Here’s Why",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/this-presale-token-will-hit-1-investors-say-heres-why/,"While the broader crypto market is caught in a storm of volatility and uncertainty, one under-the-radar project is quietly capturing the attention of smart money. Forget the meme coins and speculative hype—investors are piling into RentStac (RNS) , a presale token with a clear and inevitable path to the $1 mark. This isn’t wishful thinking. The immense confidence from early backers is built on a rock-solid foundation: a groundbreaking model that links the blockchain to the time-tested stability of the real estate market. As the project smashes through its fundraising goals, the conversation has shifted from if it will reach $1 to how much early investors will profit when it does. A New Paradigm: Real-World Assets on the Blockchain For too long, the crypto space has been a high-stakes casino. Fortunes are made and lost based on social media trends, whale manipulation, and speculative frenzy. RentStac is leading a revolution away from this chaos by offering something radically different: an asset backed by tangible, income-producing properties. The concept is simple yet powerful. RentStac acquires a portfolio of rental properties, and its (RNS) token represents a fractional share of this real estate. The rental income generated each month is then distributed directly to the token holders. This creates a “real yield” that is completely disconnected from crypto market volatility. The value of your investment is backed by property deeds and rental contracts, providing a level of security that purely digital assets can never match. It’s a game-changer for anyone looking to build sustainable wealth. The Inevitable Path to $1: A Simple Calculation The conviction that (RNS) will hit $1 is backed by the project’s explosive presale performance. Having already raised over $412,222, RentStac is demonstrating overwhelming market demand for a stable, asset-backed investment as it charges toward its first $1 million milestone. To reward its visionary community, RentStac is running a limited-time 100% token bonus. This offer doubles any investment made during the presale and is the engine behind the massive return potential. Let’s look at the numbers. The current presale price for (RNS) is just $0.025 per token. If you invest $500 today, you receive 20,000 RNS tokens. But with the 100% bonus, you get an additional 20,000 tokens for free, bringing your total to an incredible 40,000 RNS tokens. When (RNS) reaches the $1 valuation that investors and analysts project, your 40,000 tokens will be worth $40,000. Your initial $500 investment will have generated an extraordinary return. This simple math reveals the staggering upside and explains why early backers are so certain about the token’s future. What This Means for Your Portfolio The crypto market is maturing. The era of gambling on baseless hype is ending, and a new focus on real-world utility and tangible value is taking over. RentStac is not just part of this trend; it is leading it. The project offers a straightforward and powerful way to earn passive income from the stability of the real estate market, without the high costs and barriers of traditional property ownership. It’s the perfect hedge against market volatility and a foundational asset for any serious investor’s portfolio. With a groundbreaking model, immense investor confidence, and a presale bonus that doubles your stake from day one, RentStac isn’t just another token. It represents a new frontier in finance. The journey to $1 has already begun, and those who get in now are positioning themselves for the greatest rewards.

Data from Coinglass showed that more than $1.27 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out in 24 hours, with long traders accounting for nearly 90% of the losses. The slide follows Bitcoin’s break below its 200-day moving average near $109,800, a critical support zone that had held firm for four months. The Bitcoin price drop triggered widespread panic, pushing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 21, signaling “extreme fear.” Altcoins mirrored the weakness, with Ethereum (ETH) dropping 6% to $3,500, Solana (SOL) sliding 10% below $160, and XRP shedding 5.5%. Market analysts attributed the downturn to renewed uncertainty over Federal Reserve policy. Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks last week tempered expectations of a December rate cut, sending Treasury yields higher and weakening investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. ETF Outflows and Whale Selling Amplify Pressure Further fueling the downturn, Bitcoin ETFs saw significant redemptions, totaling $186.5 million on Monday, the largest single-day outflow since early 2024. According to Farside Investors, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was solely responsible for the drawdown, while other major ETFs like Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB remained neutral. The sharp ETF withdrawals coincided with an intensification of whale activity across exchanges. Data from Lookonchain revealed that long-term holders moved over 400,000 BTC, around 2% of the total supply, to trading platforms in the past 30 days. One early investor reportedly transferred 13,000 BTC ($1.4 billion) since October, while another whale deposited over 3,200 BTC to Kraken. Analysts suggest that these moves signal mounting profit-taking and a weakening of conviction among long-term holders. Despite rising self-custody activity on Binance, on-chain data from CryptoQuant indicated that dip-buying momentum remains fragile, suggesting accumulation may not yet be strong enough to reverse the trend. Bitcoin Price Support at $100K in Focus as Sentiment Turns Bearish With the Bitcoin price now hovering below key technical levels, analysts warn that a retest of the $100,000 psychological threshold is likely. Breaking this level could expose BTC to deeper losses, potentially reaching $77,000, aligning with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement zone and the April 2025 lows. Still, some strategists maintain that the long-term bull trend remains intact. “Each correction since 2023 has been followed by renewed accumulation near the 50-week moving average,” said Joel Kruger of LMAX. “The current pullback may be painful, but it’s consistent with Bitcoin’s cyclical structure.” As market fear intensifies and ETF flows remain negative, the Bitcoin price’s ability to defend the $100K level could determine whether the next phase is a temporary correction or the start of a deeper retracement.

According to an extensive fundamental analysis shared by Mr. Wall Street on X, the recent months of price stagnation and sudden drops are part of a larger accumulation phase dominated by institutional players. The overall setup, he argued, points clearly to Bitcoin’s eventual climb back above $120,000. Institutional Accumulation And Controlled Bitcoin Price Range The analyst’s first point is how Bitcoin has been trading within a 120-day range, oscillating between $107,000 and $123,000 to form what is a controlled consolidation range by institutions intended to push out weak retail investors. Mr. Wall Street noted that Bitcoin’s structure remains fundamentally bullish despite the prolonged sideways movement. Related Reading: Donald Trump Makes Nice With China, But Why Are The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Still Crashing? Each attempt to break out above $120,000 strongly or below the $107,000 support has failed, a sign that large institutions are actively controlling liquidity within this narrow band. Every crash within this period, including the one caused by the Binance sell-off and Trump’s tariff war with China, was met by strong institutional bids near the $107,000 zone, even when Bitcoin went on a flash crash to $101,000. Therefore, there is no technical or structural weakness that invalidates the bullish thesis. The imbalance to the upside, he added, is sufficient to push Bitcoin back to trading in the $120,000 and $123,000 range, which is the Value Area High. Mr. Wall Street also tied Bitcoin’s coming surge to changes within the Federal Reserve’s policies. He pointed out that despite claiming to end quantitative tightening, the Fed has quietly injected billions into the banking system through repo operations and mortgage-backed securities purchases. He highlighted a single Friday where $50.35 billion entered the system. According to him, this liquidity will ultimately find its way into risk assets, including Bitcoin, in a pattern similar to the 2019 monetary response that preceded crypto’s 2020 and 2021 bull run. Although he warned that a fabricated crash could precede the next liquidity wave, this will only strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term position for another move to $120,000 and possibly higher. Gold And Bitcoin In The Battle For The Real Store Of Value Mr. Wall Street also called attention to the psychological side of the current cycle, which has been highlighted by some investors gravitating towards gold. He argued that retail investors are being pushed to gold through manipulated narratives of stagflation and economic fear, while institutions quietly buy Bitcoin. “What’s ironic is that the same logic that drives people to buy gold should be making them buy Bitcoin instead,” he said. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals What Traders Are Missing After The Bitcoin Price Spike To $116,000 The ongoing gold hype is to distract the public while institutions accumulate Bitcoin at discount levels. Once retail participants exit the crypto market entirely, then there is going to be a move upward that redefines Bitcoin’s price level. As he concluded, the boring sideways phase is nearing its end, and the next aggressive move, one that could carry Bitcoin back above $120,000, is only a matter of time. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,200.

The announcement was made on Monday, as Ripple USD (RLUSD), the network’s native stablecoin, hit the $1 billion milestone in market cap. Ripple Prime breaks ground in the US today with the launch of digital asset spot prime brokerage capabilities – allowing clients to execute OTC spot transactions across the most prominent digital assets and stablecoins, including $XRP and $RLUSD . https://t.co/zTYb4MrPX4 — Ripple (@Ripple) November 3, 2025 Ripple Prime is the result of a prior acquisition of Hidden Road. The two companies have combined their licenses to offer OTC trading to U.S. institutional customers, facilitating the trading of crypto assets. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Needs to Stay Above This Level to Start Recovering XRP has gone down by 5% in the past 24 hours, and currently sits at $2.27. Trading volumes have exploded by nearly 100% to almost $8 billion, accounting for 6% of the token’s circulating supply. The token is now approaching what could be considered its last line of defense before a bigger decline. At $2.20, the market will decide if the latest developments are bad enough to kickstart a bear market, or buyers may step in to scoop up the token with the expectation that these ecosystem growth initiatives will lift it by year’s end. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory in the 4-hour chart, increasing the odds of a bounce off this level. If that happens, we could see XRP hitting $3 soon , meaning a 36% upside potential in the near term. As momentum begins to return, early crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could see the biggest gains. With over $25 million already raised, the project is building a faster, cheaper version of Bitcoin that supports smart contracts, trading apps, and new use cases that the original network was never built for. Bitcoin Hyper Brings Speed and Simplicity to BTC – Early Buyers Could See Big Gains Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings Solana’s speed and low fees to Bitcoin, unlocking fast and affordable crypto features for BTC holders. Bitcoin Hyper is building a faster, smarter version of Bitcoin that fixes some of its biggest problems – like slow transactions and the lack of apps. Using the Hyper Bridge, anyone can send their BTC to a secure wallet and instantly get the same amount on the Bitcoin Hyper network. Once you’re in, you can do things that regular Bitcoin doesn’t allow – like earning rewards, staking, lending, and using apps for trading, payments, and even meme coins. Crypto analysts say that as more exchanges and big investors adopt the network, demand for $HYPER could surge – giving early buyers a major advantage. To buy $HYPER before its next price increase, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper official website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can swap USDT or SOL to complete the transaction or use a bank card instead. Buy $HYPER Here.

These three altcoins have witnessed drops of at least 5% in the past 24 hours, extending a period of on-and-off negativity that began in late July. Yet they are now all so far in the red that a big rebound could be on its way, while one new token in particular looks ready to rally once it launches in the next few weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETF Arrival Could Push Altcoin Above $4 in December XRP has dropped to $2.27 today, marking a 5.5% loss in 24 hours and a 25% decline in a month. The altcoin has struggled in recent weeks, along with the wider market, yet it remains up by 350% in a year, making it the best-performing top-ten coin within this timeframe. This puts it in a commanding position to continue rising once the market regains some optimism, particularly when upwards of ten XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the next few weeks . The launch of these funds will drive institutional money towards XRP, boosting its price in much the same way ETFs boosted Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now may therefore be a great time to buy XRP, seeing as how its chart shows the coin in such an oversold position. Source: TradingView As we can see from the chart above, XRP’s indicators have been languishing in weakened positions for three months now, give or take. Its relative strength index (yellow) has plunged in the past day, falling back towards the 30 level. It could therefore bottom out soon, with XRP likely to rebound in price, potentially returning to $3 by the end of the month. And if we do see a wave of XRP ETF launches soon, it could top $4 by the end of 2025. Crypto Price Prediction: Official Trump ($TRUMP) – Meme Coin Showing Renewed Momentum After Tough Summer At $7.24, TRUMP is down by 5% in 24 hours, although it does hold on to a 6% gain in a week and a 23% increase in a fortnight. On the other hand, investors should bear in mind that it has suffered a 90% drop since reaching an ATH of $73.43 on January 19. We can interpret this fact in one of two ways, with the first being that such a huge drop is a sign of a coin in terminal decline. However, a more positive interpretation is that this gives TRUMP big potential to make a disproportionate comeback once the market becomes more bullish. Its chart today also shows that it has regained momentum in recent days, following a difficult summer. Source: TradingView Its RSI remains above 50 after the short-lived breakout rally it enjoyed at the end of October, while its MACD (orange, blue) has also turned positive in the past couple of days. As such, TRUMP may be close to another rally, which could see it push towards $10 in the next couple of weeks. From there, an ETF-inspired market-wide rally could see it climb to $20 or $30 by the end of December. Crypto Price Prediction: BNB Coin ($BNB) – Exchange Token Ready to Set New ATHs in Weeks BNB has also fallen by just over 5% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $957 representing a 15% drop in a week and a 17% decline in a month. Otherwise, BNB is in good shape, having posted a decent 71% gain in the past year. It has also recently set a record high of $1,369, a price which it attained only 22 days ago. Put differently, it retains some bullish medium- and long-term momentum, so we would expect BNB to return to growth once market sentiment picks up. This could happen as soon as the first wave of altcoin ETF approvals and launches takes place, which may be only a matter of weeks. If so, BNB would leap from its currently undervalued position, with its chart today suggesting that it may be close to a bottom. Source: TradingView Its RSI and its MACD have both fallen to decidedly negative positions, and don’t have too much space to fall lower. Because of this, we could see BNB return to $1,000 in the next day or two, while it could reach $1,300 again by December. And given Binance’s dominant position as the biggest exchange in the market, the coin could set new records before 2026 arrives. Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENODE Raises $2 Million as Presale Snowballs: Could It 100x in 2026? The three coins above all have the potential to make some very strong gains in the next couple of months, but they won’t be the only alts to do well in the near future. Traders may also want to investigate newer coins, including presale tokens, since these can often outpace the market as they list for the first time and enter price discovery. One of the most promising presale tokens right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based token that’s about to launch a mine-to-earn platform. PEPENODE is heating up 2M Raised! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/jd6PLovBJX — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 31, 2025 It has raised more than $2 million in its sale, which will end in the next few weeks. This is an encouraging sign of its growing popularity and of how successful it could be once it launches. And what’s exciting about PEPENODE is that it’s about to launch crypto’s first mine-to-earn platform. What this means is that it will give users the chance to grow and run their own virtual mining rigs, which they can use to earn rewards in other coins. By spending PEPENODE to buy more virtual nodes, users can increase the rewards they earn. This provides a strong incentive to acquire more PEPENODE, something which should boost demand over time. Also boosting demand is the fact that holders can stake PEPENODE for a regular staking income, with the current APY above 600%. This all makes PEPENODE one of the more bullish new tokens arriving on the market right now. Investors can buy it early by going to the PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. The coin is currently selling at $0.0011317, although this price will continue to rise for the duration of the sale.

Fink’s remarks, made during the Future Investment Initiative (FII) event in Riyadh, focused on how tokenization could transform the movement of money and assets worldwide, a development that many XRP supporters see as aligned with Ripple’s long-term vision. During his address, Fink stated that central banks around the world are now exploring how quickly they can digitize their currencies. He explained that this shift raises important questions about the future of the U.S. dollar, as well as the relevance of established payment companies such as Visa and Mastercard in a fully digital economy. Larry Fink Calls Tokenization the Next Major Financial Evolution Fink emphasized that while artificial intelligence dominates most conversations about financial innovation, the tokenization of assets and currencies represents an equally powerful trend. He described tokenization as a technological advancement that could streamline global finance by improving how transactions are processed and settled. According to him, many governments and institutions still underestimate the scale of this transformation. Larry Fink just confirmed what we’ve been saying for years, every central bank currency will be digitized, every ETF and asset will be tokenized, and they’ll all need a cross-border settlement layer. The plumbing of global finance is being rebuilt, and #XRP is the foundation. pic.twitter.com/hu0yArQeX7 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 29, 2025 His comments quickly gained attention within the XRP community, where advocates have long maintained that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is well-positioned to support the tokenization era. Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist and a well-known XRP proponent, responded to Fink’s remarks by suggesting that they validate the long-standing view that XRP could underpin a new, tokenized financial infrastructure. Aljarrah asserted that in a future where central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other assets exist on tokenized platforms, a unified settlement network will be necessary. He argued that XRP’s design allows it to serve as the global bridge asset connecting diverse financial systems. Ripple’s Growing Focus on Tokenization Ripple’s own executives have echoed similar sentiments in recent years. In 2023, David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, confirmed that the XRPL’s development strategy would increasingly focus on tokenization capabilities. Bitwise, a major digital asset management firm, also named XRP as one of the tokens offering the most direct exposure to the anticipated growth of the tokenization sector. These developments have helped position XRP at the center of the broader discussion about how blockchain technology might power the future of financial markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How High Could XRP Go If Tokenization Becomes Mainstream? To estimate what this global shift could mean for XRP’s valuation, a hypothetical scenario generated by Google’s Gemini AI offered an optimistic outlook. According to Gemini, the market for tokenized assets could expand to between $10 trillion and $26 trillion by 2030. Using a middle estimate of $15 trillion, Gemini projected that if the XRPL captured even 1–5% of that total market, XRP’s market capitalization could range from $6 trillion to $30 trillion. With roughly 60 billion XRP currently in circulation, this projection would place XRP’s price between $100 and $500 per token, assuming consistent adoption and supply conditions. However, Gemini emphasized that such an outcome would depend on several key factors, including regulatory clarity for digital assets, widespread institutional use of XRP for settlement, and Ripple’s ability to maintain a technological edge over competitors like Ethereum and Solana. It also noted that XRP’s deflationary token burn mechanism could gradually decrease supply over time, potentially reinforcing upward price momentum if demand increases. Although these estimates remain speculative, the renewed discussion following Larry Fink’s comments underscores a growing belief that tokenization could reshape global finance and that XRP might play a meaningful role in that transformation.

This move aims to attract more clients away from Google’s Chromebooks and Microsoft’s basic Windows PCs. The tech giant’s decision has sparked debates in the industry. Sources familiar with the situation suggest that this new device will be particularly useful for individuals who primarily work on documents, browse the internet, or edit light media. Additionally, they mentioned that the device specifically targets casual users, students, and businesses. Meanwhile, apart from an affordable Mac, Apple is also considering potential iPad buyers who may prefer a more traditional laptop experience, the sources said, maintaining anonymity. Apple aims to solidify its position as the leader in the tech industry Apple’s unreleased, low-cost budget Mac , known by the code name J700, is currently being tested and is in the early stages of production with suppliers outside the US, according to sources close to the matter. According to them, the Cupertino-based tech firm intends to launch the new device probably in the first half of next year. When reporters contacted a representative from the tech giant for comment on the situation, the spokesperson declined to respond. This news marks a significant shift in Apple’s operations, as the company has been renowned for producing cutting-edge devices that generate substantial profits. Interestingly, the tech company has vowed not to pursue market share by offering cheaper products. Regarding creating a budget-friendly Mac, the sources acknowledged that Chromebooks increasingly threaten Apple. This affordable laptop operates on Google’s Chrome OS, a lightweight, cloud-based operating system. In the meantime, Apple noted another opportunity to solidify its position as a leader in the tech ecosystem. This was after reports revealed that some individuals were unhappy with Microsoft Corp.’s change to Windows 11, which left them without security updates for the older software version. With this issue raised, the tech giant aims to appeal to Windows users. Following the release of this information, Apple’s stock reportedly rose slightly by less than 1%, reaching an all-time high of $270.25. Considering the advantages surrounding its recent decision, the tech company plans to price its new laptop below $1,000 by utilizing simpler components. This new device will feature a more basic LCD and an iPhone processor. Moreover, it will have the smallest screen of any current Mac model, measuring just below the 13.6-inch display found in the MacBook Air. This marks the first scenario in which the tech giant uses an iPhone processor in a Mac, rather than a chip specifically designed for computers. Still, internal tests indicate that this smartphone chip may outperform the M1 chip, which was designed just a few years ago. It is worth noting that Apple initially used iPhone chips in its iPads, but later transitioned those devices to its M-series processors for higher-end models. Apple to expand its footprint in schools with the creation of a budget-friendly Mac Analysts researched and discovered that Apple had already tested the market before news of creating a budget-friendly Mac leaked. This was after it provided a discounted M1 MacBook Air for less than $700 via Walmart and other stores. However, the analysts still insist that the new model will feature an entirely new design, rather than an older version, at a lower price. On the other hand, sources have mentioned that Apple’s most affordable Mac in the current market is the M4 MacBook Air. The device is priced at $999 but can go down to $899 with educational discounts. Chromebooks are available for a few hundred dollars, while high-end models cost about $600. The sources also noted that many students prefer using Apple’s basic iPad with the Magic Keyboard Folio, which is priced at about $600. The upcoming Mac would be priced similarly but include advanced features such as the added benefits of macOS software, a built-in keyboard, and better battery life. Therefore, the tech giant could attract both students and regular consumers, the sources said.

The company brought in just $5.02 billion in revenue, falling far below the $6 billion analysts predicted, according to the earnings report released after the bell. Adjusted earnings landed at 35 cents per share, also missing the expected 40 cents. But oh that wasn’t the only red flag. Revenue fell 15% compared to the same period last year, when the company reported $5.94 billion. The warning signs were there two weeks ago when Super Micro gave an early peek and slashed its revenue guidance to $5 billion, down from the earlier $6 billion to $7 billion range. The company said some expected revenue had been delayed to the next quarter due to “design win upgrades.” Super Micro’s net income got hammered too, dropping to $168.3 million, or 26 cents a share, compared to $424.3 million, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Even for a company tied to the AI server boom, these numbers showed a sharp slowdown. Super Micro says better Q2 is coming despite AI slowdown concerns In the middle of the earnings call, Super Micro tried to calm investors by raising guidance for the current quarter. The company now expects revenue between $10 billion and $11 billion, which is well above the $7.83 billion analyst consensus from LSEG. The delayed server builds are expected to ship this quarter, which may explain the bullish outlook. Even with the company’s tight grip on the AI server market, there are signs of pressure. Some analysts say Dell has started to pull ahead in market share. Though Super Micro has benefited from high demand for servers packed with Nvidia GPUs, growth has clearly slowed. Before this earnings report, the stock had jumped 55% this year. That gain now looks shaky. For the full fiscal year that ended June 30, Super Micro reported $22.0 billion in revenue, up from $15.0 billion in the previous fiscal year. But profit dropped, as net income came in at $1.0 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, down from $1.2 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share, the year before. Profit margins shrink as company outlines fiscal 2026 expectations The company’s non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal 2025 was 11.2%, after adjusting for $25 million in stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP net income totaled $1.3 billion, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $2.12 the previous year. The adjustments included a $239 million loss tied to extinguishing convertible notes and related tax effects of $75 million. There was also a $23 million write-off and $8 million in tax impacts. As of the end of June, Super Micro reported $5.2 billion in cash and equivalents, and $4.8 billion in total bank debt and convertible notes. Rounding up the earnings press release, Super Micro said it expects net sales between $6.0 billion and $7.0 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, ending September 30, 2025. It also guided GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to $0.42, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.52, “assuming tax rates of 13.0% and 15.5%, and share counts of 631 million and 644 million, respectively,” said the earnings report. Included in the GAAP forecast is a $69 million in stock-based compensation, with $20 million in excluded tax effects under the non-GAAP metric. And for the full fiscal year 2026, Super Micro is projecting at least $33.0 billion in revenue.

According to people familiar with the matter, the letter was reportedly sent on Friday, with Amazon accusing Perplexity of violating its terms of service by allowing its browser agent, Comet, to buy items on Amazon without disclosing that it was acting on behalf of a user. Perplexity , valued at around $20 billion, denied wrongdoing, saying the move was a “bullying tactic” by Amazon to suppress competition in the fast-evolving market for AI-powered browsing and shopping tools. Amazon accuses perplexity of breaking its conditions Perplexity’s Comet browser, launched in July this year, can research and, like in this case, purchase products on behalf of users, among a host of other things. Amazon’s complaint , however, claims that Perplexity’s agent failed to properly identify itself and in some cases logged directly into users’ Amazon accounts as if it were a standard Chrome browser. The company said this “degraded the customer experience” by bypassing personalization systems and introducing inaccuracies in delivery estimates and pricing. Amazon’s conditions for its online store make it clear that no one is allowed to use bots or automated tools to scrape data or make purchases. “We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers should operate openly and respect service provider decisions,” Amazon’s spokesperson Lara Hendrickson wrote in a statement, adding that Amazon has been sending requests to Perplexity to “remove Amazon from the Comet experience, particularly in light of the degraded shopping and customer service experience it provides.” Perplexity’s response In a draft blog post responding to the letter, Perplexity accused Amazon of trying to “eliminate user rights” in order to boost advertising revenue, while maintaining that its Comet browser neither trains on nor scrapes data from Amazon’s site. Perplexity’s chief executive officer, Aravind Srinivas, rejected Amazon’s characterization and stated that agents should have all the same rights and responsibilities as a human user. He added that “it’s not Amazon’s job to survey who is shopping on behalf of whom.” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy appeared to acknowledge the challenge during an earnings call last week, noting that most AI shopping agents currently deliver “not good” customer experiences due to limited personalization and inconsistent fulfillment data. Still, he hinted that partnerships with third-party developers could emerge in the future. “I do think we will find ways to collaborate,” Jassy said. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is also an investor in Perplexity AI. Competition and control in the AI era Amazon’s objections come as it develops its own set of AI-driven shopping tools . Earlier this year, it introduced “Buy For Me,” which lets users purchase items from brand websites within its app, and “Rufus,” an AI assistant capable of recommending and adding products to a cart. It recently launched another AI feature known as “Help Me Decide,” and this feature helps hesitant buyers make a buying decision faster. Some observers see the company’s action against Perplexity as a defensive move to protect its ecosystem and its advertising business, which earns billions of dollars annually by selling sponsored product placements in search results.

That was enough to push the stock lower in extended trading. The company said adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.20, beating the $1.16 consensus. Revenue reached $9.25 billion, ahead of the $8.74 billion estimate. Revenue rose 36% compared to the same quarter last year. The quarter ended on September 27. Net income was $1.24 billion, or 75 cents per share, up from $771 million, or 47 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. For the fourth quarter, AMD guided to about $9.6 billion in revenue, which implies 25% growth year over year.Analysts were expecting around $9.15 billion. The company said it expects an adjusted gross margin of 54.5%, which matched StreetAccount’s forecast.AMD repeated that the guidance does not include any revenue from shipments of its Instinct MI308 chips to China. Executives said during the release, “We are not including revenue from China‑bound MI308 shipments in the outlook at this time,” repeating the same stance from last quarter. AMD shares had climbed 107% year‑to‑date ahead of these results, while the Nasdaq had risen 21% over the same period. AMD outlines major AI infrastructure partnerships AMD reached a strategic agreement with OpenAI last month. The arrangement could lead to OpenAI holding as much as 10% of AMD.As part of the deal, OpenAI plans to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs across multiple chip generations. The first 1‑gigawatt portion is expected to roll out in the second half of next year. For years, OpenAI and many other AI developers primarily used Nvidia GPUs to train and run large models. The shift signals growing supply and ecosystem diversification. Oracle said in October it plans to deploy 50,000 AMD Instinct MI450 chips in its cloud next year. AMD also introduced its new “Helios” rack‑scale design and said it supports the Open Rack Wide standard introduced by Meta at the Open Compute Project Global Summit. Cisco and AMD expanded their collaboration with G42 to build a large‑scale cluster in the UAE using AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs.IBM and AMD announced a multi‑year effort to support Zyphra with clusters running AMD Instinct MI350X GPUs for multimodal models. Cohere is increasing its use of AMD Instinct GPU infrastructure across its enterprise lineup.Vultr said AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs are now available across its cloud network. DigitalOcean expanded cloud offerings to include AMD Instinct MI325X now and MI350X later this year. Tech Mahindra will bring AMD Instinct GPUs and AMD EPYC CPUs into its Cloud BlazeTech platform. The U.S. Department of Energy announced two upcoming supercomputers based on AMD hardware. The Lux AI system will use AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs, AMD EPYC CPUs, and AMD Pensando networking. The Discovery system, expected in 2028, will run on next‑gen AMD EPYC “Venice” CPUs and AMD Instinct MI430X GPUs, part of AMD’s new MI400 Series. Data center, client, and gaming segments show broad growth AMD’s data center business generated $4.34 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 22%. Analysts were expecting $4.13 billion. Client revenue came in at $2.75 billion, up 46%, beating the $2.61 billion consensus. Gaming revenue totaled $1.30 billion, up 181%, above the $1.05 billion estimate. Amazon, a meaningful cloud customer, disclosed in a filing that it sold all 822,234 of its AMD shares as of September 30. The position was originally built in the first quarter. AMD released ROCm 7 software to improve training and inference performance. The company also completed the divestiture of its ZT Systems data center manufacturing business to Sanmina. AMD partners expanded cloud services powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors. AWS said its new Amazon EC2 M8a instances deliver up to 30% better performance than the prior generation. Oracle introduced new X11 platforms powered by the same processors. IBM and AMD also announced plans to combine quantum computing with high‑performance compute in future architectures. AMD updated its PC and gaming lines with Ryzen Threadripper 9000WX, Threadripper PRO 9000X, and FSR 4. FSR 4 support doubled to more than 85 games. The company expanded its embedded line with AMD EPYC Embedded 4005 and Ryzen Embedded 9000 processors for industrial and edge computing.

Over the past 30 days, Cardano has dropped 37%, but the recent spike in 24-hour trading volume to $1.6 billion suggests buyers are stepping in fast. On-chain data from CoinGlass reveals that exchange netflows have remained mostly negative since October, meaning large investors are pulling tokens into cold storage instead of selling. This behavior often signals long-term conviction, as whales tend to load up quietly before major moves. With ADA now hovering at key support, the token could enter a consolidation phase before mounting a fresh rally – especially if institutional interest continues to climb. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Hits Former Trend Line Resistance from Above Cardano has tapped a key trend line resistance, and all eyes are now on whether buyers will step up to flip this zone into support. A decisive bounce here could mark the beginning of ADA’s next rally. However, the token is still trading below its 200-day exponential moving average – a level it must reclaim to confirm a bullish shift in momentum. The $0.53 zone is the key support to watch. Holding above it could spark a short-term breakout, especially as traders look to reenter positions after last week’s brutal sell-off. With billions wiped from the market, even a modest ADA recovery could spark a fresh wave of FOMO. For investors who hold through volatility, Best Wallet offers a smarter way to stay ahead – combining secure storage, low-fee swaps, and early access to emerging tokens, all in one seamless, mobile-first platform. As presales gain momentum, tools like this are becoming essential for spotting the next breakout before it goes mainstream. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Powers a New Level of User Experience Now in early presale, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is reshaping what a wallet can be – bringing together powerful trading tools, frictionless payments, and first access to top-tier presales inside a clean, user-friendly ecosystem. The wallet already supports over 60 blockchains, features low fees, and includes an integrated DEX that connects to 200+ decentralized exchanges. Now, with the launch of its native token $BEST, users will gain access to even more perks — from reduced transaction costs to exclusive presale access before listings go public. $BEST holders can also take part in staking for rewards and be the first to try out new product releases like the upcoming Best Card, which will let users spend crypto directly at stores, ATMs, and online. As the wallet’s popularity increases, the demand for $BEST will rise as well, especially as it gets users discounts on fees. To buy $BEST, simply visit the official Best Wallet Token website and link up your wallet (download the Best Wallet app here). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead.

Die Regierung präsentiert den Schritt als Signal für mehr Innovationsfreiheit und ein Ende der als feindlich wahrgenommenen Kryptopolitik der Biden-Ära. Gleichzeitig verschärft ein historischer Regierungs-Shutdown die wirtschaftliche Unsicherheit in den USA. Ein politischer Donnerschlag erschüttert Washington und die globale Finanzwelt zugleich. Mit der überraschenden Begnadigung von Binance-Gründer Changpeng “CZ” Zhao setzt US-Präsident Donald Trump ein deutliches Zeichen für seine neue Kryptostrategie. Während Befürworter von einem Neuanfang in der digitalen Wirtschaft sprechen, warnen Kritiker vor einem gefährlichen Präzedenzfall . Gleichzeitig steckt das Land im längsten Regierungs Shutdown der US-Geschichte, der Märkte und Bürger verunsichert. Was bedeutet dieser Schritt für die globale Kryptolandschaft und die wirtschaftliche Zukunft der USA? Ein Blick auf die Hintergründe und politischen Dynamiken. Trump setzt auf Krypto und Innovation Die Entscheidung, den Binance-Gründer Changpeng Zhao zu begnadigen, sorgt weltweit für Schlagzeilen. Trump bezeichnet den Schritt als Beginn einer neuen Ära, in der Innovation statt Sanktionen im Vordergrund stehen soll. Laut seiner Regierung markiert die Begnadigung den Bruch mit einer Politik, die digitale Technologien ausbremste und Talente ins Ausland drängte. Beobachter sehen darin ein klares politisches Signal: Die USA sollen wieder führend im Kryptosektor werden und ein attraktiver Standort für Blockchain-Unternehmen sein. Gleichzeitig steht die Entscheidung im Kontrast zu Trumps vorherigen Aussagen. Noch vor wenigen Tagen behauptete er, Zhao gar nicht zu kennen. Nun löscht die Begnadigung sämtliche strafrechtlichen Konsequenzen im Zusammenhang mit AML-Verstößen bei Binance. Kritiker fragen sich daher, ob politische Motive oder wirtschaftliche Interessen im Vordergrund standen. Befürworter hingegen feiern die Rückkehr einer unternehmerfreundlichen Finanzpolitik. Weiße Haus spricht von Ende des “Kryptokrieges” Pressesprecherin Karoline Leavitt betonte in Washington die Ambitionen der Regierung. Sie sprach von einem “Ende des Biden-Krieges gegen Krypto” und hob das Recht des Präsidenten hervor, Unternehmer zu schützen und Innovation zu fördern. Aus Sicht des Weißen Hauses ist der Pardon ein wirtschaftspolitisches Signal an Investoren, Technologen und Finanzmärkte weltweit. Die USA sollen wieder als Heimat für digitale Finanzsysteme gelten, nicht als Feind. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Gleichzeitig kritisieren Analysten den Tonfall, da er eine klare politische Frontbildung erkennen lässt. Während Trump Wachstum und Freiheit betone, verweisen Juristen auf die Bedeutung konsequenter Aufsicht im Finanzsektor. Die Begnadigung könnte damit zu einem Schlachtfeld zwischen Innovationsfreiheit und Regulierungssicherheit werden – zwei Themen, die global zunehmend im Fokus stehen. CZ bleibt umstrittene Figur der Finanzwelt Changpeng Zhao ist einer der bekanntesten Unternehmer der Kryptobranche. Sein Einfluss auf die globale digitale Finanzwelt ist enorm, doch die Vergangenheit bleibt kontrovers. Seine Verurteilung wegen Compliance-Fehlern und die anschließende viermonatige Haft hatten klare Signale gesetzt. Nun könnte die Begnadigung als Einladung für aggressive Expansion und risikofreudige Finanzmodelle verstanden werden. I’m still shocked that stories like this which come out daily still get largely ignored. The most corrupt person to ever hold any public office in US history. I will keep posting them every day and try to amplify them, even when most media doesn’t care. https://t.co/R9YUs3C4H4 pic.twitter.com/NwVpoyp9bC — Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) October 30, 2025 Auch Zhao selbst polarisiert weiterhin. Viele bewundern ihn als Visionär, der Kryptowährungen massentauglich machte. Andere sehen in ihm ein Symbol für unzureichende Aufsicht und Systemrisiken. Die Trump-Entscheidung verstärkt diese Spannungen und könnte in Zukunft neue Debatten über Verantwortung und Innovation auslösen. Shutdown bringt Märkte ins Wanken Parallel zur Begnadigung erschüttert ein historischer Regierungs-Shutdown die USA. Seit mehr als fünf Wochen stehen Bundesbehörden still, weil sich Regierung und Demokraten nicht auf ein Budget einigen. Der Stillstand lähmt öffentliche Dienste, schwächt Verbrauchervertrauen und belastet Unternehmen. Finanzmärkte reagieren nervös, da politische Unsicherheit oft zu Kapitalflucht führt. Beim US-Shutdown stehen Millionen Amerikaner vor leeren Tellern. Das wichtigste Lebensmittelhilfeprogramm wird ab dem 1. November nicht mehr finanziert. Während dessen ist Trump mit Badumbauten beschäftigt. https://t.co/D6CixtpDDz pic.twitter.com/LUEgwufk8A — Volkat (@DortmundaBerlin) November 1, 2025 Analysten berichten zudem von verstärkter Volatilität bei Aktien und Kryptowährungen. Die Kombination aus politischem Stillstand und starkem Eingriff in die Kryptopolitik schafft ein komplexes, kaum kalkulierbares Umfeld. Für viele Beobachter offenbart diese Situation die strukturellen Spannungen zwischen Regierung, Finanzsystem und technologischem Wandel. Trump-Lager gibt Demokraten die Schuld Trumps Berater nutzen die Situation, um klar Position zu beziehen. Sie werfen den Demokraten vor, wirtschaftliche Innovation zu blockieren und politische Machtspiele über das Wohl der Bürger zu stellen. Die Begnadigung Zhaos und die geplante Kryptostrategie seien Belege einer pro-wirtschaftlichen Agenda, so die Sicht des Weißen Hauses. Das Narrativ: Republikaner fördern Wachstum, Demokraten verhindern Fortschritt. Doch auch diese Darstellung ist umstritten. Kritiker argumentieren, dass Polarisierung und symbolische Politik zu Instabilität führen. Ökonomen warnen zudem vor langfristigen Schäden durch politische Blockaden. Während das Weiße Haus auf Dynamik und Zukunft setzt, fordern Marktbeobachter klare Regeln und verlässliche Prozesse. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Wie es für die USA weitergeht Die kommenden Wochen werden entscheidend sein. Die wirtschaftliche Lage bleibt angespannt, und die internationale Finanzwelt beobachtet jeden Schritt genau. Ob die Begnadigung ein mutiger Zukunftsschritt oder ein riskanter Präzedenzfall ist, zeigt sich erst langfristig. Fest steht: Die USA senden gemischte Signale, die Unsicherheit schaffen, aber auch Chancen bieten könnten. Die Diskussion um Kryptowährungen, staatliche Kontrolle und technologische Freiheit wird weiter an Fahrt gewinnen. Gleichzeitig bleibt die Lösung des Shutdowns dringend, um Vertrauen zurückzugewinnen. Für Anleger, Technologieunternehmen und Bürger beginnt eine Phase, die sowohl enorme Möglichkeiten als auch erhebliche Risiken birgt. Bitcoin Hyper: Aufgebaut auf einem zunehmend krypto-freundlichen Amerika Die politische Stimmung in den USA wird immer krypto-freundlicher. Gesetzgeber, große Unternehmen und Finanzinstitutionen erkennen zunehmend das Potenzial digitaler Assets – allen voran Bitcoin. Diese wachsende Unterstützung sorgt dafür, dass Bitcoin immer stärker institutionalisiert wird und seinen Platz im globalen Finanzsystem festigt. Genau hier setzt Bitcoin Hyper an: Es baut direkt auf der Sicherheit des Bitcoin-Netzwerks auf und erweitert es um die Geschwindigkeit und Programmierbarkeit der Solana-Technologie. Während die USA den Weg für eine breite Bitcoin-Adoption ebnen, schafft Bitcoin Hyper die technische Grundlage, damit Bitcoin nicht nur gehalten, sondern aktiv genutzt werden kann. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Mit Bitcoin wachsen in einer neuen Ära $HYPER ist der Utility-Token, der dieses Layer-2-Ökosystem antreibt. Je stärker Bitcoin durch politische Unterstützung und institutionelles Kapital in den USA wächst, desto größer wird der Bedarf an skalierbaren Lösungen, die BTC im Alltag brauchbar machen. Bitcoin bleibt die Basis – Bitcoin Hyper liefert die Funktionalität. In einer Zukunft, in der Bitcoin immer stärker verankert wird, kann $HYPER als technischer Erweiterungsbaustein direkt von dieser Entwicklung profitieren.

The disagreement follows a letter last month from the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) urging the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to reject Coinbase’s application because it could destabilize traditional banking. In a le tter to the OCC, the ICBA states that it “strongly opposes” Coinbase’s bid to establish Coinbase National Trust Company, as it considers the crypto exchange’s model to be “untested and risky.” The group stated that the company may face challenges in crypto market downturns and lacks the same protections and oversight as traditional banks. Coinbase said the OCC, which regulates national banks and trust companies, will determine whether it may operate under a federal charter. This change would put the digital currency exchange under direct federal oversight and expand its business by allowing it to offer custodial services, as well as trading, clearing, and settlement services. Coinbase fires back: “Banks fear competition, not risk” Coinbase’s CLO publicly criticized the ICBA position in a post on X. “Imagine opposing a regulated trust charter because you prefer crypto to remain unregulated,” he wrote. “That’s the ICBA’s position — another example of bank lobbyists digging regulatory moats to insulate themselves,” he said. Grewal’s words illustrate Coinbase’s increasing impatience with what it deems unfair resistance from traditional finance. The firm says it has no intention of becoming a full-service bank, but would prefer to operate within a single federal framework to enforce better, protect, and disclose its consumer practices. The national trust charter would ease the company’s administrative and regulatory burden across states, enabling it to bring more products to more customers. The company states that passing its proposed charter would enhance oversight of the firm’s activities by bringing it under OCC surveillance, a goal banks have long lobbied for in relation to crypto firms. Within Coinbase, this development is viewed as a milestone toward its mission of bridging the legacy financial world with the complex crypto economy. The executives note that subjecting crypto institutions to the same level of oversight as banks currently receive will foster confidence, attract institutional investors, and reduce systemic risk. Banks fight to keep control of the financial system At the center of the clash is a question that could determine the future evolution of global banking: Should crypto firms be allowed to operate under essentially the same federal framework as traditional banks, or should they remain separate and closely regulated? The banking industry holds a near monopoly on the infrastructure that enables cash to circulate, deposits to be secured, and trust in the financial system. The rise of cryptocurrency and businesses like Coinbase, which provide services such as custody, trading, and settlement, is posing a threat to some of that stranglehold. If Coinbase were awarded a federal trust charter, the company would have automatic access to the state, local, and tribal regulatory structure that banks use to conduct business across all 50 states. Less friction, quicker innovation, and perhaps even a new model for financial inclusion that bypasses intermediaries as we’ve traditionally known them. However, old-school banks believe that this would establish a risky precedent. Digital-asset companies have yet to demonstrate that they can handle risks such as money laundering, cybersecurity attacks, and market fluctuations under real-world banking conditions, they say. Adding a similar federal designation for such companies could create fissures in the system that allow companies that don’t take deposits or maintain reserves to benefit from the same kind of national footprint and credibility as banks. They have fear that transcends compliance. Crypto companies like Coinbase can already serve millions, if not tens of millions, of customers with relatively little physical infrastructure, relying solely on technology and automation, as opposed to branches or complex legacy systems. This efficiency may pose a threat to the typical business models of banks.

The initiative, which runs until November 13 at 04:00 (UTC), is designed to encourage increased activity on the platform through a mix of trading, staking, and referral-based participation. Overview of the Campaign The event, titled “Your Chance to 420,000 XRP”, gives both new and existing users multiple ways to earn XRP rewards. Participants can qualify by engaging in three key activities: trading and depositing XRP, staking their holdings, or joining Bitrue’s new XRP launchpool to multiply returns. To be eligible for rewards, users are required to complete Bitrue’s Level 1 Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification. The platform also clarified that any withdrawals during the campaign period could impact eligibility. All rewards from the event will be distributed within two weeks after the campaign concludes. Deposit and Trading Event The first component of the campaign centers on deposits and trading. Bitrue is offering incentives to users who deposit and trade at least 100 XRP on its spot market. A dedicated 250,000 XRP prize pool has been allocated for this event. Additionally, Bitrue will provide a 20% welcome bonus to the first 500 new users who meet the trading and deposit requirements. The exchange defines “new users” as individuals who registered on Bitrue after January 1, 2025, and have not made any previous deposits. Users can further increase their earnings by inviting others to join the platform, with referral bonuses of up to 50 XRP for each qualified trader introduced to Bitrue. Staking Opportunities The second part of the promotion focuses on staking rewards, offering users flexible and fixed-term options depending on their registration status. New users can access a seven-day flexible staking plan with an impressive 80% annual percentage yield (APY) and guaranteed returns. Existing users can participate in a 15-day fixed-term staking option that offers 3% APY. These staking programs are designed to encourage long-term participation while providing steady incentives to holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Launchpool for Multiplying Rewards In the campaign’s third stage, Bitrue introduces a new XRP launchpool, which officially goes live on November 4. Both new and existing users can participate and earn up to 50% APY through this feature. The launchpool allows participants to increase their XRP holdings without active trading, providing another route to accumulate rewards during the campaign period. Bitrue has consistently positioned itself as one of the most XRP-friendly exchanges in the digital asset industry. Since listing the token in 2018, the platform has steadily expanded its XRP-related offerings , introducing over 90 trading pairs by March 2024. In addition to regular trading services, Bitrue has previously hosted several XRP-specific promotions, including a $50,000 XRP giveaway in March 2024. The latest 420,000 XRP campaign reinforces Bitrue’s ongoing confidence in XRP’s role within the broader crypto ecosystem and highlights the exchange’s commitment to fostering engagement within the community. Through this event, Bitrue not only rewards active users but also continues to strengthen its connection to the XRP ecosystem, a relationship that has remained consistent through fluctuating market conditions.

With sellers pushing toward the $102,000 zone, BTC is now at a moment that may mark the final washout before a major rebound. The coming days could be decisive in determining whether Bitcoin finds its footing or continues its decline. Bitcoin Faces Pressure Below $108,000 As Bears Regain Control Crypto analyst Crypto Candy shared insights into Bitcoin’s latest price action, noting that the flagship cryptocurrency tried to hold the $107,000–$108,000 support zone but ultimately failed to do so, closing below that level. This development signals a potential shift in market dynamics, as the $107,000–$108,000 zone may now act as a strong resistance area. Related Reading: Head And Shoulders Pattern Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $100,000 Crypto Candy further explained that if the downward momentum continues, Bitcoin could retrace deeper toward the $99,000–$101,000 range, an area viewed as a critical support zone where fresh buying interest might emerge. A dip into this range could also help clear out weak positions and create healthier conditions for a long-term rebound. However, the analyst added that if Bitcoin manages to reclaim and hold above the $107,000–$108,000 zone, it would signal that bullish strength is returning to the market. Such a breakout could restore confidence among investors, paving the way for renewed upward momentum and possibly another push toward higher targets. $102,000: The Ideal Flush Zone Before The Next Big Move In his latest BTC daily update, Super฿ro emphasized the critical role of the $102,000 support zone, describing it as an ideal area for the market to flush out remaining leveraged long positions. This kind of shakeout is often necessary to clear weak hands and set the stage for a more sustainable bullish continuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A ‘Do-Or-Die’ Level As Cycle Faces First Real Test: Analyst Super฿ro further noted that once this cleanup phase concludes, Bitcoin could see a sharp rebound, primarily fueled by a short squeeze from traders caught on the wrong side of the market. As shorts begin to close their positions, buying pressure could intensify, creating a rapid upward move that reclaims lost levels. That said, the crypto analyst has warned that a break below the $101,000 level would not be ideal, as it might signal that market weakness is deeper than anticipated. Still, he maintains confidence in the broader picture, highlighting that high-timeframe (HTF) indicators remain supportive of a potential rebound. Presently, the price of BTC is hovering around $104,000, indicating a more than 3% decline over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, its trading volume has picked up pace, rising by over 79% in the same time frame.

54039754,620273,1762300847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54039754.jpeg,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: 28,600 BTC Sold At A Loss",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holders-capitulate-28600-btc/,"Bitcoin has slipped below the $105,000 level, signaling mounting selling pressure and a notable rise in volatility as the market enters a critical phase. After months of strong resilience and repeated defenses of key support zones, bulls are now on the back foot, struggling to regain momentum while bears attempt to force BTC toward the psychological $100,000 threshold. Despite the sharp pullback, Bitcoin is still trading near important demand levels that previously acted as a base for significant upside movements — placing the market at a pivotal crossroads. According to data highlighted by top analyst Darkfost, short-term behavior is intensifying the sell-off. Short-term holders (STHs) continue sending Bitcoin to exchanges at a loss, with around 28,600 BTC currently being realized at negative profit. This aligns with heightened capitulation pressure, where newer market participants are exiting positions amid fear and short-term panic rather than a conviction-based strategy. While long-term on-chain metrics remain relatively stable, the market is now watching closely to see whether demand absorbs this wave of selling — or whether momentum shifts decisively in favor of the bears. With macro uncertainty still looming and liquidity thinning across major assets, the next few sessions could determine Bitcoin’s near-term direction. Short-Term Holders Remain Under Pressure According to Darkfost, the short-term holder (STH) cohort remains the key source of sell-side pressure in the current phase of the Bitcoin market. The analyst highlights that we can still expect a stronger capitulation from STHs, as their SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) continues to hover around 1 — a level that historically reflects indecision and stress. When SOPR hovers around parity, it indicates that short-term holders are either selling at break-even or only slightly above or below cost, suggesting little conviction and a lack of willingness to hold through volatility. This behavior also aligns with another critical pattern: each time Bitcoin approaches the STH realized price, roughly around $112,500, the market sees waves of profit-taking or break-even selling. Instead of holding through potential reversals, short-term participants are consistently exiting positions as soon as the price recovers toward their entry level. This repeated supply response near the STH cost basis has effectively become a rotating ceiling for BTC, preventing clean continuation and creating a structurally heavy price environment in the short term. Darkfost notes that this behavior signals doubt, fatigue, and heightened sensitivity to drawdowns among recent buyers. While long-term holders remain largely steady and are not contributing meaningfully to sell pressure, the STH cohort continues to react to every bounce with caution — a dynamic that often precedes final shakeouts or deeper wick-down events before trend continuation. BTC Tests Weekly Support Zone as Momentum Weakens and Sellers Tighten Control Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a decisive shift in momentum, with price sliding toward the $103,000–$105,000 support area and testing the 50-week moving average after a period of sustained weakness. The market has now posted several lower highs from the peak near $127,000, signaling a gradual transition from strong uptrend behavior to consolidation — and now, potential trend vulnerability if buyers fail to defend current levels. The recent weekly candle shows a sharp wick to the downside and increased selling volume, reflecting panic-driven exits and short-term capitulation. Despite this, price remains above a key structural support zone that held during previous pullbacks earlier in the cycle, making this level crucial for bulls to protect. A decisive break below the 50-week MA could accelerate downside momentum and open the door to deeper retracement targets toward $95,000 or even $88,000 if risk aversion intensifies. However, macro trend structure still leans bullish over the long term as the 200-week moving average continues to trend upward and sits comfortably below the current price. For now, eyes remain on whether BTC can reclaim $110,000 in the coming sessions — a move that would signal absorption of selling pressure and prevent further deterioration of market sentiment.

With 26.2% early-stage gains already locked for the earliest swarm members, the conversation around the best 1000x crypto in this cycle just got itchy. As anchors like Cardano bleed red and Aster rides billionaire backing, a tiny meme insect is quietly building a hive, growing its swarm, and sneaking toward attention in a market where underdogs can break the internet faster than anyone refreshes a chart. Yes, the memes are loud. Yes, the mosquito wings are whirring. And yes, crypto watchers are wondering whether this bug is preparing a sting that turns tiny entries into oversized bags. Time for a Mosquito Moment? La Culex Flexes Meme Mischief and Math La Culex ($CULEX) calls itself crypto’s mosquito, and somehow the branding works. Memes show mosquitoes wearing aviators, mosquitoes chasing moon rockets, and mosquitoes refusing to let bags sleep. Tiny but relentless. Annoying but impossible to ignore. The project mixes meme humor with staking, referrals, and token burns designed to shrink supply and amp loyalty rewards. Early holders already see 26.2% gain in Stage 4, backing the idea that early swarms eat first. With over 500M tokens sold and a La Culex presale tally crossing $11,000, this insect is collecting more buzz than a Bitcoin halving thread during bull season. The token supply structure aims for fairness instead of stealth launches and secret VC seeds. A community-first flight path means new holders join the swarm rather than chase whales. Memes are half the story. Referrals and staking APY are the other half. Because even mosquitoes want sustainable feeding cycles. $7,500 Bag Scenario at Listing Price now: $0.00002458 Projected listing price: $0.007 $7,500 buys approximately 305,185,244 tokens. At $0.007 listing, that bag values near $2.13M. Not financial advice. Just math. Math that makes traders choke on coffee and start checking mosquito memes twice. Cardano Dips Hard While Bulls Look the Other Way Cardano investors woke up to a chart that needed tissues. According to Investing.com, ADA dropped 10.11% in a single day and remains down 82.29% from its $3.10 all-time high. That is not just a dip. That is a flashback to 2022 PTSD territory. Volume hit $1.5392B, yet price slid to $0.5489 while traders searched for green somewhere else. In the last 7 days alone, the coin shed 17.64%, turning excitement into eyebrow raises. ADA still holds massive long-term fundamentals and academic-grade blockchain architecture, but right now, short-term nerves are real. With Bitcoin dominance tightening at over 60% and Ethereum wobbling, the capital rotation into microcaps and early memes feels familiar. It is the historic pattern where oversized blue chips stagnate, and micro-cap weirdos with strong community energy take off while everyone debates logic. Aster Pumps With CZ Fuel as Hype Spreads While Cardano was feeling the pain, Aster rode a rocket on social feeds after Binance founder CZ publicly posted about buying ASTER. The market jumped over 30% in minutes, and trading volume exploded, according to Bitget Academy. CZ saying “I buy and hold” hit harder than a bull run meme. Wallet trackers saw a swarm of traders rushing in, and some compared the moment to his early support for BNB. Aster has real-world DeFi mechanics, leveraged trading, and a zero-knowledge upgrade coming, giving it actual depth beyond hype. Still, people are watching to see whether the rally sustains or sees short-term traders dump in waves. Final Thought: Best 1000x Crypto Bite Point? Cardano has history, Aster has backing, and La Culex has culture and early math that refuses to sit still. As the next wave of meme cycles gathers force, smart investors watch for new community sticks of dynamite. Small caps often explode hardest during rotation phases. The mosquito narrative taps into humor, simplicity, and those “what if” energy moments that spark wild runs. Crypto never rewards those waiting politely. It rewards the projects that show up flapping wings with conviction. If curiosity is a mosquito bite, this one is itching right where hype lives. No wonder La Culex is named the best 1000x crypto .

La Culex combines memes with staking, referral systems, and burn mechanics designed to support sustainable growth beyond humor. How risky are early meme tokens? Meme tokens carry high volatility and risk. They can surge fast, but they can also correct sharply. Research is key. Why is Cardano down lately? Cardano has faced market selling pressure, dropping 17% in the past week amid broader sentiment shifts and altcoin rotations. Why did Aster rally recently? Aster surged over 30% after Binance founder CZ disclosed buying $2M worth of ASTER tokens, boosting confidence and volume. Glossary Presale: Early token sale before public listing APY: Annual percentage yield for staking rewards ROI: Return on investment Burn Mechanism: Token removal to reduce supply Meme Coin: Crypto driven by culture, humor, and community energy ZK Tech: Zero-knowledge proofs for blockchain privacy Swarm: La Culex community nickname Summary La Culex is emerging as a surprising meme-based contender in the hunt for the best 1000x crypto as major chains like Cardano struggle and Aster rallies on CZ backing. In Stage 4 of its presale, La Culex has already delivered 26.2% gains for early buyers, selling over 500M tokens and crossing $11,000 in funding with more than 80 holders. With a $0.00002458 price and a $0.007 listing target, speculative ROI math fuels community interest, supported by staking, referral rewards, and token burns. Meanwhile, Cardano fell over 10% in one day and remains down 82% from its all-time high, while Aster surged over 30% following CZ’s public investment. The article examines sentiment rotation into smaller meme-driven assets, evaluates early-stage token mechanics, and emphasizes risk transparency. The tone blends humor and research, highlighting a unique narrative shift where a mosquito-themed token gains traction amid shifting market cycles.

54039757,621493,1762301853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54039757.jpeg,Bitcoin Experten reden Tacheles: Saylor und Kiyosaki geben ihre Jahresprognosen ab,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-experten-prognose-saylor-kiyosaki/,"Michael Saylor und Robert Kiyosaki erwarten eine deutliche Bitcoin-Rally bis Ende 2025. Beide verweisen auf langfristige Trends und die Bedeutung von emotionaler Disziplin in volatilen Märkten. Trotz kurzfristiger Schwankungen und Rücksetzer bei MicroStrategy zeigt sich das langfristige Vertrauen stark. Bitcoin sorgt erneut für Schlagzeilen. Zwei der bekanntesten Stimmen im Kryptomarkt senden bullische Signale – und das, obwohl der Kurs nach Rekordständen zuletzt korrigiert hat. Michael Saylor und Robert Kiyosaki bleiben überzeugt, dass BTC noch ganz am Anfang seiner Reise steht. Ihre Botschaft ist klar: Wer jetzt Nerven zeigt, könnte später belohnt werden. Prominente Prognosen für eine neue Bitcoin-Rally Bitcoin polarisiert wie kaum ein Asset und legt ein weiteres Kapitel intensiver Debatten hin. Nachdem der Kurs sein Rekordhoch erreicht hat, folgte eine scharfe Korrektur. Dennoch treten zwei der lautesten Fürsprecher auf den Plan und setzen ein Zeichen des Vertrauens. Michael Saylor und Robert Kiyosaki sind überzeugt, dass die Kryptowährung weiter steigen wird und neue Höchststände erreichbar sind. Während viele Anleger verunsichert reagieren, bleiben diese prominenten Marktbeobachter optimistisch. Sie sehen die aktuelle Phase als normalen Zyklus in einem langfristigen Aufwärtstrend. Ihre Prognosen spiegeln nicht nur Hoffnung wider, sondern basieren auf historischen Mustern und neuen Marktstrukturen. Für sie ist der Rückgang kein Signal zur Panik, sondern eine Chance zum Handeln. Michael Saylor sieht strukturelle Stärke im Markt Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman von MicroStrategy, betont die wachsende Stabilität des BTC-Ökosystems. Trotz des jüngsten Schocks von Milliardenliquidationen sieht er eine robuste Marktstruktur. Laut Saylor bleibt der Aufwärtstrend bestehen, da Volatilität sinkt und institutionelle Nutzung zunimmt. Sein Kursziel von $150.000 bis Ende 2025 basiert auf Analysten-Konsens und langfristiger Fundamentalanalyse. Er geht sogar weiter und spricht von einem möglichen Anstieg bis hin zu siebenstelligen Beträgen innerhalb weniger Jahre. Seine Firma setzt diese Überzeugung in Taten um und kaufte zuletzt erneut hunderte Bitcoin. MicroStrategys Strategie bleibt klar: Bitcoin als primäres Wertaufbewahrungsmittel. Dass die Aktie von MicroStrategy parallel zur Korrektur fiel, zeigt die starke Bindung an den Kryptomarkt. MicroStrategy bleibt auf Einkaufskurs Die jüngste Akquisition von 390 BTC unterstreicht das Vertrauen des Unternehmens. Mit über 640.000 Bitcoin hält MicroStrategy eine Position, die im Krypto-Sektor nahezu einzigartig ist. Trotz Kursverlusten von rund 13% im Aktienpreis bleibt die Strategie unverändert. Für Saylor ist Bitcoin ein langfristiges Anlagevehikel, das traditionelle Finanzsysteme herausfordert. During the Strategy earnings call Saylor said that MSTR is a 10 year hold when a few minutes earlier the CEO presented figures based on BTC hitting $150k in…. checks watch ….60 days. You couldn't make this up! pic.twitter.com/NVbptYHLdZ — Skag (@superskag) November 1, 2025 Die Marktreaktion zeigt jedoch, dass Anleger kurzfristig sensibel auf Preisbewegungen reagieren. Der Rückgang bestätigt die enge Korrelation zwischen Bitcoin-Preis und Unternehmensbewertung. Dennoch sieht Saylor diese Schwankungen gelassen. Sein Fokus liegt klar auf langfristigen Wertzuwächsen und strukturellem Wachstum des Bitcoin-Netzwerks, nicht auf täglichen Kursbewegungen. Kiyosaki setzt auf emotionale Stärke und Kursziele Robert Kiyosaki, Bestseller-Autor und bekannter Investor, teilt eine noch aggressivere Prognose. Auf X erklärte er, dass BTC bis Jahresende $200.000 erreichen könne. Er betont jedoch nicht nur Zahlen, sondern das emotionale Management beim Investieren. Angst sei laut ihm der häufigste Grund, Chancen zu verpassen. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Kiyosaki erklärt, dass Anleger mehr verlieren, wenn sie aus Furcht handeln statt rational. Er selbst hält nach eigenen Aussagen BTC im Millionenbereich. Seine Sichtweise spricht besonders Kleinanleger an, die sich in volatilen Märkten schnell verunsichern lassen. Für ihn ist Bitcoin ein Werkzeug zur finanziellen Freiheit und Absicherung gegen Inflation. Marktdaten zeigen gemischtes Stimmungsbild Bitcoin handelt aktuell nahe $111.000 und liegt damit unter seinem Allzeithoch. Handelsvolumen und Futures-Finanzierung haben nachgelassen, was auf geringere Marktaktivität hinweist. Gleichzeitig zeigen institutionelle Zuflüsse, dass das Interesse großer Anleger weiter besteht. Analysten sehen den Rückzug daher eher als Mid-Cycle-Korrektur, nicht als Trendbruch. On-Chain-Daten bestätigen verstärkte Akkumulation, da mehr Coins von Börsen abgezogen werden. Niedrigere Liquidität erhöht zwar kurzfristiges Risiko, doch langfristige Anleger nutzen Rücksetzer zum Kauf. Diese Dynamik stützt die These eines gesunden Marktumfeldes. Geduld und Strategie scheinen derzeit wichtiger als schnelle Entscheidungen. Langfristige Perspektive trotz kurzfristiger Schwankungen Sowohl Saylor als auch Kiyosaki verweisen auf die Bedeutung des langfristigen Blicks. Ihre Einschätzungen beruhen auf strukturellen Trends, nicht auf tagesaktuellen Charts. Beide gehen davon aus, dass BTC weiter wachsen wird, gestützt durch institutionelle Nachfrage und klare Angebotsstruktur. Die aktuelle Unsicherheit sei temporär und Teil des Zyklus. Für Anleger bedeutet dies: Ruhe bewahren, Risiken kennen und langfristig denken. Emotionale Disziplin wird zum Schlüssel in einer hochdynamischen Anlageklasse. Wer BTC als langfristige Investition betrachtet, könnte von zukünftigen Kursanstiegen profitieren. Die Vision bleibt klar: ein digitaler Wertspeicher mit globaler Reichweite und enormem Wachstumspotenzial. Bitcoin Hyper: Profiteur eines prognostizierten Anstiegs von BTC Viele Experten prognostizieren für dieses Jahr einen deutlichen Anstieg von BTC. Mit steigendem Interesse und institutioneller Teilnahme gewinnt BTC weiter an Bedeutung. Bitcoin Hyper baut direkt auf dieser Entwicklung auf: Es verbindet die Sicherheit von Bitcoin mit der Geschwindigkeit von Solana und macht BTC anwendbar – nicht nur ein Wertaufbewahrungsmittel. Gelangt Bitcoin in eine neue Wachstumsphase, steht Bitcoin Hyper bereit, davon zu profitieren. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für BTC Hyper! $HYPER: Wenn BTC steigt, könnte Hyper mitsteigen $HYPER ist der Token, der diese Erweiterung möglich macht. Steigt BTC wie von Experten erwartet, steigt auch der Bedarf an Lösungen, die BTC nutzbar machen. Hyper erfüllt genau diesen Bedarf – und $HYPER könnte von dieser Dynamik mittel- bis langfristig profitieren.

This move would position Gemini among the many financial firms entering a new field of prediction markets. Reports highlighted that this market will provide a controlled method for betting on outcomes of elections, sports games, and other events. The launch represents Gemini’s effort to diversify its offerings amid a competitive crypto exchange market. Gemini aims to remain competitive in the crypto space Recently, Gemini has been making significant moves to strengthen its position in the crypto space . To begin with, the firm applied for regulatory approval to establish its own derivatives exchange, which is designated as a contract market. This update followed discussions by the cryptocurrency exchange’s officials about using this exchange for trading prediction contracts. The application is still under review. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that securing approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a new exchange can take a considerable amount of time, often spanning months or even years. The delays may also occur if a government shutdown takes place. Another significant milestone in the ecosystem is that several exchanges and retail investment brokers have decided to collaborate with existing prediction market platforms that already hold the necessary licenses, rather than starting from scratch. An example of these platforms is Robinhood, which offers its clients event contracts from Kalshi Inc. If Gemini moves forward with its plans, the company can compete against key players such as trading exchange Kalshi, which is already registered with the US derivatives regulator, and Polymarket, which seeks to resume operations in the US soon. Trump Media and Technology Group also entered the growing trend of prediction markets, partnering with Crypto.com. The predictions are expected to be integrated with Truth Social , Trump’s social media platform. Truth Social will use Crypto.com Derivatives North America as a clearinghouse, tapping a CFTC-registered platform. The initial testing of Truth Predict, the new market, is expected to commence soon. Prediction markets face significant regulatory challenges. Following the growing trend among companies to participate in prediction markets, established exchange companies such as CME Group Inc. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. have reportedly entered the prediction market. Moreover, Gemini’s major competitor in the crypto industry, Coinbase Global Inc., pointed out in recent earnings calls that it aims to branch out into event contracts. According to the company, this move is part of its expansive goal to become an “Everything Exchange” for different financial products. On the other hand, Gemini announced in a regulatory filing that it intended to launch event contracts for predictions connected to sports, finance, politics, and economics before its initial public offering in September this year. Since going public, the firm’s stock has drastically declined by 40% from its debut price. Its IPO prospectus explained that Gemini is not currently profitable. The legal document also highlighted that the cryptocurrency exchange only accounts for a small portion of crypto trading in the US. This situation prompted a Needham analyst to comment on the matter. The analyst acknowledged that the prediction markets present an ideal opportunity for Gemini to expand its services beyond what it currently provides. However, reports noted that prediction markets still face major regulatory challenges. For example, while CFTC has granted Kalshi permission to introduce new markets, state gaming regulators, who usually manage sports betting, have opposed this decision in court.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new DeFi token that is growing popular among investors and may turn into one of the most successful ones to follow in 2026. The project is a combination of both practical use in the real world and potential of investing earlier, and its presale has already attracted the attention of the industry. Mutuum Finance emerges as one of the most discussed new crypto coins of the year and its price is still under $0.05 but a novel protocol launch is also coming, which promotes the gradual increase in the popularity of this project. Presale Gains Momentum The presale of Mutuum Finance has demonstrated a consistent increase up to 2025. The current phase of the project is Phase 6 and the MUTM tokens are traded at $0.035 each. The following step will involve increasing the price to be charged at $0.04 and price at launch will be at $0.06 which will give an early buyer an advantage of around 100-500% MUTM appreciation. The value of the token has also increased by 250% since the very first offer when the presale stood at a low price of just $0.01 US. To illustrate a bigger picture, 790 million tokens have already been sold, so 85%of Phase 6 is already allocated. Mutuum Finance also raised more than $18.4 million and had over 18,000 holders, which shows increased confidence of the retail and institutional investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The prototype of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is non-custodial. It considers giving an effective and direct lending system where users will be able to lend, borrow and make yield without the intervention of any intermediaries. Users are awarded the interest-based tokens into the protocol when they deposit crypto, which are called ports that continue to generate yield as the borrower pays interest. As an illustration, when a user deposits ETH, he/she is awarded with the mtETH which accumulates value over time as interest is paid. The other star attribute of Mutuum Finance is that of the buy-and-distribute model. Since the tokens of the Mutual token can be bought on the open market with some platform fees, they are relocated to the users who hold staked mtTokens. Roadmap Plans In addition to the presale, Mutuum Finance is also designing a USD based stablecoin which is expected to be over-collateralized by in-ecosystem loans. The stablecoin will be minted and burnt on demand, and this will generate an elastic supply system to improve the liquidity and stability throughout the platform. The integration will also facilitate long-term sustainability and provide an even greater yield to the treasury. The project is also going to use the power of oracle infrastructure which may be combined with Chainlink which would provide timely and precise price feeds. Oracles play an important role in loan health, liquidations and accuracy of Mutuum Finance is evidence of its institutional-grade DeFi infrastructure. It is estimated that MUTM has the potential to achieve $0.30 to $0.40 within the first year of its debut as per the forecasts made by various analysts. V1 Intake and Whale Partaking The second milestone that will be significant to Mutuum Finance is the release of V1 protocol , which is scheduled in Q4 2025 on Sepolia Testnet. The platform will debut the basic capabilities of the platform, which include Liquidity Pool, mtToken system, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot all of which constitute fundamental elements of the decentralized lending framework. Phase 1 of the roadmap which is audits, platform architecture, and initial outreach to the community has been done. The group is currently in Project Phase 2 that will be concentrated on product development and the launch of the testnet prior to the launch of the mainnet in 2026. The fiction on whales has grown and a number of large purchases have been made to the presale within the past two weeks. Analysts interpret this initial participation of the whales as being a signal of institutional or high-net-worth confidence. The Reason Investors Are Watching Mutuum Finance is one of the potential best crypto to follow in Q4 in the year 2025 because of the combination of a low presale price, utility-driven model, and good roadmap implementation. Although major players like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are sound, their huge market values deny them chances of making immediate gains. Conversely, MUTM is still in its infancy with a low valuation of only $0.035 and its development is pegged closely on DeFi yields- which is a huge upside. The two-lending structure of the project, revenue structure founded on buy-and-distribute, and open communication with the communities, explains why the analysts call it one of the most promising new crypto-projects that have a price less than $0.05. With Phase 6 already sold of 85% and with exceeding 18.4 million funds raised and the V1 Testnet coming into play, the months ahead of time may play a crucial part in making MUTM one of the highest-performing DeFi tokens of 2026.

54040781,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=848542,1762304419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54040781.jpeg,Crypto Isn’t Topping Yet: Arthur Hayes Says Stealth QE Is Near,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-isnt-topping-yet-arthur-hayes-stealth-qe/,"Arthur Hayes argues that the next leg of the crypto cycle will be driven not by a headline pivot to quantitative easing, but by a “stealth” version executed through the Federal Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility (SRF). In a new essay titled “Hallelujah” published on November 4, 2025, the former BitMEX CEO lays out a balance-sheet-driven case that persistent US fiscal deficits, hedge-fund demand for Treasuries financed via repo, and the Fed’s need to cap funding stress will translate into incremental dollar liquidity that ultimately “pumps the price of Bitcoin and other cryptos.” As he frames the core mechanism: “Government issued debt grows the money supply.” Hayes’ logic chain begins with an observation on political incentives and the arithmetic of public finance. Governments can fund spending with “savings or debt,” and in his view elected officials “will always favor borrowing from the future to get re-elected in the present.” For the United States, he contends that the trajectory is already set: “Here are the estimates from the TBTF banksters, and a few US government agencies. As you can see, the estimates are for ~$2 trillion deficits funded by ~$2 trillion of borrowing.” In his model, once one accepts that “Yearly Federal Deficit = Yearly Treasury Debt Issuance Amount,” the next critical question is who actually buys that debt, and on what financing. Fed’s Stealth QE Will “Pump Crypto” He dismisses foreign central banks as dependable marginal buyers after the US sanctioned and immobilized Russian reserves in 2022. “If Pax Americana is willing to steal Russia’s money… then no foreign owner of treasuries is ever safe,” he writes, concluding reserve managers “would rather buy gold than treasuries.” He likewise downplays the capacity of the US household sector given that “the 2024 personal savings rate was 4.6%” while “the US federal deficit was 6% of GDP,” and he argues the largest US money-center banks have increased their Treasury holdings by only “~$300 billion” in fiscal 2025 against issuance of “$1,992 billion,” making them meaningful but not decisive. Related Reading: Caution In The Crypto Market: Expert Warns Of Bearish Phase Unfolding This November Instead, Hayes positions relative-value hedge funds—particularly those booking positions via Cayman vehicles—as the marginal, price-setting bid for US duration. Citing a recent Federal Reserve study, he quotes: “Cayman Islands hedge funds purchased, on net, $1.2 trillion of Treasury securities… [between] January 2022 and December 2024… [and] absorbed 37% of net issuance of notes and bonds.” The trade architecture is straightforward: “Buy a cash treasury debt security vs. sell the corresponding treasury futures contract,” then lever the tiny basis through repo funding. Because the edge is “measured in basis points,” the trade only works if leverage is cheap and predictable every day. That funnel leads directly to the SRF. Hayes lays out the Fed’s short-rate corridor—“Upper and Lower Fed Funds; currently these equal 4.00% and 3.75% respectively”—and the policy plumbing that keeps market rates inside it: the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) at the lower bound for money-market funds (MMFs) and banks, interest on reserve balances (IORB) for banks in the middle, and the SRF at the upper bound as the emergency spigot. Lower Fed Funds = RRP < IORB < SRF = Upper Fed Funds,” he summarizes, adding that the target, SOFR, normally oscillates inside the band. Stress occurs “when SOFR trades above the Upper Fed Funds,” which he calls “a problem” because “the filthy fiat financial system shuts down” once participants can’t roll overnight leverage at a stable rate. In his telling, the cash supply that cushions SOFR is structurally thinner than it was when the Fed began quantitative tightening in early 2022. MMFs, he says, have drained the RRP to zero because “the T-bill rate is so attractive,” making them less available as repo cash providers. That leaves banks, who will supply liquidity so long as they have ample reserves, but “banks lost trillions in reserves since the Fed began QT.” Set against that diminished supply of cash is relentless demand for repo financing from RV funds, whose “marginal” Treasury purchases must be levered. If SOFR threatens to pierce the ceiling and repo becomes unreliable, the Fed’s SRF must backstop the system to prevent a funding accident. “Because a similar situation occurred in 2019, the Fed created the SRF,” Hayes writes. “The Fed can supply an infinite amount of cash using its printing press at SRF as long as one provides an acceptable form of collateral.” His conclusion is blunt: “If the SRF balances are above zero, then we know the Fed is cashing the checks of the politicians using printed money.” Hayes labels this dynamic “Stealth QE.” He argues the optics of outright balance-sheet expansion via asset purchases are now politically toxic—“QE is a dirty word… QE = money printing = inflation”—so the central bank will prefer to meet marginal dollar demand via SRF lending rather than by visibly creating excess reserves. What This Means For The Crypto Market The result is functionally similar from a liquidity standpoint, in his view: repo credit distributed by the Fed against Treasuries still increases spendable dollars in the system to finance government borrowing. “This will buy some time, but eventually the exponential expansion of treasury debt issuance will force the repeated use of the SRF,” he writes. “Stealth QE will begin shortly. I don’t know when it will begin. But… the SRF balance must grow as the lender of last resort. As SRF balances grow, the amount of fiat dollars in the world expands as well. This phenomenon will reignite the Bitcoin bull market.” He also sketches a near-term tactical backdrop that helps explain recent market tone across crypto. While auctions are pulling cash into the Treasury General Account, he notes, fiscal spending has been temporarily impeded by the government shutdown, producing a net drain in private-sector liquidity. Related Reading: Crypto Bull Case Vs. Bear Case: These Forces Divide The Market “The Treasury General Account is above the $850 billion target by ~$150bn,” he writes, arguing that this “extra liquidity won’t get released into the markets until the government reopens,” contributing to “current softness in the crypto markets.” In other words, the same fiscal engine that ultimately forces the Fed’s hand via the SRF can, in the very short run, sap liquidity when issuance front-runs outlays. Hayes’ rhetoric remains intentionally sharp. He describes Treasuries as “dog shit” at prevailing real yields, calls the buy-side “debt shit eaters,” and opens with a hymn to Bitcoin’s monetary properties—“Praise be to Lord Satoshi that time and compounding interest exist regardless of who you are.” The provocation serves the point: if the marginal financing of US deficits increasingly relies on opaque backstops rather than transparent reserve creation, then crypto’s native, non-sovereign liquidity cycles will key off the same hidden plumbing. He distills the investment upshot in a single sentence: “Treasury Debt Amount Issued = Increase in Supply of Dollars.” The essay is not a calendar call. Hayes refuses to timestamp the inflection—“I don’t know when it will begin”—and he warns that “between now and when stealth QE begins, one has to husband capital. Expect a choppy market,” especially with shutdown dynamics distorting flows. But he is unequivocal on direction once SRF usage becomes persistent: “Stealth QE will begin shortly… [and] will reignite the Bitcoin bull market.” For crypto investors conditioned to watch CPI prints and FOMC dots, the message is to track money-market microstructure instead. In Hayes’ framework, when SRF balances stop being a rounding error and start trending, that is the tell that dollar liquidity has quietly flipped—and that crypto isn’t topping yet. At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.41 trillion.

The listings include both futures-based and spot-based products, suggesting that the first U.S. spot XRP ETFs may debut this month despite ongoing regulatory delays. Related Reading: Market Maker Balancer Compromised: Key Facts Behind The $128 Million Hack While a DTCC listing does not automatically mean trading has begun, it represents a key preparatory step toward launch. Futures ETFs, such as UXRP, XRPI, XRPT, and XXRP, are already live, while spot-focused funds like TOXR, XRP, XRPC, and XRPL await the final approval. Notably, the review process stalled due to the October U.S. government shutdown, which froze more than a dozen altcoin ETF filings, including those tied to Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano. However, with Canary Capital removing delaying amendments and setting November 13 as the automatic effective date for its XRP ETF, analysts now expect trading to begin within days. Bitwise and Grayscale Fast-Track XRP ETFs Without SEC Approval Major asset managers Bitwise and Grayscale have confirmed plans to roll out their XRP ETFs under newly adopted SEC listing standards that allow automatic effectiveness after 20 days if no objections are filed. This means both firms could list their funds without explicit SEC approval, a move that marks a significant regulatory shift in the U.S. Bitwise has set a 0.34% management fee for its XRP ETF, while Grayscale’s proposed fund carries a 0.35% fee, the same rate as its Dogecoin ETF. Both issuers are replicating their successful Solana ETF strategies, which drew over $56 million in first-day trading volume, signaling robust institutional demand. According to Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, “The launch of spot XRP ETFs marks the end of an era of anti-crypto regulation.” If approved, XRP could soon join Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as a core asset class in the ETF landscape. Analysts Eye a Breakout as XRP Holds Above Key Support Despite short-term weakness, XRP continues to hold above the $2.25 support zone, a level analysts view as pivotal for the next bullish leg. Market watcher Dominus recently predicted XRP will “print the largest green candle in crypto history,” citing the convergence of ETF-driven demand, institutional adoption, and on-chain strength. Meanwhile, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin has surpassed $1 billion in valuation, further solidifying the company’s ecosystem strength.

The government says the action is needed to protect the integrity and stability of the $2.1 trillion fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, amid escalating political tension over Israel’s war in Gaza and U.S. diplomatic pressure. The Norwegian government’s finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, stated on Tuesday that Norway’s parliament had passed an urgent measure to suspend the ethics council, pending the country’s review of rules for ethical investing. He said that the current system could have compelled the fund to divest from major technology companies over their alleged roles in Israeli military operations and surveillance programs. Stoltenberg stated that an independent body could potentially compel the fund to sell its holdings in some of the world’s largest companies, noting that such a move would compromise the fund’s objectives of remaining broad and globally diversified. Among the funds managed by Norges Bank Investment Management — an arm of Norway’s central bank that manages the Government Pension Fund Global, and which acquired shares in more than 9,000 companies, U.S. tech giants among them- Alphabet shares ranked fifth in value, behind stakes in Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc. These are the top companies that account for over 15% of the fund’s combined equity holdings. To be compelled to withdraw from them would leave the fund with a significantly more unbalanced picture globally, and the economic foundations of Norway’s state welfare arrangements, which rely on revenues from the fund for around a quarter of its annual budget, would also suffer as a result. Tensions rise over Israel and U.S. pressure The freeze comes after months of wrangling in Norway over how to respond to the fund’s links to Israel. It sold off shares of Caterpillar Inc. in August, after bulldozers manufactured by the company were shown to have razed Palestinian properties in the West Bank and Gaza. That decision was said to have raised alarms in Washington, where U.S. officials cautioned further exemptions aimed at American entities could put a strain on diplomatic and commercial relations . A UN report by Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese was published in July, adding to the pressure. The report blamed Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet for offering cloud services and AI technologies that grant Israel virtually government-wide access to surveillance and other sensitive databases, which could support military and security operations. The ethics council was about to consider these companies when the government intervened abruptly and halted the process. The move was passed in parliament thanks to the support of Norway’s two largest centre-right opposition parties. Left-wing groups, who are critical allies in the passage of the national budget, wasted no time in denouncing the decision. Critics argue that suspending the ethics council casts Norway, which has a history of principled divestments from areas such as corporations engaged in corruption, arms production, or environmental harm, as failing to uphold its reputation as a global leader in responsible investing. However, supporters argue that the fund’s primary mandate is financial stability, not moral enforcement. Norway reassesses fund’s ethical rules The government stated that the pause was temporary and would remain in effect until a comprehensive review of the fund’s ethical guidelines is completed in 2026. This review will also examine whether to relax the ban on investing in defense companies, such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus, and BAE Systems, which are currently prohibited due to their links to nuclear weapon manufacturing. A former head of NATO, Stoltenberg, said Norway’s policy now amounted to “a paradox” because Norway relies on the protection offered by nuclear weapons as part of NATO even though its own fund is forbidden from investing in firms that make them.

54041364,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=853183,1762305396,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54041364.jpeg,Franklin Templeton updates XRP ETF filing for imminent launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/franklin-templeton-updates-xrp-etf-filing/,"Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has taken a significant step in introducing the Spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The company submitted an updated S-1 registration statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week, removing language that likely stood in the way of approval. The change is indicative of a strong commitment to completing the fund sale in short order — as soon as this month. The amendment is primarily designed to eliminate the “8(a)” delay clause, a technological artifact of ETF filings under which the SEC can prevent the effectiveness of a registration statement from taking effect automatically until it affirmatively approves it. By deleting this provision, Franklin Templeton secures the right to render effective the filing of the Registration Statement automatically upon fulfillment of all other conditions. This development positions Franklin Templeton as one of the most ambitious asset managers to file for a crypto ETF amid the current market flow. It replicates an approach that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers previously adopted, expediting approvals and listings when the 8(a) clause was removed. The timing of this change is crucial. Analysts say it betrays a confidence that the SEC will not register additional complaints against XRP-related products — especially as the market continues to mature and regulatory infrastructures around crypto ETFs take clearer shape. For Franklin Templeton, which manages assets worth more than $1 trillion globally, an XRP ETF would be a significant addition to its cryptocurrency investment offerings. The firm already offers exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum through similar products, indicating an increasing confidence in digital assets as an emerging investment asset class. Other asset managers race to launch XRP ETFs Franklin Templeton isn’t the only one seeking to launch an XRP ETF. Other asset managers, such as Canary Funds and Bitwise, have also revised their S-1 filings in recent weeks. Canary Funds has withdrawn its operating company’s delaying amendment and is seeking to go live in mid-November, subject to exchange approval. Bitwise, another major player in digital asset management, announced that it would list an XRP ETF on a prominent U.S. exchange. The company has already made public fees and custodial arrangements — the last steps generally completed when an ETF is on the verge of a launch. The surge in amended filings indicates growing industry optimism that the SEC may approve several XRP ETFs for marketing around the same time. For investors, this would provide new, regulated access to one of the world’s most widely traded cryptocurrencies, without the need to hold a token directly. Investors prepare for ripple effect on markets The competition to offer an XRP ETF demonstrates the next step toward institutional involvement in digital assets. If approved, these funds would provide investors with a straightforward, regulated way to gain token access to XRP price movements through traditional brokerages. An XRP ETF could also onboard new retail investors and boost the liquidity and trust of the asset, similarly to what spot Bitcoin ETFs achieved earlier this year. Those funds attracted billions of dollars in inflows within a matter of weeks, a subtle indication of the pent-up demand among institutional and retail investors. The SEC, which has become more receptive to digital-asset ETFs after approving products including Bitcoin and Ethereum, is still carefully weighing every filing. Final approval will be based on full disclosure, custody, and transparency of how pricing is happening through the base market. Still, market participants view the update in Franklin Templeton’s filing as their strongest sign yet that they are poised. With a swift response from the firm and news of other competing funds, this should mean that we don’t have long to wait for the first XRP ETF — marking another key turning point in crypto’s journey into traditional finance.

The company pulled in $83.5 million in revenue for Q3, nearly double what it made in the same quarter last year, which was $43.7 million. And it’s not just numbers on a spreadsheet. They’ve got boots on the ground and shovels digging. The company is building 1.5 gigawatts worth of new data center capacity across the U.S. Out of that $83.5 million, a massive $70 million came from the compute business. That includes hosting revenue from its crypto mining arm American Bitcoin (ABTC) and the high-performance compute segment. The rest came from its power generation and managed services unit ($8.4 million) and digital infrastructure offerings ($5.1 million) for other clients using its hosting services. Hut 8 expands buildout across Louisiana, Illinois, and Texas Hut 8’s net income exploded to $50.6 million, up from just $0.9 million in Q3 last year. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $109 million, compared to only $6 million in Q3 2024. At the end of the quarter, Hut 8 had 1.02 gigawatts of total capacity under management. Now, management says it’s aiming to take that number to over 2.5 gigawatts in the years ahead. To do that, four new sites are in play across three U.S. states. One of them is the 300 MW River Bend location in Louisiana, which was first announced back in August. There’s also a 40 MW facility in Illinois, along with two sites in Texas, one at 180 MW and another beast-sized 1 GW location. The Texas sites haven’t been named yet. CEO Asher Genoot laid it out in the Q3 report : “In the third quarter, we reached an inflection point in the scale and maturity of our development flywheel.” He continued: “We advanced 1,530 megawatts of capacity from exclusivity into development… Subject to commercialization, this portfolio has the potential to expand our Energy Capacity Under Management to more than 2.5 gigawatts.” To fund the expansion, Hut 8 opened a $1 billion at-the-market offering. On top of that, they locked in a $200 million revolving credit line from Two Prime. That helps give them near-term cash to keep pushing the buildout forward. As of now, the company holds 13,696 bitcoin on its balance sheet. Meanwhile, its mining arm American Bitcoin, which became public in September after merging with Gryphon Digital, is still operating strong. At quarter-end, it was running about 25 EH/s of hashpower across Hut 8 facilities. American Bitcoin itself holds 3,865 bitcoin in its own treasury.

The entry point that matters here is around $89,613, which is the blended price where the average U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF investment sits, according to Bloomberg. That $89,613 has now become the line where gains turn into losses for the everyday buyers who entered during the heavy inflows earlier in the year after Trump’s second inauguration. Billions moved into these ETFs throughout the year. That demand helped lift Bitcoin to a new record high before the recent drop. But the coin is now down more than 20% from its peak. Most ETF buyers are still above break-even, but the cushion is getting smaller. This same level also lined up with a reversal in April when Bitcoin hit its low of the year and then bounced higher. Vetle Lunde, the head of research at K33, said, “It was very interesting to see how the April reversal coincided with the cost basis.” Many ETF buyers didn’t buy the top. They added exposure during that selloff. If Bitcoin tests that zone again, those positions could quickly turn negative. ETF participation grows while volatility returns Supporters of Bitcoin ETFs have argued that these products bring in more patient investors. They say people using ETFs are less likely to trade on every price swing and are more comfortable holding through corrections. They also argue that ETF flows have reduced some of Bitcoin’s extreme volatility. But the recent drawdown is showing that volatility has not disappeared. Newer investors who entered through regulated ETF products are learning that the price of Bitcoin can still move sharply, even with Wall Street in the picture. Market sentiment has weakened. Bitcoin fell more than 6% on Tuesday and traded under $100,000, its lowest level since June. The coin is now down 20% from the high it reached last month, which in traditional markets would count as a bear market move. Ether and smaller altcoins have fallen even harder. A large part of the selloff is tied to low market participation and fear left over from the October liquidation event that wiped out billions in leveraged positions and left long traders with little momentum to defend recent gains. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF remains the largest Bitcoin ETF, pulling in more than $27 billion this year and holding around $85 billion in assets. But even with major asset managers involved, Bitcoin remains a market that moves in cycles. James Seyffart at Bloomberg Intelligence said , “This asset and these ETFs move forward in this two-steps-forward one-step-back move.” He added that crypto remains a very volatile asset class and there is no certainty whether this is a small retracement or the beginning of a larger downturn. Hedging rises as Bitcoin moves with tech stocks Options traders have been preparing for further declines. Put contracts expiring in late November with $80,000 strike prices are getting the most interest on Deribit, the crypto exchange owned by Coinbase. That positioning suggests that traders are protecting themselves against deeper losses or are positioning to profit if Bitcoin falls toward that level. Bitcoin’s drop this week is also moving in line with the performance of high-growth tech stocks. Companies tied to AI trends, such as Palantir and Nvidia, have seen their share prices fall as traders question whether valuations became too stretched. Bitcoin has often been viewed as a proxy for speculative appetite. It is now once again trading in sync with the mood of the wider equity market instead of acting as a hedge or separate alternative.

The kind that turns ordinary investors into crypto legends overnight? As markets hum with anticipation and altcoins flash green once more, analysts are asking which projects could define the next big wave. For anyone looking to buy top cryptos this month, momentum is everything, and right now, three names are dominating headlines for very different reasons: Chainlink, Polygon, and a meme-fueled titan-in-the-making, BullZilla. BullZilla is a cinematic token saga that blends utility with myth, tokenomics with storytelling, and community power with raw DeFi mechanics. Built on Ethereum, its presale structure and deflationary burns have captured serious attention among retail and pro traders alike. From a 2,235% ROI trajectory to a 70% APY staking furnace, BullZilla is showing the kind of growth pattern that early DOGE or SHIB holders would recognize instantly. For those planning to buy top cryptos this month, this beast is the next apex pick. Final Countdown: Grab BullZilla at $0.00022573 Before It Mutates to Stage 9C Chainlink ($LINK): FTSE Russell Partnership Brings On-Chain Benchmark Data Chainlink has been the backbone of decentralized data feeds for years, but its latest move might redefine on-chain finance altogether. In a first-of-its-kind partnership, FTSE Russell — the global index provider- has joined forces with Chainlink to bring equity, FX, and digital asset benchmarks directly to blockchain networks. Through Chainlink’s DataLink service, this integration connects FTSE Russell’s regulated data with over 2,000 applications across 50+ blockchains, creating an unprecedented bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. This collaboration effectively turns benchmark indices into programmable financial primitives, accessible to developers and institutions worldwide. With Chainlink’s infrastructure providing secure, verifiable feeds, the move could usher in a new era of institutional-grade on-chain finance. However, as this transformation unfolds, the LINK price dropped 7.44% to $14.85 in the last 24 hours, hinting that the market might still be digesting what could become one of the most consequential integrations in crypto’s evolution. Frequently Asked Questions About Chainlink Why is Chainlink in the spotlight this week?

Jared is an eccentric billionaire, who founded of Shift4 and commanders two private spaceflights. But Jared is also known to be close, long-term friends with Elon Musk, whose companies hold major influence in the U.S. space industry. In the statement shared Tuesday on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Jared’s passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.” That post marked the formal reinstatement of Jared’s nomination. The first nomination was withdrawn in late May after tensions between Trump and Elon, who at the time was involved in a White House effort to cut the size of federal agencies. Trump said the withdrawal was due to reviewing Jared’s “past associations,” but he did not explain further. Reports suggested the reference pointed to Jared’s earlier donations to Democrats, though nothing was confirmed from the White House. Isaacman reorganizes Shift4 and prepares for Senate confirmation Days after the pulled nomination, Jared addressed Shift4 investors. He wrote that his “brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience.” He then announced that he would step down as CEO and instead become executive chairman of the company he founded in 1999 at age 16. He had been planning to leave the CEO role if the Senate confirmed him to lead NASA, but the confirmation process did not take place at that time. Since July, NASA has been led temporarily by Sean Duffy, the Transportation Secretary, as interim administrator. That arrangement continues while the government remains shut down. The shutdown began at the start of October, but the Senate is still able to vote on presidential nominees. Jared will need Senate approval before he can officially take control of the agency. Jared has a long background in aerospace and military contracting.In 2012, he co‑founded Draken International, a Florida defense aviation company that operated one of the largest fleets of privately owned fighter jets. The company trained U.S. military pilots and managed defense contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Jared previously stated that the model saved taxpayers billions. Isaacman lays out NASA direction and answers questions in Senate hearing During nearly three hours of testimony, Jared described how he would reshape NASA around a “mission‑first” structure, with an emphasis on efficiency and stronger coordination with commercial partners. He supported Artemis II and III, which rely on the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft, but questioned their timelines and expenses. Jared asked, “Why is it taking us so long, and why is it costing us so much to go to the Moon?” He called for a data‑based review of these systems to determine whether they remain viable for long‑term space exploration. Jared said he would support extending the International Space Station through 2030, while increasing research output through public‑private research agreements. He also opposed a proposal from the White House to cut 50% of NASA’s science budget and 20% of its overall budget starting in 2026. Senators questioned Jared about NASA’s strategic reasons for potentially pushing toward Mars., and he responded that he would operate with transparency and would pursue a dual‑track strategy for the Moon and Mars. Senator Ed Markey asked Jared about his relationship with Elon Musk. Jared replied that they were not close and said he did not share NASA plans with Elon. He confirmed that he was interviewed only by Trump when offered the job. But when Markey asked whether Elon was present during that interview, Jared refused to directly answer.

The company, which already trades in Shanghai, priced its Hong Kong shares at HK$131.50 apiece, the top of its marketed range, but still 22% below its latest Shanghai closing price. More than 300 investors took part in the offering. Shares of Seres surged in gray market trading on Tuesday, showing early demand ahead of the formal listing. This IPO adds more fuel to a city already having its strongest year for new equity deals since 2021. In total, $51 billion has been raised through public offerings in 2025 so far. For Seres, listing in Hong Kong is about expanding its footprint outside the mainland, especially after the company’s stock posted a stunning 1,600% gain over five years in Shanghai. Seres climbs from minivans to luxury EVs with Huawei’s help Seres was founded in 1986, back when it only made springs and shock absorbers. Over time, it moved into motorcycles, then minivans. Now, the company sells one of China’s top-selling luxury electric cars, the Aito M9, thanks to its partnership with Huawei Technologies. The Aito brand, developed jointly by both companies, has helped Seres jump ahead of legacy brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz in the Chinese luxury auto segment. Even though the company has underperformed this year compared to the local benchmark, that didn’t stop its long-term rally.Seres has been listed in Shanghai since 2016, but this year’s intense price competition has weighed on all Chinese automakers. “Seres has achieved success through its Aito brand in partnership with Huawei,” said Eugene Hsiao, head of China equity strategy at Macquarie Capital. “Investors looking for a premium auto proxy may be interested in the shares.” The company’s Hong Kong move comes just as the city tries to rebuild its status as a financial hub. Paul Chan, Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary, said this week that the local economy grew 3.8% in the third quarter, driven by stronger exports, higher domestic spending, and surging tourism numbers. That puts Hong Kong on track to hit its 2% to 3% full-year growth goal. On top of that, its wealth management sector is growing fast; private banking assets have jumped 15%, and Bloomberg Intelligence expects the city to overtake Switzerland this year as the world’s largest cross-border finance hub. Beijing price war hits EV sales, BYD takes a hit While Seres enjoys the spotlight, the rest of China’s electric vehicle sector is feeling pressure. The Beijing government has called on automakers to stop cutting prices to win sales. The push is aimed at ending the aggressive competition that’s been squeezing margins and raising concerns about declining product quality. The impact of this crackdown has been limited so far, but many expect the industry to rush sales through the end of the year, before tax incentives and subsidies start getting phased out. One company that’s already feeling the pinch is BYD, the biggest EV maker in the world. In its latest earnings report, BYD said third-quarter net income dropped 33%, falling to 7.82 billion yuan or about $1.1 billion. It also reported that total revenue fell 3% to 194.98 billion yuan, far short of estimates for 216 billion yuan. Vehicle deliveries dropped 1.8% from the previous year, with the company shipping 1.15 million new energy vehicles, including both fully electric and hybrid models. In contrast, rivals like Geely Automobile and Chongqing Changan posted large sales gains in the same quarter, up 96% and 84%, respectively. Both are stepping up their push into EVs while the market remains volatile. But even with that momentum, the industry remains shaky. China’s leaders are still trying to rein in the ongoing price war, worried that a race to the bottom could ruin the long-term health of the domestic auto market.

SHIB is recognized by Grayscale Investments and FTSE Russell as… pic.twitter.com/8jBpKkP9PL — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) November 2, 2025 Inclusion Signals Institutional Recognition Based on reports, the FTSE–Grayscale framework was launched in 2023 to sort crypto assets into clearer groups for investors. The framework covers five niches, and Grayscale’s latest report lists SHIB among the assets that meet the SEC’s Generic Listing Standards (GLS) criteria. The GLS rules, approved in September, let exchanges list crypto ETPs under a set of generic requirements rather than seeking individual sign-off for each token. That opens the door for more straightforward pathways to spot ETPs, although a token still needs an effective registration statement to trade as an ETF. Shiba Inu Among A Few Eligible Tokens Reports have disclosed that at least 11 cryptocurrencies across four sectors meet the GLS thresholds. In the Currencies sector, XRP, Litecoin, Stellar, and Bitcoin Cash are named. Smart contract platforms that qualify include Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche. Chainlink stands alone in Utilities & Services. In consumer and culture, only Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are recognized. Solana and Litecoin ETFs are already trading in the US, while Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash are still awaiting approvals. Valour Inc. has issued a SEK-denominated ETP tied to SHIB in Europe, and asset manager T. Rowe Price has mentioned SHIB as a candidate for inclusion in its Active Crypto ETF, but SHIB does not yet have a standalone spot ETF filing in the US.

54043351,620422,1762308053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54043351.jpeg,Bitcoin Loses $105K Level As SSR Signals Fresh Capital Ready To Deploy – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-loses-105k-level-ssr-signals-fresh-capital/,"Bitcoin has broken below the $105,000 level, deepening market fears as selling pressure accelerates across the crypto landscape. The sharp move lower comes at a time when confidence is wavering, volatility is rising, and traders are bracing for possible further downside. Yet beneath the surface, a key on-chain indicator suggests that a critical liquidity shift may be approaching — one that has historically preceded major rebounds. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) has now fallen back into the same low zone seen just before Bitcoin’s earlier recovery this year, hovering around the 13–14 range. This indicator measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s market capitalization and the total market cap of stablecoins, offering insight into the amount of “dry powder” available on the sidelines. When SSR declines, it typically signals that stablecoin liquidity — potential buying power — is increasing relative to Bitcoin’s valuation. Historically, this zone has often acted as a turning point, where capital quietly builds before re-entering risk assets. SSR Signals Hidden Liquidity — But With a Cycle-End Twist According to CryptoQuant analyst Woominkyu, the behavior of the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) offers critical insight into Bitcoin’s current position in the market cycle. When SSR drops, stablecoin liquidity — effectively the dormant “buying power” sitting on the sidelines — rises. This dynamic often precedes market recovery phases, as capital quietly prepares to rotate into Bitcoin. Conversely, when SSR climbs, it typically reflects liquidity being deployed already, aligning with overheated markets and distribution periods. Right now, SSR is retesting its yearly lows while Bitcoin trades near $104,000 and attempts to consolidate. This alignment has historically marked powerful turning points, suggesting that fresh capital could be preparing to re-enter. In previous cycles, similar setups preceded relief rallies and, in some cases, explosive upside continuation. That makes the current environment particularly intriguing, even as bearish sentiment dominates and fear spreads across the market. However, Woominkyu highlights a key nuance that traders cannot ignore: each SSR rebound zone in recent cycles has shown diminishing strength. In other words, while liquidity is accumulating, the magnitude of these signals appears to be weakening. This could mean that crypto’s liquidity engine — once driven heavily by rapid stablecoin expansion and speculative inflows — is slowing. If this interpretation holds, Bitcoin may still see a recovery rally from current levels, potentially even one final push toward euphoric highs. But it also suggests the possibility that the market is gradually transitioning into a new phase — one defined less by aggressive liquidity cycles and more by maturing capital flows, institutional participation, and slower reflexive momentum. Bitcoin Slides Toward Key Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin’s price action continues to deteriorate as market volatility rises, with BTC now trading around $104,000 after breaking below the $105,000 level. On the 8-hour chart, the structure remains fragile, and the series of lower highs and lower lows highlights persistent bearish momentum. Attempts to reclaim the $110,000 region earlier in the week were rejected near the cluster of moving averages, reinforcing that sellers currently control the market. The highlighted consolidation zones around $109,000–$111,000 and $106,000–$108,000 have flipped into resistance, providing a visual map of where supply continues to overwhelm demand. Now, price is approaching a critical demand zone near $102,000–$103,000. This area has historically attracted dip buyers, but if it fails, Bitcoin may be exposed to a deeper retrace toward psychological support closer to $100,000. Volume has noticeably increased on recent red candles, suggesting panic-driven selling and forced liquidations rather than calm distribution. Meanwhile, moving averages are starting to roll over, and the 50-EMA has turned sharply lower, signaling momentum loss. Bulls need to defend this current support region to avoid further downside acceleration. Until Bitcoin reclaims at least the $108,000–$110,000 zone, the market bias leans bearish, and traders should expect volatility and caution as price compresses near these key levels.

According to Rector, the rapid integration of blockchain technology into global finance positions XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to capture a share of an emerging market potentially valued at up to $30 trillion within the next decade. Tokenization: The Next Major Financial Shift Rector highlights the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), such as real estate, commodities, debt instruments, and private equity, as one of the most significant developments in modern finance. He cites estimates from Ripple and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) suggesting that the total value of tokenized assets could reach between $12 trillion and $23 trillion by 2033, with a conservative upper range of $20 to $30 trillion moving on-chain over the next ten years. He explains that XRP’s future growth will likely depend less on retail speculation and more on its ability to bridge tokenized assets, support liquidity, and provide settlement mechanisms for institutional-grade financial activity. In his view, this represents the next evolution beyond XRP’s established role in cross-border payments. The Role of Regulation and Institutional DeFi A key factor in Rector’s forecast is the introduction of clearer regulations, referred to broadly as the upcoming Clarity Act , that would define how digital assets interact with traditional finance. Rector argues that such legislation would give institutions the confidence to adopt decentralized finance (DeFi) frameworks built on the XRP Ledger. He believes large-scale institutional DeFi has yet to emerge on XRPL because most holders have focused on accumulation rather than liquidity provision. However, once clearer compliance standards are in place, he expects financial institutions to develop regulated DeFi products and settlement tools, leading to a gradual but steady expansion in XRP utility through 2030 and beyond. Ripple’s Expanding Institutional Network Rector also points to Ripple’s recent acquisitions and partnerships as critical steps toward positioning XRPL within global financial infrastructure. He notes that Ripple Prime (formerly Hidden Road) will enable institutional clients to move post-trade settlement onto XRPL, potentially handling very large transaction volumes at minimal cost.

Other collaborations, including with Securitize, BlackRock, and VanEck, involve projects to tokenize money market funds and allow on-chain redemption through Ripple’s dollar-backed token, RLUSD. Rector interprets these moves as groundwork for real-world utility beyond retail trading. Liquidity Is the True Value Driver Rector cautions that tokenizing assets alone will not automatically raise XRP’s price. Instead, he emphasizes that liquidity and transactional demand will determine the token’s value. He notes that the combination of Ripple’s partnerships, XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX), and new automated market maker (AMM) features could enable the ledger to handle large-scale institutional liquidity. In his view, the long-term outlook for XRP depends on whether these liquidity flows materialize and whether XRPL continues to attract major financial players seeking compliant, low-cost settlement solutions. While Rector describes his projections as optimistic, he maintains that the convergence of regulation, infrastructure, and institutional integration could position XRP at the core of a new era of financial tokenization. He concludes that XRP’s success will ultimately depend not on speculation, but on how effectively it serves as the liquidity engine of a tokenized global economy.

At the same time, Chinese AI bots outperformed ChatGPT in crypto trading, reinforcing confidence in AI-driven strategies.

Australia’s new cryptocurrency laws, which promote investor protection and transparency, further boost market confidence. Expanding ETF access boosts demand worldwide and institutional inflows, making this launch favorable for BTC. To support Bitcoin’s price rebound from its recent decline to $102,250, analysts anticipate fresh buying pressure. China’s Budget AI Bots Beat ChatGPT in Crypto Trading In a worldwide cryptocurrency trading competition , two inexpensive Chinese AI models, QWEN3 MAX and DeepSeek beat OpenAI’s ChatGPT demonstrating China’s increasing advantage in AI-driven finance. Each bot in the Alpha Arena-hosted event received $10,000 to trade on the Hyperliquid market on its own. Whereas all other models including ChatGPT concluded with losses ChatGPT losing 57% of its capital QWEN3 stood out with a 7.5% profit ($751).

The confidence about AI’s potential to improve market forecasts was strengthened by its winning strategy. Due to QWEN3’s long BTC attitude, which showed a strong belief in a price rebound, this achievement increased investor confidence in BTC. As AI-powered trading tools become more widely used, traders see opportunities for more intelligent, data-driven Bitcoin tactics, which will boost the market sentiment for the cryptocurrency. BitMine Buys $294M in Ethereum as Tom Lee Predicts Major Bitcoin Rally BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) has increased its ETH holdings to 3.39 million ETH or roughly 2.8% of the total supply, by adding $294 million to its treasury. Under the direction of Chairman Tom Lee, the company now has more than $12.5 billion in Ethereum, making it the second-largest cryptocurrency treasury after Strategy’s $69 billion in BTC. Lee is still very hopeful, even though ETH fell 6.9% to $3,617 and BMNR’s stock fell 25% in a single month. Strong fundamentals, such as increased stablecoin volume and record on-chain revenues, indicate an impending rise, he told CNBC. Lee sees the recent $19 billion liquidation as “a market reset” and predicts that Bitcoin could reach $150K–$200K and Ethereum could reach $7K by year’s end. The market’s mood has improved due to BitMine’s aggressive ETH acquisition and Lee’s optimistic outlook, which has strengthened belief in the ability of both Ethereum and Bitcoin to rebound. Bitcoin Technical Forecast: $97K in Focus as Bears Dominate Bitcoin price prediction is bearish as BTC trades near $101,300, extending losses after a decisive breakdown from a symmetrical triangle that’s guided price action since mid-September. The failed rebound from $106,300 confirms resistance, while both the 50-EMA and 200-EMA slope downward, signaling continued bearish control. A three black crows pattern highlights strong selling momentum, and the RSI near 28, though oversold, shows no bullish divergence yet, implying weakness may persist. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key support rests at $100,400, with the next downside target at $97,600, where historical buying interest could emerge. A daily close below $100K would confirm a deeper correction, while a recovery above $103,500 could spark a short-term bounce toward $106K–$108K. For now, the path of least resistance remains lower, but this extended selloff may mark a late-stage shakeout, potentially paving the way for Bitcoin’s next major rebound as long-term accumulation quietly builds.

Bitcoin slid to a five-month low on Wednesday, briefly breaking below $100,000 as investors reacted to the prolonged US government shutdown and fresh signs of slowing growth. Ether led losses, falling more than 12% to $3,179. The drop leaves Bitcoin near its weakest level since May, roughly 20% below its early October peak above $126,000, as enthusiasm fades and liquidity thins. Liquidations accelerated. About $2.09b of crypto positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours, CoinGlass data showed, including $1.68b from longs. The tally remains far below October’s record $19b washout, yet traders have turned more cautious since that rout. Markus Thielen, CEO at 10X Research, told Cryptonews: “The issue today isn’t excessive futures leverage, it’s the long spot holders stepping back.” “Powell’s signal that a December rate cut is not guaranteed removed a key pillar of confidence just as mega-whale selling began to outweigh whale buying, a dynamic that emerged immediately after the FOMC meeting,” he added.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their largest one-day declines since Oct. 10, with tech weakness setting the tone as the market reassessed stretched valuations tied to the artificial intelligence boom. Executives at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs cautioned on bubble risks after a series of all-time highs for the S&P 500. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon earlier warned of a significant correction risk over the next six months to two years, citing geopolitical tensions. Longest-Ever US Shutdown Freezes Data as Markets Search for Direction The government shutdown, driven by a congressional impasse, is nearing a record at 36 days. With official statistics on hold, investors are leaning on private gauges such as the ADP National Employment Report due Wednesday, while parsing Federal Reserve commentary for policy signals in a data vacuum. Sector moves were stark. Tech shares fell 2.3% to pace declines across the S&P 500’s 11 sectors, while financials led the gainers. Futures later pointed to a softer US open, adding to nerves. Asia followed Wall Street lower. MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.8%, dragged by a 4.1% slide in South Korea’s Kospi. US e-mini futures eased another 0.4% after the S&P 500’s 1.2% drop overnight. Flows remained selective, with buyers stepping back on strength and bids thinning on weakness. Traders Cite Trump’s China Rhetoric, Liquidity Strains, and Fed Doubts as Pressure Builds Macro cross-currents kept pressure on crypto. Traders cited President Trump’s ongoing trade fights, including a recent threat against China that preceded October’s record liquidations, along with worries about liquidity and fading confidence in a possible third US rate cut in 2025. Still, there are potential upside markers. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, said Bitcoin could test $115,000 to $120,000 if macro signals improve, while Ether may rebound toward $4,200 on layer-2 scaling gains and a firmer DeFi backdrop. “Key catalysts to monitor include upcoming Fed rate decisions, ongoing ETF inflows, and regulatory clarity from global bodies such as the SEC, all of which could accelerate mainstream integration,” he said. “That said, geopolitical tensions and unexpected inflation prints remain key downside risks that could trigger abrupt pullbacks.” The post Asia Market Open: Crypto Markets Tumble, Bitcoin Slides to 5-Month Low as Global Stocks Flash Red appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-05 02:58:53

Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Loses Key Support Amid 8% Drop, Risks Major Correction To This Level Bitcoin Plunges To Physiological Barrier On Tuesday, Bitcoin saw a 9% drop from its weekly opening, dropping to the $100,000 area for the first time in months. The flagship crypto has been trading above $105,000 since late June, hovering between $108,000-$120,000 over the past four months. During the early October correction, BTC’s price briefly deviated below these crucial levels, hitting a three-month low of $102,000 before recovering. Since then, the cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim the mid-zone of its local range, falling to the $106,000-$108,000 area multiple times in the daily timeframe. As the price retested the $100,000 level, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted that Bitcoin has now broken below its 10th of October low, which was “the last major level before the $98K low from the Middle Eastern war fud back in June.” Analyst Ted Pillows highlighted that BTC has two massive liquidity clusters on the longer timeframes. Per the chart, the first cluster sits around the $90,000 level, which also coincides with an open CME Gap from Q2. Meanwhile, the second cluster sits around the all-time high area at $126,000. “Given that the market is looking weak now, a dump to fill the CME gap before reversal could happen,” the market watcher warned. However, Ali Martinez suggested that a 5%-11% rebound from the current area is possible. The chart shows that Bitcoin has been trading between $101,300-$124,000 price range since May, bouncing from the lower boundary each time it was retested. If BTC holds this area, it could surge to at least $106,500 or $112,000, the analyst asserted. BTC Retests 50-Week EMA Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC had reached the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The analyst explained that after closing below the 21-week EMA, Bitcoin was deviating below its range lows for the fifth consecutive week. The 21-week EMA has served as crucial support during pullbacks since late Q2. However, it was lost amid the recent market volatility. Last week, multiple analysts warned that closing above this level was crucial to turn it back into support and prevent a larger pullback. Per the Tuesday post, the 50-week EMA, sitting around the $100,000 level, “would probably only get tagged on confirmed breakdown from $108k,” meaning that the flagship crypto will need to close the week above this level to maintain its current price range. Similarly, Crypto Bullet pointed out that the 50-week MA retest was “the moment of truth” for BTC. Notably, the cryptocurrency has retested this indicator three times this cycle, marking the bottom of each corrective phase and the start of a new rally to a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Is Crypto ‘Boring’ Now? Bitwise CEO Says The Market Is Changing The market watcher warned that losing this level would mean “it’s lights out” for the flagship cryptocurrency. However, a rebound from this area could set the stage for a price recovery and a potential bullish rally in late Q4. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $100,356, a 6% decline in the daily timeframe.

Reports have suggested that co-founder Charles Hoskinson blamed the Cardano community for the blockchain’s DeFi stagnation. However, Hoskinson has now publicly refuted those claims, calling them a misrepresentation of his comments. In a fiery response on the social media platform X, he criticized crypto media outlets for twisting his words, noting that he never blamed users for ADA’s DeFi struggles but instead highlighted a participation imbalance within the ecosystem. Hoskinson’s Clarification: I Never Blamed Anyone In a video on X addressing the controversy, Hoskinson expressed frustration at what he described as “fundamentally dishonest” reporting. He stated that the headlines portraying him as blaming Cardano users for the network’s DeFi woes were entirely false. He insisted that his initial comments were meant to identify a structural issue within the ecosystem. The structural issue is based on the difference between those who stake ADA and those who engage in decentralized finance, and it is not to assign blame. According to Hoskinson, over 1.3 million users actively participate in Cardano staking, while far fewer engage with the blockchain’s DeFi protocols. This disparity, he argued, explains why ADA’s total value locked (TVL) is modest compared to other networks . He estimated that if the same level of engagement were mirrored on both sides, Cardano’s DeFi TVL could range between $5 billion and $10 billion. Hoskinson pointed out that this observation was not a criticism of the community but an analytical point about user behavior and ecosystem growth patterns. “There’s not a single person in the Cardano ecosystem who I am blaming for our DeFi situation,” he said. A Closer Look At Cardano’s DeFi Sector Hoskinson went on to explain that the problem lies not in lack of community engagement, but in the absence of proportional participation between governance and DeFi. According to him, Cardano’s large user base and strong staking participation prove the network’s health and scale, and this contradicts claims that it only has between 10,000 and 50,000 active users. The real challenge, he said, is understanding why the majority of participants who stake their ADA are not also contributing to DeFi liquidity. These challenges could be factors such as slippage, fees, user experience, yields, and education. Despite the controversy surrounding the misinterpretation of Hoskinson’s remarks, there is still an underlying issue of Cardano’s sluggish DeFi growth. On-chain data still shows that ADA’s daily active addresses have dropped from over 32,000 in mid-October to around 24,000 in early November. According to data from DeFiLlama , the Cardano network currently has the 26th largest TVL, with only about $243.2 million in 60 protocols. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.5417, down by 6.2% in the past 24 hours. However, the decline is not limited to Cardano alone, as the entire crypto market is currently down by 4% in the past 24-hour timeframe.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano network|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson|defillama|Total Value Locked|TVL,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-05 03:00:47

The sell-off hit fast and without hesitation, wiping gains from some of the most crowded trades in global equity markets. Japan’s Nikkei 225 plunged below the 50,000 mark on Wednesday for the first time in weeks. The Topix index also weakened, sliding 2.27% as large-cap technology backers like SoftBank absorbed heavy losses. Advantest, which supplies semiconductor testing equipment, lost more than 8%, and Renesas Electronics dropped 5.48%, adding to downside pressure on Japan’s tech-heavy indices. Asia tech and chip stocks saw heavy selling across markets South Korea’s Kospi fell 5.97%, with chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix posting losses of over 7% and 8% respectively. The small-cap Kosdaq shed 5.39%. The downturn also hit Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, which slipped 2%. In China, Alibaba dropped more than 3%, and Tencent was over 2% lower. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index lost 1.36%, and the CSI 300 in mainland China plunged by 0.9%. Even Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 saw declines, falling 0.77%, though its exposure to AI-linked firms is smaller than the others. Investors traced the Asian sell-off to losses in major U.S. AI and cloud names the previous evening. Palantir fell about 8%, despite reporting stronger-than-expected third-quarter results. Oracle slid 4%, AMD dropped nearly 4%, and Nvidia and Amazon both moved lower as well. Traders focused less on earnings beats and more on how stretched valuations have become. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio has climbed above 23, its highest level since 2000, raising concern that the market may be replaying the conditions leading up to the dot-com bubble. Meanwhile, Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, disclosed new short positions through Scion Asset Management targeting Nvidia and Palantir. Both companies have become key symbols of the AI boom and its sky-high valuations. The sell-off was also influenced by cautious remarks from Wall Street. CEOs of both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley said this week that investors should prepare for a potential market drawdown over the next two years. Their comments landed at the same time that Capital Group suggested the “everything rally” had run too far. Andrew Jackson, head of Japanese equity strategy at Ortus Advisors, summed up the day’s sentiment clearly: “Finally, a sell-off hits the tape as the ‘everything rally’ takes a breather after comments from the CEOs, and Capital Group that markets were due a correction.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Business|Softbank,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-05 03:31:35

If approved by the US derivatives regulator, Gemini would compete with dominant players, including Kalshi and Polymarket. Sources noted that the billionaire brothers-run crypto platform has discussed launching products “as soon as possible.” Gemini Awaits US Regulatory Approval, Which May Take Months or Years The exchange, in May, applied to create a designated contract market with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Gemini is considering listing prediction-based derivatives contracts on the platform. However, the US derivatives regulator can take months or years to approve a new exchange. Additionally, the recent government shutdown could further delay the approval process. Gemini closed its initial public offering (IPO) in September, pulling in $425 million, marking one of the strongest debuts for a digital asset platform. At the time, the New York-based firm teased this new venture in a filing that it intended to launch event contracts for “economic, financial, political and sports forecasts.” Prediction Markets See Massive Demand The move comes amid growing demand for prediction markets, driven by platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket showing record volume growth . Kalshi is already registered with the US CFTC, while Polymarket is considering reopening in the US soon. An analyst from investment bank Needham told Bloomberg that Gemini’s plans would expand beyond its current offerings, as prediction markets offer an “attractive opportunity.” Elsewhere, platforms like CME Group have made their own moves into the arena. Meanwhile, crypto exchange behemoth Coinbase said in a recent earnings call that it would expand into event contracts to broaden its offerings as part of “Everything Exchange.” Further, Robinhood said that it is launching a prediction market where users can trade on the outcome of games. James Newman, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer at Chiliz, the sports blockchain, told Cryptonews at the time that the launch is the latest signal of a growing adoption of blockchain-based fan engagement platforms. “This is indicative of a trend we’re seeing where more and more industry players are taking notice of the prediction market space,” Newman told Cryptonews. “The challenge is how we can integrate into prediction markets sustainably, while balancing innovation with responsibility.” The post Gemini Exchange Prepares for Prediction Market Contracts Launch: Bloomberg appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Gemini|Winklevoss Twins,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-05 03:57:24

Related Reading: CryptoQuant Head Reveals Reason Behind Bearish Bitcoin Trend The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Active Addresses,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on a given network every day. When the value of this metric rises, it means more users are making transfers on the blockchain. Such a trend implies trading interest in the cryptocurrency may be on the rise. On the other hand, the indicator witnessing a decline suggests investors may be shifting their attention elsewhere as they are reducing their transaction activity on the network. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator for Ethereum, the largest of the altcoins, over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Active Addresses metric was at a high of 589,000 in late July. Since then, activity on the network has gone downhill, with there now being 488,000 addresses making transactions, around 17% lower than the peak. “Fewer users interacting on ETH indicates weaker on-chain demand, a pattern seen in past bear-market phases,” explained Sentora. Solana, another prominent altcoin, has been showing a similar trend. How the monthly value of the Active Addresses has changed for SOL over the last few years | Source: Sentora on X From the chart, it’s clear that the monthly version of the Active Addresses witnessed a notable decline for SOL during Q3 2025. More specifically, active users on the blockchain dropped by about 30% in this period. “Solana has been the out-performer this cycle, but momentum is cooling,” noted the analytics firm. Memecoins have been hit hard in the recent market downturn, and the same has held true for their on-chain activity. Dogecoin, the largest meme-based token, has only witnessed a slight decrease in Active Addresses, but Pepe has gone through a drawdown of 85%. “This drop shows how quickly speculative user bases can evaporate,” said Sentora.

The metric is still relatively strong compared to other cryptocurrency-related indicators, but a change in direction is apparent. With the crash in prices and downturn in on-chain activity, is the altcoin sector entering a season of winter? “It’s too early to tell but the current data echoes past cycles,” noted Sentora. “We are already 6+ months into an altcoin slowdown, with winter signs popping up.” Ethereum Price Ethereum has plunged alongside the rest of the market during the past day as its price has retraced to $3,300.

The integration marks a pivotal expansion of Ripple’s enterprise capabilities, positioning it more firmly within the institutional blockchain space. Palisade’s infrastructure will now form a key component of Ripple’s next-generation custody and payments architecture, providing a secure and scalable framework for digital asset management. The acquisition consolidates Ripple’s control over the digital asset lifecycle, bringing together three essential elements of its ecosystem: XRP for real-time settlement, RLUSD for institutional liquidity, and Palisade’s technology for multi-asset custody. This comprehensive integration extends Ripple’s reach beyond traditional fintech tools into foundational infrastructure for institutional blockchain operations. BREAKING: @Ripple just acquired @palisadeinc and this is massive. Palisade’s wallet-as-a-service platform will now power Ripple’s next-generation custody and payments infrastructure, unlocking enterprise-grade wallet tech for institutions across the globe. The same team.… pic.twitter.com/nI4Y9wjaHJ — Pumpius (@pumpius) November 4, 2025 Institutional Impact and Ecosystem Integration According to crypto commentator Pumpius, the move signifies more than an expansion of Ripple’s service suite; it represents a strategic evolution toward full-stack financial architecture. Palisade’s technology, now operating within Ripple’s global network, provides enterprises with the tools to manage, transfer, and safeguard digital assets with heightened efficiency and regulatory readiness. The addition of secure wallet infrastructure enhances Ripple’s ability to serve institutions seeking compliant, reliable, and interoperable blockchain solutions. By leveraging Palisade’s proven expertise, Ripple can now offer enterprises an end-to-end solution covering custody, liquidity, and settlement — all under one ecosystem. The alignment between XRP , RLUSD, and Palisade demonstrates a deliberate strategy to unify payment execution and asset management under a single operational model.

Commenting on the development, a user described it as a “strategic win,” highlighting how the combination of XRP, RLUSD, and Palisade strengthens Ripple’s hold on enterprise infrastructure. The integration signals Ripple’s intent to be not merely a participant but a central architect of institutional adoption in the digital asset sector. The acquisition also reinforces Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand its suite of products beyond payments, focusing on end-to-end financial solutions that meet institutional standards of custody and settlement. With this move, Ripple demonstrates an ambition to define the operational backbone for the next phase of blockchain finance — one in which speed , security, and scalability converge to support global financial systems.

Cynthia Lummis says the Clarity Act will create the first full legal system for crypto stablecoins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lummis-calls-clarity-act-the-biggest-in-u-s/,"Sen. Cynthia Lummis stated that the Clarity Act is the largest crypto law in U.S. history, providing clear rules for the crypto industry after years of uncertainty. The Wyoming Republican said she and her staff work every day to garner support from both parties because the bill could significantly impact the U.S. financial system. Lummis works with both parties to get support from Senate Democrats for the bill Senator Lummis said her staff meets with Democrats almost every day to discuss the bill, as lawmakers who don’t understand or agree on the text before the committee vote may cause problems in the full Senate. She explained that the process is very different from the GENIUS Act because it covers most crypto assets , not just stablecoins, so lawmakers from both parties needed to agree on every part fully. Executives from major crypto companies also met with lawmakers multiple times in recent weeks, but disagreements over timing and leaked documents regarding the regulation of DeFi slowed down the talks. Senators also disliked how some lobbyists criticized the Democratic draft instead of working quietly to find solutions. But despite this feedback, Lummis says the bill is moving in the right direction because her team is working on building understanding and trust between Republicans and Democrats. She wants the Banking Committee to vote on the bill before the end of the year so that the full Senate can begin debates early next year. The Clarity Act could change how the U.S. regulates digital assets The Clarity Act will provide guidance to crypto companies on their responsibilities and limitations, enabling them to operate safely and protect both investors and consumers. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will serve as supervisors under the new ACT. Senator Lummis even praised SEC Chair Paul Atkins for using flexible programs so that crypto companies continue providing services even when the bill is still in progress. The bill also addresses the ongoing tension between traditional banks and crypto companies, as community banks have long complained that crypto exchanges offer rewards that they cannot match. The Senator informed the banks that the Clarity Act would enable them to provide custody and management services for digital assets legally, allowing them to compete fairly with crypto firms. Lummis also talked about the recent Custodia Bank case and said she was very disappointed that a federal appeals court ruled that the Wyoming-based bank could not access the Federal Reserve’s full payment system. She, however, noted that the Fed made a significant step forward when it created a “skinny master account” for special-purpose banks, as it demonstrates that they are beginning to recognize the importance of digital assets in the financial system. On related development, Lummis posted on X reiterating her comments that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is the only solution to offset the United States’ national debt. She noted , “I truly believe the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is the only solution to offset our national debt. I applaud @POTUS and his administration for embracing the SBR, and I look forward to getting it done.” Highlighting the federal government’s staggering $38 trillion debt , Lummis argues that Bitcoin’s scarcity, immutability, and storability render it an optimal long-term asset for the nation’s resilience. She recently stated that, according to the best available modeling, if Bitcoin is held for two decades, America can reduce its national debt by half.

He made the remarks in a televised interview, saying China “is getting into it very big right now,” and arguing that the US must act to keep its edge. US Vs China Crypto Stash According to figures cited in recent reports, the US is estimated to hold about 198,012 BTC , valued at roughly $21.32 billion, while China is estimated to hold about 194,000 BTC, worth about $20.89 billion. Those numbers are widely shared in media accounts, but analysts stress they are estimates based on available on-chain research and public data. The true picture may include private holdings that are not visible on public ledgers. Trump’s comments framed the issue as part of a wider contest over new finance and tech tools. He said the US should not cede ground, and he warned that overly heavy rules at home could push business and jobs elsewhere. Based on reports, his tone blends economic concern with national strategy. Trump doubles down on digital dominance: “I only care about one thing — will the U.S. be number one in $crypto ? China is getting into it very big.” pic.twitter.com/M5cG5KsqYk — COACHTY (@TheRealTRTalks) November 3, 2025 Mining And Supply Links Reports have disclosed that Chinese manufacturers of mining equipment — names such as Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT — remain central to the global supply chain. Some of those firms have moved to set up manufacturing footholds outside of China, including in the US, a step that industry watchers say is meant to blunt trade pressure and meet demand from large buyers. This shows that influence over hardware and infrastructure can matter as much as who holds coins. Market players have been watching a mix of signals. Policy talk in Washington, trade moves, and public comments by political leaders have all fed into market swings. The Challenge Of Estimating Crypto Holdings Price moves can be sharp when headlines raise the prospect of tariffs, export controls, or broad new rules. That volatility affects investors and companies that are planning long-term projects. Analysts who study crypto holdings note that country-level estimates often rely on tracing flows and known addresses tied to exchanges or firms. Based on reports, those methods give useful hints but leave gaps. Some assets are held by private investors, trusts, or entities that do not disclose their positions. As a result, any single figure for national holdings should be treated with care.

Aljarrah noted that each XRP can be divided into 1 million units called drops, meaning that even if XRP were to reach $10,000 , a single drop would still be worth only one cent. According to him, this ensures XRP remains practical for everyday transactions regardless of price. Aljarrah linked this comment to his article, “How XRP Will Consolidate the Global Financial System,” in which he outlined why he believes XRP is positioned to become the backbone of global payments . He described XRP not as a speculative asset but as “the foundation of a multi-hundred-trillion-dollar financial framework” developing through infrastructure, adoption, and necessity. Each #XRP can be divided into 1 million units, known as drops. This means that even if one XRP were to reach $10,000, a single drop would still be worth just one cent. This ensures scalability at any price level and guarantees that XRP can be used for everyday transactions. https://t.co/MJmdrKewD3 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 2, 2025 Building Global Payment Corridors In his article, Aljarrah credited Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity product as the real driver of XRP’s growth. He explained that traditional payment systems like SWIFT rely on nostro-vostro accounts that trap capital and slow settlement. Ripple’s solution uses XRP as a bridge asset , enabling banks to convert and transfer value across currencies. These corridors, already active across several regions, form a growing network of regulated payment routes. Aljarrah emphasized that each new corridor increases the amount of XRP required for liquidity. As Ripple’s infrastructure expands, the token’s role in replacing legacy systems strengthens. He sees this as a steady transition, saying the system is evolving “corridor by corridor,” not through speculation but through operational progress. Regulation and Institutional Adoption A major section of his article focused on regulatory clarity. Aljarrah argued that Ripple’s legal victories and global licensing give XRP a distinct advantage. He referenced frameworks such as the EU’s MiCA and Abu Dhabi’s FSRA, stating that XRP already aligns with their standards. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that a U.S. federal judge’s ruling that XRP is not a security provides the legal foundation for banks and institutions to adopt it. This clarity, he said, is what enables sovereign and institutional integration. By securing compliance in multiple jurisdictions, Ripple positions XRP as a legally recognized settlement asset suitable for large-scale financial use. XRP’s Scalability Advantage Aljarrah’s post highlights the technical foundation that allows XRP to scale effectively at any valuation. By being divisible into 1 million drops, XRP can maintain transactional efficiency even if its value increases dramatically . This model ensures that the asset remains usable for both micro and institutional transactions, a critical feature for a global settlement layer. In Aljarrah’s view, such scalability is what enables XRP to realistically function as the core infrastructure of the evolving financial system.

Dogecoin barely budged at first, then slipped with the broader market. By early Nov. 5, DOGE traded lower on the day near $0.16, while Bitcoin and Ether were also in the red as risk appetite weakened. Speculators instead latched on to DOGE-1, a meme token that shares a name with a planned CubeSat mission funded in Dogecoin. Musk’s post was a reply to Dogecoin community member DogeDesigner (@cb_doge), who wrote “No Highs, No Lows, Only DOGE” and shared a 2021 screenshot of Musk’s promise that SpaceX would “put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon.” It’s time — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 3, 2025 On-Chain Data Shows Veteran Memecoin Trader Moving Into DOGE-1 Lookonchain noted DOGE-1 jumped about 300% after Musk’s post. But the token was last down 17.4% to $0.73 later in the session. On-chain traces pointed to one notable buyer. The trader known as god.sol, also called Mitch, spent roughly 100 SOL, about $14,800, to acquire 16.27m DOGE-1, according to wallet records. The wallet, which shows prior realized profits of about $2.8m from memecoin trading, has a history of short holding periods and rapid rotations. The DOGE-1 mission itself remains a real project. Developed by Geometric Energy Corporation and financed in Dogecoin, the payload is set to fly on a SpaceX Falcon 9. Filings indicate a late 2025 target after several delays. Elon Musk( @elonmusk ) once again said ""It's time"" to send Dogecoin to the moon. The memecoin DOGE-1 has since surged ~300%. Smart trader ""god.sol aka Mitch"", who previously profited $2.8M trading memecoins, just spent 100 $SOL ($14.8K) to buy 16.27M DOGE-1.… pic.twitter.com/tIGDuVCT6K — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 5, 2025 Musk Rekindles Dogecoin Talk, but Traders Are Sticking to Caution Musk’s Dogecoin connection runs deep. He has called it “the people’s crypto,” joked about a Martian currency, and once changed his X bio to “Former CEO of Dogecoin.” In 2021 his posts helped fuel a surge that pushed DOGE’s market value above $80b at the peak. This time, the backdrop looks tougher. Crypto opened November on the back foot after a bruising October, with liquidations and thin liquidity muting the familiar Musk effect. Bitcoin tumbled about 10% on Wednesday. Traders described a risk-off tape where rallies fade quickly and dips attract only selective bids. Rotation Into Safer Tokens Explains Diverging Moves Across the Meme Complex Macro also weighed on sentiment. Markets parsed hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve and a shaky global tone, a mix that has drained momentum from high beta tokens and pushed rotation into larger caps when volatility spikes. That rotation helps explain the split reaction. Dogecoin tracked the majors lower, while DOGE-1 became a short-lived target for momentum flows before profit taking knocked it back. The fast round trip fits a market laser focused on liquidity and exit lanes. For now, the trade is tactical. If broader conditions stabilize, meme pockets can reawaken quickly, especially when Musk posts. But with Bitcoin defending key levels and funding resetting across derivatives, many desks prefer tight risk and quick hands. As ever with meme tokens, the key tells sit on-chain. Watch wallets like god.sol for adds or exits, monitor exchange liquidity for DOGE and DOGE-1 and track SpaceX chatter that could revive speculative interest around the mission’s timeline.

Meanwhile, semiconductor firm Sequans sold 30% of its Bitcoin holdings to repay half of its debt, and called it a strategic move to strengthen its balance sheet. The decision sent Sequans’ shares tumbling more than 16%. Bitcoin Loses Steam Bitcoin’s price seems to be losing momentum after weeks of consolidation, which casts some doubt on the more optimistic predictions that it could surge toward $250,000 before the end of 2025. The world’s leading crypto slipped to a four-month low of around $100,800 this week, and analysts are now divided on whether the current cycle still has enough strength to produce another major rally before the year is out—or if the next real uptrend will only arrive in 2026. ShapeShift analyst Houston Morgan said in an interview that he does not expect Bitcoin to climb higher than $125,000 in 2025, which falls just short of the $126,000 all-time high that was reached on Oct. 4. Morgan suggested that Bitcoin’s recent price action has become too dependent on political headlines, particularly those tied to US President Donald Trump, and that a genuine bull run may not resume until the asset decouples from such macro correlations. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) At the same time, data from Bitfinex shows deepening selling pressure as long-term Bitcoin holders continue to distribute their coins. The exchange’s analysts pointed out that this ongoing outflow reflects “broader signs of exhaustion” in the market and warned that unless Bitcoin can recover above $116,000 soon, the price could face more downside into the end of the year. Historical trends show that when prices stagnate for prolonged periods, sentiment deteriorates and forced selling becomes more common—a risk amplified by the current market mood. In fact, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell sharply to 21 out of 100 on Tuesday, signaling “Extreme Fear” among traders. At press time, the score stood at 23, which also falls under the ‘Extreme Fear’ category. Crypto Fear and Greed Index Despite the gloom, some people in the industry still hold out hope for an explosive finish to the year. BitMine chair Tom Lee and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes reiterated on the Bankless podcast that they believe Bitcoin can still hit between $200,000 and $250,000 before 2026. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz , however, warned that such a move will require “the planets to align.” Looking ahead, analysts are still split on 2026’s outlook. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan expects it to be a strong recovery year, while Andrew Lokenauth predicts a bear market similar to previous mid-cycle declines. Veteran trader Peter Brandt also recently added to the cautious tone by suggesting Bitcoin could even revisit levels as low as $60,000. Sequans Sells Bitcoin to Cut Debt Shares of semiconductor firm Sequans tumbled more than 16% on Tuesday after the company sold 30% of its Bitcoin holdings to redeem half of its convertible debt. The move was described by the company as a “strategic asset reallocation,” and it raised questions about its long-term Bitcoin accumulation plans, which previously aimed to reach 100,000 BTC over the next five years. Sequans CEO Georges Karam said that the sale was a tactical decision made to strengthen the company’s balance sheet amid challenging market conditions. “Our Bitcoin treasury strategy and our deep conviction in Bitcoin remain unchanged,” Karam stated. “This transaction was a tactical decision aimed at unlocking shareholder value given current market conditions.” He added that the sale “strengthens our financial foundation and removes certain debt covenant constraints,” which allows Sequans to focus on strategic initiatives while still maintaining Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. The sale reduced Sequans’ Bitcoin holdings from 3,234 BTC to 2,264 BTC, with proceeds used to cut its debt from $189 million to $94.5 million. However, investors still reacted negatively to the announcement, sending shares in Sequans (SQNS) down 16.6% to $5.92. The stock is now down close to 89% from its 2025 high of $53.90. Sequans share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) The sell-off now adds to growing skepticism surrounding corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies, especially for firms without strong underlying financials. While many companies initially saw share prices surge after announcing Bitcoin purchases, a number have since declined sharply as enthusiasm cooled. Sequans’ recent sale was first identified by crypto analysts last week after a 2,264 BTC transfer was spotted on-chain. The company now ranks as the 33rd largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, slipping four places since its previous acquisition in mid-July.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-05 05:30:00

After losing support above $4,000, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now showing more signs of a breakdown that could trigger a spiral. Multiple analysts have already shared where they see the Ethereum price going, and we take a look at two that look at both ends of the spectrum. A Recovery And Then A Crash Crypto analyst Melikatrader highlighted an important structure that the Ethereum price has formed recently, and that is a clear structure of recovery. This comes after the cryptocurrency completed a liquidity sweep around $3,700, which is referred to as a “Hunting.” Related Reading: Head And Shoulders Pattern Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $100,000 Now, with the liquidity sweep completed at this level, the analyst believes that this creates a potential base that could see the Ethereum price correct upwards. Amid this, the altcoin has also seen some consolidation between $3,700 and $3,800, making this range an important area of interest. If bulls are able to claim and hold this level, then it could put Ethereum on the path of another uptrend. It would put an end to the accumulation trend and kickstart another bullish run. Such a run would send the Ethereum price into the next supply zone, which lies at $4,080-$4,180, before seeing any major downward correction. Despite expecting the price to climb, the crypto analyst also highlights the fact that Ethereum is still flashing a bearish market structure. With the ascending trendline on the move, the price is expected to hit resistance around $4,100. If bears are able to successfully reject the price from this level, then the Ethereum price is expected to crash back below $4,000. Analyst Calls The Top For Ethereum Price While many in the space believe the current downtrend is only temporary, crypto analyst CRYPTO Damus believes that this could actually be the cycle top. In the post on X, he compares the current trend to that of the 2018 and 2021 cycle tops using the weekly chart. Related Reading: Here’s What Happens To The Dogecoin Price After The Consolidation Phase Ends Damus points out that there are similarities between the previous cycle tops and that the Ethereum price is currently following a similar playbook. This comes after consistent green candles, followed by red candles on the weekly chart, ending in a bear market. The analyst explains that it is possible that this time could be different, given the deviations in the market cycles so far. However, if it is the same trend from the last two bull cycles, that would mean that the bull run is over for Ethereum, and investors should brace for a crash.

The economic think tank claimed that Reeves will require an additional £50 billion ($65 billion) in her upcoming budget to stabilize the nation’s finances and cushion against future shocks. It warned that with interest costs rising sharply, the chancellor must run primary surpluses to keep debt from rising. Chancellor Rachel Reeves suggested she may increase taxes The last time the UK ran a primary surplus was in 2001–02, under Tony Blair, a period when the economy was growing much more rapidly and debt was only 30% of GDP. Public debt is now perilously close to 100% of GDP. In her pre-budget speech, Chancellor Reeves hinted at significant tax increases to patch up the UK’s strained finances. She did not necessarily certify that they would stick to the promises made in Labour’s election manifesto, not to hike income tax , VAT, or national insurance. When journalists asked if the pledge still held, she deflected, saying that she was “setting the context for Budget.” She added, “The choices I make in this Budget, this month, will be focused on getting inflation falling and creating the conditions for interest rate cuts to support economic growth and improve the cost of living.” She also vowed to craft a budget for growth rooted in fairness, targeting NHS backlogs, high debt levels, and the rising cost of living. However, many analysts and government leaders believed her address did not provide much clarity. The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, branded the speech “one long waffle bomb,” arguing it left businesses completely in the dark. Reeves has yet to clarify which taxes could rise, though she seemed to rule out resigning if income tax were increased. When asked on LBC whether breaking the pledge should prompt her to step down, she replied, “I’m not going to walk away because the situation is difficult.” David Aikman says the next shock may result in a rise in debt David Aikman, director of NIESR, has warned that the UK’s public debt path is becoming “unsustainable,” and could surpass 100% of GDP unless stronger measures are introduced. Despite a £40 billion($52 billion) tax rise in her first budget, Reeves now faces an even bleaker debt picture, with much of the deterioration blamed on weaker productivity forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. NIESR expects the OBR to put the fiscal gap at between £20 billion and £30 billion, a smaller figure than its own, but argues that Reeves should go further and create a £30 billion ($39 billion) safety buffer. Aikman explained that the next economic shock would almost certainly push debt even higher, stressing the need to start reducing the debt ratio now to preserve the government’s ability to respond to future crises and invest effectively. The think tank also anticipates GDP to rise 1.5% in 2025 and 1.2% next year, though it noted that Reeves’s efforts to rein in the deficit could limit economic growth. Additionally, it forecasts that the Bank of England will make two 0.25% rate reductions next year, as inflation remains over 3% through next spring before returning to the 2% goal. Meanwhile, other influential think tanks have published proposals on how taxes can be made fairer and economic growth improved without worsening the budget shortage. They argued that outmoded and unequal tax policies have led to restricted investment and production. Additionally, they recommended the removal of stamp duty, a reduction in VAT, and an increase in the goods subject to levy. Moreover, they are encouraging the merging of income tax and national insurance.

In a brief video, the Cardano founder said media outlets misrepresented his prior comments about participation patterns across the ecosystem, stressing that his point was a structural “mismatch” between who stakes and governs versus who takes part in DeFi—not blame. “I never once blamed anyone from the Cardano ecosystem for the DeFi [woes],” Hoskinson said , naming The Crypto Basic as an example of outlets whose framing he called fundamentally inaccurate. “I’m sorry crypto media that you guys are and you just want clickbait headlines. You guys have to cut this the […] out.” He added that there is “not a single person in the Cardano ecosystem who I am blaming for our DeFi situation right now.” Cardano’s DeFi Gap Is A Participation Mismatch Hoskinson’s core claim is numerical and directional rather than accusatory. He argued there is a demonstrable divergence between Cardano’s high participation in staking and governance and its lower participation in DeFi protocols, which depresses total value locked. “I pointed out in a video that there is a mismatch between the people who participate in staking and governance and the people who participate in DeFi. And if there was proportionality there… our TVL would be at least five to 10 billion,” he said. He characterized the recent headlines as “materially wrong and factually wrong” because they attributed intent—“blaming users”—that he explicitly disavowed. The founder anchored his point in a specific user count comparison. Some third-party measurements, he said, “are asserting that Cardano has only 10,000 to 50,000 actual users when there’s 1.3 million who are using staking.” For Hoskinson, that delta underscores that Cardano “has a large population, a large wallet base, and a lot of users as evidenced by the enormous level of participation in both governance and staking,” even if those participants are not currently “deploying to the other side of the aisle, to the TVL side, to the DeFi side.” He repeatedly emphasized that diagnosing the participation gap is an ecosystem responsibility, not a morality play. “I’m not blaming them for not participating,” he said. “Never once said it’s their fault and they’re bad people and they’ve done something wrong.” Instead, he called for a frank community conversation about the drivers behind users’ choices. “It could be slippage. It could be fees. It could be user experience. It could be yields. It could be safety concerns. It could be education. There could be 150,000 different reasons for that. But we as an ecosystem have to have that discussion.” The remedy, in his view, is a coordinated governance agenda rather than a media narrative. He urged Cardano stakeholders to treat the participation gap as a 2026 workstream and to fund targeted initiatives through delegated authority. “We as an ecosystem have to ask why that mismatch exists and how can we correct that mismatch… as a 2026 governance agenda, and get some delegated authority funding and effort to correct that,” he said. If the proportionality problem were addressed, Hoskinson argued, “that alone can get our TVL up 5 billion to 10 billion,” potentially placing Cardano “in the top ranks of TVL, the top five to top 10.” The dispute originated, he said, when media took a narrow, data-driven observation about where Cardano users allocate capital and translated it into a blame narrative. “People say something very specific, very targeted, and then it gets misinterpreted, and then everybody judges you based upon the headlines,” he said. “I’m not going to allow the crypto media to go ahead and put words in my mouth.” He reiterated the same point multiple times for emphasis: “I did not blame the Cardano ecosystem. I did not blame the Cardano users for anything. I was very careful, guarded, and specific in the things that I said.” Hoskinson coupled the clarification with a broader critique of crypto media practices. “If you continue to broadcast, you’re lying to people,” he said, adding, “I expect that from the crypto media because they are scum. They do lie. Everything’s sensational. Everything’s clickbait.” He framed his intervention as a corrective to prevent a headline cycle from hardening into accepted fact: “The record has been corrected.” Beyond media criticism, the practical substance of his message focused on mobilizing existing users rather than conjuring new ones. “We have the users. We have the capital,” he said. “For some reason, those users with their capital are not participating in DeFi.” While he acknowledged having personal “suspicions” and hearing “frustrations” from ecosystem participants, he stopped short of diagnosing root causes, instead calling for an open, data-first process to “systematically chip away” at barriers that deter stakers and governance participants from crossing into DeFi activity. Across the video, Hoskinson’s throughline never deviated: the issue is proportional participation by an already large user base. “There is a mismatch between the people participating in staking and governance—of which it’s seven figures over a million people—and the people participating in DeFi ,” he said. “We have to get to the bottom of that mismatch as an ecosystem… But I’m not blaming the Cardano users for that mismatch. I’m not saying it’s their fault. I’m not saying that they did something wrong.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.538.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-05 06:00:23

Its outlook points to growing trader interest in early-stage tokens showing real progress before the broader rally starts. One of those projects is Noomez ($NNZ) , now in Stage 2 of its presale and drawing massive attention for its transparent structure and fast-paced growth among retail investors. The Next Crypto Bull Run: Why Analysts See Early Signals Forming Market sentiment is slowly turning positive after months of sideways trading. Bitcoin and Ethereum are stabilizing near key levels, and analysts like Claude believe this steady base could set the stage for the next major rally. Institutional inflows through ETFs have increased, stablecoin supply on exchanges is rising, and retail participation is starting to recover. These are early signs of renewed risk appetite. Historically, such conditions have preceded major breakouts by several months. According to on-chain data, accumulation wallets are growing, and long-term holders are adding positions instead of selling. When asked when is the next crypto bull run expected , most analysts point to early to mid-2026 as a likely start, assuming macro stability and consistent liquidity inflows. If these trends hold, early presales like Noomez ($NNZ) may already be positioned to capture the first wave of speculative energy before the market’s next expansion phase. Why Presales Often Lead Market Recoveries Before Major Coins Rally Early-Stage Advantage Presales tend to outperform in the months leading up to a market recovery. Smaller tokens attract buyers who want higher potential returns before liquidity floods back into large caps. During these quiet phases, traders look for transparent projects with visible progress and fair tokenomics. This early accumulation phase often builds the foundation for explosive growth once confidence returns. Community Accumulation Before each major market cycle, retail communities gather around low-cap projects that feel accessible and exciting. Unlike top-tier coins, presales allow small investors to participate from the ground up. This mix of accessibility and community hype has historically triggered the first sparks of every bull market. Historical Trend Analysts reviewing past cycles note that presales from 2020 and 2021 delivered massive gains months before Bitcoin’s all-time highs. The next crypto bull run prediction follows a similar pattern, with structured presales like Noomez ($NNZ) positioned to benefit first as optimism builds. Noomez Emerges as the Standout Presale Heading Into 2026 Among the few presales showing real traction, Noomez ($NNZ) is an impressive project for its structured, transparent approach. The project is built on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) and operates with a fixed supply of 280 billion tokens , removing the risk of hidden inflation. Its presale spans 28 stages , starting at around $0.00001 and ending near $0.0028 , offering early participants clear price visibility. Each stage closes within seven days or once sold out, and any unsold tokens are permanently burned , tightening supply as the project progresses. The live Noom Gauge visually tracks presale completion, showing investors each milestone in real time. With Stage 2 now active and filling fast, the project has already attracted insane retail attention. Its mix of visible progress, deflationary design, and fair entry pricing has positioned Noomez as one of the strongest early contenders ahead of the next market recovery. How Noomez Could Set the Tone for the Next Retail Wave The growing interest in Noomez ($NNZ) isn’t just about price; it’s about structure. The project rewards participation through its Noom Recruit referral program, giving both the referrer and the new buyer a 10% token bonus on every confirmed purchase. This system is fully automated, tracked in real time on the dashboard, and backed by a fixed 5% allocation, ensuring the total supply remains intact. Beyond referrals, the project will open staking pools after launch, allowing holders to earn rewards for locking tokens between 30 and 365 days . What’s next for Noomez: Post-launch, Noom Engine to distribute partner tokens automatically. Vault events at Stage 14 and 28 with major token rewards and burns. Full liquidity lock at launch for verifiable security. Together, these steps demonstrate that Noomez is a carefully planned system designed to sustain value, attract retail attention, and potentially lead the first wave of the next bull run.

Key Takeaways: Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race, becoming the city’s first Muslim mayor. Polymarket traders accurately predicted Mamdani’s victory, continuing their strong record in major political forecasts. Mamdani’s cautious stance on crypto signals tighter oversight and consumer protection for New York’s digital asset sector. According to unofficial results from the city’s Board of Elections , Mamdani secured just over 50% of the vote, defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who captured around 40%. The Associated Press officially called the race for Mamdani on Wednesday. Polymarket Traders Score Again After Predicting Mamdani’s NYC Mayoral Win Data from Polymarket, the blockchain-based prediction platform, showed that 92% of traders bet on a Mamdani victory before election day , including a $1 million position that pushed implied odds close to certainty. The result adds to Polymarket’s growing track record after correctly forecasting both Donald Trump’s presidential victory last year and New York’s Democratic mayoral primary in June. Mamdani, 34, a Ugandan-born, Queens-raised progressive and self-described democratic socialist, becomes New York’s first Muslim mayor. His campaign centered on affordability, including tackling rent, childcare, and public service funding through higher taxes on the city’s wealthiest 1%. While Mamdani’s victory represents a breakthrough for New York’s progressive movement, it also raises questions for the city’s crypto and fintech sectors. Unlike previous mayors, including Eric Adams and Cuomo, who voiced open support for digital assets, Mamdani’s stance has been cautious. As a member of the State Assembly, he co-sponsored Bill A7389C, seeking a moratorium on proof-of-work crypto mining using on-site power generation, citing environmental and community concerns. “When crypto companies collapse, it isn’t the rich who suffer,” Mamdani said in 2023 after the Terra and FTX meltdowns. “It’s small investors from low-income and communities of color.” Andrew Cuomo could’ve spent the years since his resignation making amends and helping New Yorkers. Instead he hounded the women who spoke out about his serial harassment, fought to keep his book deal millions…and advised a foreign crypto exchange that broke US law. pic.twitter.com/kBxkNGdrgA — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) April 2, 2025 The mayor-elect has consistently emphasized consumer protection and transparency over industry expansion. His comments align with New York Attorney General Letitia James’ push for stronger oversight, including the proposed crypto transaction tax projected to generate over $150 million annually. Crypto Titans Clash with Mamdani as Billionaires Fund Anti-Mayor Campaigns Despite limited direct engagement with crypto issues during his campaign, Mamdani’s critical remarks toward the industry, and toward Cuomo’s advisory role for crypto exchange OKX, which later paid $500 million in penalties, drew backlash from prominent tech and finance figures. Gemini’s Tyler Winklevoss and Sequoia’s Shaun Maguire were among those who criticized Mamdani, while billionaire Bill Ackman poured funds into anti-Mamdani PACs. Mamdani brushed off their opposition with characteristic wit. “He’s spending more money against me than I would even tax him.” As Mamdani prepares to take office on January 1, all eyes are on how his administration will navigate the balance between progressive policymaking and the city’s influential financial and crypto sectors.

The debut of U.S. spot price ETFs was a big deal for the cryptocurrency market at large, so much so that it incited a major bull run in 2024. Looking back today, the bets on crypto ETFs were right. BTC and ETH ETFs have become a big part of the crypto market, controlling over $175 billion in assets in just one year. In this article, we will explain in detail why crypto ETFs are such a big deal and the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, among other things. Why Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Are in the Spotlight The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs was met with intense euphoria among crypto investors because it was believed they would essentially bridge crypto to Wall Street and bring about institutional and regulatory acceptance. How ETFs Bridge Traditional Finance and Crypto First of all, an ETF or exchange-traded fund is not unique to the cryptocurrency space. It started from traditional finance and has been used for decades to invest in mutual funds and a basket of different assets. Now, one of the roadblocks that decelerated the adoption of crypto by traditional investors is the complexity in managing cryptocurrencies. Not many investors know how or want to deal with the friction and risks of buying and storing BTC and other crypto assets. The listing of crypto ETFs basically waived off these concerns, bringing down crypto to an instrument that most TradFi investors are already familiar with. 2024–2025 ETF Boom — Spot Approvals and Market Impact The success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw a rush in the applications for other crypto assets, including SOL, XRP, DOGE, and other major altcoins. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has even made it easier for more crypto assets to gain ETF approval, and much faster. In September, the regulator approved generic listing standards for spot crypto ETFs, removing the need for lengthy case-by-case approvals. That implies more crypto assets could make it to Wall Street, which would translate to more capital inflows from institutions, financial advisors, and retail investors in TradiFi. Institutional Demand for Regulated Crypto Exposure Spot ETFs widen the door to institutional demand for underlying crypto assets. As stated earlier, financial institutions, wealth managers, hedge funds, and retail investors are more likely to engage with crypto through these ETFs because it is a familiar product. There are other benefits that come with it, such as ease of access and regulatory comfort attached to it. Institutions that wouldn’t dabble in the crypto market directly are now doing so through ETFs. In August, top universities Harvard and Brown revealed holding $116 million and $13 million in Bitcoin through ETFs. What Is a Bitcoin ETF? A Bitcoin ETF is simply an investment fund that tracks the value of Bitcoin. It’s traded on traditional stock exchanges, similar to how Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and shares of other companies are traded. Investors who buy into Bitcoin ETFs indirectly gain exposure to the largest crypto without needing to worry about securing the asset. All that is handled by the fund issuer and the custodian firm designated for that particular ETF. How Bitcoin ETFs Work There are two categories of Bitcoin ETFs: spot and futures, and each works differently. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are based on the real-time market price of BTC. That means the issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, etc., would need to buy and hold the actual Bitcoin. So, in this sense, owning a share of a spot Bitcoin ETF is similar to holding a fraction of BTC, without needing to deal with the actual coin. The Bitcoin backing the shares is usually held with a regulated third-party custodian, not the fund issuer itself. For instance, Coinbase and Anchorage are the custodians of BlackRock’s Bitcoins. When there is high demand for the spot ETF shares on the stock exchange, the issuers like BlackRock buy more BTC to create new shares. And when investors want to sell the ETF shares back to the fund, the issuer will need to sell a corresponding amount of BTC to redeem the shares. On the other hand, a futures-based ETF is based on futures contracts that bet on the future price of Bitcoin. They are usually traded on a regulated exchange like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Spot vs Futures Bitcoin ETFs Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer the closest exposure to the largest cryptocurrency than the futures-based products because they directly invest and track spot BTC. With the futures ETFs, there may be price deviations due to market dynamics. And since issuers only hold futures contracts, there is usually no need for a custodian. Spot Bitcoin ETFs generally have a lower expense ratio, i.e., operating expenses, compared to futures ETFs. For instance, BlackRock’s IBIT, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, has a 0.25% expense ratio, whereas ProShares’s BITO, the largest futures Bitcoin ETF, charges 0.95%. Key Issuers of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Below are five of the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF issuers by assets under management, as of October 2025. 1. BlackRock BlackRock is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF and also the world’s largest asset manager. The firm’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) currently has $64.3 billion in cumulative total net flow and more than $89 billion in AUM. 2. Fidelity Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) is currently the second-largest, with $12.6 billion in cumulative total net flow and $22.84 billion in AUM. 3. Grayscale Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) comes third, with over $19 billion in AUM. It has a negative total net flow of -$24.6 billion. 4. Ark & 21Shares ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) takes the fourth place, with $2.11 billion in net flow and $4.75 billion in assets under management. 5. Bitwise Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) is the fifth-largest spot Bitcoin ETF, with up to $2.39 billion in net flow and $4.59 billion in AUM. Underlying Asset Exposure — BTC Holdings and Custody As mentioned earlier, spot Bitcoin ETFs are intended to closely reflect the price of the underlying BTC. As such, the issuers have to purchase or sell BTC from their treasury to issue or redeem ETF shares in response to demand. The responsibility of managing or securing the holdings is usually outsourced to a third-party digital asset custodian. Interestingly, Coinbase happens to be the primary custodian for most of the spot Bitcoin ETFs trading in the U.S. market. Bitcoin ETF as “Digital Gold” Investment Vehicle Bitcoin ETFs brought about another channel for investors to buy into BTC, a store of value, similar to how people are also trading gold ETFs. The “digital gold” narrative for Bitcoin is based on shared characteristics of scarcity with gold. The supply of gold is limited by the amount that can be mined from the earth. Likewise, Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins. No more than that number of BTC will ever exist. What Is an Ethereum ETF? An Ethereum ETF tracks the value of Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency. Buying shares of an Ethereum ETF gives investors indirect exposure to ETH. How Ethereum ETFs Differ from Bitcoin ETFs The first and obvious difference between Ethereum ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs is the underlying asset. The former is based on BTC, while the latter is based on ETH. BTC is primarily perceived as a store of value due to its fixed supply. ETH, meanwhile, functions as programmable money for smart contracts and DeFi. Also, BTC is based on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, while ETH is based on Proof-of-Stake (PoS). That means, Ethereum ETFs can passively earn investors staking rewards, but Bitcoin ETFs cannot. So, investors can only make a profit from capital appreciation with BTC ETFs, while ETH ETFs can offer both capital appreciation and staking rewards. Spot vs Futures Ethereum ETFs Ethereum spot and futures ETFs work the same way as their respective Bitcoin counterparts. The only difference is in the underlying asset. Spot Ethereum ETFs directly invest in the actual Ether, while the futures ETFs invest in Ether futures contracts. Holding the spot ETF shares gives you direct exposure to the price of ETH, while the futures allow you to speculate on the price. Ethereum’s Unique Features — Smart Contracts and Staking Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is a Turing-complete blockchain, which means it can, in theory, execute any arbitrary computational instruction or program. That is primarily the reason Ethereum is able to support smart contracts, DeFi, and dApp protocols. However, Ethereum wasn’t initially designed to support staking. It started out as a PoW blockchain, before finally transitioning to PoS after a major upgrade in 2022 dubbed “ The Merge .” That transition led to a chain split, birthing the current Ethereum network, which is secured by validators staking their coins, rather than miners. ETH ETFs and Staking Yield — A Layer of Passive Income Since Ethereum now allows staking, it means Ethereum ETF issuers like Grayscale and VanEck can stake their holdings to earn staking rewards. As of October, the annualized staking yield for Ethereum was 2.87%. The issuers can choose to distribute the yield to shareholders as a form of cash dividend or distribution, similar to how bond or stock ETFs distribute income. Another way they can manage the staking reward is by reinvesting it into the fund. When that happens, the funds are added back to holdings and so restaked to earn more returns. Also, putting back the reward to the funds could lead to a higher Net Asset Value (NAV) per share, which is good for investors. Earlier in October, Grayscale rolled out staking for its spot Ethereum ETPs, covering Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. Approved and Pending ETH ETF Issuers Here are the five biggest spot Ethereum issuers based on assets under management as of October. 1. BlackRock BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) is currently the largest spot Ethereum ETF, with more than $1.2 billion in traded volume and $15.68 billion in AUM. 2. Grayscale Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) comes second with $117.9 million in traded volume and $4 billion in AUM. 3. Fidelity Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) comes third with $110.5 million in traded volume and $2.97 billion in AUM. 4. Bitwise Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) is in fourth place with $22.4 million in traded volume and $473 million in AUM. 5. VanEck VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV) comes fifth with only $11 million in traded volume and $254 million in AUM.

Market data shows these ETFs now account for billions in daily trading volume. Bitcoin ETF Trading Volume and Liquidity The listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market has led to a substantial increase in overall Bitcoin trading volumes, especially concentrated around U.S. market hours. Market data from SoSoValue shows that more than $4 billion in volume was traded in a single day (October 24th), with $90.60 million inflow. The chart shows that the trading volume has been on a steady climb since the first batch was approved. More precisely, in just 18 months after launching, spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume. As of October, the number sits at $1.14 trillion. Cumulative Spot Bitcoin ETF Volumes. Source: Newhedge All U.S. Bitcoin ETFs now account for $149.96 billion worth of BTC in assets under management, according to market data from SoSoValue. That is equivalent to about 6.78% of the BTC market cap. Ethereum ETF Market Uptake Since Launch Ethereum ETFs have also had a similar trajectory to Bitcoin ETFs. However, the volume is lower than that of Bitcoin. Data shows Ethereum ETFs have only amassed $271.7 billion in cumulative trading volume since their inception a year ago. Clearly, the volume for Ethereum ETFs is not as strong as Bitcoin’s, but they seem quite correlated. Cumulative Spot Ethereum ETF Volumes. Source: TheBlock In the period that Bitcoin ETFs recorded $4 billion in daily traded volume, the Ethereum ETFs only brought in $1.82 billion in trading volume. So far, spot Ethereum ETFs account for $26.39 billion in assets under management, which is equivalent to 5.55% of ETH’s current market cap. Price Correlation — ETH Following BTC or Decoupling? The price of BTC has gone from $46,600 to the current price of $113,911 since the ETFs launched. That represents a whopping 144% increase. Similarly, the ETH price increased from $3,439 to the current price of $4,124, but has seen a slight gain of 19% so far. But despite the diverging returns, there has been, in fact, a strong price correlation between BTC and ETH. It didn’t just start. The correlation can be traced back a couple of years and has continued to persist even with the launch of the spot ETFs. BTC and ETH price trends. Source: TradingView Institutional Allocation Trends There’s no question that Bitcoin is the darling digital asset of most institutions. This is already evident in the volume of ETFs traded, including spot coins accumulated by publicly traded companies and other institutional players alike. However, some are beginning to ease up on diversifying into Ether as an income-producing growth asset, so to speak. With Ether, institutions make gains from both price appreciation and staking rewards. That is giving firms more reason to diversify or hold Ether as well in their portfolio. Over the past months, more companies have come out to accumulate ETH as a digital asset treasury, a move that started with BTC back in 2020. Staking: The Game-Changer for Ethereum ETFs Not just for the ETFs, staking is one feature that has given companies more reason to hold ETH. But it’s not all that rosy. How ETH ETFs Integrate or Exclude Staking Rewards Ethereum ETFs’ staking has yet to kick into high gear. In fact, most issuers are yet to enable staking, other than Grayscale, which only began supporting it in early October. According to the filing, Grayscale intends to stake its ETH through its custodian, Coinbase, and third-party staking providers. Grayscale said it will distribute Ether (or cash from the sale of Ether) received as yield to investors under certain conditions from time to time. Each of Grayscale’s ETH-based ETFs , i.e., Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (Ticker: ETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (Ticker: ETHE), uses a different reward approach. ETHE will pay distributions for those who like cash flow, while ETH will roll staking returns into NAV to compound the reward. Other issuers are likely to use either of these approaches to integrate staking rewards into their funds. SEC Considerations and Custodial Complexity Staking has always been met with fierce resistance from the SEC. Many issuers had to tell the regulator they wouldn’t participate in staking as part of the conditions for approval. “Neither the trust, nor the sponsor, nor the custodian, nor any other person associated with the trust will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the trust’s ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings,” a 2024 Cboe filing reads. However, more issuers began to push for it again after the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance said in May that certain staking activities don’t constitute an offering of securities. Besides, ETFs require daily liquidity for investor redemptions, but staked ETH is subject to an unbonding period. That could add an extra layer of complexity in the management of the assets. Impact on ETF Yield, Taxation, and Total Return Staking can boost the total return of Ethereum ETFs, but it can also pose a big challenge with respect to taxation. Funds that allow staking will return approximately 3% annualized yield to investors, which is an added benefit to the price growth of the potential increase in the price of ETH, compared to funds that don’t support it. But staking could be treated as an income-making activity, and that can affect how Ethereum ETFs are classified and taxed. At any point, the issuer, like Grayscale, gains “dominion and control” over the staking rewards; that is, once they are able to sell or transfer the rewards, they become ordinary income and are taxable. Regulatory Landscape and Compliance SEC Approval Timeline for BTC ETFs 2013: Winklevoss brothers filed the first-ever application for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. 2017: The SEC rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust proposal, citing concerns about market manipulation. 2018: The SEC rejected Winklevoss’s second application for similar reasons. 2021: The first Bitcoin futures ETF, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), began trading. October 2021: Grayscale applied to convert its Bitcoin trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF. 2022: The SEC turned down Grayscale’s request and that of other issuers, including Fidelity. June 2022: Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC for denying its application. May 2023: Cathie Wood’s ARK Investments filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF. June 2023: BlackRock followed suit, with other asset issuers like Fidelity. August 2023: U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit unanimously ruled in favor of Grayscale, stating the SEC’s denial was “arbitrary and capricious.” January 10, 2024: The SEC approved the applications to list and trade shares for 11 spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs). January 11: The approved spot Bitcoin ETFs officially began trading on U.S. exchanges. Custody and Transparency Requirements As we already know, traditional ETFs are heavily regulated, and so, crypto ETFs are not left out. They are subjected to similar requirements. The SEC requires that the underlying cryptocurrency of spot ETFs be held by a regulated and trusted custodian, which is why most of the issuers had to always state their designated primary custodian in their applications. For transparency sake, the SEC also requires that crypto ETF issuers file annual audited financial statements on Form 10-K and quarterly financials on Form 10-Q, similar to a traditional public company. Jurisdictional Differences (U.S., Canada, EU, Asia) The regulatory approaches to BTC and ETH ETFs vary across global financial hubs, especially the U.S., Canada, the EU, and Asia. The U.S. regulators were previously known to be hostile towards cryptocurrencies. It wasn’t until after the Trump administration stepped in that policies eased up for crypto and stablecoins, with the U.S. government even announcing a national Bitcoin reserve. Canada happened to be more friendly to crypto. Canada was reportedly the first country to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF under a clear regulatory environment. The EU has also begun to clear up regulatory hurdles for crypto, with the recent passing of the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which provides a unified framework for crypto-asset markets across member states. Regions like Hong Kong also put Asia on the map. Hong Kong actually sped up approval of Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs in a bid to beat the U.S. to it. However, places like China continue to maintain a strict stance with bans on cryptocurrency trading and mining. Which ETF Fits Your Investment Strategy? Investors buy BTC and ETH as a store of value or passive income, and that also influences their choices regarding investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin ETF — Conservative Store-of-Value Exposure Bitcoin is perceived as a store of value due to its fixed supply, which creates a sense of scarcity. And based on the economics of scarcity, many people purchase Bitcoin and its related funds as a good long-term investment and even as a hedge against inflation. Ethereum ETF — Tech-Driven Growth and Yield Ether would appeal more to people who believe in Ethereum’s future as a decentralized computing platform and the concept of Web3 at large. ETH and its funds are better assets to hold, especially for investors looking to earn passively from their idle stash. Balanced Portfolio Approach — BTC/ETH Split Strategies A general rule of thumb with investing is never to put all your eggs in one basket. Balancing your portfolio would mean having both BTC and ETH exposure. Although BTC and ETH have a high correlation, some analyses suggest that a 70/30 or 50/50 allocation might offer a better risk-adjusted return profile than an exclusive holding of either. Key Considerations: Risk, Liquidity, Time Horizon Liquidity, risk, and time horizon, including fees, are some of the factors to consider when deciding which ETF to hold. BTC is often less volatile than ETH. Also, as we explained earlier, Bitcoin ETFs have more liquidity than Ethereum ETFs. Management fees can be higher or lower depending on the issuers and underlying assets. The Future of Crypto ETFs Multi-Asset and Index Crypto ETFs As the crypto ETF market matures, we could begin to see more entrants of multi-asset and index-based crypto ETFs. These funds offer investors exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies, rather than a single asset. Something equivalent to the S&P 500. Integration of DeFi and On-Chain Yield Products The integration of on-chain activities like staking and DeFi lending into the ETF structure is another key trend that could play out in the future as a way to enhance income features of the funds. But that could be met with heavy regulation. Institutional Entrants and Expanding Access Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are only a year into the U.S. market. It’s not far-fetched to expect more institutional exposure to BTC and ETH through the funds, which means more capital flow and demand for the assets.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides|BTC|ETH,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-05 06:02:21

54049429,621365,1762326016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54049429.jpeg,SBF Seeks New Trial: Lawyers Argue FTX’s Founder Was ‘Blocked’ From Fair Defense,https://bitcoinist.com/sbf-lawyers-ftx-founder-blocked-fair-defense/,"Ahead of his Tuesday appeal hearing, Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have claimed that the FTX co-founder was unfairly convicted and was not allowed to tell his full story during his 2023 trial. FTX Founder Claims Unfair Trial On Tuesday, the legal team of FTX’s co-founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), is set to appeal his fraud conviction and 25-year sentence in a hearing at the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. According to a Bloomberg report , SBF’s lawyers have claimed in a previously filed brief that the crypto-exchange founder was wrongly convicted and was never given a fair chance to present his defense due to pressure from the media and prosecutors. “Sam Bankman-Fried was never presumed innocent,” his lawyers reportedly argued in the brief. “He was presumed guilty — before he was even charged.” In November 2023, Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven criminal counts, including fraud and conspiracy. He was later sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay back $11 billion to FTX customers. His legal team, led by Alexandra Shapiro, is allegedly focusing on New York Judge Lewis Kaplan, whom they have accused of “repeatedly putting a thumb on the scale to help the government and thwart the defense.” The former crypto executive’s lawyers argued in the appeal brief that the judge had “pressed jurors into a quick verdict,” and “continually ridiculed Bankman-Fried, criticized his demeanor, and signaled his disbelief of Bankman-Fried’s testimony.” They highlighted an instance when Judge Kaplan allegedly called SBF’s testimony that he did not run FTX’s sister hedge fund, Alameda Research, after stepping down as CEO, “a joke.” As a result, Shapiro is expected to argue that the New York judge “wrongly blocked Bankman-Fried from telling the jury that FTX had enough assets to repay exchange customers.” Meanwhile, prosecutors were allowed to claim SBF had stolen billions of dollars from customers, which “forced” FTX into bankruptcy. Since the trial, the disgraced crypto exchange’s co-founder has maintained that the company was never insolvent. As reported by Bitcoinist, Bankman-Fried recently shared a document arguing that “the crisis FTX faced in November 2022 was a liquidity crisis, i.e., a sudden shortage of cash,” affirming that the company “was never bankrupt.” His team is also expected to claim that Bankman-Fried didn’t intend to defraud customers, that prosecutors were given an unfair advantage, and that Judge Kaplan should have allowed him to testify that he had followed FTX lawyers “in good faith.” New Trial Or Presidential Pardon? Bankman-Fried’s appeal has requested a new trial with a different judge. Nonetheless, the former CEO has also been seeking a pardon from US President Donald Trump as part of his attempts for an early release. After January’s pardon of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, SBF’s parents have reportedly been exploring paths to secure a presidential pardon for their son. In a February interview , he slammed the Biden Administration, arguing that his conviction was part of the previous government’s crackdown on the industry. He also shared his hope that President Trump would grant him a pardon. Notably, on October 23, the White House announced that Trump had pardoned Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, two years after pleading guilty. The White House’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, affirmed that the US President had “exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.” Since then, speculation about a potential pardon to Bankman-Fried has increased, with the odds on betting markets such as Polymarket spiking to 15% after Zhao’s pardon. However, many industry players believe that the real chances of a pardon are low. Lawyer and CLO at Variant, Jake Chervinsky, previously affirmed that he would be “truly shocked if SBF gets a pardon,” as SBF and CZ are “not comparable at all.” Chervinsky noted that “SBF was a Democratic mega-donor before FTX collapsed and he went to prison bankrupt. His name is half punch line half curse word in DC. Not a single serious person wants this.”",Crypto News|Alameda Research|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|FTX|FTX Collapse|FTX trial|Judge Kaplan|Sam Bankman-Fried|SBF|SBF Appeal|SBF lawyers|SBF news,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-05 07:00:16

FTX Trust Abandons Controversial Plan The FTX Recovery Trust, which filed a notice on Monday, had previously sought court approval to freeze payouts to creditors in 49 countries, including China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Ukraine, citing ambiguous or restrictive local regulations surrounding cryptocurrency. The trust’s motion, filed in early July, aimed to implement procedures that could have significantly affected the rights of creditors in these regions. However, numerous objections—over 70—were submitted shortly after the motion was made public, prompting the estate to reconsider its approach. Weiwei Ji, a creditor, emphasized that while the withdrawal represents a victory for affected creditors, it is crucial to remain vigilant until compensation is fully received. He warned that the implications of the motion extended beyond FTX creditors and could potentially undermine trust in the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. In related developments, the FTX estate’s planned repayment strategy has raised concerns about the actual value of distributions. Creditor representative Sunil Kavuri cautioned that creditors might receive far less than anticipated, particularly since repayments are being issued in fiat currency rather than cryptocurrencies. He pointed out that while the estate has outlined a 143% repayment plan in fiat terms, this does not adequately reflect the losses incurred when measured in cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, amidst the backdrop of FTX’s legal struggles, co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried is seeking to overturn his fraud conviction and 25-year prison sentence. Sam Bankman-Fried Seeks To Overturn Conviction Bankman-Fried’s legal team argues that he was wrongfully convicted due to a rush to judgment influenced by the media, prosecutors, and notably, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan. In a brief submitted to the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers contended that he was presumed guilty even before formal charges were filed. The appeal is being presented by Alexandra Shapiro, a criminal appeals lawyer known for her successes in similar cases. She is set to argue against the conduct of Judge Kaplan, who has been accused of bias against Bankman-Fried throughout the trial. The defense claims that Kaplan pressured jurors for a swift verdict by offering amenities and suggesting they could extend their deliberation hours. Moreover, they assert that the judge “ridiculed” Bankman-Fried’s testimony and undermined his defense. Bankman-Fried’s legal team is also challenging Kaplan’s decision to prevent him from informing the jury that FTX had sufficient assets to repay its customers , while the prosecution was allowed to assert that he had stolen billions, leading to the company’s downfall. Amidst these legal battles, there are reports that Bankman-Fried’s parents are exploring options for securing a presidential pardon , potentially from former President Donald Trump. Bankman-Fried’s team maintains that he did not intend to defraud customers, believing they would ultimately be repaid.

According to market veteran Michaël van de Poppe, that support — the 20-month MA, near 59% — is the signal traders should watch. Related Reading: ‘Good News’ Finally Arrives For SHIB Army As Team Unveils New Update He warned that a confirmed break under that level could flip the market’s favor toward altcoins. Short moves can happen. Big shifts follow. Bitcoin Dominance At A Crossroads Based on reports and chart reads, The 20-month MA has been touched several times recently. In September, Bitcoin dominance briefly slipped below 59% before bouncing back, a move that shows the index is being pushed and probed. Van de Poppe drew a parallel to late 2019, when a long run above that moving average eventually gave way and set the stage for a long altcoin run. He told followers it could be “party time” if the line is broken with conviction. The #Bitcoin dominance is still trending upwards, but on edge to be breaking south. Why? It’s mimicking Q4 2019. I’d want to see a break beneath the 20-Monthly MA. If that happens, that’s party time. pic.twitter.com/m21WnBhKuj — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 4, 2025 Traders say this test matters because it is not just a small tug of war. It is a structural test that could change where money flows next. Momentum would likely shift. Market behavior could become more favorable to smaller coins. Historical Echoes From 2019 Back In September 2019, Bitcoin dominance peaked at 73% before the index began a steady slide. It tested the long moving average by February 2020, then in mid-2020 the structure changed and the drop continued until dominance hit 39% by December 2021. Reports point to that period as when many altcoins outperformed Bitcoin and saw large gains. Some analysts believe a repeat pattern is possible if the same technical threshold fails. Analyst Steve, from Crypto Crew University, flagged comparable chart shapes and resistance points that came before the major altcoin rallies of 2017 and 2021. He suggested the pattern might reappear, perhaps around 2026, meaning an altcoin upswing could arrive later rather than sooner. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Be This Week’s Big Story As Saylor Teases Fresh Buy What Traders Are Watching Several clear markers are being followed. The 20-month MA at 59.29% is one. A sustained close below that level would be the clearest technical trigger. Volume trends and how quickly dominance moves after a break will be watched closely. In addition, analysts will watch whether major Bitcoin flows — such as ETF activity, exchange balances, or large holder moves — change, because those can speed up or slow down an altcoin response.

The update, reported by Cointelegraph and attributed to Bloomberg’s James Seyffart, includes a revision to the document’s 8(a) language, a technical adjustment that indicates final preparations for approval. One Step Closer to ETF Approval The report revealed that Franklin Templeton has shortened the language in its S-1 filing and aims to launch its spot XRP ETF this month. This development arrives as anticipation surrounding a spot XRP ETF intensifies. For months, market observers have regarded such a product as a milestone that could bring institutional capital into the XRP ecosystem. Many analysts believe that the only barrier to earlier approval was the temporary disruption caused by the U.S. government shutdown , which paused several regulatory processes at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Franklin Templeton’s adjusted filing has drawn considerable attention, as such refinements usually imply confidence behind the scenes and readiness for execution.

One community member stated that shortened legal text often aligns with the SEC’s final stages of approval, suggesting that there is procedural confidence in the product. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another commenter added , “When big names start tightening filings like that, it usually means they’re getting ready for go time.” The sentiment across online platforms remains overwhelmingly positive, building on years of spot XRP ETF hype , and many market participants believe that hype is about to pay off. Positioning XRP for Institutional Access Should approval be granted, Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF would join the recently launched Rex-Osprey XRP ETF as a regulated vehicle providing direct exposure to the digital asset within traditional markets. The XRP community has maintained that regulatory clarity is essential for sustainable growth, and such access could bridge institutional portfolios to XRP without requiring direct custody of tokens, thereby expanding the asset’s liquidity and accessibility. If Franklin Templeton’s filing leads to approval within weeks, it could mark a turning point for XRP’s integration into mainstream financial products. For now, all eyes remain on the SEC’s next steps, as experts believe the commission will approve spot XRP ETFs in mid-November .

The collapse that began on Monday evening continues, with the BTC price dropping below $100,000. While there is curiosity about whether Bitcoin's decline will continue, one analyst claimed that if Bitcoin cannot hold $100,000, it could fall to $72,000 within a month or two. Bitcoin's Situation Is Getting Worse, $72,000 Possible! According to The Block, CryptoQuant research head Julio Moreno said that the critical level for Bitcoin is $100,000. According to Moreno, Bitcoin could drop to $72,000 in one to two months if it fails to maintain the $100,000 level. “If Bitcoin fails to hold around $100,000 and breaks down, there is a higher risk of seeing $72,000 in one to two months.” Moreno said Bitcoin's recent declines reflect a continued deterioration in demand following the October 11 liquidation, the largest liquidation in cryptocurrency history, which wiped out more than $20 billion in leveraged positions. At this point, the analyst pointed out that demand has weakened since the record liquidation event on October 11 and that market sentiment has generally been on a downward trend, and that the latest consecutive decline is due to these reasons. “Since the big crash in October, spot demand for Bitcoin has steadily declined. ETF net inflows have decreased and the Coinbase premium has turned negative, suggesting weakening investor demand in the US as well. The crypto market's Bullish Score Index is currently around 20, clearly signaling a bearish period. *This is not investment advice.

Based on on-chain data, the transfers were made to institutional exchanges, including Coinbase Prime, FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and Two Prime. Arkham Intelligence flagged the transfers that mark the latest notable transfer in crypto markets following yesterday’s BlackRock transfer of over $290 million into Coinbase Prime. The transfers have not directly signaled any selling proof; however, based on history on-chain, deposits to exchanges have been associated with plans to liquidate or rebalance large positions. MARA and BlackRock move over $1.2 billion in BTC and ETH Based on Arkham Intelligence’s latest reveal , MARA deposited roughly $45 million into Coinbase Prime and approximately $60 million into Falcon X, with the rest going into Two Prime and Galaxy Digital. A combined deposit of $236 million was made to the exchanges, which originated from wallets controlled by the MARA Pool, the mining operation responsible for block payouts. Is #MARA , the #Bitcoin mining firm that had been consistently buying $BTC , now selling? In the past 12 hours, #MARA transferred a total of 2,348 $BTC ($236M) to #FalconX , #TwoPrime , #GalaxyDigital , and #CoinbasePrime . https://t.co/9DlN5ZPsBz pic.twitter.com/Sur1Swt1d8 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 5, 2025 Ahead of today’s announcement, BlackRock was also seen moving more than $1 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum from its cold wallets to Coinbase Prime over the past five days. The breakdown includes 3,496 BTC, valued at $383.9 million, and 31,754 ETH, valued at $122 million, both of which were made on October 31. The asset manager also transferred $506 million at the beginning of this month and another $290 million yesterday. So far, it remains unclear why the institutions are moving the sizable funds, leaving the market to speculate on possible reasons. The moves could indicate ETF and custodial adjustments, given the firm’s dominant position in the Bitcoin space. MARA’s current total holdings are approximately $1.68 billion. The fund movements suggest that profit-taking is underway after strong performances from both Bitcoin and ETH in recent cycles, despite ongoing volatility. Meanwhile, due to altcoins such as Solana, which continue to receive inflows and garner institutional interest, some major players may be preparing to reallocate funds. Bitcoin drops below $104K As of now, crypto markets have shown signs of a short-term bearish trend, following an almost 5% drop in BTC over the past 24 hours, with trading below $104,000 for the first time in a while. BTC was trading at roughly $102,024, representing a 4.2% drop over the past 24 hours at the time of publication. The token has shed over 17% of its value in the past 30 days, following a new all-time high reached towards the end of October. Ethereum, on the other hand, has also experienced a nearly 10% drop over the past 24 hours. The Ethereum ecosystem’s native token was trading at $3,348, representing a 7.8% drop at the time of publication. ETH has declined by more than 25% over the past month, indicating a renewed bearish momentum across the cryptocurrency market. SOL also experienced a drop in bearish momentum of over 4% in the past 24 hours and more than 30% over the past 30 days. Despite market downtrends, Solana ETFs have recorded new inflows, as opposed to outflows, compared to U.S. spot ETH ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs. Based on SoSoValue data, Solana drew roughly $84 million of new capital over the past month. Ethereum ETFs have recorded $355 million in outflows over the past 30 days. BTC spot ETFs also saw approximately $764 million in outflows during the same period. Source: SoSoValue ; Total SOL spot ETF net inflow over the past month. So far, Solana ETFs have approximately $488.8 million in net assets and trade at around $ 153.40. The trend has sparked some speculation across the crypto industry that institutions may be moving capital into high-yield stacking products, such as Solana Bitwise, which offers approximately 7%.

SOL token was trading at $157, down by nearly 40% from its highest point this year. HBAR token has dropped to $0.1708, down by about 44% from the YTD high. SOL and HBAR ETF inflows have continued Hedera and Solana prices have retreated in the past few months because of the ongoing crypto market crash . Bitcoin and most altcoins have also joined in this crash. The two tokens have crashed even after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowed the launch of their exchange-traded funds (ETF) to start trading in the United States. Data compiled by SoSoValue shows that these funds have been received well by American investors. Spot Solana ETFs have had inflows in all days since their approvals. They added over $14 million in inflows on Tuesday as the crypto market meltdown continued. These funds have had cumulative inflows of over $284 million, bringing their total assets to over $488 million, which is about 0.58% of all assets. The Bitwise Solana ETF (BSOL) has led with over $400 million, while Grayscale Solana ETF (GSOL) has over $88 million in assets. This growth will likely accelerate in the coming months as the agency approves more ETFs Similarly, the Canary Solana ETF has had inflows in the past five days, bringing its cumulative inflows to over $68 million. The fund now has over $60 million in assets under management. This growth is notable as it is happening when the more blue-chip Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have continued to shed assets in the past few days. They have all shed assets in the last five consecutive days. Hedera price technical analysis The daily timeframe chart shows that the HBAR price has crashed in the past few months, moving from a high of $0.3050 in July to the current $0.1700. It has formed a descending channel and is now a few points above the lower side. Also, the coin has formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) crossed each other. On the positive side, there are signs that it is forming a double-bottom pattern at $0.1600 and a neckline at $0.2190. HBAR price chart | Source: TradingView Therefore, while the HBAR price forecast is bearish, the double bottom pattern may lead to a rebound. This bullish outlook will become invalid if it drops below the double-bottom pattern and the lower side of the channel Solana price technical analysis The daily timeframe chart shows that the Solana price has been in a strong downward trend in the past few months, moving from a high of $253 to $150. The coin crashed below the lower side of the ascending channel and then retested it. This performance is known as a break-and-retest pattern, which is a common continuation sign. The coin has moved below the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and is about to form a death cross pattern. It also moved below the key support at $171, its lowest level in October. SOL price chart | Source: TradingView Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the Solana token continues falling, potentially to a low of $125, its lowest level in June. A move above the resistance level at $171 will invalidate the bearish view.

At the same time, the native token is trying to reemerge following yesterday’s market-wide calamity that drove the entire capitalization south by over $300 billion at one point. New Major Milestone Pi News, the social media channel with over a million followers on X, informed that the project has surpassed 100 million downloads. According to the screenshot they shared, this means that Pi Network’s downloads are significantly higher than those for the largest US-based crypto exchange, Coinbase. The gap with OKX and Crypto.com is even wider, as both are somewhere in the 10 million to 20 million bracket. CryptoPotato was able to verify these numbers on the Google Play Store, which confirms that Pi Network’s downloads were indeed above 100 million. Pi Network has surpassed 100 million downloads, boasting a user base far exceeding that of mainstream exchanges, demonstrating its immense community power and growth potential! pic.twitter.com/1IyP3N2la3 — Pi News (@PiNewsMedia) November 5, 2025 This achievement comes on the heels of the latest updates announced by the Core Team. One of them is the partnership with OpenMind (a company developing an operating system for robots), which opened the path to AI for Pi Network. Additionally, the team outlined impressive numbers in terms of verified user bases, with more than 3.36 million such accounts passing the KYC procedures. PI Defends $0.20 Support The entire cryptocurrency market tumbled on Monday and Tuesday, with bitcoin plunging below $99,000 for the first time since June. Ethereum erased all 2025 gains and dumped toward $3,200. Pi Network’s native token was not spared from the crash, plummeting from $0.25 to just under $0.20 within hours. However, the bulls managed to maintain that level, and the asset has bounced to just under $0.22 as of press time. As reported yesterday, some X users believe in PI’s potential, highlighting big targets of somewhere between $3 and $5 in the next few years. However, the asset remains far away from these targets now, while the average daily number of tokens to be unlocked in the next month suggests there might be some pain on the horizon. The most tokens to be released will be on November 15 (over 6.7 million), while November 23 will see just 3.2 million. PI Token Unlock Schedule.

As the big tokens, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, continue to be stable, more investors are interested in new DeFi projects that can be actually used and have a development perspective. One such token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which early adoptees consider the possible biggest surprise of Q4 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol based on smart contracts, which does not involve intermediaries. This design allows users to lend, borrow and gain interest right in their wallets. The protocol is designed around two lending markets that are complementary. The original is Peer-to-Contract (P2C), which allows people to put their assets into liquidity pools and obtain mTokens, which are yield-generating ERC-20 receipts that automatically generate interest. As an illustration, 1ETH is deposited to earn 1mtETH, which increases as more borrowers pay interest. The second one, Peer-to-peer (P2P), matches single lenders and borrowers. Borrowers are allowed to take variable or stable rates where the protocol dictates dynamic rates depending on the demand in the market. Mutuum Finance loans are established by Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios based on the volatility of the collateral. Stable assets such as USDT are usually given up to approximately 75% LTV, whereas more risky tokens are given less than that. In case the value of collateral deteriorates beyond the safety levels, smart contracts will liquidate assets to secure lenders. Presale Success and Growing Momentum Mutuum Finance is in Phase 6 of its presale where MUTM is priced at $0.035 US Dollar. The next step will increase the price by nearly 20% up to $0.04 USD and the launch price is officially set at $0.06 USD. Phase 1, which started when the price was $0.01 US dollar, has already increased MUTM’s price by nearly 300% to the current presale phase. The presale is given 45.5% (1.82B tokens) of the total number of 4 billion tokens. The project has raised over $18.4 million USD, received over 18,000 holders and sold allocated around 790million tokens, which is 85% of the current phase. The high demand is indicated by the rapid growth. Every single presale stage sells more quickly than the previous one, which means that the project is becoming more popular as it is reaching another milestone. Security Foundations, V1 Launch In Q4 2025, Mutuum Finance will launch V1 on the Sepolia Testnet and move out of the development phase and into the working phase, according to the official X statement . V1 roadmap has the following key features: Liquidity Pools, minted tokens, Debt Tokens and an automatic Liquidator Bot to liquidate undercollateralized loans. The project received a CertiK audit to establish trustability prior to launch, scoring 90/100 tokens scan score, which is a good indicator of the security of smart-contracts. The team also has launched a bug bounty program, which provides up to $50,000 USD to external developers that identify code vulnerabilities. Such steps indicate the team cares about transparency, user protection, and long-term sustainability, which analysts mention as the most important to the success of DeFi. As V1 will be released shortly, analysts expect a big token revaluation when users get to look at the protocol. It is projected that the price could grow by 300-600% in early 2026 provided the adoption targets are achieved. Why Are Investors Watching MUTM Closely? Stable growth, effective tokenomics, and a successful presale have enabled Mutuum Finance to become one of the leading new crypto projects. Its current price of $0.035 US dollar gives first mover a significant edge over post listing prices of $0.06 USD and above. Provided the project keeps achieving milestones of its roadmap, analysts expect MUTM to increase 5-10x in the next few years, as organic token acquisition will rely on post-launch lending demand and platform charges. Although all projects have their own degree of risk, the extensive security audits of the Mutuum Finance, as well as its community-focused approach, may indicate that it could be one of the top crypto leading largest market surprises in Q4 2025.

The Nvidia Deep Learning Institute will offer training and technical talks to guide AI systems and developer empowerment. The tech giant joined a group of venture capital and private equity investors pledging $2 billion for deep tech investments in semiconductors, energy, biotech, space, robotics, and AI. However, the company did not provide details about its own contribution to the pledged amount, training targets, or timelines. Nvidia’s Managing Director of South Asia, Vishal Dhupar, said his company aims to guide India’s AI systems and developer enablement. It also aims to establish close ties with policymakers, entrepreneurs, and investors. India’s AI growth is accelerating IDTA’s founding executive council member, Sriram Viswanathan, claimed that the pace of AI innovation in India is accelerating, adding that a significant number of his country’s deep tech firms could achieve global repute in five years. Viswanathan believes that Nvidia’s depth of expertise in AI systems , building ecosystems, and software will benefit the IDTA’s network of entrepreneurs and investors. Meanwhile, India’s government has reportedly been actively encouraging innovation and research in deep tech through major initiatives. It has spent over $1.1 billion (100B Rupees) under the AI Mission initiative and another $11.2 billion (1 trillion Rupees) through the Research, Development, and Innovation Scheme, targeting deep-tech firms. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced on November 3 that India will host the 2026 AI Impact Summit. Top policymakers, heads of state, and business leaders, including Google DeepMind’s CEO Demis Hassabis and Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, are expected to participate in the event. OpenAI also reportedly counts India as its second-largest user base, as Nvidia’s commitment to the country coincides with a surge in global interest in its AI market. Google recently pledged $15 billion for an AI hub to be built in Visakhapatnam. India doubles R&D gross expenditure PIB India, the nodal agency for communicating with the media on behalf of the Indian government, reported on November 4 that the country’s gross expenditure on R&D (research and development) has more than doubled over the past 10 years. The agency added that the government has placed R&D at the center of its Viksit Bharat@2047 mission. Meanwhile, efforts to strengthen private and public participation, deepen links between industry and academia, and promote tech startups have created a transformative innovation hub as India marches forward. The agency claimed that the government’s sustained institutional reforms and policy focus have contributed to the steady rise in R&D spending. Per capita R&D spending has also surged consistently, with the private sector accounting for about 36% of the total GERD (Gross Expenditure on Research and Development) budget, while the government contributes the remaining 64%. India ranks third globally in Science and Engineering (S&E) PhDs after the U.S. and China . India also launched the ₹1 lakh crore RDI (Research, Development, and Innovation) Scheme Fund on November 3, marking a significant milestone towards strengthening the country’s R&D ecosystem. The scheme aims to establish an innovation environment driven by the private sector to help boost the country’s progress in science and technology. It is expected to encourage more private investment in RDI in the strategic and sunrise sectors. The scheme also offers risk capital and growth to address existing challenges in funding private research. It focuses on promoting the adoption of technology, enhancing competition in emerging areas, and fostering innovation. PIB India noted that forward-looking policy measures and a robust institutional framework have guided the country’s innovation journey. The agency also claimed that the government has undertaken several reforms to make India a global hub for research and entrepreneurship across emerging sectors.

Key Takeaways: Canada will introduce its first federal framework for fiat-backed stablecoins under the 2025 budget, following the US model. The Bank of Canada will spend $10 million over two years to oversee implementation, recovering costs from regulated issuers. The move reflects Ottawa’s push to modernize payments as stablecoin adoption accelerates globally. According to Tuesday’s budget release , the legislation will require stablecoin issuers to maintain full reserves, establish clear redemption policies, and implement robust risk management systems, including safeguards for personal and financial data. The goal is to strengthen trust in digital payment systems and provide clarity for issuers operating in Canada’s expanding crypto market. Bank of Canada Allocates $10M to Oversee Stablecoin Rollout The Bank of Canada is expected to spend $10 million over two years, starting in fiscal year 2026–2027, to oversee the rollout. Annual supervision costs of about $5 million will later be recovered from issuers regulated under the Retail Payment Activities Act. The move comes just months after the US passed its GENIUS Act in July , a landmark stablecoin bill that heightened global regulatory momentum. Ottawa’s response signals its intent to modernize payment systems while keeping pace with international developments. Although the government has yet to specify when the bill will be introduced, the plan forms part of a wider effort to make digital transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure for Canada’s 41.7 million residents. Coinbase Canada CEO Lucas Matheson welcomed the proposal, telling CBC that it could “change how Canadians interact with money and the internet forever.” Canada just made a big step forward. Today’s federal budget includes new guidance on stablecoin regulation, signaling progress toward embracing faster, cheaper, and borderless payments. With 60,000 advocates strong, Stand with Crypto Canada will continue to be a driving… pic.twitter.com/C0ZiO3GLsR — Stand With Crypto Canada (@StandWCrypto_CA) November 4, 2025 The global stablecoin market is currently valued at $309.1 billion, with the US Treasury projecting it could reach $2 trillion by 2028. Institutional adoption is already accelerating, with Western Union, SWIFT, MoneyGram, and Zelle integrating or planning to integrate stablecoin-based solutions. Among Canada’s emerging players is Tetra Digital, which recently raised $10 million from Shopify, Wealthsimple, and the National Bank of Canada to develop a Canadian dollar-backed stablecoin. The push comes as the Bank of Canada shelved its central bank digital currency (CBDC) plans in September 2024, citing “no compelling case” to move forward. Western Union to Launch Dollar-Backed Stablecoin on Solana Western Union is also entering the stablecoin market with plans to launch the US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT) on the Solana blockchain in the first half of 2026. The token, issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, will allow users to move money globally with lower fees and faster settlement times, reducing reliance on traditional banking intermediaries and volatile currency conversions. CEO Devin McGranahan described the move as a continuation of Western Union’s 175-year mission to simplify money transfers, this time through blockchain technology. He said Solana was chosen for its speed, scalability, and low-cost transactions, which are crucial for the company’s high-volume remittance business. By leveraging blockchain rails, Western Union aims to make remittances nearly instantaneous and more transparent.

In 2031, we expect the ENA price to achieve $7.38. Ethena is a stablecoin project built on Ethereum that offers USDe, a fully decentralized coin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, USDe doesn’t depend on banks or centralized companies for reserves. Instead, it uses a cash-and-carry trading strategy to keep its value equal to the dollar. For investors who prioritize decentralization, USDe could be an appealing choice — especially since it currently offers staking rewards above 9%. However, critics caution that since the project is still new, it’s uncertain whether USDe’s high yields and dollar peg can remain stable during a market downturn. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Ethena price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will ENA reach $10?” and explore the factors behind ENA price prediction.

Currently, the ENA price is preparing for a recovery rally. Ethena price analysis 1-day chart: ENA price triggers bearish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of ENA tokens, ENA witnessed a bearish correction after sellers pushed the price below resistance lines. Sellers are now aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels around $0.32. The 24-hour volume surged to $77.8 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. Ethena’s price is currently trading at $0.32, which has dropped by over 0.4% in the last 24 hours. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers around the 31-level, showing that bears control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. ENA/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour ENA price chart suggests that ENA experienced a bullish activity below EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. Additionally, buyers aim for a strong rebound above the EMA20 trend line. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.51, suggesting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost downward correction. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening buying positions. ENA price predictions: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.4590 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.4286 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.4654 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.4656 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.5147 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.6009 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.4819 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.4700 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.5112 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.5680 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.6112 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.5906 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.5263 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.4938 SELL What to expect from ENA price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the ENA price from an immediate surge. However, if the ENA price successfully breaks above $0.3912, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.5091. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, ENA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.293, resulting in a correction to $0.22. Is ENA a good investment? Whether ENA is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. Ethena has been ranked among the 100 cryptocurrencies. Still, there are questions about its demand, given its similarity to algorithmic stablecoins — a concept that lost trust after LUNA’s collapse in 2022. Even so, Ethena has shown strong performance during market surges, making it a solid project in the crypto market. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the ENA price down today? ENA’s price gained buying pressure around recent lows, resulting in a strong upward push. This created a push above $0.32. Will Ethena price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.4 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will ENA reach $10? ENA price might reach the $10 mark in 2032 if buying demand surges and ENA attracts altcoin investors. Will ENA reach $100? The $100 mark is a distant dream for ENA. This price level is achievable in the long run if ENA continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Ethena a good long-term investment? ENA has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on ENA Terminal Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) incubated by Ethena Labs, has attracted more than $262 million in total value locked (TVL) ahead of its upcoming launch. Ethena (ENA) price prediction November 2025 Over the last few days, ENA prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $120K in November, we might see a solid surge in the ENA price. According to technical analysis, the ENA price might record a maximum level of $0.44 and a minimum of $0.25, with an average value of $0.35 throughout November.

ENA historical price sentiment ENA Price History: Coinmarketcap Ethena’s price history from mid-2024 to late 2025 shows a period of intense volatility marked by sharp fluctuations in both price and market capitalization. In early 2024, Ethena traded strongly, reaching highs around $1.20 in April, supported by high trading volumes exceeding $8 billion. However, by mid-2024, the token began to decline steadily, closing near $0.38 by July as investor sentiment weakened and market activity cooled. The latter half of 2024 saw further instability. Ethena’s price dropped as low as $0.20 in September, reflecting a major correction phase in the broader crypto market. Despite these setbacks, the token demonstrated resilience, climbing back above $1.00 by December 2024. This late-year rally suggested renewed interest from traders and potential ecosystem developments. In 2025, Ethena continued to experience wide swings. The token opened the year near $1.25 but faced sustained downward pressure through the spring, dipping below $0.30 by June. A strong recovery followed in the third quarter, with prices surpassing $0.70 in August and stabilizing near $0.50 by October. Throughout this period, Ethena’s market cap ranged from $1 billion to over $5 billion. In early November, the price of ENA declined toward $0.3.",Crypto Price Predictions|ENA|Ethena,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ENA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-05 07:40:46

Bitcoin traded at $111,000 on Sunday evening, ETH was above $3,900, XRP was at $2.60, and so on. What followed, though, was a market-wide crash that pushed BTC down to just under $99,000 for the first time in almost five months. ETH turned negative YTD, dropping to $3,200. And these declines took place less than a week after the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates, US and China made significant progress on the trade deal front, and the inflation numbers in the States were not as high as many feared. So, why did crypto crash, and why did the market cap go down to $3.2 trillion, thus erasing $1 trillion since the October 6 all-time highs? Here’s the take from the Kobeissi Letter. Why, Crypto, Why? The analysts noted that the big answer to this question is “more technical than fundamental.” They believe that some of the key metrics for the industry, such as adoption levels, deregulation, and advancing technology, remain very high, which should be prompting investors to enter the market, not pushing them away. However, they warned once again that leverage is at “unprecedented levels, which is amplifying moves in the market, such as the $20B liquidation seen on October 10.” “As a result, when uncertainty arises or technical momentum fades, downward swings are amplified. 300,000 traders are being liquidated PER DAY on average, and the market has evolved into its most reactive form in history amid Trump posts and headlines.” Consequently, the analysts warned that the short-term price picture points to “larger swings in both directions” due to the excessive leverage used by futures traders, but noted that the long-term thesis is “stronger than ever.” One of Those Days Crypto’s crash was not an isolated event, as most financial markets went down on Monday and Tuesday. Of course, their losses, even the 4.5% decline of the Japanese stock market, are nowhere near as damaging as crypto’s calamity, but that’s primarily because of the aforementioned leverage and the size of the actual market. Consequently, the Kobeissi Letter determined once again that nothing had changed fundamentally and added that such corrections are experienced periodically during bull runs. The analyst concluded that “rate cuts have arrived, deregulation is here, earnings growth is running at 10%+ YoY, and the AI Revolution is accelerating,” and advised investors to “ignore the noise.” Today is one of those days: Just about every asset class is trading lower today and all intra-day rally attempts are being sold. It’s simply widespread profit-taking. In our view, nothing has changed fundamentally speaking. That said, the most healthy bull markets experience… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) November 4, 2025 The post What Crashed the Crypto Market on November 4 and Should You Worry? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Top News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Ethereum (ETH) Price,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-05 07:53:23

Following October, declines continued in November, historically known as the month of rise, with Bitcoin falling below the critical level of $100,000. While this decline also dampened bullish expectations, some analysts said that Bitcoin would have a hard time reaching $125,000 by the end of 2025. Year-end Expectations for Bitcoin Are Declining! At this point, ShapeShift analyst Houston Morgan stated that Bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level in the last four months and that long-term investors are selling, strengthening the selling pressure in the market. Morgan said that for BTC to rise, it needs to break its high correlation with US President Donald Trump's statements, including tariffs, as this will be difficult for BTC to rise. “It will be difficult for the Bitcoin price to surpass $125,000 by the end of the year. Unless Bitcoin breaks its high correlation with Trump's policy statements, it will not be easy for it to experience a new bull market. $116,000 Needs to Be Earned! Bitfinex analysts also noted that Bitcoin is facing a difficult time. They pointed to a price of $116,000, indicating continued selling pressure from long-term investors. At this point, analysts stated that if Bitcoin fails to surpass $116,000, further declines are possible. “The continued selling by long-term investors is creating structural pressure. If the Bitcoin price cannot quickly break above $116,000 amidst declining demand, the risk of further declines will increase. Because the upward momentum is gradually weakening, and the longer the stagnation phase lasts, the weaker investor confidence becomes, which increases the risk of a downturn. Could Bitcoin's Bear Market Begin in 2026? While there is no clear opinion on this matter, analysts are divided on how Bitcoin will perform in 2026. Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan predicted that 2026 will be a “bullish year” for Bitcoin. In contrast, financial analyst Andrew Lokenauth said that a bear market similar to previous mid-season periods is likely to occur in 2026. *This is not investment advice.

In most cases, the process just feels abstract, slow, and symbolic. SACHI is rewriting the script with Governance That Matters, ending the cycle of irrelevant proposals and performative polls leading up to decisions that rarely improve the player experience. SACHI’s answer is a platform where player votes directly moderate upcoming features, drops, and modes in real time. Governance becomes real agency when players trust that the results from today’s votes can go live in next week’s update as long as there is community consensus. SACHI is the case study for Web3 projects looking to keep their communities engaged and empowered with its transparency in delivering immediate implementations of governance resolutions. SACHI’s governance model democratizes decision-making Due to its relatively novel nature, the natural reaction to Web3 governance is curiosity. Many players have asked the “Will my voice matter here?” question when they enter new ecosystems, and unfortunately, the answer usually underwhelms when compared to the initial proposition. SACHI answers the governance question with an emphatic yes, and follows through with direct, responsive execution of poll results in real gaming environments. Player choices flow straight into the development pipeline , whether it is in deciding avatar skins to be added to the game, voting on tournament formats, or deciding the theme of the next season’s pass. Your Votes Steer SACHI’s Direction SACHI’s governance system renders abstract DAO structures with convoluted delegation structures obsolete, with its open design that allows players at all levels to vote on outcomes that transparently and directly affect real change. Players can contribute to decision-making via different votes, such as: Feature Votes: Players can decide on how game modes are prioritized. Drop Votes: These voting rounds focus on ecosystem decisions for skins, emotes, or VIP perks in the launch pipeline. Economy Votes: Users can contribute to decisions about event rewards, modifications to seasonal balance, and marketplace updates. Every $SACHI token holder is a stakeholder with corresponding amounts of votes that help steer the direction of the SACHI ecosystem. Even better, SACHI sets a new standard for execution speed, quickly implementing users’ decisions in-game and across the ecosystem. Responsiveness is the Name of the Game SACHI bridges the divide between community and creators, engaging players to be co-creators in an ecosystem they actively participate in. This dynamic relationship keeps the SACHI universe adaptive and engaged , allowing users to quickly effect change via an active loop week after week. “Governance at SACHI isn’t paperwork, it’s power,” said Jonas Martisius, CEO of SACHI. “When you vote here, you’re not just filling out a form. You’re helping ship a feature, a drop, or a mode that you’ll actually see and play within days. That immediacy builds trust, excitement, and a sense of true belonging.” Why This Matters for Gaming The promise of Web3 has always been ownership. But ownership without agency falls flat. SACHI’s model ensures that owning $SACHI means shaping SACHI. By connecting tokens to visible, playable outcomes, governance becomes more than a concept, it becomes a reason to log in, play, and participate. Play SACHI today and see your vote shape tomorrow. Join the universe where your choice ships features, drops, and modes in real time. About SACHI SACHI is an immersive Web3 competitive gaming universe combining AAA-quality gameplay, real-time social features, and blockchain-powered economies. Built on Unreal Engine 5 and powered by pixel streaming , SACHI is accessible on any device without downloads or high-end hardware.

At press time, bitcoin (BTC) hovered near $101,700 after an intraday trough just above $99,000 on widely used benchmarks, marking a fall of roughly 6% day-over-day and the lowest print since June. The slide came as US equities limped into mid-week, with the Nasdaq up 20.9% year-to-date and the S&P 500 up 15.1% as of Tuesday’s close—gains that underscore how much bitcoin has lagged other risk assets during long stretches of 2025. That divergence, together with a growing body of ETF-flow data showing several straight sessions of net outflows from US spot bitcoin funds into early November, provided the macro backdrop for a fragile crypto tape. Independent tallies from Farside/SoSoValue and multiple outlets point to a roughly $1.3–$1.4 billion cumulative bleed over four trading days into November 3–4, led by BlackRock’s IBIT. Why Is Bitcoin Price Down? Into that context, Joe Consorti—Head of Growth at Horizon (Theya, YC)—argues the selloff is less a loss of conviction than a structural handoff of supply. In a video analysis posted late November 4 US time, he framed the day’s move as “one of its roughest days of the year, down more than 6 percent, falling to $99,000 for the first time since June,” adding that while equities would call that “the start of a bear market… for Bitcoin, though, this is typical of a bull market drawdown.” He noted that “we’ve already weathered two separate 30 percent drawdowns during this bull run,” and characterized the present action as “a transfer of Bitcoin’s ownership base from the old guard to the new guard.” Related Reading: CryptoQuant Head Reveals Reason Behind Bearish Bitcoin Trend Consorti anchored his thesis to a now-viral framework from macro investor Jordi Visser: bitcoin’s “silent IPO.” In Visser’s Substack essay—shared widely since the weekend—he posits that 2025’s rangebound price belies an orderly, IPO-like distribution as early-era holders access the deepest liquidity the asset has ever had through ETFs, institutional custodians and corporate balance sheets. “Early-stage investors… need liquidity. They need an exit. They need to diversify,” Visser wrote, arguing that methodical selling “results [in] a sideways grind that drives everyone crazy.” Consorti adopted the frame bluntly: “This isn’t panic selling, it’s the natural evolution of an asset that’s reached maturity… a transfer of ownership from concentrated hands to distributed ones.” Evidence for that churn has been visible on-chain. Multiple instances of Satoshi-era wallets and miner addresses reanimating this quarter—some after 14 years—have been documented, including July’s duo of 10,000-BTC wallets and late-October movement from a 4,000-BTC miner address. While not dispositive that coins are being market-sold, the pattern is consistent with supply redistributing from early concentrates to broader, regulated channels. Technically, Consorti cast the drop as part of “digestion,” not exhaustion. “The RSI tells us Bitcoin is at its most oversold level since April, when the last leg of the bull run began. Every drawdown this cycle, 30%, 35%, and now 20%, has built support rather than destroyed it.” He added a key conditional: “If we spend too much time below $100,000, that could suggest the distribution isn’t done… perhaps we’re in for a bull-market reversal into a bear market.” Macro, however, is intruding. The Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 bps on October 29 to a 3.75%–4.00% target range, but Chair Jerome Powell carefully pushed back on the idea of an automatic December cut, citing “strongly differing views” inside the FOMC and a “data fog” from the ongoing government shutdown. Markets promptly tempered their odds for further near-term easing. Consorti’s warning that bitcoin “is extremely correlated” to risk-asset drawdowns therefore looms large: if equities lurch meaningfully lower or funding stress reappears, crypto will feel it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run: Over Or Just Paused? CryptoQuant CEO Presents The Data If Visser’s “silent IPO” is right, ETFs are both symptom and salve. They have delivered the two-sided depth to absorb legacy supply but also introduced a new, faster-moving cohort whose redemptions can amplify downdrafts. That dynamic showed up again this week in the four-day string of net outflows concentrated in IBIT, even as longer-term assets under management remain enormous by historical standards. Consorti’s conclusion was starkly patient, not euphoric. “For every seller looking to liquidate their position, there’s a new participant stepping in for the long haul… It’s slow, it’s uneven, and it’s psychologically draining, but once it’s finished, it unlocks the next leg higher. Because the marginal seller is gone, and what’s left is a base of holders who don’t need to sell.” Whether Tuesday’s pierce of the six-figure floor proves the climactic flush—or merely another chapter in a months-long ownership transfer—will hinge on how quickly price reclaims and bases above $100,000, how ETF flows stabilize, and whether the Fed’s path from here restores risk appetite or starves it. For now, the most important story in bitcoin may be happening under the surface, not on the chart. At press time, BTC traded at $101,865.

The chart he shared outlines XRP’s long-term structure and ongoing accumulation phase, suggesting that the asset could be preparing for a significant upward movement. EGRAG CRYPTO described the current setup as a technical formation built over years of data. The chart, labeled “ The Bifrost Bridge ,” depicts XRP trading within a defined ascending channel, with clear resistance and support zones. According to the analyst, XRP has been consolidating in a 12-month accumulation range, which historically precedes a major price expansion. The analysis emphasizes that this accumulation is forming above every major candle body since inception, which he says represents a “solid, rigid support zone.” $XRP : Ignore The Noise https://t.co/WI1geeSPY4 pic.twitter.com/beCg7wL7KZ — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 3, 2025 A Conviction Built on Structure EGRAG CRYPTO highlighted that the technical setup reflects the same structural behavior of early XRP cycles. However, he explained that the current market environment is more mature and complex, making the pattern unfold slowly. He also noted that traders who continue to short XRP are “fighting the structure itself,” pointing to the repeated validation of the support zones within the blue range shown on the chart. The analysis implies that XRP’s long-term technical structure remains intact despite recent fluctuations , suggesting a potential continuation of the upward trend once consolidation ends. The Critical Blue Box Zone One of the central points in EGRAG CRYPTO’s post was the blue box area highlighted on the chart, which he identified as the key support range for XRP. When addressing the possibility of the price breaking below that zone, he said, “If that ever happens, the entire global financial system will be in deeper trouble than XRP itself.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst argued that prolonged consolidation often misleads bearish traders, who mistake time-based stagnation for directional weakness. By contrast, his interpretation views this extended phase as necessary for structural maturity before XRP resumes its next leg upward . Generational Wealth Perspective EGRAG CRYPTO closed his post by reaffirming that his analysis is focused on long-term positioning rather than short-term trading. He wrote, “I’m here for generational wealth,” adding that people will see prices like $19.5 and $17 as entry points. XRP traded at $2.39 at the time of his post, but the analysis suggests that the asset is nearing the end of its consolidation within the accumulation range. The outlined channel indicates potential room for expansion toward higher price levels if market momentum confirms the structure.

DOGE-1 Satellite had been moving in tandem with the rest of the crypto market, which has been trading in the red since the start of this business week. The token slipped with the broader market to an all-time low of $0.000282, but Elon Musk’s X update flipped the coin to an upward momentum that took it over 300% above the November 3 lows. Elon Musk( @elonmusk ) once again said ""It's time"" to send Dogecoin to the moon. The memecoin DOGE-1 has since surged ~300%. Smart trader ""god.sol aka Mitch"", who previously profited $2.8M trading memecoins, just spent 100 $SOL ($14.8K) to buy 16.27M DOGE-1.… pic.twitter.com/tIGDuVCT6K — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 5, 2025 The brief message was a direct reply to Dogecoin community member DogeDesigner, who had quoted Musk’s old 2021 declaration that SpaceX would “put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon,” with a post of his own saying: “No Highs, No Lows, Only DOGE.” DOGE-1’s all-time low slump period halted by Musk rally Before the SpaceX head gave the market a reason to add coins, DOGE-1 had been languishing near an all-time low, before climbing past $0.0011 after an unforeseen price correction. The upward momentum defied the negative trend in the broader crypto market, and its market cap ticked upwards by 367.34% to reach $9.174 million within 24 hours of Musk’s post. The token’s valuation has since retraced slightly to around $7.2 million, but it is still 266% above its initial value at the start of Monday’s market turmoil. DOGE-1 Satellite (DOGE-1) is a Solana-based meme token for the upcoming SpaceX DOGE-1 lunar satellite mission. The mission, announced in 2021, will send a small satellite into lunar orbit to broadcast digital content like advertisements, images, and logos on a display screen attached to the craft. According to the project’s detailing, cameras on board will capture and stream the broadcasts back to Earth via YouTube and Twitch. In reaction to the DOGE-1 market surge, blockchain data tracker Lookonchain reported that a well-known trader identified as “god.sol” or “Mitch,” purchased 16.27 million DOGE-1 tokens. On-chain data from Solscan revealed Mitch spent 100 SOL, worth roughly $14,800, to acquire the position, and now holds about $18,500 worth of DOGE-1. The trader’s wallet has previously recorded realized profits of about $2.8 million from other memecoin trades through short holding periods and quick sales during market peaks. By ""god.sol aka Mitch himself lol pic.twitter.com/gnJksvjllp — Mason (revenge arc) (@Masongainz) November 5, 2025 Mitch downplayed the “smart trader” label issued to him by the community in a Telegram group screenshot shared on X by another trader known as Mason earlier today. “Why would they call me a smart trader? Just cause I made millions? I’m retarded, fr fr,” he wrote, quoting Lookonchain’s post and confirming he made the trades late Monday. Dogecoin price slightly rises, but struggles ensue after whale sell-offs DOGE-1 may have surged due to the world’s wealthiest man’s influence, but its inspiration, the original Dogecoin, has been facing heavy selling pressure over the past week. According to Santiment feed data, wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE sold around one billion coins in recent days. Blockchain analyst Ali Martinez noted that these large outflows have continued since mid-October, contributing to a steady decline in Dogecoin’s market value. Dogecoin’s market capitalization fell from $55.7 billion on October 28 to around $24.4 billion on Wednesday, a $30 billion erosion in seven days. The token dropped below $0.18 and hit a low of $0.1648 in today’s early morning trading sessions, although it is up 0.8% over the past 24 hours. Dogecoin is still down nearly 35% over the past 30 days, which could mean the latest rally may be more of a tactical rebound than the start of a sustained trend. The DOGE-1 surge also coincided with a rotation into memecoins, where tokens like TRUMP fell 0.6%. Major cryptocurrencies Ethereum dropped 8.2%, and Solana fell 4.9% during the same period. Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a seven-day high of 59.95%, a sign that investors were consolidating into the king coin by market cap and waiting on volatility from smaller-cap memecoins.

By removing delaying clauses and adding key operational details, the issuers signal growing confidence that the SEC’s recent guidance has opened a fast track for XRP ETFs to reach the market. Canary Capital set the tone by trimming the delaying amendment from its S-1 and publicly indicating an automatic effectiveness window that points to a November 13 listing date, a move designed to let the ETF go live as soon as exchange and clearing mechanics permit. That filing and the stated target date have pressured rivals to tidy their paperwork and lock in market positioning ahead of what analysts expect will be a concentrated debut period. Grayscale, a leading institutional force in crypto, filed a detailed early-November amendment for its proposed Grayscale XRP Trust ETF, outlining governance, custody, and fee structures. The filing reveals how the firm plans to operate the spot product and underscores its readiness to list immediately once the SEC and exchanges give the green light. Alongside Bitwise’s recent fee disclosures and Canary’s accelerated timeline, Grayscale’s move amplifies a clear message across the industry that top asset managers are fully primed to launch XRP ETFs the moment approval lands. Franklin Templeton’s update was equally significant. The $1.5 trillion asset manager removed an 8(a)-style delay clause from its S-1, language that would have required explicit SEC approval, and replaced it with provisions for automatic effectiveness. This subtle but strategic change streamlines the path to market, signaling Franklin Templeton’s confidence that exchanges will move swiftly under the SEC’s new generic listing standards. Why the rush? Well, in September, the SEC approved rule changes letting national exchanges adopt generic listing standards for spot crypto and commodity ETFs, a structural shift that shortens reviews and opens the door to rapid listings. With early-mover advantage at stake, issuers are racing to perfect their operational, custody, and fee disclosures before exchanges or regulators give the green light. Therefore, the coordinated wave of S-1 updates from Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, and Bitwise has shifted the XRP ETF story from theoretical approval to a full-scale operational sprint. Conclusion The synchronized S-1 updates from Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Canary Capital signal a turning point for crypto-based ETFs. What began as a cautious regulatory trial has evolved into a full-scale sprint toward mainstream recognition of XRP as a legitimate asset within traditional finance. Should approvals arrive by mid-November, these issuers could unlock a new wave of institutional participation and accelerate the fusion of digital assets with regulated markets. The coming weeks may thus mark a defining milestone, not only for XRP, but for the broader future of cryptocurrency investing.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-05 08:11:25
54051351,621613,1762330388,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54051351.jpeg,"Lummis Says ‘Clarity Act’ Is Biggest US Crypto Bill, 23 Days to $BEST Presale Close",https://bitcoinist.com/sen-lummis-calls-clarity-biggest-crypto-act-in-history-best-presale-soars/,"Quick Facts: US lawmakers push the Clarity Act that Lummis calls the biggest crypto bill ever and a full legal system for digital assets and stablecoins. Regulatory clarity could funnel new users to secure, mobile wallets with simple onramps, favoring stacks like Best Wallet with Fireblocks MPC security. $BEST presale shows 23 days left, about $16.83M raised, a price at $0.025895, and an estimated 78% dynamic staking APY for early stakers. $BEST utility includes reduced fees, curated early presale access, and future features like a fiat card, rewards hub, and staking aggregator per the project roadmap. Sen. Cynthia Lummis says the ‘Clarity Act’ could create the first full legal system for crypto and stablecoins in the US. She calls it the largest crypto bill ever and is trying to secure Democratic votes before year end . The push includes meetings between senators and industry leaders in Washington to avoid further delays. If passed, the framework could end years of regulatory uncertainty that slowed wallet innovation and limited mainstream adoption. Retail users have a lot of gain from this because clear crypto structures and disclosures are necessary for more compliant onramps and better consumer protections. The SEC and CFTC would be the supervisors under this act, which brings much-needed authority and knowledge in an industry plagued by uncertainty. Per Lummis, the bill’s goal is to create a unified legal structure rather than piecemeal enforcement. And CEOs from big crypto companies are in support of the move, setting up meetings with lawmakers in recent days. More importantly, this industry clarity narrative links directly to wallet infrastructure. That’s because most wallets today are either tied to centralized companies or lack mobile ease of use. But one non-custodial solution might just escape that pattern – Best Wallet . It bridges that gap with a non custodial, multi chain app, plus extra benefits that typical wallets skip. Those include access to some of the best crypto presales and lower trading fees for token holders. More importantly, Best Wallet can ride the US crypto bill momentum. Through its official token, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , traders will access a continuously-developing DeFi ecosystem with MPC security, support for six major chains, a curated presales hub, and much more. Let’s see why $BEST may be one of the safest crypto to buy, given the current context. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Key to the Wallet and DeFi Ecosystem of the Future Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers a mobile first, non custodial wallet that supports thousands of assets and cross chain swaps. Inside the app, users can buy, hold, and swap, and there’s an in-built fiat onramp for easy accessibility. An upcoming Best Card aims to turn balances into everyday spend with cashback. All thbese features are accessible from one interface, which matters if new US rules bring more first time users into crypto. Best Wallet itself is one of the first wallets to integrate Fireblocks MPC CMP for key management, which enables custom multi wallet portfolios and a simplified ease of use. The team also offers in-app swaps on 6 major chains plus a mobile integration with Pancake Swap, which reduces the need to hop apps. For users, fewer hops mean fewer approvals and fewer chances to sign malicious transactions. And $BEST is the centerpiece of this wallet ecosystem. Holding $BEST unlocks reduced fees in the ecosystem and early access to curated presales via the in app ‘Upcoming Tokens’ portal. This removes third party risk by routing purchases through the wallet itself. If the Clarity Act advances and exchange listings tighten, the ability to access new tokens from a vetted wallet interface becomes a real differentiator. $BEST itself is an Ethereum token, with a smart contract audited by Coinsult for extra security assurances. The roadmap includes a staking aggregator, browser extension, rewards hub, and gas token free transactions. These will be very useful for day traders, in particular. And the project aims to capture 40% of the wallet market by 2026, which is aggressive but aligns with where the industry is currently heading toward.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant news today as Bitcoin falls below $100,000 . This dramatic shift has caught many investors off guard, marking a crucial moment for the market. According to Bitcoin World’s real-time market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at an astonishing $99,802.57 on the Binance USDT market. This dip below a psychological and technical threshold raises immediate questions about market stability and future price action. What Triggered Bitcoin’s Latest Decline Below $100,000? When we observe that Bitcoin falls below $100,000 , it is natural to inquire about the underlying causes. Several factors often contribute to such significant market movements. Firstly, large-scale profit-taking by long-term holders or institutional investors can exert considerable downward pressure. This often happens after extended periods of growth. Secondly, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as persistent inflation fears or anticipated interest rate hikes by central banks, can lead investors to shy away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Moreover, unexpected regulatory developments or significant news from major crypto exchanges can also trigger a rapid sell-off. It is typically a complex interplay of these elements that drives such market shifts, making it essential for investors to stay informed. How Does This Impact BTC Investors and the Broader Crypto Market? The immediate aftermath of Bitcoin falls below $100,000 can be unsettling for many market participants. For individual BTC investors, this price action might trigger fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), potentially leading to panic selling. However, experienced traders often view such dips as strategic buying opportunities, looking for long-term value. The broader cryptocurrency market, which often mirrors Bitcoin’s movements, typically experiences a ripple effect. Altcoins may see similar declines, though some might show surprising resilience or even temporary gains as investors seek alternatives. This event highlights Bitcoin’s continued role as the market’s bellwether, influencing the sentiment and trajectory of nearly all other digital assets. Understanding this interconnectedness is crucial for navigating market volatility. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights When Bitcoin Falls Below $100,000 In times when Bitcoin falls below $100,000 , maintaining a clear strategy is paramount. Here are some actionable insights for investors to consider during volatile periods: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always understand the assets you hold and the market dynamics at play. Knowledge is your best defense against panic. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider buying small amounts regularly, rather than trying to time the market perfectly. This strategy can help mitigate risk during volatile periods by averaging out your purchase price. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes can also help reduce exposure to single asset volatility. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, expert analyses, and broader macroeconomic indicators. Informed decisions are crucial for long-term success. Emotional Discipline: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or greed. Stick to your long-term investment plan and avoid reacting to short-term fluctuations. The recent event where Bitcoin falls below $100,000 serves as a potent reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market. While such significant price movements can be alarming, they are also a characteristic feature of this nascent asset class. Understanding the factors at play, managing risk effectively, and staying informed are key to navigating these turbulent waters. The crypto market continues to evolve rapidly, and Bitcoin’s journey remains a fascinating spectacle for investors worldwide. Whether this dip signals a temporary correction or a more prolonged downturn, one thing is certain: the crypto space never ceases to offer compelling developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is Bitcoin expected to recover after falling below $100,000? A1: Market recoveries depend on various factors, including investor sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory news. Historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience after significant drops, but future performance is never guaranteed. Q2: What should I do if my Bitcoin investment is down? A2: It’s crucial to avoid panic selling. Revisit your original investment thesis, consider dollar-cost averaging, and ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also be beneficial. Q3: Are there any positive aspects to Bitcoin’s price drop? A3: For some investors, a price drop can present a buying opportunity at a lower entry point. It can also ‘shake out’ speculative investors, potentially leading to a more stable market in the long run. Q4: How often does Bitcoin experience such significant price drops? A4: Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and significant price corrections are not uncommon. It has experienced multiple drops of 20% or more throughout its history, often followed by periods of recovery. Q5: What is the significance of the $100,000 price level for Bitcoin? A5: The $100,000 mark is a significant psychological and technical level. Breaking below it can trigger further selling due to perceived loss of momentum, while holding above it often signals strong market confidence. Did you find this analysis helpful?

ETF flow leadership often precedes performance, steering attention and liquidity toward chains where users need faster wallets, cross-chain routing, and simpler onramps. Sustained Solana ETF inflows ($70.1M on Monday) despite $BTC and $ETH outflows highlight appetite for alternative L1 exposure and higher throughput ecosystems entering the next adoption wave. The $BEST presale fits this rotation, combining a secure wallet and presale portal at a $0.025895 price with $16.8M+ raised so far. ETF flows rotated fast this week. Multiple spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs posted sizable net outflows. $BTC outflows hit $1.43B , while $ETH outflows recorded $637M across the past four trading sessions. We noticed persistent red days for $BTC and $ETH funds, coupled with a growing focus on Solana as institutions scout higher beta plays for the next leg of the cycle. Why this rotation matters goes beyond price screens, as ETF flow leadership often signals where risk appetite is heading across crypto. Solana’s throughput offers traders cleaner beta to on-chain activity, so inflows to $SOL products may show that traders are looking for cyclical upside rather than a simple risk-off move in $BTC and $ETH. That shift tends to pull liquidity into venues that make exposure to top altcoins simpler for non-custodial users. For retail, the rotation creates practical needs. New buyers arriving via ETFs want a fast wallet that hides bridge hops. They want fast execution across chains, and early access to projects that might benefit from fresh liquidity. Ease of onboarding and presale access also become practical differentiators when flows migrate down the risk curve. At the same time, self custody remains top of mind. A wallet that removes multi-chain complexity and bakes in institutional-grade security can benefit from this shift. Best Wallet is positioning itself there. Its whitepaper outlines a non-custodial mobile wallet that integrates Fireblocks MPC CMP, in-swap swapping across 6 major chains, and a portal for the best crypto presales on the market. And if ETFs continue to funnel attention toward higher-growth ecosystems, early tokens can surely benefit. Best Wallet Token ( $BEST) , Best Wallet’s official token, offers a secure purchase flow within the wallet and ties user rewards to on-chain activity. The live presale shows significant traction (almost $17M raised), with whales jumping in recently (one dropped $33K a week ago ). This is clear evidence that users want a wallet that doubles as a presale gateway, not just a key manager. Read more about Best Wallet Token in our guide. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Secure Mobile Wallet With Presale Access & Upcoming Analytics Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers Best Wallet, a non-custodial and no-KYC solution built on Ethereum that utilizes Fireblocks MPC CMP to fragment and safeguard keys. That security layer is uncommon among retail wallets and is central to everyday users who want exchange-level protections without sacrificing self-custody. Aside from buying, selling, and swapping cryptocurrencies, Best Wallet will introduce in-app staking, an NFT Gallery, a crypto news feed, and even gas-free transactions in the future. This breadth is clearly strategic. If users arrive for presales, they can stay for daily wallet tasks without switching apps. Currently, the wallet supports: Bitcoin Ethereum Solana Binance Smart Chain Base Polygon But future plans include support for over 60 major chains. As for $BEST holders, they get reduced fees across the ecosystem, early access to screened presales through the Upcoming Tokens portal, and gamified rewards. Staking is also live for presale buyers at a 78% APY, so investing $500 today could lead to $890 in a year’s time, purely based on the staking APY. But careful, the APY drops as more people stake tokens. The current token price is $0.025895, with a total presale raise of $16.8M at the time of writing. To join the presale early, read our ‘How to Buy $BEST’ guide. Payments are available in $ETH, $BNB, $USDT, $USDC, or by card, and the claim process will be handled on site after the sale. These onramps target users coming from ETF-driven interest who want an easy first step into self-custody and alt exposure. And if our $BEST price prediction strikes true, the token could reach a sky-high $0.62 by the end of 2026. That’s nearly a 2,300% increase from today’s price. ETF watchers seeking the next crypto to explode narrative, but who prefer measured exposure, can use Best Wallet Token to explore presales with guardrails. And while power users gain cross-chain routing and multi-wallet support in one mobile interface, newcomers get a simpler purchase flow that sits inside a secure wallet rather than scattered websites. Join the $BEST presale now for just $0.025895 per token.

This sudden plunge is part of an even larger trend, with a total of $1.14 billion worth of futures being liquidated over the last 24 hours . Such significant crypto liquidations highlight the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading in the digital asset space. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations and Why Do They Happen? For those new to the scene, understanding crypto liquidations is crucial. Essentially, a liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens because the trader can no longer meet the margin requirements for their leveraged trade. Imagine you’re trading with borrowed money, or ‘leverage’. If the market moves against your prediction significantly, the exchange steps in to protect itself from losing money. It automatically sells your assets to cover the loan, resulting in a liquidation. This mechanism is common in futures trading, where traders use leverage to amplify potential gains, but also potential losses. The Alarming Scale: What Triggered This Massive Event? The sheer scale of recent crypto liquidations — $109 million in an hour and over a billion in 24 hours — points to significant market movements. Several factors can trigger such large-scale liquidations: Sudden Price Swings: A rapid upward or downward movement in a major cryptocurrency’s price (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) can quickly push leveraged positions past their liquidation thresholds. Market-Moving News: Unexpected news, whether positive or negative, regarding regulations, technological advancements, or macroeconomic factors, can spark panic or euphoria, leading to volatile price action. Whale Activity: Large institutional or individual investors (often called ‘whales’) making substantial trades can create ripples that trigger a cascade of liquidations. Cascading Effects: Once initial liquidations occur, they can add selling pressure to the market, further driving prices down (or up), which then triggers even more liquidations in a chain reaction. The recent event likely stems from a sharp price correction or surge that caught many highly leveraged traders off guard, leading to these substantial losses. Navigating Volatility: How Can Traders Mitigate Risks from Crypto Liquidations? While the allure of high returns through leverage is strong, the reality of massive crypto liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the risks. Here are some actionable insights for traders to navigate such volatile conditions: Practice Prudent Risk Management: Never trade with more than you can afford to lose. Define your risk tolerance before entering any trade. Avoid Excessive Leverage: While leverage can magnify gains, it equally magnifies losses. Use leverage cautiously, especially in unpredictable markets. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: These automated orders sell your assets if they reach a certain price, limiting potential losses and preventing full liquidation. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into a single asset or a single leveraged position. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and sentiment to make informed decisions. Understanding the market and managing your exposure are key to surviving and thriving in the often-turbulent world of crypto trading. Beyond the Numbers: The Broader Market Impact of Crypto Liquidations These large-scale crypto liquidations are more than just individual losses; they have broader implications for the entire market. When numerous positions are liquidated, it often creates a snowball effect. The forced selling can further depress prices, leading to a ‘liquidation cascade’ that exacerbates market downturns. This can also impact investor sentiment, potentially leading to fear and uncertainty, which in turn can drive more traders to close positions or exit the market. Regulatory bodies also closely watch these events, as extreme volatility and large liquidations can draw attention to the need for greater investor protection and market stability measures. The recent $109 million in an hour and $1.14 billion in 24-hour liquidations serve as a stark reminder of the dynamic and often unforgiving nature of the crypto futures market. While opportunities for profit exist, the risks, especially with high leverage, are equally significant. Traders must prioritize robust risk management strategies and maintain a clear understanding of market mechanics to protect their capital. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘liquidated’ mean in crypto trading? A1: In crypto trading, ‘liquidated’ means an exchange has forcefully closed a trader’s leveraged position because their margin (collateral) is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses from the trade. This happens when the market moves significantly against their position. Q2: Why are crypto liquidations so common in futures trading? A2: Crypto liquidations are common in futures trading because traders often use high leverage, meaning they borrow a large amount of capital relative to their initial investment. While this can amplify profits, even small adverse price movements can quickly wipe out their margin, leading to forced closure of their positions. Q3: How can I avoid being liquidated when trading crypto futures? A3: To avoid liquidation, use lower leverage, set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, maintain sufficient margin in your account, and practice sound risk management by not over-committing capital to a single trade. Q4: Do crypto liquidations only happen during market crashes? A4: No, while large-scale crypto liquidations often occur during significant market crashes or sharp downturns, they can also happen during rapid upward price movements. Traders with short positions (betting on a price decrease) can be liquidated if the price suddenly surges. Q5: What is the difference between margin and leverage? A5: Margin is the collateral you put up to open a leveraged position. Leverage is the ratio of borrowed capital to your own capital, allowing you to trade with a larger position size than your initial margin would normally permit. Did you find this article insightful?

It’s one of the most critical suppliers in the AI chain right now, especially as companies like Meta and OpenAI dump billions into data center builds. But those companies still haven’t turned that spending into actual earnings. That hasn’t slowed Foxconn down. Every order for accelerators turns into orders for the servers they sit in, and that’s where Foxconn comes in. Foxconn adds AI server lines in Wisconsin and Texas Despite still pulling a large part of its revenue from building Apple’s iPhones , Foxconn is now more plugged into the AI boom than ever. With iPhone sales stuck at a plateau, the company has shifted focus toward AI-driven demand. Executives said new capacity is being added in Wisconsin and Texas, where Foxconn already runs existing plants. The new U.S. production will focus specifically on AI servers, and both Apple and Nvidia are involved in the expansion strategy. Earnings for Q3 are expected to drop later this month. But Foxconn’s messaging suggests a strong quarter, especially as AI infrastructure continues to pull in cash from every major tech platform. The company’s value in the AI race is its ability to deliver high-volume compute hardware fast, at a time when demand is overwhelming supply. At the Global Management Dialogue held in Tokyo, Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way said the company is pulling production out of China as part of a major global restructure. Three years ago, nearly all of Foxconn’s manufacturing happened in China. Now, 65% remains there, with the rest now spread across Vietnam, India, and Mexico. “We’ve established regional headquarters in these areas,” Liu said, explaining that the goal is to manage local relationships with both governments and business partners more effectively. Liu also addressed the changes generative AI is bringing to the production cycle. “When generative AI happened, that was really disruptive,” he said. “None of us can escape from this change. It will impact all industries.” He added that Foxconn is exploring how to use generative AI internally to shorten the time it takes to develop and ship new technologies. AI demand hits record highs, Microsoft warns of data center strain Takeshi Numoto, Chief Marketing Officer at Microsoft, said AI is spreading faster than the cloud or the internet ever did. He pointed to Microsoft’s internal strategy of acting on early signals in the market, driven by what he called a “culture of curiosity.” Takeshi said the company will double its data center capacity in two years, but pushed back against concerns about a bubble, saying the investment is based on real signals from customers. Joaquin Duato, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, said AI will transform medical research, particularly in imaging and diagnostics, and could turn some cancers into manageable chronic illnesses. He also said the company is focused on eventual cures. Ryan Charland, head of Manulife Japan, said AI will not eliminate human roles in financial services. He said it can be used to equip advisors with customized talking points and fill trust gaps by improving how they explain complex financial topics. “Human connection remains critical,” said Ryan, adding that AI can support advisors in improving financial literacy.

The initial rollout covers 50 physical point-of-sale and 50 digital merchant activations, creating a comprehensive presence across retail, service, and online commerce in Sri Lanka’s emerging digital payment network. Bybit Pay has fortified its presence as a borderless crypto-native payment solution through deep localization and global connectivity. With mobile penetration exceeding 130% and ever-growing digital adoption, Sri Lanka has a vibrant payment ecosystem with significant opportunities for innovation and demands for nimble and affordable digital solutions. The introduction of Bybit Pay will empower crypto-ready payment methods that serve both domestic merchants and international visitors efficiently. Digital Assets: A Trusted Plug-and-Play Solution for Businesses Bybit Pay offers a refreshing take on democratizing access to the digital asset class. No matter the size of the business, and regardless of prior experience of processing crypto-enabled payments, retail stores, service providers and online merchants will be able to set up a physical point of sale when they join the program. Bybit Pay has partnered with Ceylon Cash to launch this initiative in Sri Lanka through CeyPay, enabling local businesses to seamlessly adopt crypto payment solutions and participate in the global movement toward digital asset-enabled commerce. Through the new initiative, Bybit Pay will establish 50 Android POS devices across traditional retail and service merchants, while simultaneously activating 50 digital merchants through a selection process. Application is currently open. Key Benefits Among the many reasons for merchants in Sri Lanka to support Bybit Pay, a few factors stand out that could address core challenges faced by local businesses and consumers: Lightning Speed : Merchant and customers on the Bybit Pay network can confirm real-time payments through instant proof-of-payment via API and ultra-fast settlement, eliminating the multi-day delays common with legacy methods. Affordable Access: A cost-effective way for Sri Lankan businesses to go global, with both local and international payments supported at competitive rates. The cost advantage improves profit margins for small businesses and benefits locals and travellers. Expanding Customer Base: Beyond geographical barriers, merchants also face an increasing generational divide. With Bybit Pay, businesses can enable payments from digital-first and crypto-first consumers who may be otherwise deterred by traditional payment gateways. Trust and Security : With fraud-protection and compliance built in, Bybit Pay’s robust network and security infrastructure enhance payment approval rates, lowering the risk and potential costs of payment disputes for merchants. Freedom to Choose: Payers and merchants have the flexibility to settle in crypto or fiat depending on their preferences. “Sri Lanka’s combination of tech-forward consumers, substantial international tourism, and diverse merchant landscape creates ideal conditions for crypto payment adoption,” said Nazar Tymoshchuk, Regional Manager at Bybit . “This rollout is part of Bybit Pay’s commitment to helping make payments painless, efficient, and borderless for as many people as possible as they travel the world or build their own businesses.” Bybit Pay will publicly announce all 100 selected merchants in a directory for users and continue to grow the merchant network across Sri Lanka. The market entry also supports Sri Lanka’s broader digital transformation initiatives while addressing key business and consumer challenges, positioning participating merchants to better serve both domestic growth and international competitiveness. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

The largest returns in a market cycle are normally observed in top crypto projects that have low entry price, true utility, and distinct developmental growth. One of such projects is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It is still priced under $0.04 and may increase by 25x by the year 2026 as per some analysts expectations. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is at the sixth stage of its presale. Every MUTM token costs $0.035 now. The following step is increasing the price to $0.04 and it is officially set to be launched at $0.06. The current investors investing today are positioned for about 100% MUTM appreciation potential prior to the listing, and possibly more, once launched. Up to now the project has raised in excess of $18.45 million, has drawn in a greater number of holders totalling over 18,000, and sold approximately 790,000,000 tokens, which is approximately 85% of the present stage. Since this early presale, MUTM has already surged by 250% of its Phase 1 price of $0.01 and is in fact climbing round after round. Such a consistent rise is considered by analysts as an indicator of increasing investor confidence, and prospects of the second release of the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is developing an alternative lending model that will be non-custodial and decentralized, leveraging the safety of defi crypto lending, transparency, and making it more accessible to the average user. The protocol is designed to allow users to receive yield by lending their digital assets or borrowing using their holdings without transferring ownership, using smart contracts. Users send tokens to their accounts and get mtTokens which are payable ERC-20 receipts. The yield is automatically documented in the system and this yields passive income without the necessity to reinvest manually. Mutuum Finance employs a buy-and-distribute system to help in token value: a fraction of protocol charges will be used to purchase MUTM in the open market, and then provided back to mtToken holders, which is a generating long-term buying pressure and rewards to the community. Oracle Integration Plans and Stablecoin In addition to lending, Mutuum Finance plans to launch a USD-pegged stablecoin that will be pegged to platform loans. To maintain the balance between supply and demand, the stablecoin will be minted and burnt on demand, and it will create more interest income to the treasury. Mutuum Finance is also planning to utilize decentralized oracle services like Chainlink in order to keep price information accurate and eliminate volatility. These oracles give real-time collateral price feeds and also allow safe liquidations in which collateral values drop below threshold. With these pillars, it is expected by many that MUTM could expand by 15x-25x by the end of 2027 because of adoption and expansion of the ecosystem. V1 Introduction The other significant milestone is the release of V1 of Mutuum Finance on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. V1 shall consist of a liquidity pool, mtToken system, debt tokens and a liquidator bot which will automatically liquidate under-collateralized loans. As V1 is implemented, people will have an opportunity to view the system working in real time. An operational product normally causes an acute post-launch re-pricing of the tokens. The market watchers are already attracted by the increasing number of investors. Whale wallets are making bigger presale commitments and the token is a scarce utility-based DeFi asset that is currently below $0.05. The 24-hour leaderboard keeps the momentum steady as daily winners win $500 worth of MUTM. Mutuum Finance provides an on-card purchasing option, which guarantees that small and big investors can easily invest in the presale. Could MUTM 25x In The Near-Term? MUTM is positioning itself as one of the most valuable coins that are currently priced below $0.05 due to several reasons. The platform will also be able to get first-hand experience as it develops and the investors will be able to join before possible big exchange listing and large-scale marketing campaigns. The utility-based tokenomics of the project are exclusive. Its buy and distribute model directly correlates demand in tokens to lending, not speculation or hype. Lastly, the coming launch of the V1 will signify the transition between the concept and active product itself, which generates momentum in increasing prices and investor confidence. Many say that the token could soar to a price of between $0.40 and $0.60 in the first year of introduction, which could translate into 1,000-1,500% MUTM appreciation when compared to the price at the presale and approximately 25x the value at the Phase 1 entry point.

The cryptocurrency market, known for its electrifying highs and dramatic lows, recently delivered a stark reminder of its inherent volatility. In a stunning display of market forces, a staggering $106 million worth of crypto futures liquidation occurred in just one hour. This rapid unraveling left many traders reeling and highlighted the amplified risks associated with leveraged trading. Over the past 24 hours, the numbers swelled even further, reaching an astounding $873 million in total liquidations across major exchanges. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation, and How Does It Work? Understanding the mechanics behind such massive events is crucial for any crypto enthusiast or trader. Crypto futures liquidation isn’t just a fancy term; it’s a forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. Think of it as a safety mechanism, albeit a painful one for the trader involved. When you trade futures, you’re essentially speculating on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. Many traders use leverage, borrowing funds to amplify their potential gains. However, leverage also magnifies losses. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Leverage: Allows you to trade with more capital than you possess. For example, 10x leverage means a $1,000 investment controls $10,000 worth of crypto. Margin: The collateral you put up to open and maintain your leveraged position. Margin Call: If the market moves against your position, your margin might fall below a required level. The exchange will then issue a margin call, asking you to add more funds. Liquidation: If you fail to meet the margin call, or if the price moves too rapidly, the exchange automatically closes your position to prevent further losses for the platform. This is crypto futures liquidation . What Triggers Such Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation Events? The recent $106 million hourly wipeout, and the larger $873 million over 24 hours, wasn’t a random occurrence. Several factors often converge to create these high-impact crypto futures liquidation cascades. Firstly, sudden and sharp price movements in the underlying cryptocurrency are the most common culprits. A rapid dump or pump can quickly push leveraged positions past their margin limits. Consider these common triggers: Market Volatility: Unforeseen news, regulatory announcements, or macroeconomic shifts can trigger extreme price swings. Whale Activity: Large institutional or individual traders (whales) can execute significant orders, causing immediate price shifts that trap smaller leveraged positions. Cascading Liquidations: When one large position is liquidated, it adds selling (or buying) pressure to the market, which can then trigger further liquidations. This creates a domino effect, accelerating the price movement and leading to even more crypto futures liquidation . Technical Factors: Breaching key support or resistance levels can also ignite panic selling or buying, contributing to the rapid price changes. Navigating the Storm: How Can Traders Mitigate Crypto Futures Liquidation Risks? While the allure of amplified gains through leverage is strong, the stark reality of crypto futures liquidation underscores the importance of robust risk management. It’s not about avoiding volatility entirely, but rather about preparing for it. For instance, the recent events serve as a powerful lesson for all participants. Here are actionable insights to help navigate volatile markets: Understand Leverage: Use leverage cautiously. Higher leverage means a smaller price movement can lead to liquidation. Many experienced traders advocate for lower leverage, especially in highly volatile assets. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Always place stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a certain point. This limits potential losses and prevents full crypto futures liquidation . Manage Your Margin: Keep a close eye on your margin levels. Consider adding more collateral during periods of high volatility or reducing your position size. Diversify: Don’t put all your capital into one highly leveraged position. Diversifying your portfolio can help spread risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and sentiment. Informed decisions are better decisions. The recent episodes of crypto futures liquidation , particularly the $106 million hourly event, are sharp reminders of the unforgiving nature of leveraged trading in the cryptocurrency markets. While the potential for significant returns exists, so too does the risk of rapid and substantial losses. Ultimately, success in this dynamic environment hinges on a deep understanding of market mechanics, disciplined risk management, and a cautious approach to leverage. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and trade wisely to protect your capital. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does “futures liquidated” mean in crypto? When crypto futures are liquidated, it means an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin (collateral) is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses as the market moves against their trade. 2. What causes crypto futures liquidation? The primary causes are sudden, significant price swings in the underlying cryptocurrency, high leverage, and cascading liquidations where one closure triggers many others. 3. Is crypto futures liquidation always a bad thing? For the individual trader whose position is liquidated, it results in a loss of their margin. However, it’s a mechanism exchanges use to manage risk and maintain market stability. 4. How can traders avoid being liquidated? Traders can mitigate liquidation risks by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, actively managing their margin, diversifying their portfolio, and staying informed about market conditions. 5. What is the difference between margin and leverage? Margin is the collateral you put up to open a leveraged position. Leverage is the ratio by which your capital is multiplied, allowing you to control a larger position size with a smaller initial investment.

54053141,621711,1762335053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54053141.jpeg,MARA Reaches Record-High Q3 Revenue as Bitcoin Hyper Becomes One of the Best Altcoins on the Market,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-miner-mara-revenue-bitcoin-hyper-best-altcoins/,"Quick Facts: MARA’s Q3 revenues hit a record high of $252.4M, a 92% increase from 2024’s $131.6M. MARA mined 2,144 $BTC this Q3, over 98% more compared to 2024’s numbers, increasing their yearly Bitcoin production to 53,000 over the span of 12 months. Frederick Thiel, MARA CEO, attributes this growth to the company’s expansion into the AI ecosystem, which grew MARA’s peta hash rate by 20%, while lowering costs by 15%. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) reaches $25.8M in presale and promises faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions once its Layer 2 goes live. Bitcoin mining company MARA just announced record-high revenues for this past Q3, at $252.4M. This represents a 92% increase compared to 2024’s Q3, when the company bagged $131.6M. MARA owes this growth rate to its expanding Bitcoin mining system, which generated 98% more $BTC over a one-year span. The company mined 2,144 $BTC during this Q3 or almost 53,000 between 2024 and 2025. Fred Thiel, MARA’s CEO, explained this mass expansion in the context of adopting open-source AI tech to replace the standard GPUs: We are already seeing the alternatives to GPUs enter the market, and open source AI is making it far easier and much less expensive for companies to deploy advanced AI systems directly in their own private cloud environments. — Frederick Thiel, MARA Holdings Q3 Earnings Call As Salman Khan, MARA’s CFO, explains during the same call, the company’s hash rate grew by roughly 20%, while the cost per peta hash per day dropped 15% over the last year. This allowed MARA to almost double its performance in just 12 months. MARA’s achievement, paired with Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $25.8M presale, could revitalize a slipping Bitcoin which is barely holding above $100K right now. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 solution, Hyper could have an even bigger impact in 2026, promising faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions for a more scalable and performant network. Institutions Support Bitcoin Unconditionally As Fred Thiel himself noticed, Bitcoin has ‘entered its institutional phase’, with names like City Corp, BlackRock, and JP Morgan ‘integrating Bitcoin into traditional frameworks’. Then we have governments and public and private companies hoarding $BTC at an unprecedented rate. As Bitcoin Treasuries data shows, 353 entities hold over 4.05M $BTC and their accumulation rate went up 4.12% over the last 30 days. This ever-expanding ecosystem offers unlimited opportunities and Thiel’s MARA is all for it. As the CEO explained, the company plans to expand on the marriage between Bitcoin and AI tech: Bitcoin mining monetizes underutilized energy and stabilizes grids, while AI inference transforms that same energy into intelligence and productivity. By bringing Bitcoin and AI together, we seek to maximize the value of every megawatt-hour we manage. — Fred Thiel, MARA Holdings Q3 Earnings Call To that end, MARA already secured a partnership with MPLX with the goal of expanding its operations into West Texas. MPLX will offer ‘long-term access to low-cost natural gas at scale’, which will complement MARA’s computing infrastructure for higher throughput. The projected initial capacity goes in the ballpark of 400 megawatts or 1.5 gigawatts across three areas. These developments position MARA to become the leader in Bitcoin mining, which can only work in Bitcoin’s favor. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) contributes to that by promising a faster and cheaper Bitcoin network than ever before. How Bitcoin Hyper Makes Bitcoin Fast, Scalable, and More Performant Than Ever Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) promises a faster, more performant, and more cost-effective Bitcoin network with the help of tools like SVM and the Canonical Bridge. The Canonical Bridge, in particular, addresses Bitcoin’s most pressing issue: its performance limitation. The Bitcoin network is now capped at 7 transactions per second (TPS), which impacts its finality times and increases transaction costs due to the fee-based priority system. The latter is the result of miners prioritizing larger transactions with higher fees in the confirmation queue. Because of this, smaller transactions can sometimes experience confirmation times of hours, which explains the network’s low adoption rate. The Canonical Bridge fixes this issue by minting the users’ bitcoins into the Hyper layer as soon as the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms the transaction details. The entire process lasts seconds, vastly improving Bitcoin’s confirmation times and removing the 7-TPS cap. The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) contributes to the ecosystem’s overall performance by enabling the ultra-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps. This will increase Bitcoin’s ranking on the list of the fastest blockchains today and make the network more feasible for institutional investors. The presale is at over $25.8M so far and it’s growing at a steady pace, despite the October 10 meltdown , which sent the market into a downward spiral. The project’s resilience already ranks it among the best presales of 2025. $HYPER is available at the presale price of $0.013225 and shows great long-term potential. A realistic price prediction for $HYPER puts the token at $1.50 by 2030 for a 5-year ROI of 11,242%. With on-point implementation and widespread adoption, the price can get considerably higher. This makes $HYPER one of the best altcoins to buy this coming Q4. So, if you want it, go to the presale page and buy your $HYPER today. This isn’t financial advice.

The filings, posted between October 31 and November 4, suggest issuers are eyeing mid-November for potential launches. Major Asset Managers Join the XRP ETF Push Earlier today, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart revealed that Franklin Templeton had submitted an amended S-1 featuring shortened “8(a)” language, an important legal tweak that allows a registration to take effect automatically within 20 days, bypassing direct SEC sign-off. The prospectus, dated November 4, outlines that the Franklin XRP Trust will hold the token as its primary asset, tracking its price performance. Both Bitwise and Canary Capital made similar filings last week, removing the “delaying amendment” that normally lets the SEC control approval timing. According to journalist Eleanor Terrett, this move positions Canary’s ETF for a November 13 debut, assuming Nasdaq grants final clearance through its 8-A filing. This approach mirrors the strategy used by issuers of the Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Hedera (HBAR) ETFs last month, which launched under the same automatic rule despite parts of the U.S. government being shut down. Those launches were successful, with Bitwise’s BSOL ETF even recording $56 million in first-day trading volume, the highest among over 850 ETFs launched this year. Broader Market Implications and Investor Outlook The expected XRP ETF wave comes at a time when over 150 crypto ETF filings are pending with the SEC, spanning 35 different digital assets. The Ripple token currently ranks third among all crypto ETF targets, with around 20 separate filings, trailing only Solana and Bitcoin. Industry watchers say these developments show a clear shift in regulatory tone, following the end of Ripple’s five-year legal dispute with the SEC in August 2025. Analysts such as Nate Geraci of NovaDius Wealth Management believe XRP ETFs could “launch within the next two weeks,” marking what he called a “major moment” for mainstream crypto investing.

Orderly Network has just launched a significant ORDER buyback program , signaling a strong commitment to its native token’s value and the overall health of its ecosystem. This strategic move is already generating buzz, as it promises to reshape the dynamics for ORDER token holders. Understanding the ORDER Buyback Program ‘s Core Mechanics Orderly Network, a prominent permissionless, decentralized exchange protocol, has officially commenced a substantial buyback initiative for its native ORDER token . As reported by CryptoBriefing, the network is committing a remarkable portion of its revenue to this program. Specifically, Orderly Network will allocate up to 60% of its net trading fees to purchase ORDER tokens directly from the open market. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a powerful, ongoing mechanism designed to create a deflationary pressure on the token’s circulating supply. Think of it as the network actively reinvesting in its own success. By consistently buying back ORDER tokens , Orderly Network aims to reduce the total number of tokens available, which can positively influence the token’s market dynamics and intrinsic value over time. Why This ORDER Buyback Program is a Strategic Masterstroke For anyone holding ORDER tokens or considering an investment, this initiative brings several compelling benefits that highlight Orderly Network’s forward-thinking strategy: Increased Scarcity: As tokens are purchased and potentially removed from circulation, fewer ORDER tokens will be available on the market. This reduced supply, assuming constant or growing demand, can lead to increased scarcity. Value Appreciation Potential: The classic economic principle of supply and demand suggests that reduced supply, coupled with consistent or rising demand, often translates to upward price pressure for the asset. Enhanced Investor Confidence: A consistent ORDER buyback program demonstrates Orderly Network’s long-term vision and unwavering commitment to its community and token holders. It signals a belief in the project’s future. Sustainable Growth Model: By directly linking the token’s health to the network’s trading volume and success, the buyback program creates a virtuous cycle. As the network grows and generates more fees, more tokens can be bought back, further strengthening the ecosystem. This proactive approach underscores Orderly Network’s dedication to building a robust, transparent, and sustainable ecosystem for its users and investors. Orderly Network’s Commitment: The Impact of the ORDER Buyback Program Beyond the immediate benefits for token holders, the ORDER buyback program sets a significant precedent within the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. It showcases a clear, transparent mechanism for value accrual that aligns incentives between the network’s operational success and its participants. Orderly Network’s core mission is to empower decentralized applications (dApps) with deep liquidity and a powerful trading engine, primarily built on the NEAR protocol. This buyback initiative reinforces its position as a leader in providing robust infrastructure for Web3 trading by adding a strong economic incentive for its native token. The transparency of using a percentage of net trading fees ensures that the buyback is directly tied to the network’s operational performance. This fosters trust and accountability, crucial elements for long-term success in the crypto community. Navigating the Future: What the ORDER Buyback Program Means for Holders If you’re an ORDER token holder, this development is certainly worth understanding. While the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, a consistent buyback mechanism can act as a powerful, fundamental driver for long-term value. It represents a tangible effort by the Orderly Network to support its token’s economic model. It’s an exciting time for the Orderly Network community, as this program is expected to foster greater stability and potential for growth. Keeping an eye on the network’s overall trading volume and fee generation will provide valuable insights into the ongoing impact of the ORDER buyback program . Conclusion The launch of Orderly Network’s ORDER buyback program marks a pivotal moment for the platform and its native token. By strategically reinvesting a significant portion of its trading fees, Orderly Network is not just buying back tokens; it’s actively building a stronger, more valuable, and sustainable future for its entire ecosystem. This initiative truly underscores the network’s commitment to its community and the long-term success of ORDER, setting a new standard for tokenomics in the DeFi space.

Bitcoin (BTC) Hits Key Zone,https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-panic-or-buying-opportunity-bitcoin-btc-hits-key-zone/,"Bitcoin is hovering around $101,800 after a steady decline pushed it below the October 10th low. This level is being watched by market analysts as it matches an earlier area where liquidity was absorbed. With selling pressure increasing and market activity rising, this point could play an important role in what happens next. Price Tests Liquidity Area Below October Crash Bitcoin has seen a drop of over 10% in the last seven days. It is now trading just above $100,000, near a zone that some consider critical. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe said he is watching to see what happens “ when Bitcoin takes the liquidity from the October 10th crash. ” He pointed out that this could lead to a bounce or mark the start of a bottoming phase. Really keen to be seeing what’s happening when #Bitcoin takes the liquidity form the October 10th crash. That should be a key point for potential bounces/bottom formations. Disastrous start of the month. $112K remains the crucial level for any new ATH attempt. pic.twitter.com/x6fDoQBTIk — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 4, 2025 Notably, the price has moved between $99,000 and $104,500 in the past 24 hours (CoinGecko data). Its all-time high remains at $126,080, which it hit 30 days ago. Van de Poppe also noted that a move back to $112,000 would be needed before any serious talk of a new high can begin. Bullish Signals and Recovery Scenarios Analyst Ali Martinez stated , “ Bitcoin could rebound here to at least $106,500 or $112,000 .” The support zone around $100,000 has acted as a base before and may do so again if selling slows. Based on his chart, there are two likely paths: a quick rebound or a small dip before recovering. In both, the first target sits around $106,500. Source: Ali Martinez/X Another analyst, CryptoBull_360, stated that Bitcoin has broken out of an ascending wedge pattern with strong volume. He noted that the price is still trading above the 50-day moving average, which is acting as support. “The price is expected to retest the breakout level, and a break below the 50-day moving average could trigger further declines,” he said. Bearish Pressure and Liquidity Risks Remain Not all signals point to recovery. Analyst Ted pointed to two areas with large liquidity: around $90,000 and near $126,000. He warned that “ a dump to fill the CME gap before reversal could happen .” The option market is showing smaller moves, which often means traders are unsure and staying out for now. Reports also show that recent buying has not gained much strength. Self-custody is rising, but buyers aren’t stepping in with enough volume. Meanwhile, treasury firm Sequans Communications sold 970 BTC, cutting its holdings by nearly one-third. The firm used the sale to reduce its debt from $189 million to $94.5 million. So far, the zone between $100,000 and $102,000 is holding, but pressure remains. Whale wallets sold off $272 million worth of Bitcoin, as previously reported . If that trend continues, bulls may struggle to defend current levels. The $112,000 mark remains a key area for any larger recovery. Until that point is regained, Bitcoin may stay in a holding pattern. The post Crypto Panic or Buying Opportunity?

This recent dip has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting crucial questions about market stability and future trajectories. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at approximately $102,998.43 on the Binance USDT market. Such price movements are vital indicators, and understanding their implications is paramount for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Decoding the Bitcoin Price Dip: What Just Happened? The immediate reaction to Bitcoin’s price movement is often one of caution. When Bitcoin falls below $103,000 , it signals a shift in market sentiment, even if temporary. This particular drop means that the psychological support level around $103,000, which many traders observe, has been breached. While a single price point doesn’t define the entire market, it certainly draws attention to potential underlying changes. Market data from various exchanges, including Binance, confirms this trading activity. Such movements are a natural part of the cryptocurrency cycle, characterized by periods of rapid growth and subsequent corrections. However, the exact reasons behind each significant dip are often multifaceted and require a closer look. Why Did Bitcoin Fall Below $103,000? Exploring Potential Factors Several factors can contribute to a sudden price decline in the crypto market. When Bitcoin falls below $103,000 , it could be influenced by a combination of macroeconomic trends, regulatory news, or even large-scale selling by significant holders, often called “whales.” Consider these potential influences: Global Economic Indicators: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation data or interest rate changes from central banks, can impact investor appetite for riskier assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Announcements: News regarding new regulations or enforcement actions in major markets can create uncertainty and lead to sell-offs. Technical Resistance: Traders often use technical analysis to identify price levels where selling pressure might increase. Breaking below key support levels can trigger further automated selling. Profit-Taking: After periods of upward movement, some investors might decide to take profits, leading to a temporary downward correction. Understanding these underlying dynamics helps in interpreting market shifts beyond just the immediate price action. Impact on the Crypto Market: What’s Next for Investors? A significant move like Bitcoin falls below $103,000 often has ripple effects across the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin, being the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often dictates the general direction of altcoins. Here’s what investors might observe: Altcoin Volatility: Many altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead. A drop in BTC can often lead to amplified dips in other digital assets. Investor Sentiment: Market sentiment can quickly turn bearish, leading to increased fear and uncertainty, which can further fuel selling pressure. Trading Opportunities: Conversely, experienced traders might view such dips as buying opportunities, accumulating assets at lower prices in anticipation of a rebound. It is crucial for investors to remain calm and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price fluctuations. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio When the market experiences a notable event, such as when Bitcoin falls below $103,000 , having a clear strategy is paramount. Panic selling is rarely the best approach. Instead, consider these actionable insights to manage your portfolio effectively: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reputable news sources and market analysis to understand the broader context of price movements. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This strategy helps to average out your purchase price over time. Diversification: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with any single asset’s performance. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear stop-loss orders if you are actively trading to limit potential losses. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin has historically recovered from significant dips. A long-term holding strategy (HODLing) often proves beneficial for those who believe in its fundamental value. These strategies can help you navigate market volatility with greater confidence and potentially turn challenges into opportunities. In conclusion, while the news that Bitcoin falls below $103,000 might seem alarming, it is a reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Such events underscore the importance of informed decision-making, strategic planning, and a calm approach. Staying updated with market trends and understanding the factors influencing price movements are key to successfully navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when Bitcoin falls below $103,000? A1: When Bitcoin falls below a specific psychological level like $103,000, it often indicates increased selling pressure and a potential shift in short-term market sentiment. It can also trigger further automated selling if many traders had stop-loss orders around that price. Q2: What factors typically cause Bitcoin’s price to drop? A2: Bitcoin’s price can drop due to various factors, including macroeconomic concerns (e.g., inflation, interest rates), regulatory news, large sell-offs by whales, profit-taking by investors, or negative technical indicators. Q3: Should I sell my Bitcoin when the price drops? A3: This depends on your individual investment strategy and risk tolerance. Panic selling during a dip can lock in losses. Many long-term investors prefer to hold (HODL) or even buy more through dollar-cost averaging during downturns, believing in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Q4: How can investors protect their portfolios during a Bitcoin price dip? A4: Investors can protect their portfolios by diversifying their holdings, practicing dollar-cost averaging, setting clear risk management strategies (like stop-loss orders), and only investing capital they can afford to lose. Staying informed and avoiding emotional decisions are also crucial. Q5: Is this a buying opportunity for Bitcoin? A5: For some investors, a price dip can be seen as a buying opportunity, allowing them to acquire Bitcoin at a lower cost. However, it’s essential to conduct your own research, assess market conditions, and align any buying decisions with your personal investment strategy and financial goals.

The launch of its new ClickUp AI Assistant , integrated into a comprehensively redesigned productivity platform , marks a significant leap forward in how teams manage their daily operations. For those invested in the future of technology and streamlined workflows, this development is more than just an upgrade; it’s a strategic move to redefine the very essence of work software . The Dawn of Intelligent Work: What’s New with ClickUp AI Assistant? ClickUp 4.0 introduces a suite of powerful artificial intelligence capabilities, fundamentally altering the user experience. The company’s vision, as articulated by CEO Zeb Evans, has always been to consolidate all work software into one flexible platform. With this release, that vision takes a monumental step closer to reality, powered by intelligent automation and smart assistance. Central to this transformation are two distinct yet complementary AI agents : Communication Channel Agent: This proactive agent is embedded within all communication channels. Its primary function is to intelligently scan conversations for potential questions and provide immediate, relevant answers. What makes it truly remarkable is its ability to pull knowledge from both internal company resources and external platforms like Google Drive, OneDrive, Figma, and Gmail, creating a unified knowledge base at your fingertips. Imagine fewer interruptions and faster problem-solving within your team. Brain: Aptly named, ‘Brain’ is a general-purpose AI assistant designed to elevate individual and team productivity. Living conveniently in the sidebar, Brain is accessible across the entire ClickUp interface. Its capabilities are extensive: Idea Generation: Kickstart brainstorming sessions with AI-powered suggestions. Task Automation: Schedule meetings based on team availability, add comments to tasks, or even create new tasks automatically. Information Retrieval: Access the web and other integrated tools to fetch necessary data. Data Analysis: Analyze reports and provide actionable insights. Content Creation: Draft emails, documents, or summaries, saving valuable time. These AI agents are not just tools; they are intelligent companions designed to reduce friction, automate routine tasks, and free up human potential for more strategic work. How Does ClickUp 4.0 Enhance Your Productivity Platform? The redesign of ClickUp’s productivity platform goes beyond just adding AI. It’s about creating a more fluid, intuitive, and integrated environment for work. The core idea is to make switching between different aspects of your work — tasks, documents, and communications — seamless and effortless. Key enhancements include: Streamlined Navigation: The updated sidebar now provides quick access to your internal company forum timeline, various communication channels, and different task views, ensuring you can find what you need without context switching. Intelligent Calendar Tool: ClickUp’s calendar can now dynamically adjust meetings and tasks. Mark a task as a priority, and the system intelligently reconfigures your schedule to accommodate it, optimizing your time management. Unified Team Dashboard: Leaders gain a comprehensive, internet-style dashboard. This central hub displays updates from different channels, offers team analytics on work progress, and even tracks who has time off, providing a holistic view of team operations. Advanced Communication Features: Building on last year’s introduction of AI-powered summaries and live video/audio calls (Syncups), ClickUp 4.0 places a Syncup button in every channel. Furthermore, its AI notetaker can now record, transcribe, and distribute notes from these live calls, ensuring everyone stays informed and decisions are well-documented. These features collectively aim to create a cohesive work environment, minimizing the need to jump between multiple applications and centralizing critical information. The Strategic Edge: Competing with the Giants through Enterprise Search A crucial element enabling ClickUp’s ambitious 4.0 release is its strategic acquisition of Qatalog, an enterprise search startup. Qatalog, which had garnered significant backing from investors like Salesforce Ventures and Atomico, brought advanced search capabilities to ClickUp’s arsenal. This acquisition has allowed ClickUp to build a truly unified knowledge graph, enabling its AI assistants to draw information from disparate sources both inside and outside the company. This enhanced enterprise search functionality is vital in ClickUp’s quest to better compete with established players like Notion, Slack, and Microsoft Teams. While these platforms excel in specific areas (Notion for documents, Slack/Teams for communication), ClickUp aims to provide a singular, comprehensive solution encompassing calendar, communication, documents, task tracking, and now, intelligent search and AI assistance, all under one roof. The ability to quickly find information across all integrated tools and data sources is a significant differentiator in today’s information-rich, time-poor work environments. The Future of Work Software: ClickUp’s Ambitious Vision ClickUp CEO Zeb Evans emphasized the long-term vision during a call with Bitcoin World: ""Eight years ago, when we started, the vision and the strategy were to replace all of your work software. The strategy to do that was to build a flexible data models platform that can be used essentially for anything, and build primitives of software like a spreadsheet, a table, a document, and a task. In the age of AI, they’re needed to an even greater extent because you can’t really visualize things in AI within a chat interface."" This statement underscores ClickUp’s commitment to building a robust foundation that can evolve with technological advancements, especially AI. The company has demonstrated impressive growth, crossing $300 million in annual recurring revenue and securing over $537 million in funding from prominent investors like a16z and Tiger Global. With this momentum, ClickUp plans to go public within the next two years, signaling strong confidence in its market position and future trajectory. The integration of advanced AI into its work software is not just about automation; it’s about fundamentally changing how teams interact with their tools and each other, paving the way for unprecedented levels of efficiency and collaboration.

Traders have shifted away from high-risk assets and into stablecoins. Crypto presales have been attractive too, due to their low, early-bird entry point and potential to explode. Bitcoin Hyper emerged as one of the winners in the current market downturn, having raised over $25.8M to date in its ongoing token presale. Bitcoin ($BTC) fell below $100K yesterday, as uncertainty continued to cause panic across the crypto market. It’s the first time the world’s largest crypto dropped to this level since May this year. For opportunists, however, the crash has been a good opportunity to buy the dip. A handful of the best crypto presales continued to pump as well. Among these is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which has already raised over $25.8M so far in its crypto fundraiser. $1.74B Liquidated in the Last 24 Hours with Traders Shifting to Stablecoins With uncertainty still looming over the market, over $1.74B worth of positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, with longs accounting for $1.33B of the total, according to Coinglass data. Bitcoin positions lost $504.81M during the same period, just second to Ethereum ($ETH) with $577.08M worth of positions wiped out. Various factors, such as the US tariff threats on China and uncertainty brought about by the US government shutdown, have dragged down Bitcoin’s value. The crypto market is deep in ‘Fear’ territory , according to CoinMarketCap’s Fear and Greed Index. As Glider CEO Brian Huang notes in an interview with Decrypt, traders are pivoting away from high-risk assets and into stablecoins. Aside from stablecoins, traders are also looking into token presales, as these offer low entry points with steady price increases amid the market crash. Among these presales, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has emerged as one of the winners, as it continues to rake in millions of dollars from investors. Bitcoin Hyper: There’s No Stopping One of 2025’s Hottest Presales Depending on one’s point of view, the current situation can be seen as part of the market’s growing pains as it starts to mature. While meme coins have been favorites in the past, traders now tend to prefer tokens with actual utility. A classic example of this is the ongoing Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale. At the very least, its $HYPER can be used to pay for transaction costs in the Layer-2 (L2) network that the project team is developing. But aside from that, it’ll give you governance rights as well as access to exclusive features on the L2. The L2, in particular, has drawn a lot of attention from investors, as it will integrate the Solana Virtual Machine . This will make transactions faster and cheaper in the Bitcoin ecosystem, which can currently handle only up to seven transactions per second . In addition, the L2 will feature a canonical bridge , which will allow you to send your $BTC from the base network to the L2 and use it for a variety of applications like staking and interacting with dApps – things you can’t do at the moment with your Bitcoin. Be sure to check out our comprehensive Bitcoin Hyper review where we discuss all the details of this exciting project. For now, you can grab $HYPER tokens at $0.013225 each at the official Bitcoin Hyper presale page . You can claim your tokens at the end of the presale or stake it right away to earn passive rewards set at 45% p.a. Alternatively, HODL your tokens and wait for their value to appreciate further. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , $HYPER has the potential to reach $0.20 in 2026, making long-term investing an attractive option. Need step-by-step instructions on how to buy $HYPER tokens? Our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper has you covered. To date, the presale has already raised over $25.8M – and counting. This easily makes it one of this year’s hottest fundraisers, and for good reason. Its combination of actual token utility and a promising aim to give the Bitcoin ecosystem a much-needed upgrade checks the right boxes when it comes to a top new cryptocurrency with a huge potential upside. But hurry, since there are less than two days before the next price increase. That means it could be your last chance to buy $HYPER tokens at its current price. Ready to jump in? Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Always do your own research before making any investment.

A new proposal from the European Commission (EC) aims to centralize EU crypto oversight under the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), a move that is meeting fierce resistance. This potential shift in regulatory power has sparked an urgent debate about the future of innovation and growth within Europe’s rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Why Centralized EU Crypto Oversight Raises Eyebrows The European Commission is currently drafting a proposal to grant ESMA significant supervisory authority over the crypto sector. While the intention might be to streamline regulation and enhance investor protection, many in the industry view this as a potentially stifling development. ESMA’s Role: ESMA is an EU financial regulatory agency responsible for contributing to the stability and effectiveness of the financial system. Granting it direct supervisory power over crypto would be a significant expansion of its mandate. The Proposal’s Scope: The draft suggests that ESMA would handle crucial aspects like licensing and ongoing supervision for crypto firms across the EU. This centralized approach to EU crypto oversight is seen by many as a step that could inadvertently harm the very sector it seeks to regulate. Is Innovation at Risk with Centralized EU Crypto Oversight? One of the loudest voices against the proposal comes from Faustine Fleuret, head of public policy at DeFi lending protocol Morpho. She argues that excessive regulatory authority vested in ESMA could significantly slow the pace of innovation within Europe’s crypto and fintech industries. Fleuret highlights several key concerns: Resource Drain: If ESMA were to handle all licensing and supervision, it would require vast resources, potentially leading to bottlenecks and delays. Reduced Flexibility: A centralized body might struggle to adapt quickly to the fast-evolving nature of crypto, reducing decision-making speed for startups and emerging projects. Impact on Early-Stage Companies: For nascent projects, close cooperation with national regulators is often essential. A shift to a distant, centralized authority could sever these vital local ties. These concerns suggest that while uniform EU crypto oversight might seem efficient on paper, its practical application could hinder the agility required for technological advancement. How Might Centralization Affect Europe’s Crypto Future? The debate around this proposed EU crypto oversight model extends beyond immediate operational challenges. It touches upon Europe’s strategic position in the global crypto landscape. The continent has often aimed to be a leader in balanced crypto regulation, exemplified by the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. However, a highly centralized approach could inadvertently push innovative projects and talent towards jurisdictions with more agile or less burdensome regulatory environments. The industry fears that instead of fostering growth, this move could lead to stagnation. Maintaining a competitive edge means balancing robust regulation with an environment that encourages experimentation and growth. The current proposal for EU crypto oversight , according to its critics, leans too heavily on the former at the expense of the latter. Finding a Balance: The Path Forward for EU Crypto Oversight The pushback from the crypto industry isn’t necessarily against regulation itself, but rather against a specific model of centralization. Many stakeholders advocate for a more nuanced approach that leverages existing national expertise while still achieving harmonized standards. Key considerations for a balanced framework include: Subsidiarity: Allowing national regulators to handle day-to-day supervision for smaller entities, while ESMA focuses on cross-border issues or larger, systemic risks. Clear Guidelines: Providing transparent and predictable rules that support innovation rather than creating ambiguity. Industry Dialogue: Continuous engagement with industry participants to understand their operational realities and incorporate feedback into policy-making. Ultimately, the goal of effective EU crypto oversight should be to protect consumers and maintain financial stability without inadvertently stifling the very innovation that drives the sector forward. The ongoing discussions will be crucial in shaping a regulatory framework that serves both purposes. Conclusion: The Crossroads of Regulation and Innovation The European Commission’s proposal to centralize EU crypto oversight under ESMA has ignited a significant debate within the crypto industry. While the ambition for a cohesive regulatory environment is understandable, concerns about innovation, resource allocation, and the agility of startups are valid and demand careful consideration. The challenge now lies in crafting a regulatory framework that can safeguard market integrity and consumer interests, while simultaneously nurturing Europe’s potential as a hub for digital asset innovation. The outcome of this pushback will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of crypto in the EU for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is ESMA and what is its proposed role in EU crypto oversight? ESMA, the European Securities and Markets Authority, is an EU financial regulatory agency. The European Commission’s draft proposal seeks to grant ESMA supervisory power over the crypto sector, including licensing and ongoing supervision of crypto firms across the EU. Why is the crypto industry opposing this centralization of EU crypto oversight? The industry, represented by figures like Faustine Fleuret of Morpho, fears that centralizing all regulatory authority under ESMA could slow innovation, reduce decision-making flexibility for startups, require vast resources, and diminish the essential role of national regulators for early-stage companies. How might this proposal impact crypto innovation in Europe? Critics argue that a centralized approach might lead to slower adaptation to new technologies, create bureaucratic bottlenecks, and potentially deter innovative projects from establishing or growing within the EU, thereby hindering Europe’s competitiveness in the global crypto landscape. What is MiCA, and how does it relate to this discussion? MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) is a landmark EU regulation designed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto-assets. While MiCA provides the rules, the current debate focuses on who will supervise these rules – a centralized ESMA or a more distributed approach involving national regulators, especially concerning EU crypto oversight . What alternative approaches are being suggested for EU crypto oversight? Industry stakeholders suggest a more nuanced approach, advocating for national regulators to handle day-to-day supervision for smaller entities, while ESMA focuses on broader, cross-border or systemic risks. They also call for clear guidelines and continuous dialogue with the industry. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

The report gives a comprehensive analysis of crypto derivatives , macroeconomic outlook, and trader sentiment following the $6 billion liquidation on October 10. Sources: Bybit, Block Scholes The liquidation, triggered by renewed U.S.–China trade tensions, prompted widespread deleveraging in perpetual swap markets. Though conditions briefly improved after a subsequent trade deal, any brief optimism was overshadowed by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish remarks during the FOMC press conference. With trader sentiment uncertain, Bitcoin ( BTC ) sank to $107,000 and short-term put-call skews turned negative. Derivatives open interest stagnates as volatility persists According to the report, notional open interest in perpetual contracts remains below $10 billion, showing little sign of recovery since the selloff. Despite record highs in the U.S. equities market, BTC is struggling to break out of the narrow $105,000–$115,000 range. Options activity has increased, however, suggesting sustained hedging demand. Rising at-the-money implied volatility and steady interest in short-term puts point to traders maintaining defensive exposure rather than re-leveraging. WLFI token rebounds but market sentiment mixed World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralized finance ( DeFi ) platform backed by President Donald Trump and his family, saw its governance token WLFI climb 25% to $0.15 following an 8.4 million WLFI airdrop to early users. However, unstable perpetual funding rates indicate uncertainty remains around the token’s long-term price action. Sources: Bybit, Block Scholes Ultimately, the report suggests the derivatives market is slowly finding its footing after a period of heavy deleveraging. Still traders remain cautious, holding off on aggressive positioning as they wait for clearer signals on monetary policy and geopolitical developments. Featured image via Shutterstock.

Toyota made that forecast even as it warned that new U.S. import tariffs will cost the company 1.45 trillion yen, saying it expects stronger results over the full year despite pressure on quarterly performance. For the quarter that ended in September, Toyota reported operating profit of 834 billion yen, below expectations of 863.1 billion yen. At the same time, revenue increased to 12.38 trillion yen (about $81 billion), compared with analyst estimates of 12.18 trillion yen. Toyota’s net income for the quarter came in at 972.9 billion yen, and the company said that firm demand in Japan and North America helped maintain sales strength even under new trade costs. “Despite the impact of U.S. tariffs, strong demand supported by the competitiveness of our products has led to increased sales volumes mainly in Japan and North America and has expanded value chain profits,” said Toyota on Wednesday. Tariffs weigh on Toyota’s operating profit and U.S. market The 3rd quarter was the second straight decline in operating profit for Toyota since the United States introduced “reciprocal” tariffs in April. A trade agreement between Tokyo and Washington in July lowered the originally proposed 25% tariff to 15%, with the new rate taking effect on August 7. Even so, automobile shipments from Japan to the U.S. have continued to slide. Exports decreased 24.2% in September, following a 28.4% drop in August. Toyota said that import tariffs remain the biggest drag on U.S.-related profits. In Japan, currency movements and higher costs also pressured earnings. While Toyota manufactures extensively in North America, about one-fifth of U.S. sales still depend on imported vehicles. The company is absorbing tariff costs on those imports rather than passing them on to customers. Liz Lee, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said, “We’re expecting profitability to remain under pressure in [the current quarter] as tariff and currency headwinds persist, with gradual improvement likely from the [March quarter] onwards.” Lee added that next fiscal year could bring some relief if trade expenses stabilize and the yen weakens, but noted that competition from electric vehicle makers will remain a challenge. “Profitability should recover modestly next fiscal year if trade costs stabilize and the yen weakens, though rising EV competition will continue to cap upside potential,” she said. Hybrid sales drive growth while battery EV lineup remains limited Toyota has been increasing its focus on electrified vehicles, and 46.9% of all Toyota and Lexus sales in the first half of the fiscal year came from that category. Most of these sales were hybrid electric vehicles, especially in North America and China, where demand for hybrid systems remains strong. However, Toyota currently has a limited lineup of fully battery-powered EVs. Lee noted that this may leave the company more exposed to competition from Chinese EV manufacturers expanding in Europe and Southeast Asia. Despite tight margins, global demand for Toyota’s vehicles has remained steady. The company reported 5.3 million vehicle sales in the nine months to September, a 4.7% increase from the same period last year. This total includes Toyota’s Lexus luxury brand.

The pushback from banking associations intensified this week as both community banks and Wall Street lobbying groups mounted coordinated efforts to block crypto firms from securing federal banking licenses. Grewal fired back after the Independent Community Bankers of America urged federal regulators to deny Coinbase’s charter application for its subsidiary, Coinbase National Trust Company. “ Imagine opposing a regulated trust charter because you prefer crypto to stay… unregulated ,” Grewal wrote on X, adding that bank lobbyists are attempting to “ dig regulatory moats to protect their own. “ Imagine opposing a regulated trust charter because you prefer crypto to stay … unregulated.

The banking group’s letter claims the application exhibits fundamental deficiencies in governance, profitability, sustainability, and receivership complexity, particularly during crypto bear markets when both Coinbase and its subsidiary would face simultaneous financial pressure. The ICBA letter also challenges the legal validity of OCC Interpretive Letter 1176, which permits national trust banks to engage in non-fiduciary activities beyond traditional trust services. ICBA urged the @USOCC to deny Coinbase’s application for a national trust bank charter for its subsidiary, Coinbase National Trust Co. The application fails to meet statutory chartering standards and would set a dangerous precedent for the structure of the U.S. banking system.… — Independent Community Bankers of America (@ICBA) November 4, 2025 The banking group contends that this interpretive letter was issued without the required public notice and comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act, rendering it legally invalid as a basis for Coinbase’s application. Meanwhile, a separate banking lobby emerged in the stablecoin debate. The American Bankers Association and 52 state banking associations submitted a joint letter to the Treasury Department on November 4, urging strict enforcement of the GENIUS Act’s prohibition on stablecoin interest payments. The coordinated response addresses what banks view as a “loophole” allowing digital asset platforms to circumvent the law by offering interest through affiliates rather than directly from stablecoin issuers. Stablecoin Interest Debate Intensifies The banking associations warned that without a broad interpretation of the interest ban, digital asset platforms may exploit loopholes through high-yield rewards and incentives, which would undermine the law’s intent to keep stablecoins as payment tools rather than investment vehicles. Senator Mike Rounds previously told Politico the interest workaround “looks like an end-run on the original legislation.” At the same time, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller stated stablecoins should function as pure payment instruments, not interest-bearing deposits. “ It’s not an investment vehicle. It’s not a time deposit where you’re holding it to earn interest ,” he said. The banking groups argue that interest-bearing stablecoins could trigger a 25.9% loss in bank deposits, eliminating approximately $1.5 trillion in lending capacity and shrinking small business and farm credit by $110 billion and $62 billion, respectively. Community banks serving rural and underserved areas would face disproportionate impact from deposit outflows to yield-generating stablecoins. Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad dismissed the banking concerns, stating that the GENIUS Act explicitly permits third-party rewards programs and distinguishes them from issuer-paid interest. The GENIUS Act is clear that rewards are allowed. Third party rewards programs and interest paid by the issuer are not the same thing. Congress answered this question. The @ABABankers letter admits as much. End of story. https://t.co/CMKqgDsWcO — Faryar Shirzad (@faryarshirzad) November 4, 2025 “ Congress answered this question ,” Shirzad wrote , suggesting the banking industry’s letter acknowledges this distinction while attempting to reopen settled legislative intent. Review Process and Industry Implications The OCC is expected to take between 12 and 18 months to review Coinbase’s application, with public comments potentially influencing the agency’s decision. The agency is currently led by Comptroller Jonathan Gould, a former chief legal officer of Bitfury, who has criticized the banking sector’s reluctance to work with crypto companies. Beyond Coinbase, similar opposition from the Bank Policy Institute targets trust charter applications from Ripple, Circle, and Paxos. Anchorage Digital remains the only crypto firm with an approved national trust bank charter, granted in January 2021. If stablecoins become more integrated into the traditional financial system without full safeguards, crypto market shocks could infect the broader economy for the first time. Read the latest from BPI: https://t.co/boQL7TutWm — Bank Policy Institute (@bankpolicy) November 3, 2025 Looking forward, the concentrated wave of banking industry resistance shows that traditional financial institutions view crypto firms’ pursuit of federal charters as a fundamental threat to their competitive position in custody and payment services.

Following the decline in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, liquidations reached billions of dollars, while BTC fell below $100,000 and Ethereum (ETH) fell to $3,000. Some investors see this decline as a buying opportunity and buy more, while others continue to sell. At this point, cryptocurrency analysis platform Lookonchain said that MARA Holdings sold $236 million worth of BTC after steady accumulation. According to data from Lookonchain, Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings, a frequent buyer of BTC, has suddenly started selling its BTC holdings. Over the past 12 hours, addresses believed to belong to MARA Holdings transferred a total of 2,348 BTC (worth approximately $236 million) to various platforms including FalconX, 2Prime, Galaxy Digital, and Coinbase Prime. Following these transactions, MARA Holdings still holds 53,250 BTC worth approximately $6.17 billion. Ethereum Whales Are Accumulating! While Mara Holding is attracting attention with its Bitcoin transaction, Ethereum whales are taking advantage of the huge drop in ETH. According to Lookonchain data, five Ethereum whales capitalized on the recent market decline by amassing 323,523 ETH worth $1.12 billion over the past two days, at an average purchase price of $3,469. *This is not investment advice.

Data from Farside Investors showed that spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $578 million in net outflows — the steepest daily withdrawal since mid-October. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s FBTC led the exodus, signaling a pause in institutional accumulation. Ether ETFs saw similar pressure, with $219 million in redemptions. Fidelity’s FETH and BlackRock’s ETHA were hit hardest, pushing total Ether ETF outflows close to $1 billion since late October. Solana Defies Trend With Six Days of Inflows While Bitcoin and Ether funds struggled, Solana-based ETFs continued to attract capital. Spot Solana ETFs logged $14.83 million in net inflows on Tuesday — their sixth consecutive day of gains. Bitwise’s BSOL and Grayscale’s GSOL led the charge, suggesting that investors are rotating toward newer, yield-generating assets despite the risk-off environment. Institutions Reduce Exposure Amid Macro Uncertainty Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph the outflows are more about macroeconomic stress than fading belief in crypto. “Straight days of redemptions show institutions are trimming risk as leverage unwinds and macro jitters rise,” Liu said. “Until liquidity conditions stabilize, capital rotation will keep the ETF bleed alive.” He added that a stronger U.S. dollar and tightening liquidity have triggered broad risk aversion. Solana’s Story Gains Momentum Liu noted that Solana’s continued inflows represent a mix of curiosity and opportunity. “Solana’s strength is partly fresh flow meets fresh story, a new ETF with yield appeal pulling in curious capital,” he explained. “Its speed, staking, and story keep momentum tilted upward.” However, Liu warned that Solana’s growth remains niche. “It’s a narrative-driven move by early adopters chasing yield and growth.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Now Pointing At ‘Extreme Fear’ The “ Fear & Greed Index ” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the sentiment that’s present among the average trader in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The index uses the data of the following five factors to determine the investor mentality: trading volume, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, volatility, and Google Trends. To represent the sentiment, it utilizes a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values above 53 signal a net sentiment of greed, while those under 47 imply fear in the market. The indicator being between the two cutoffs naturally indicates a neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiment zones, there are also two special regions called the extreme fear and extreme greed . The former occurs below 25 and latter above 75. Historically, the extreme sentiments have held much importance for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as they are where major tops and bottoms have tended to form. The relationship between sentiment and price has been an inverse one, however, meaning extreme fear facilitates bottoms, while extreme greed results in tops. Followers of a trading technique called “contrarian investing” exploit this fact to time their moves. Warren Buffet’s famous quote sums up the idea, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” After the latest crash in Bitcoin and altcoins, sentiment among investors has worsened into the extreme fear zone, as the Fear & Greed Index shows. As is visible above, the Fear & Greed Index is down to 21 on Tuesday, a sharp change compared to Monday’s value of 42, nearly in the neutral zone. The current extreme fear sentiment is the strongest since April. Interestingly, that low in April coincided with a bottom in the Bitcoin price. The reverse side of the pattern played out in early October, when Bitcoin formed its top above $126,000 alongside a Fear & Greed Index value of 74, right at the boundary of extreme greed. With the trader sentiment now back inside the extreme fear zone, it only remains to be seen whether a bottom will follow for the market. In the past, the index has often stayed inside the region for an extended period before a turnaround, so it could be a while for BTC this time as well. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $100,400, down more than 11% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Extreme Fear|Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index|bitcoin sentiment|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-05 10:00:28

This has sparked concerns as ETH nears important support levels, putting its $3,000 mark at danger. October Events Lead To Significant Corrections Ram Ahluwalia, the chief investment officer at Lumida Wealth, recently noted that the roots of this latest crypto sell-off can be traced back to the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) October meeting. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Falls Under $100,000: Elliott Wave Analysis Forecasts Decline To $70,000 On October 29, the central bank announced its second interest-rate cut of the year. However, during the subsequent press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed uncertainty about the possibility of another reduction in December. According to Ahluwalia’s analysis, this has been detrimental to Bitcoin and the overall crypto market, as lower interest rates typically bolster speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Adding to the ongoing Ethereum price correction, mid-October saw US President Donald Trump announce new tariffs on China due to its restrictions on rare earth exports. This announcement triggered a flight of investors from cryptocurrencies to safer assets such as gold. Ethereum Price Under Pressure From a technical perspective, analysts at The Birb Nest have highlighted key levels to watch. On social media platform X (formerly Twitter), they noted that the Ethereum price broke below a critical weekly support level, which they interpret as a major deviation until price action proves otherwise. They highlighted that a breakdown below the altcoin’s yearly open of $3,337 might push the Ethereum price to $2,800. For a positive reversal, they believe ETH must retake $4,000 and close above this level on a weekly basis. Related Reading: Caution In The Crypto Market: Expert Warns Of Bearish Phase Unfolding This November Additionally, the ETH/BTC pairing is under scrutiny, with prices trading below the yearly open at 0.0355. To target a rise towards 0.04, reclaiming this level is essential. Until then, analysts are watching for potential retests around 0.0325–0.03. However, some experts, such as Ali Martinez, caution against overly optimistic projections. He warns of a worst-case scenario in which the Ethereum price fails to reclaim the $4,000 mark, and potentially drops to as low as $2,400 or even $1,700. A decline of this magnitude would mean an additional 45% increase for ETH, which could also lead to a deeper correction in the broader altcoin market. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,100. This represents a significant gap of 32% between the current trading prices and the all-time highs, which could not be re-tested before the end of the year unless a new recovery occurs before the weekly close.

Yet, according to prominent crypto analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark), this period of low activity may not be a sign of weakness but rather a signal of strength building beneath the surface. His comments have reignited confidence among the XRP community that this consolidation period could precede a significant upward move. Dark Defender shared his view on X, writing, “When the tide pulls back, don’t panic — that’s when the tsunami is coming.” He described the current state of the market as one where “liquidity dried up, sentiment cooled & attention faded,” emphasizing that such conditions often set the stage for large movements . His message to the XRP community was to stay ready, because “The tide doesn’t pull back forever,” and he sees the current market position as the “Perfect set-up for the next massive TSUNAMI WAVE!” When the tide pulls back, don’t panic — that’s when the tsunami is coming. Silence increased with the pullback. Liquidity dried up, sentiment cooled & attention faded Perfect set-up, for the next massive TSUNAMI WAVE! Stay positioned #XRPArmy ! The tide doesn’t pull back… — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) November 3, 2025 Market Conditions Reflect Strategic Accumulation Market phases characterized by lower trading volumes and reduced volatility often serve as consolidation periods where long-term holders strengthen their positions. Analysts like Dark Defender interpret these pullbacks as moments when speculative traders exit and committed investors quietly accumulate. XRP has historically shown this pattern before major price surges, and Dark Defender’s remarks align with that perspective. The reduction in liquidity and public attention, rather than signaling decline, can indicate the market is stabilizing ahead of renewed demand. The analyst sees the quiet phase as an opportunity for strategic positioning rather than retreat. His view reflects a disciplined approach to market psychology, where patience and conviction take precedence over reaction to short-term sentiment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Resilient Market Position Despite price fluctuations , XRP continues to maintain a strong presence in the global digital asset landscape. The token remains integral to Ripple’s broader efforts to modernize cross-border settlement infrastructure, a utility-driven use case that underpins its resilience. Even as short-term trading interest has decreased, institutional developments such as Ripple’s expansion into new financial services, including prime brokerage , continue to support long-term optimism. As the market awaits renewed activity, Dark Defender’s comments remind investors that a temporarily silent market does not equate to weakness. Stability often precedes movement, and those prepared for the shift may stand to gain when momentum returns and XRP experiences the “tsunami wave” that Dark Defender anticipates.

Lummis Pushes ‘Biggest’ Crypto Law Ever Setting the Stage for the Next 1000x Crypto $PEPENODE November 5, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Senator Cynthia Lummis is calling her Clarity Act the biggest crypto law in U.S. history. She’s on a mission to ditch the regulatory chaos and give crypto a clear, official rulebook. Lummis is in a total sprint, trying to rope in bipartisan support to get this bill through the Banking Committee before the year ends. Why? The bill essentially tells the SEC and CFTC exactly who regulates what, offering market structure and stability to major firms. It also helps out local community banks by legally allowing them to jump into the digital asset game with custody services, which lets them compete with the big crypto players. The hope is that the new clarity will open the floodgates for investment. In fact, many in the community are already looking ahead. While Washington focuses on regulation, the market is buzzing about projects like PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . It’s blending meme culture with a cool mine-to-earn gaming ecosystem. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is exactly the early-stage, utility-focused innovation that could thrive if Lummis’s clarity finally arrives, potentially becoming one of the next 1000x crypto success stories. See why our experts think $PEPENODE could reach $0.0023 by the end of 2025 . $10B Profit in 2025 Pushes Tether to Top, Sets Up $BEST As Next 1000x Crypto November 5, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Tether’s Q3 attestation report is some impressive stuff. Among the highlights: $10B net profit in 2025 YTD $17B in new $USDT issued Tether holds $135B in US Treasuries, surpassing South Korea’s $132B to rank 17th among foreign countries. It’s all part of an increasingly dominant picture for Tether and $USDT, which currently boasts a $183B market cap. Stablecoins enjoy growing adoption as cross-border remittance systems and tools for banks to settle payments at any time, anywhere. And as stablecoin use grows, expect ordinary investors to follow suit. But to use stablecoins smoothly, you need a crypto wallet. Best Wallet offers a fully non-custodial crypto wallet with MPC and biometric security. Use up to five individual wallets within the app, and access the best crypto presales before they launch. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers the Best Wallet ecosystem – and with Tether’s $USDT pushing crypto adoption, $BEST could be the next 1000x crypto.

This strategic acquisition strengthens Zama’s technical depth in blockchain scalability and validity (ZK) rollups, while accelerating its ability to deliver high-performance confidentiality to all public blockchains. Unlocking the Next Phase of Scalable Onchain Confidentiality KKRT Labs (also known as “Kakarot”) brings deep expertise in designing high-performance proving architectures and modular rollup systems for Ethereum-equivalent environments. Backed by investors such as Vitalik Buterin, Starkware, Lambda Class, and Stake Capital, Kakarot is recognized as one of the strongest ZK-rollup teams in the ecosystem, aiming at building the most scalable, efficient proving engine for Ethereum-compatible chains. By joining forces, Zama and KKRT Labs will accelerate scalability efforts across the Zama Protocol, targeting 10,000+ confidential transactions per second on public chains such as Ethereum, Solana, and others. This new scale will open up critical financial applications on-chain, such as confidential stablecoin payments, confidential DeFi, or confidential on-chain asset management. “KKRT Labs has assembled one of the best ZK-rollup teams in the world,” said Rand Hindi, CEO at Zama. “Together, we will scale faster and reach new levels of performance, bringing the Zama Protocol to tens of thousands of transactions per second.” Integration, Growth, and Future Roadmap Beyond technical alignment, Zama and KKRT Labs share a common philosophy: a belief in open-source innovation, confidentiality-first infrastructure, and democratizing access to advanced cryptographic technology. Both teams have been driven by the conviction that scalability and confidentiality are not trade-offs, but complementary building blocks for the next generation of decentralized systems. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum and KKRT Labs investor, said: “Kakarot has played a significant role in advancing the state of cryptographic technologies in Ethereum, from their early pioneering work on ZK-EVMs to their work on client-side proving for privacy preservation. I look forward to seeing what the team's talented researchers and developers will do next.” Zama is committed to ensuring a seamless integration of KKRT Labs: Team retention & leadership: KKRT’s key engineers, operations, and leadership will transition fully into Zama. Roadmap alignment: KKRT’s ongoing initiatives will be integrated into Zama’s broader product and engineering roadmap with minimal disruption. Eli Ben Sasson, co-founder of ZCash and CEO of StarkWare, said: “I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with the exceptional Kakarot team over the years and witnessing firsthand what they can build. They’ve achieved tremendous success by taking a simple PoC from some of our engineers three years ago and turning it into impressive technology. They have a deep understanding of what it takes to scale blockchains using advanced cryptography, and I’m thrilled to see them dedicating their expertise to scaling and privacy. I’m sure they will provide pivotal support to Zama’s ambitious scaling roadmap.” “Joining Zama allows us to bring our expertise towards scaling one of the last major challenges in blockchain: confidentiality.” added Clément Walter, co-founder, KKRT Labs. “We’ve always believed scalability and confidentiality are essential to the adoption of blockchains, and by joining forces with Zama we can finally make high-throughput, low latency confidential on-chain finance a reality.” About Zama Zama is a cryptography company building state-of-the-art FHE solutions for blockchain.

According to CryptoQuant analyst TeddyVision, the Bitcoin Realized Cap growth rate has significantly slowed, creating a concerning divergence that could impact future price cycles. This crucial metric often reveals what surface-level price action conceals. What Exactly is Bitcoin Realized Cap and Why Does It Matter? The Bitcoin Realized Cap represents the aggregate value of all coins at the price they were last moved on-chain. Unlike market cap, which fluctuates with current prices, this metric provides a more stable view of network health. When the Bitcoin Realized Cap growth slows, it indicates reduced capital flowing into the network despite apparent price stability. Why Should You Worry About Slowing Realized Cap Growth? The current slowdown in Bitcoin Realized Cap expansion reveals several critical issues. First, it shows weakening structural momentum at the network level. Second, it suggests that long-term holders aren’t accumulating at previous rates. Most importantly, this trend indicates that genuine investment capital isn’t entering the ecosystem at necessary levels to sustain higher valuations. Key bearish signals from the slowing Bitcoin Realized Cap include: Reduced capital inflows despite high prices Weakening long-term trend momentum Potential for lower price ranges in next cycle Divergence between price action and network health How Does This Impact Bitcoin’s Future Price Trajectory? Unless the Bitcoin Realized Cap trend reverses, TeddyVision predicts the next cycle will likely form at lower price levels. This doesn’t necessarily mean immediate price crashes, but it does suggest that the foundation for sustained upward movement is weakening. The Bitcoin Realized Cap serves as a reality check against speculative price surges. What Can Reverse This Bearish Bitcoin Realized Cap Trend? Several factors could potentially revitalize the Bitcoin Realized Cap growth. Increased institutional adoption, renewed retail interest, or significant protocol developments could inject fresh capital. However, without these catalysts, the current trajectory suggests cautious market conditions ahead for Bitcoin investors. Conclusion: Reading Between the Price Lines The slowing Bitcoin Realized Cap growth serves as an early warning system for savvy investors. While current prices might appear stable, this underlying metric reveals concerning network-level trends. Monitoring the Bitcoin Realized Cap provides crucial insights beyond surface-level price action, helping investors make more informed decisions in volatile market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions What is the difference between Bitcoin Realized Cap and market cap? Market cap calculates total value using current prices, while Realized Cap values each coin at its last transaction price, providing a more accurate picture of actual capital invested. How often should I monitor Bitcoin Realized Cap? Weekly monitoring provides sufficient insight into trends, though significant market events might warrant more frequent checks. Can Bitcoin Realized Cap predict short-term price movements? While it’s better for identifying long-term trends, sudden changes in Realized Cap growth can signal impending price shifts. What other metrics should I watch alongside Bitcoin Realized Cap? Combine with network activity, exchange flows, and miner behavior for comprehensive market analysis. Has Bitcoin Realized Cap been wrong before? Like all metrics, it’s not infallible but has proven reliable for identifying structural market changes. How can retail investors use this information? Use it to validate market sentiment and adjust risk exposure accordingly during uncertain periods. Found this analysis insightful?

This explosive incident reveals critical vulnerabilities in AI systems that could impact everyone from cryptocurrency developers to political figures. Google AI Faces Political Firestorm The controversy erupted when Senator Blackburn discovered that Google’s Gemma AI was generating completely false information about her personal history. When asked “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?” the AI model fabricated detailed allegations involving a state trooper and prescription drugs that never occurred. The incident highlights how even sophisticated AI systems can create convincing but entirely fictional narratives. Gemma Defamation Claims Escalate Blackburn’s formal complaint to Google CEO Sundar Pichai detailed multiple instances of defamation. The senator emphasized that the AI not only invented the accusations but also provided broken links to non-existent news articles. This pattern of fabrication extends beyond political figures, as conservative activist Robby Starbuck has also sued Google for similar AI-generated defamation labeling him a “child rapist.” AI Incident False Claim Response Marsha Blackburn Query Fabricated sexual misconduct allegations Google removed Gemma from AI Studio Robby Starbuck Case False child rapist accusations Ongoing lawsuit against Google AI Bias Controversy Intensifies Senator Blackburn’s letter argues this isn’t simple AI “hallucination” but demonstrates systematic AI bias against conservative figures. The timing is particularly sensitive given former President Trump’s recent executive order targeting “woke AI” and ongoing concerns about political censorship in technology platforms. This incident raises crucial questions about how AI training data and algorithms might reflect political biases. Consistent pattern of bias allegations against Google AI systems Political figures disproportionately affected by false claims Training data selection under scrutiny Algorithmic transparency demands increasing AI Censorship Debate Reignites The Gemma incident has fueled the ongoing debate about AI censorship and content moderation. Google’s response that they “never intended this to be a consumer tool” raises questions about responsibility for AI outputs. As AI becomes more integrated into development environments and cryptocurrency platforms, the potential for similar incidents affecting business reputations grows exponentially. FAQs: Understanding the Google Gemma Controversy What is Google Gemma AI? Google Gemma is a family of open, lightweight AI models that developers can integrate into their applications. It was available through AI Studio, Google’s web-based development environment. Who is Senator Marsha Blackburn? Marsha Blackburn is a Republican Senator from Tennessee who has been active in technology policy and regulation discussions. What is AI Studio? AI Studio is Google’s development platform for creating AI-powered applications, similar to environments used by cryptocurrency developers for blockchain integration. How did Google respond to the allegations? Google removed Gemma from AI Studio while keeping it available via API. The company acknowledged “hallucinations” as a known issue they’re working to mitigate. What are the implications for AI development? This incident highlights the urgent need for better fact-checking mechanisms, bias detection, and accountability frameworks in AI systems, especially as they become more integrated into financial and political systems. The Google Gemma defamation scandal serves as a critical warning about the real-world consequences of AI errors. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly embedded in our technological infrastructure—from cryptocurrency platforms to political analysis tools—the need for robust safeguards against misinformation and bias has never been more urgent. This incident demonstrates that AI’s potential for harm extends far beyond technical glitches into the realm of reputational damage and political manipulation.

Despite intense short-term volatility, fresh data suggests that the latest price action is not a structural reversal, but “a sentiment-led pullback within an otherwise intact market trend.” A Sentiment Crash, Not A Network Crash A sudden collapse in confidence was first flagged when Bitcoin fell below a crucial support level of $107,000. CryptoQuant explained that the Fear & Greed Index fell to 21, and bullish price targets in the $150,000-$200,000 zone disappeared from social feeds. Google search interest for Bitcoin also cooled significantly after October, and altcoin sentiment reached -81. The analytics platform stated that in crypto, because the market structure is still immature and liquidity is uneven, sentiment always carries outsized price impact. However, despite Bitcoin’s brief decline below $100,000 on Tuesday for the first time since June, on-chain data shows no major breakdown. For instance, exchange withdrawals have actually increased, which can reflect more coins moving toward self-custody rather than distressed exits. UTXOs in loss sit around 12%, which is considered high, but still far from historical capitulation levels. Meanwhile, the network hash rate remains close to 1.1 ZH/s, pointing to strong mining participation. Whale ratio has declined, which helps reduce heavy sell pressure. And $10.7 billion in stablecoins flowed into Binance, which strengthens potential buy-side firepower. Additionally, CryptoQuant said that while realized cap trends show long-term holders taking some profit, fresh demand is absorbing it. Santiment also found that the reaction across social channels has now flipped into outright fear. The Trending Words Dashboard shows that the top rising phrases are overwhelmingly about Bitcoin price levels, with “100K” and “BTC” leading the surge, which proves that the entire retail conversation has shifted from speculative altcoins back to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, the Trending Stories Dashboard is heavily focused on the Bitcoin break below $100,000 and renewed debates about whether this confirms the beginning of a proper bear market. Zooming Out According to Santiment, this is exactly what happens when the crowd starts capitulating – attention pivots to BTC’s survival, not altcoin narratives. Their sentiment-based price range indicator also shows the shift as the $50K-$100K band suddenly spiked with the dip, while Ethereum is seeing fresh calls for sub-$3,000 levels after ETH briefly dropped toward ~$3,090. The analytics platform observed that this move into extreme negative chatter is important as Tuesday was the third most bearish day for crypto in six months, and historically, the only two more bearish days than this one were both cycle bottoms. Ethereum’s bearish sentiment spike is even worse, second only to the October 10 flash crash. Most of the altcoins, however, are not even being discussed as retail remained fixated on BTC and ETH. This is a clear fear signal, and this level of FUD has historically proven to be a favorable sign of some upcoming relief.

As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, investors are closely watching exchange tokens like Bitget Token (BGB) for potential growth opportunities. With the crypto landscape transforming rapidly, understanding the future trajectory of BGB price becomes crucial for informed investment decisions. This comprehensive analysis explores whether Bitget Token can achieve the ambitious $15 milestone by 2030. What is Bitget Token and How Does It Work? Bitget Token serves as the native utility token for the Bitget cryptocurrency exchange, one of the world’s leading digital asset trading platforms. The BGB token powers various functions within the Bitget ecosystem, including trading fee discounts, participation in exclusive token sales, staking rewards, and governance voting rights. As the exchange continues to expand its user base and service offerings, the utility and demand for BGB token naturally increases. Current BGB Price Analysis and Market Position The current market position of Bitget Token reflects the exchange’s growing prominence in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape. BGB has demonstrated resilience during market downturns while capturing significant upside during bullish periods. Several key factors influence BGB price movements: Exchange trading volume and user growth Platform feature expansions and partnerships Overall cryptocurrency market sentiment Regulatory developments affecting exchange tokens Token utility enhancements and burn mechanisms Bitget Token Price Prediction 2025: The Short-Term Outlook Looking toward 2025, BGB price prediction models suggest moderate growth potential based on current market dynamics and exchange development roadmaps. The continued expansion of Bitget’s product offerings, including derivatives trading, copy trading features, and new market entries, could drive increased demand for the BGB token. However, investors should remain cautious about overall market volatility and regulatory uncertainties that could impact exchange tokens. Year Conservative Prediction Moderate Prediction Optimistic Prediction 2025 $1.20 – $1.80 $1.80 – $2.50 $2.50 – $3.50 2026 $2.00 – $3.00 $3.00 – $4.50 $4.50 – $6.00 2030 $5.00 – $8.00 $8.00 – $12.00 $12.00 – $15.00 BGB Price Prediction 2026-2030: The Long-Term Vision The long-term BGB price prediction from 2026 through 2030 depends heavily on several critical factors that will shape the cryptocurrency exchange landscape. Bitget’s ability to maintain competitive advantages, expand into new markets, and continuously enhance token utility will be paramount. The $15 target represents an ambitious but theoretically achievable goal if the exchange sustains its growth trajectory and the broader crypto market experiences significant expansion. Key Factors Influencing Bitget Token Valuation Several fundamental elements will determine whether BGB can reach its potential price targets: Exchange Growth Metrics: User acquisition, trading volume, and market share expansion Token Utility Enhancements: New use cases, staking rewards, and governance features Market Adoption: Mainstream cryptocurrency adoption and institutional participation Regulatory Environment: Global regulatory clarity and exchange compliance Competitive Landscape: Position relative to other major exchange tokens Can BGB Realistically Reach $15 by 2030? The question of whether Bitget Token can hit $15 by 2030 requires careful consideration of both optimistic scenarios and potential challenges. Achieving this target would represent substantial growth from current price levels and would necessitate several favorable conditions aligning simultaneously. These include sustained exchange growth, expanding token utility, favorable market conditions, and successful navigation of regulatory landscapes. While mathematically possible, investors should approach such predictions with appropriate risk management strategies. Risks and Challenges for BGB Price Growth Despite the optimistic BGB price prediction scenarios, several risks could impede progress toward higher valuations: Intensifying competition from other cryptocurrency exchanges Regulatory crackdowns on exchange tokens in key markets Security breaches or platform vulnerabilities Broader cryptocurrency market downturns or extended bear markets Technological disruptions or failure to innovate Investment Strategies for Bitget Token For investors considering BGB as part of their digital assets portfolio, several strategies can help manage risk while positioning for potential upside: Dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risk Portfolio diversification across different cryptocurrency sectors Regular monitoring of exchange performance metrics Staying informed about platform developments and token utility enhancements Setting realistic profit-taking and stop-loss levels Conclusion: The Future of Bitget Token The journey toward $15 for Bitget Token represents an ambitious but theoretically plausible scenario under optimal conditions. While short-term BGB price prediction models suggest gradual growth, the long-term outlook depends heavily on the exchange’s ability to execute its growth strategy, expand token utility, and navigate an evolving regulatory landscape. Investors should balance optimism with prudent risk management, recognizing both the substantial potential rewards and significant risks inherent in exchange token investments. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitget Token used for? BGB serves multiple functions within the Bitget ecosystem, including trading fee discounts, participation in token sales, staking rewards, and governance voting. How does Bitget Token compare to other exchange tokens? BGB competes with tokens like Binance Coin , OKB , and HT , each with unique utility features and exchange ecosystems. What factors most significantly impact BGB price? Exchange trading volume, user growth, platform developments, overall market sentiment, and regulatory changes significantly influence BGB valuation.

As plannned, the endeavor supports enterprises in building crypto services through its technology while earning trading fees as commission. The Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to join the Binance Link Program during the two-day-long Gateway Gulf Investment Forum Bahrain 2025, ending Monday. The announcement was made in the presence of government officials, investors, and business leaders who came to Bahrain to discuss how to improve financial innovation in the Gulf Council region. According to the retail bank’s press statement published on Wednesday, BBK will integrate Binance’s white-label Crypto-as-a-Service (CaaS) solution directly into its mobile banking app. The service will be enabled through plug & play APIs, where BBK customers can buy, sell, and manage their crypto holdings without the need to open or manage separate Binance accounts. A dedicated dashboard inside BBK’s mobile app will allow customers to view their digital assets together with their traditional account investments. The bank’s executives said the Binance collaboration is in tandem with the Bahrain government’s vision to become a financial center with strong fintech adoption. It could also improve BBK’s banking systems by adding financial products like digital assets within one user-friendly platform. BBK takes steps toward embedded digital finance According to Yaser Alsharifi, BBK’s Group Chief Executive BBK intends to have a customer base secure enough to access investment opportunities. The General Manager for Binance Bahrain, Tameem Al Moosawi, lauded the bank for signing the MoU, saying it would help “Bahrain’s position as a regional leader in crypto-asset innovation.” Catherine Chen, Binance’s Head of VIP and Institutional business, supported the two executive’s sentiments and added that institutional demand for crypto services within the GCC region was growing exponentially. “We are pleased to collaborate with BBK to help them offer these assets to their clients at scale, unlocking new growth potential,” she surmised. The Binance partnership comes against the backdrop of another signed memorandum with ATME, a digital asset exchange licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain. Much like the Binance one, this MoU was also unveiled during an event named the FinTech Forward 2025 conference, held in early October at the Exhibition World Bahrain. BBK and ATME agreed to jointly explore tokenization opportunities by applying Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to asset management and investments. “BBK is a pioneering wealth management and investment solutions provider for clients, and we are delighted to announce this partnership with ATME. Digitizing our investment offerings and using tokenization as a tool will create a smoother trading experience and increased liquidity for our clients,” remarked Mohamed Al Rayes, BBK’s General Manager of Treasury and Investment. BBK announces strong financial performance in Q3 The bank recently released its Q3 financial results ending September 30, reporting a net profit of BD 17.9 million in stocks available to its common shareholders after all expenses, taxes, and preferred dividends have been paid. BBK’s earnings per share, the profitability that is calculated by dividing its net income by the number of its outstanding common shares, rose by about 8.5% to jump from 10 fils from 9 fils. The total comprehensive income for the owners of the bank surged 115% to BD 44.5 million, compared to BD 20.7 million counted between July and September last year. The increase in net profit came from a 6.1% uptrend in net fees and commission income, which grew from BD 4.9 million to BD 5.2 million, although there was a 72.6% decline in net provisions that came down to around BD 2 million. BBK also recorded a BD 0.3 million profit from associates and joint ventures to counter a drain of BD 0.1 million in the previous year. Total assets grew by 9.6% to BD 4.6 billion in the nine months ending September, compared to BD 4.19 billion in December 2024.

BullZilla delivers that moment right now for investors seeking a strong advantage before the world catches up.

Many experienced traders now explore the best crypto presales for short-term to benefit from performance while market volatility persists. Bitcoin remains the primary driver of the digital asset space and will continue to shape future bullish momentum.

By comparing both assets, investors can understand where fast returns could emerge while maintaining long-term confidence in major assets that steer overall adoption.

Positioning now offers control over personal upside as the price continues to advance toward projected market presence. Frequently Asked Questions about BullZilla Will BullZilla list on major exchanges? Exchange plans include large centralized platforms following presale completion once compliance, liquidity, and readiness align.

BullZilla combines stage-based pricing, significant staking incentives, and utility features to encourage strong holding behavior.

Bitcoin Short-Term and Long-Term Price Forecast Bitcoin continues to drive global crypto markets even amid cautious trading conditions. It trades around $104,371 today, while short-term projections indicate a 6.05% rise to $112,684 by December 4, 2025. Analysts also expect a 5-day surge to roughly $124,842, marking a 19.40% gain if buying pressure builds again. Despite recording 15 green sessions over the past 30 days, Bitcoin recently dipped by about 8.19% on a weekly basis, reinforcing the need for stronger triggers to restore confidence and boost momentum among active investors. Key indicators show mixed sentiment, with volatility holding near 4.61% and the Fear & Greed Index at 42, signaling ongoing caution. RSI at 47.79 stays neutral, avoiding extreme buying or selling risk while markets await decisive catalysts. Moving averages indicate technical strength, with the 50-day SMA above $114,000 and the 200-day SMA near $105,000. Strong support appears near $104,373, while nearby resistance at $112,914 will test market conviction depending on whether buyers return strategically. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025–2030 Current forecasts suggest Bitcoin may trade between $107,322 and $143,700 by the end of 2025, offering an upside of around 37.44% from today’s levels. A $1,000 investment could return approximately $374 profit, assuming the price follows projected averages. Longer-term paths depend heavily on ETF inflows, institutional acquisition, and macroeconomic conditions surrounding inflation and currency policies. Analysts remain divided on peak potential this cycle, ranging from conservative views below $135,000 to optimistic targets above $196,000 before notable corrections develop. Bitcoin Market Behavior & Adoption Influence Oscillators like MACD, Momentum, and the Ultimate Oscillator show that downside conviction remains moderate, meaning conditions can shift quickly with renewed bullish catalysts. Correlation remains strongest with Ethereum and Wrapped Bitcoin, highlighting its market influence. As the foundational crypto asset, Bitcoin’s stability draws large investors during uncertain times. A more substantial rally could emerge when whales reaccumulate at favorable levels. Portfolio builders often pair Bitcoin with high-growth presales such as BullZilla to balance long-term and high-ROI exposure. Frequently Asked Questions about Bitcoin Is Bitcoin bearish short term? Sentiment remains cautious, with many indicators showing selling strength. However, RSI and oscillators suggest limited downside conviction. A new catalyst could quickly shift momentum and push prices upward again. Can Bitcoin still hit a new all-time high? Analysts differ. Some see peaks below $135K this cycle, others look for $196K potential before larger corrections. Momentum depends on institutional demand and macroeconomic conditions. Conclusion Those pursuing the best crypto presales for short term expect reasonable entry and fast performance, which BullZilla delivers through structured increases and rising interest. Meanwhile, Bitcoin anchors credibility in this investment pairing, offering gradual yet steady improvement as technical conditions evolve. Diversifying between both coins creates a balance between rocket-fueled progression in BullZilla and continued long-term adaptation from Bitcoin. The crypto market rewards early decision-making. New cycles reward those who take positions before higher volume arrives on listings. BullZilla now represents a rare opportunity to enter low while outcomes escalate through presale stages. With growing marketing, expanded holders, and strong tokenomics fueling each step upward, future listings could turn current participation into major success. Bitcoin’s continued market dominance only strengthens portfolio resilience over time. Considering both together supports a sensible strategy in which long-term security merges with vibrant early-stage enthusiasm, providing investors meaningful paths to future growth as the digital market evolves across upcoming cycles.

54056929,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/altcoins-bounce-after-bloodbath-collapse-relief-rally-or-real-recovery-market-analysis,1762343492,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/54056929.jpeg,Altcoins Bounce After Bloodbath Collapse: Relief Rally or Real Recovery? Market Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/altcoins-bounce-after-bloodbath-collapse-relief-rally-or-real-recovery-market-analysis,"The altcoins continued their bloodbath crash late into Tuesday, with the likes of Ethereum (ETH) down 38% from its August high, while Solana (SOL) crashed 42% from its own September high. Is the current bounce just a relief rally with more downside to come, or is the start of a new upside wave that could take altcoins back to their highs? Has Total2 now lost major trendline support? Source: TradingView Total2 is the chart of the combined market capitalization of all cryptos excluding $BTC. Therefore, it’s the altcoins with some stablecoins thrown in. Still, it’s a good enough measure of how the altcoins are performing relative to USD. It can be seen that the collapse tagged the $1.25 trillion horizontal support level, but passed through the ascending trendline in order to do so. As it stands, a bounce occurred from the support level and now the bulls and bears are in a struggle for domination of the $1.31 trillion horizontal line. The $BTC price has already been up to tag the ascending trendline. This was either the first knock at this level before an eventual break back above, or it was a confirmation of the breakdown. The next few days will be critical as to whether the bulls can break back above, or whether they will succumb to further downside. Not a good setup for $ETH as it stands Source: TradingView The above chart is not a good setup for $ETH . It looked as though the combined support of the bottom of the channel, and the ascending trendline would be enough to hold the price and enable a bounce to take place from there. However, the fact that descending channels normally break upwards, and the failure of the combined supports, means that this breakdown is even more bearish. The current price action shows that $ETH has been back to confirm the breakdown of the $3,350 support and flip it into resistance in this time frame. Nevertheless, it might be expected that the price also comes back to confirm the trendline and the bottom of the channel, given their importance. Perhaps this would offer one last chance to the bulls to break back above. $SOL bulls have a chance as price holds at supports Source: TradingView The daily chart for $SOL is another story. This shows that the price held in that downward onslaught, and it held at a very strong convergence of the bottom of the descending channel, and the 0.618 Fibonacci level. The price did fall below momentarily, but the bulls bought the price back up fast enough to keep the candle bodies above, and relatively long wicks below. There is still the no small matter of the failure of the ascending trendline, but given that the $SOL price has been chopping around in this range since March 2024, and also back in 2021, surges and reversals are bound to take out the trendlines here and there. What’s next for altcoins? At this point in the game it might be best to protect one’s capital rather than lose more of it in speculation. If the whole crypto market is starting to sink into a bear market, holding altcoins could become an extremely painful experience. Arguably the best strategy would be to keep eyes on the market and look for the bulls to regain the important levels first. Trusting gut instinct is more often than not a losing ploy in markets. One thing is for sure though, this market is balanced on a knife edge and could go either way. Trade with the utmost caution. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The conservative borrowing represents just 3% of Metaplanet’s $3.5 billion Bitcoin reserve, maintaining substantial collateral buffers even during potential market crashes. Management confirmed the loan carries no fixed maturity date and allows repayment at any time, while proceeds will primarily support the company’s long-term objective of accumulating 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027. JUST IN: Metaplanet borrows $100 million loan by using its Bitcoin as collateral to buy more #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/UayQKj1FKi — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 5, 2025 Strategic Capital Deployment Amid Market Volatility Metaplanet’s borrowing strategy emerged during a period of massive pressure across the digital asset treasury sector, where a quarter of all Bitcoin-holding companies were trading below their crypto reserves in September. The firm recently approved a 75 billion yen share repurchase program specifically targeting periods when its enterprise value-to-Bitcoin holdings ratio falls below 1.0x, aiming to reduce share count and increase token ownership per remaining share. The company’s market-to-net-asset-value ratio dropped to 0.99 earlier last month , making Metaplanet the first major Bitcoin treasury to consistently trade at a discount despite pursuing an aggressive accumulation strategy since April. Metaplanet's mNAV hits 0.99, trading below $3.4B Bitcoin reserves as one in four treasury firms are trading at discount, with corporate buying down 95% since July. #Metaplanet #Bitcoin https://t.co/1KgbHxWGf5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 Representative Director Simon Gerovich characterized the repurchase initiative as designed to “ enhance capital efficiency and maximize BTC Yield ” when valuation multiples compress. Meanwhile, broader industry dynamics indicate that corporate Bitcoin adoption has declined by 95% since July , with only one company initiating treasury strategies in September, compared to 21 in July, according to CryptoQuant data. Industry-wide premiums compressed from an average of 3.76x in April to 2.8x currently, while daily Bitcoin accumulation by treasury companies slowed to just 1,428 tokens in September. Income Business Expansion Targets Stable Returns A portion of the borrowed capital will fund Metaplanet’s Income Business, which creates and sells cash-secured Bitcoin options to generate premium income while maintaining exposure to cryptocurrency. According to Coinpost , sales for this division are projected to reach 2.44 billion yen in the third quarter of 2025, representing a 3.5-fold increase from the prior year’s 690 million yen. Source: Coinpost The options strategy allows the company to earn a stable income during market volatility while providing downside protection through collected premiums. Funds allocated to this business will serve as margin for operations aimed at capturing option premiums, according to company disclosures. Metaplanet maintains conservative financial management by executing borrowings only within ranges where collateral capacity remains sufficient even during significant Bitcoin price declines. The firm expects minimal impact on fiscal year 2025 financial results from the current borrowing. However, management has pledged to announce promptly if any material effects emerge. Corporate Bitcoin Strategies Enter High-Stakes Competitive Phase The corporate crypto treasury movement has reached what Coinbase Research describes as a “player-versus-player” competitive phase , transitioning from guaranteed premiums to an environment where companies must differentiate through strategic positioning. Aside from Coinbase even stating that they’re now ghosting , Columbia Business School professor Omid Malekan recently declared that digital asset treasuries have transformed into a “ mass extraction and exit event ,” which aided the ongoing market crash . Bitcoin recently slipped below $100,000 for the first time since June, entering bear market territory with a 20% decline from its October record high and wiping over $1 trillion from total crypto market capitalization. Bitcoin falls below $100,000 as excessive leverage triggers over $1 trillion in crypto market losses despite ongoing institutional accumulation. #Bitcoin #Liquidation #Crypto https://t.co/gy5LkirDRM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 4, 2025 The downturn coincided with a record $19 billion in liquidations on October 10 , after President Trump announced harsher tariffs on China, triggering volatility that sent Bitcoin to a six-month low of nearly $101,000. Despite market turbulence, some firms maintain aggressive accumulation. Strategy purchased 397 BTC between October 27 and November 2 for $45.6 million, bringing total holdings to 641,205 BTC. Speaking with Cryptonews, Shawn Young, Chief Analyst at MEXC Research, noted that “ accumulation of coins by major market participants, the trade agreement between Washington and Beijing, and moderately positive stock market performance are paving the way for a possible recovery in November. “ The post MetaPlanet Secures $100M Bitcoin-Backed Loan to Buy More BTC appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Metaplanet,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-05 11:53:27

This enormous transaction, valued at approximately $210 million, represents one of the most significant Ethereum movements we’ve seen this year. But what does this massive ETH transferred event really mean for the market? Why Should You Care About This ETH Transferred? When such a substantial amount of ETH gets transferred from a major exchange like Binance, it sends powerful signals throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This particular ETH transferred transaction suggests several possible scenarios that could impact Ethereum’s price and market dynamics. Large movements often indicate: Institutional accumulation for long-term holding Preparation for major DeFi protocol interactions Strategic portfolio rebalancing by wealthy investors Potential movement to cold storage for enhanced security What Makes This ETH Transferred So Significant? The sheer scale of this ETH transferred operation demands attention. At 59,999 ETH, we’re looking at approximately $210 million changing hands in a single transaction. This isn’t just another routine transfer – it’s a statement. The fact that this ETH was transferred from Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to an unknown wallet raises crucial questions about the sender’s intentions and future plans. How Do Whale Transactions Impact Ethereum’s Price? When whales move significant amounts of ETH transferred between wallets, the market typically reacts in predictable ways. Large withdrawals from exchanges often signal accumulation, which can be bullish for prices. However, the unknown destination of this particular ETH transferred creates uncertainty. Key factors to consider include: Reduced selling pressure when ETH leaves exchanges Increased scarcity of available ETH on trading platforms Market sentiment shifts based on whale activity interpretation Potential price volatility as traders react to the news What Could This ETH Transferred Mean for Future Market Trends? This substantial ETH transferred event might foreshadow broader market movements. Historical patterns show that large whale transactions often precede significant price actions. The movement of 59,999 ETH could indicate that major players are positioning themselves for upcoming market developments. This ETH transferred might be part of a larger strategy involving: Ethereum 2.0 staking preparations Institutional investment vehicle creation DeFi protocol liquidity provisioning Strategic accumulation before anticipated bullish trends Understanding the Broader Implications of ETH Transferred Events Every major ETH transferred transaction tells a story about market sentiment and investor behavior. The movement from Binance to an unknown wallet suggests confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects. This particular ETH transferred operation demonstrates that despite market fluctuations, substantial capital continues flowing into the Ethereum ecosystem. The pattern of ETH transferred from exchanges to private wallets typically indicates strong hands accumulating positions rather than short-term traders making quick exits. FAQs About the Massive ETH Transferred What does it mean when ETH is transferred to an unknown wallet? When ETH gets transferred to an unknown wallet, it typically means the recipient address isn’t associated with any major exchange or identified entity. This often indicates private accumulation, cold storage movement, or preparation for undisclosed activities. How can I track large ETH transferred transactions? You can monitor large ETH transferred movements using blockchain explorers like Etherscan or specialized tracking services like Whale Alert. These platforms provide real-time notifications for significant cryptocurrency transactions. Does large ETH transferred activity affect prices? Yes, substantial ETH transferred events can influence market prices. Large withdrawals from exchanges usually reduce immediate selling pressure, potentially supporting price stability or upward movement. Why do whales transfer ETH from exchanges? Whales transfer ETH from exchanges for various reasons including long-term storage, enhanced security, participation in staking or DeFi protocols, or strategic portfolio management away from trading platforms. What’s the difference between known and unknown wallet transfers? Known wallet transfers involve addresses linked to exchanges or identified entities, while unknown wallet transfers go to unlabeled addresses, making the recipient’s identity and intentions unclear. How common are $200+ million ETH transferred transactions? While multi-million dollar ETH transferred events occur regularly, $200+ million transactions remain relatively rare and typically indicate institutional or ultra-wealthy investor activity.

54057141,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=853404,1762344000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54057141.jpeg,Learn the Facts About XRP Tundra: How Half a Dozen Independent Audits Spell Success For TUNDRA Token,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/learn-the-facts-about-xrp-tundra-how-half-a-dozen-independent-audits-spell-success-for-tundra-token/,"By November 2025, XRP Tundra had already cleared six independent verifications before trading began. Its smart contracts were examined by Cyberscope, Solidproof, and FreshCoins. The developer team completed full identity verification through Vital Block KYC, and both implementations — on Solana and the XRP Ledger — were validated on-chain. This process produced a rare result in the presale market: documented proof of security and ownership before public launch. It explains why the project’s ninth presale phase has already surpassed $2 million, with token prices and emission logic confirmed by external reviewers rather than marketing teams. Here’s what those verifications actually prove — and how they define TUNDRA’s early success. Fact 1 — Tundra Operates Across Two Verified Blockchains XRP Tundra was built to run natively on both the XRP Ledger and Solana. The XRPL hosts TUNDRA-X, the governance and reserve token. Solana powers TUNDRA-S, which handles yield and utility through its high-throughput network. Both deployments have independent verification trails — each chain requires unique contract addresses, signature proofs, and validation hashes. That dual architecture gives Tundra two visible ledgers of accountability, one optimized for governance stability and the other for DeFi execution. Early audit reports confirmed that interaction between the two token systems is locked to predetermined ratios. No bridge or admin function can alter emission data or mint new supply. In technical terms, Tundra established cross-chain trust without custodial risk — a design verified in public testnets months before the presale. Fact 2 — Contract Logic Was Audited Before Public Access The first three audits examined the project’s codebase line by line. Cyberscope reviewed contract compilation and verified non-editable emission logic. Solidproof retested Cryo Vault staking functions to ensure rewards follow fixed APY schedules. FreshCoins validated distribution mechanics and confirmed that presale bonus cannot exceed declared limits. These reviews established the framework investors now see: TUNDRA-S at $0.147 and TUNDRA-X at $0.0735 in Phase 9, backed by verified code that controls supply mathematically. All token operations occur through the audited contracts themselves, a fact confirmed across all three reports. Fact 3 — Liquidity Stability Is Enforced Through DAMM V2 XRP Tundra uses Meteora’s Dynamic Automated Market Maker V2 (DAMM V2) for its Solana pools. The model introduces an exponential fee scheduler that begins near 50% and gradually decreases to normal trading levels over 24 hours. This setup makes front-running and early dumping economically unviable. Permanent liquidity locks keep a baseline reserve, while dynamic fees ensure organic price discovery as volume grows. Auditors reviewed these parameters as part of the technical assessment, confirming that liquidity protection is embedded at code level, not dependent on manual control. It’s the main reason early volatility — the factor that kills most new tokens — is contained before listing. Fact 4 — Developer Identities Are Publicly Verified While most DeFi launches hide ownership, Tundra’s developers are registered under Vital Block’s KYC certificate . The verification links the founding entity and core engineers to corporate identifiers, matching the wallet signers that appeared in the audit records. This dual transparency — identity plus code — creates an accountability chain rarely seen in presales. It also means any subsequent update, vault modification, or liquidity adjustment can be traced to the same verified owners. For institutional participants who require human attribution, this step turns an experimental DeFi project into a compliant-ready platform. Fact 5 — Verified Data Confirms Market Traction Every verified layer has translated into measurable traction. Phase 9 of the presale has exceeded $2 million in total raised capital. Each buyer receives audited token contracts, visible bonus calculations, and traceable presale receipts on-chain. The listing targets — $2.5 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X — are tied to the same emission logic confirmed by auditors. Those aren’t speculative numbers; they’re derived from verified token-supply math. Even ecosystem components like Cryo Vaults and Arctic Spinner — which provide staking and instant bonus rewards — were included in audit testing to confirm fair distribution and non-editable logic. As analyst HotCuppaCrypto noted in a recent breakdown , audited presales are becoming the only presales institutional money will touch. XRP Tundra fits that profile: verifiable documents first, liquidity next, and staking activation scheduled only after every audit clears. Half a dozen audits already prove success — follow XRP Tundra’s verified launch.

This powerful movement in the Dollar Index creates immediate ripple effects across global markets, particularly impacting cryptocurrency investors who monitor these traditional finance indicators closely. What Does the Dollar Index Surge Mean for Crypto? When the Dollar Index strengthens, it typically signals several important market dynamics. A rising Dollar Index often correlates with increased pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This happens because investors tend to flock to the perceived safety of the US dollar during uncertain economic conditions. The current Dollar Index performance suggests we might be entering a period where traditional safe-haven assets gain favor. Moreover, the three-month high in the Dollar Index comes at a crucial time for crypto markets. Many traders use the Dollar Index as a key indicator for making portfolio decisions. The recent strength in the Dollar Index could influence: Bitcoin and Ethereum prices – Often moving inversely to dollar strength Trading volumes – As investors reassess risk appetite Institutional crypto investments – Which may slow during dollar rallies Why Should Crypto Traders Watch the Dollar Index? Understanding the Dollar Index relationship with cryptocurrency markets provides valuable trading insights. The Dollar Index measures the US dollar’s value against a basket of six major world currencies. When the Dollar Index climbs, it typically means the dollar is gaining strength globally. For crypto traders, this matters because historical data shows that a strong Dollar Index often coincides with: Reduced liquidity in crypto markets Increased volatility for altcoins Potential buying opportunities during corrections The current Dollar Index level of 101.174 represents a significant psychological threshold. Market participants will be watching closely to see if the Dollar Index can maintain this momentum or if we’ll see a pullback that could benefit crypto assets. How to Navigate Crypto Markets During Dollar Strength While a rising Dollar Index presents challenges, it also creates opportunities for informed investors. The key is understanding that currency movements and crypto prices often dance to different tunes. A strong Dollar Index doesn’t necessarily mean crypto markets will crash – it simply means different market dynamics are at play. Successful traders monitor the Dollar Index as part of their broader market analysis toolkit. They recognize that temporary Dollar Index strength can create attractive entry points for long-term crypto investments. The current Dollar Index performance should be viewed as one piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. Key Takeaways from the Dollar Index Movement The Dollar Index reaching a three-month high signals shifting market sentiment that every crypto investor should understand. This Dollar Index milestone reminds us that traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets remain interconnected. However, it’s crucial to remember that crypto has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to decouple from traditional market movements over time. The Dollar Index story continues to unfold, and smart investors will use this information to make calculated decisions rather than panic reactions. Monitoring the Dollar Index provides valuable context, but it shouldn’t override your fundamental crypto investment thesis. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Dollar Index? The Dollar Index measures the US dollar’s value against a basket of six major currencies including the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound. Why does the Dollar Index affect cryptocurrency prices? A strong Dollar Index often leads investors toward safer assets, potentially reducing capital flowing into riskier investments like cryptocurrencies. How high has the Dollar Index reached in this rally? The Dollar Index has climbed to 101.174, marking its highest level in three months according to Walter Bloomberg reports. Should I sell my crypto when the Dollar Index rises? Not necessarily. While short-term pressure might occur, many investors use Dollar Index strength as potential buying opportunities for quality crypto assets. How often should I check the Dollar Index as a crypto investor? Monitoring the Dollar Index weekly provides sufficient context without causing reactionary trading based on short-term fluctuations. Can cryptocurrencies decouple from the Dollar Index influence? Yes, cryptocurrencies have shown increasing independence from traditional market indicators as adoption grows and unique use cases develop. Found this analysis helpful?

Even after successful trading, some users could not access their gains, as the exchange reportedly refused to release the funds. Several high-profile crypto influencers have complained about LBank locking up their gains. The reports claim that even after successful trading, the centralized exchange refused to honor their withdrawal claims. Crypto investigator ZachXBT noted that one of the big shareholders of LBank is also behind the MEXC market. MEXC has also received similar complaints and was locked in a months-long battle with trader The White Whale. ZachXBT noted centralized “bucket shop” exchanges were inherently risky, but they additionally targeted profitable traders. Allegedly one of the larger shareholders for LBank also owns MEXC / WEEX A lot of these sketchy bucket shop exchanges have a “big boss” behind the scenes who runs it all Trading against users and freezing profitable traders seems to be a part of their business strategy — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) November 5, 2025 LBank carried some of the hottest meme tokens, allowing some traders to make quick gains. However, even prominent influencers were unable to claim their earnings. LBank flags accounts for breaking trading rules One of the traders, Param, was unable to withdraw gains from PNUT , a token that achieved record trading and exposure in 2024. I need help from the Web3 community…. 🚨 LBANK FROZEN MY FUNDS in 6 figures Please help everyone with this post so I can get justice. THIS IS NOT AN ENGAGEMENT FARMING POST I never posted anything like before The Lbank team can DM me and ask for my UID. I didn’t want to… pic.twitter.com/g3H539Wluu — Param (@Param_eth) November 4, 2025 The problem may not be limited to LBank, appearing to be an issue affecting smaller exchanges operating under opaque licenses. Some of the centralized exchanges flagged the accounts of the most successful traders for breaking obscure trading rules. Traders are then pressed to prove innocence and defend their outsized gains, which were often due to meme token rallies. In crypto terms, a 10X gain is considered routine, but LBank froze funds when traders attempted to take profits after such trades. The exchange has multiple rules on bot usage, but there are also reports of accounts frozen for months with no recourse. Previously, traders have lost funds to risky or obscure exchanges. However, LBank has some licensing rights in the USA and is instrumental in the latest trends for meme tokens and other launches. In some instances, centralized markets are the only trading option for hot assets, exposing even more traders to these arbitrary account freezes and sanctions. LBank locked accounts even after modest gains LBank users have posted around 40 complaints in 2025, though there may be a wider pool of users affected. Some of the accounts have modest gains, locking sums of between $350 and $10,000 per case. LBank cited incomplete KYC, and in 40% of the cases, accounts were frozen due to travel and location rules. However, some of the freezes followed specific crypto events, including the recent xUSD de-pegging. The random application of restrictions led some analysts to believe LBank may be trying to solve its liquidity issues or is unable to account for user funds. Over time, traders also complained of unresponsive customer service or deliberate attempts to avoid contact and reinstate accounts. The problem with frozen funds may not be limited to LBank, as seen in the recent complaints about MEXC. In general, centralized exchanges are seen as a potential risk. Recently, the Ourbit exchange also went viral after user reports of restricted funds and frozen accounts. Previous user complaints led MEXC to reconsider its freeze policy. The White Whale was among the leaders in making claims against MEXC, finally receiving his funds on October 31. MEXC also went through batch unlocks, showing how user pressure led to an overhaul of the exchange’s standards. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

54056848,621503,1762344045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54056848.jpeg,American Bankers Association Pushes Treasury To Enforce GENIUS Act’s Stablecoin Interest Ban,https://bitcoinist.com/american-bankers-treasury-stablecoin-interest-ban/,"The American Bankers Association (ABA), along with 52 state bankers associations nationwide, has submitted a letter to the US Department of the Treasury, urging an implementation of the GENIUS Act’s prohibition on interest for payment stablecoins. This letter responds to the Treasury’s advance notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the country’s stablecoin bill and underscores the importance of maintaining the law’s primary objective: to ensure that stablecoins function as payment instruments rather than investment options. Associations Warn Of Risks To Traditional Banking The associations articulated that the GENIUS Act’s ban on payment stablecoin issuers offering interest or yield reflects Congress’s intention for these stablecoins to be used primarily for transactions. They emphasized that the Treasury must uphold this intent to prevent any potential “exploitation of the law.” They assert that without a comprehensive interpretation of the interest ban, digital asset platforms might take advantage of loopholes to provide high-yield incentives, thereby undermining the law’s purpose and posing risks to the traditional banking ecosystem. Community banks, which are key in serving rural and underserved populations, might be particularly affected by deposit outflows resulting from interest-bearing stablecoins. The letter alleges that this disintermediation could lead to a 25.9% loss in deposits, translating to about $1.5 trillion in diminished lending capacity . It also estimates that small business and farm credit could shrink by $110 billion and $62 billion, respectively. To ensure effective enforcement of the GENIUS Act, the associations called on the Treasury to adopt a broad definition of “interest or yield,” encompassing any economic benefit, regardless of terminology. They also urged the prevention of evasion through affiliates or partners, positing that any indirect payments should be treated as issuer payments. Additionally, they requested that interpretations of the term “solely” not be overly restrictive, asserting that any benefit associated with holding a stablecoin should activate the prohibition. Debate Over Stablecoins Delays Market Structure Bill The groups also stress the need for thoughtful and balanced rulemaking that supports the financial system rather than disrupts it. However, the ongoing debate surrounding stablecoin interest has also contributed to delays in passing the Market Structure Bill , which pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis has labeled as the “most important piece of digital asset legislation in United States history.” Recent updates to the draft of this bill by Senate Banking Republicans, led by Chairman Tim Scott, aimed for advancement by the end of September, but this timeline was missed due to various challenges, notably conflicts between banking and crypto lobbies regarding stablecoin interest and the bill’s stance on decentralized finance (DeFi). In response, a group of crypto-friendly Senate Democrats proposed amendments to the bill that were ultimately rejected by Republicans and the crypto industry. These amendments sought to ensure that the legislation would uphold the prohibition on interest or yield paid by stablecoin issuers, whether directly or indirectly via affiliates. Crypto advocates are now pushing for prompt action on market structure legislation this year. Mason Lynaugh, community director for Stand with Crypto, emphasized the necessity for the Senate to act swiftly and deliberately. He noted that Congress has a unique opportunity to position the United States as a leader in the global crypto industry, achievable only through effective market structure legislation.

The coin has underperformed despite strategic fundamentals from the Ripple ecosystem. Due to the recent poor performance, XRP retested the $2.0 support level a few hours ago but has sharply bounced back. If the support level holds, XRP could rally higher in the near term. XRP dips to $2.0 despite Ripple’s Palisade acquisition XRP, the native coin of the Ripple ecosystem, is down 2% in he last 24 hours and is currently trading around the $2.2 mark. The bearish performance comes as the broader cryptocurrency market has recorded a massive selloff since the start of the week. The coin’s performance hasn’t improved despite Ripple announcing the acquisition of the cryptocurrency wallet firm Palisade earlier this week. While announcing this on Monday, Ripple said the acquisition aims to expand its custody capabilities, particularly for fintechs, crypto-native firms, and corporates. The company initially launched Ripple Custody to provide financial institutions with safe and secure storage for digital assets, stablecoins, and Real World Assets (RWAs). The acquisition of Palisade expands Ripple Custody’s offerings and use cases, allowing it to offer secure, fast, and scalable “wallet-as-a-service” technology to financial institutions. While commenting on the acquisition, Monica Long, President of Ripple, said, The combination of Ripple’s bank-grade vault and Palisade’s fast, lightweight wallet makes Ripple Custody the end-to-end provider for every institutional need, from long-term storage to real-time global payments and treasury management. Furthermore, Ripple Payments will also integrate Palisade’s technology to complement existing use cases. This would allow Ripple to expand its services to offer subscription-based payments and value collection thanks to the high-speed transactions it will process at scale. XRP eyes $2.5 if $2.0 support level holds Similar to the broader cryptocurrency market, XRP/USD’s daily chart is bearish and efficient as the coin has underperformed since the start of the week. XRP’s price began the new week negatively, losing 12% of its value during the first two weeks after getting rejected around the 50-day EMA at $2.60 over the weekend. At press time, XRP is trading at $2.23 after dropping to the $2.0 support level on Tuesday. The MACD line is still within the negative territory, indicating a bearish bias for the pair. The daily RSI of 44 shows that XRP is still under selling pressure. However, the pressure is easing, and XRP’s price could rally higher in the near term. If the support level at $2.06 holds, XRP could extend its recovery towards the pivot level at $2.540 over the next few hours or days. An extended bullish run would allow XRP to reclaim the resistance and TLQ level at $2.66. However, losing the $2.06 support level could see XRP face further selling pressure and decline towards the next daily support at $1.96.

Merrin, 36, who played 250 first-grade games with the St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Penrith Panthers before retiring from the NRL in 2021, was arrested at his Barrack Point home in the Shellharbour region on Tuesday morning. The arrest comes one year after police launched an inquiry into the alleged theft from a 29-year-old man’s crypto wallet. Inside the Crypto Scheme That Landed Ex-Rugby Star Trent Merrin in Court According to New South Wales Police, Merrin is accused of using “deceptive means” to gain unauthorized access to the victim’s account and transfer the funds. Following his arrest, investigators seized multiple electronic devices from his home, which will be forensically examined as part of the ongoing investigation. Merrin, who has described himself online as a “cryptocurrency enthusiast” and “dedicated entrepreneur and investor,” has remained active in business since his retirement, launching ventures in wellness and recovery, including a cold plunge therapy service. He was granted conditional bail and is set to appear before Port Kembla Local Court on December 3. Authorities have not disclosed how the alleged transfer was conducted or whether the stolen cryptocurrency has been recovered. Police sources say forensic specialists are analyzing transaction trails and device data to establish the full extent of the scheme. Legal experts note that the penalties for crypto-related theft can vary widely, depending on the jurisdiction and severity of the offense. In Austria, the basic penalty for fraud is imprisonment for up to six months or a fine not exceeding 360 daily rates. This applies if the fraud involves the use of false documents/data or if the damage exceeds €5,000 and is punishable by imprisonment for up to three years. If the damage exceeds €300,000, the punishment is imprisonment from one to ten years. Global Authorities Step Up Enforcement After $9.3 Billion in Crypto Scams Reported in 2024 The arrest adds to a growing global trend of cryptocurrency-related fraud cases involving former athletes and public figures. In July, a former semi-professional rugby player from Seattle, Shane Donovan Moore, was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for running a $900,000 Ponzi scheme that defrauded more than 40 investors across several states. Prosecutors said Moore used investor funds meant for a crypto mining business to pay for luxury items and personal expenses. Elsewhere, authorities in Beijing sentenced five individuals to up to four years in prison last month for running an illegal foreign exchange scheme that laundered over $166 million using stablecoins. China sentences five individuals to prison for operating $166 million crypto money laundering operation using USDT for illegal cross-border transfers. #China #Stablecoin https://t.co/9kl0oI1924 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 29, 2025 The case was described by regulators as one of China’s largest crypto-related prosecutions to date. In the U.S., two brothers educated at MIT are currently standing trial in Manhattan for allegedly stealing $25 million worth of Ethereum in seconds through a blockchain manipulation scheme. Prosecutors argue the pair exploited the Ethereum network’s validation protocols, while the defense contends the act did not constitute fraud, in a case that could test the limits of criminal law in decentralized systems. These incidents form part of a wider surge in crypto-related crime, as adoption continues to expand globally. According to the FBI, Americans reported $9.3 billion in cryptocurrency fraud losses in 2024 , a 66% increase from the previous year. Over 50% of those losses were tied to investment scams, with 149,000 complaints filed. The FBI recorded $9.3 billion losses spread across various crypto-related investment scams, extortion, ATM and kiosks, among others, in 2024. #FBI #CryptoFraud #CryptoScam https://t.co/1Eb8KStAHk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 24, 2025 Chainalysis’ mid-year 2025 report indicates the trend has not slowed, revealing $2.17 billion already stolen this year , surpassing 2024’s total. Industry analysts say many of these cases stem from deceptive tactics, weak digital security, and misplaced trust.

Despite market turbulence and a recent correction, confidence in XRP’s long-term potential remains strong. The token currently trades around $2.25, following a volatile October marked by sharp declines and a swift rebound. On-chain data shows that whales holding 100M–1B XRP accumulated more than 1.27 billion XRP in late October. This accumulation, valued at roughly $3.15 billion, highlights growing institutional confidence ahead of key market events. Institutional and Ecosystem Catalysts A major catalyst for the next XRP price surge could be the pending spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approvals. Canary Funds aims to launch its ETF on November 13 , pending SEC approval. If approved, this would give traditional investors regulated access to XRP exposure for the first time. Analysts believe such a move could unlock significant liquidity and drive institutional adoption. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, introduced in December 2024, further strengthens the XRP ecosystem. RLUSD plays a key role in facilitating Ripple’s enterprise payments and on-chain liquidity operations. Its adoption reinforces XRP’s utility as a bridge asset for cross-border transactions and interbank settlements. Grok’s Analytical Overview To gain deeper insight into XRP’s possible trajectory, we consulted Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence system, Grok. Known for its advanced analytical framework, Grok integrates technical, on-chain, and sentiment data to deliver precise market forecasts. According to Grok , XRP’s short-term sentiment remains cautious but technically resilient. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 37.67, showing neutral-to-oversold conditions that could lead to a rebound. The AI also warned of a potential “Death Cross” on daily charts—where short-term momentum weakens before a new rally phase. Despite this, Grok highlighted XRP’s strong historical performance, noting that November has averaged 88% gains across past market cycles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Volatility and Technical Levels XRP’s volatility remains elevated at 7.35% over the last 30 days, reflecting sharp price swings. Grok observed that ongoing whale accumulation and growing RLUSD liquidity could support the price against deeper corrections. The critical level to watch is $2.70, which serves as the main resistance. A confirmed breakout above this zone could ignite a rally toward new highs. Probability-Based Scenarios Grok’s forecast for December 2025 is probability-weighted. The base scenario (50%) places XRP between $3.00 and $4.00, assuming steady accumulation and ETF approval. The bullish case (40%) projects $4.00–$6.00 or higher if ETF launches coincide with a Bitcoin rally above $100,000. The bearish case (10%) envisions a drop toward $2.00–$2.80 if support at $2.10 fails and regulatory delays persist. Final Assessment Grok’s analysis presents a realistic yet optimistic outlook for the XRP price heading into year-end. Whale accumulation, ETF anticipation , and RLUSD adoption create a strong foundation for sustained growth. The AI’s $3.50 base projection stands as a data-backed expectation—not speculative enthusiasm. If ETF approvals arrive as scheduled and market liquidity expands, December 2025 could mark a pivotal moment for XRP. Grok’s forecast underscores one key point: XRP’s future strength depends not on hype, but on its proven utility and growing institutional relevance.

The two-day summit gathered leaders, institutional investors, and innovators from blockchain, cryptocurrency, Web3, and mining sectors across more than 100 countries, to explore the latest trends shaping the future of the crypto industry. HTX brand featured across the venue As one of the industry’s leaders, HTX showcased its latest strategies in global market expansion and ecosystem innovation, earning strong recognition from both industry peers and international media for its vision, resilience, and influence in the global crypto landscape. Crowds gathering at HTX’s exhibition booth HTX Ventures Head: “Rebuilding Market Confidence Requires Stable Liquidity and Security” During the conference, Alec Goh, Head of HTX Ventures, joined a panel discussion titled “Crypto Market 2025: New Growth or Continued Stagnation?” where he shared in-depth insights on the structural shifts shaping the digital asset market. Alec Goh at the roundtable Alec noted that the Oct 11 black swan event revealed the fragility of the current crypto market structure, from thin liquidity and excessive leverage by retail investors to overreliance on a few large market makers. The automated deleveraging mechanisms on exchanges, he said, triggered a domino effect that further deepened the market drawdown. “The market is now entering a post-speculation consolidation phase, similar to what we saw in 2016 or 2019,” Alec explained. “While short-term excitement has cooled, real builders are quietly expanding their share of the market. To restore retail confidence, the industry must return to fundamentals of stronger liquidity, safer trading systems, and higher-quality projects.” Looking ahead, Alec identified AI and blockchain integration as the next major development cycle, drawing parallels to the early days of DeFi in 2018. “In the next two to three years, we may see AI Agents interacting directly with smart contracts, and Initial Model Offerings (IMOs) emerging as a new fundraising paradigm. That could mark the start of the next major wave.” HTX Ventures Rises to the Top Tier, Focusing on Ease of Use and Practicality At the conference’s awards ceremony, HTX Ventures , the investment arm of HTX, was honored with the title of “Web3 Venture Capital Fund of the Year.” The recognition highlights the firm’s global influence, forward-looking investment strategy, and consistent outperformance across the Web3 sector. Over the past three years, HTX Ventures has achieved a 2.25x multiple on invested capital (MOIC), reflecting its disciplined approach to identifying high-potential blockchain projects. In addition, HTX was ranked among the Top 3 centralized exchanges of the year, reaffirming its position as one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in the global crypto industry. HTX Ventures’ trophy at Blockchain Life 2025 These honors reflect the market’s confidence in HTX’s leadership in innovation, investment foresight, and industry advancements. As Alec emphasized, HTX Ventures remains committed to its mission of “making blockchain easier and more useful.” Moving forward, it will continue focusing on the DeFi, AI agents, RWA tokenization, and blockchain infrastructure sectors, accelerating the growth and adoption of quality Web3 projects worldwide. With its steady strategic execution and sharp insight into industry trends, HTX continues to strengthen its dual role as a global leader in digital asset trading and a major Web3 venture investor. The company remains focused on advancing innovation in trading, investment, and governance, and on fostering a more open, efficient, and sustainable crypto ecosystem with more global builders and investors.

Analysts Point to Next Crucial Support,https://cryptopotato.com/can-ripples-xrp-hold-the-line-analysts-point-to-next-crucial-support/,"Ripple’s native token XRP is under pressure as market uncertainty continues. The asset is trading near $2.23, with a daily volume of around $8.8 billion. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has slipped almost 2%, adding to a 15% loss over the past week. Analysts are now watching several technical levels for signs of stability or further movement. EGRAG CRYPTO Highlights $1.94 as a Key Level Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO says XRP remains in a key accumulation zone, as long as the price stays above $1.94. In a recent post, they wrote, “We’re sitting in one of the most powerful accumulation zones you’ll ever see. Miss this range, and you’ll regret not loading up when fear was at its peak.” They also noted irregular pricing across top exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Poloniex, calling it “ data distortion .” To address this, they now use an average of multiple exchange prices, referred to as the “ Crypto Data Set .” For longer-term tracking, they’ve set $1.40 as a base level. Chart Targets Range From $10 to $50 EGRAG laid out several price levels that could come into play if XRP rebounds. In the short term, they pointed to a move toward $10, based on the current range pattern. They suggested the formation isn’t a textbook wedge or rectangle, but still shows a measured target near that zone. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO/X The outlook also includes a potential rise to the $14–$25 range if a larger wave pattern plays out. The most extended target is $50, referencing a historic wick on Gemini. Challenging the view that only lower wicks need to be revisited, they said, “If the market loves symmetry, both wicks can balance in time.” In addition, analyst ChartNerd reported that XRP recently touched its ascending support line, which has been in place since 2024. The price is now hovering near $2.21. The structure is part of a rising channel, and previous touches at support have led to recoveries toward the upper range, near $6–$7. The pattern remains valid for now. A break below support could suggest a shift in trend, but as long as XRP holds the lower boundary, the broader setup continues to track upward. Short-Term Sentiment and Market Activity Trader CRYPTOWZRD shared that XRP closed with a slightly bearish candle, while the XRP/BTC pair printed a dragonfly doji. “ XRP will follow Bitcoin’s sentiment tomorrow, ” they said, focusing on lower timeframes for possible trade setups. Wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP have recently trimmed their balances, as CryptoPotato reported . This activity was also seen ahead of previous declines and may be adding to current market pressure. Meanwhile, interest in a spot XRP ETF is growing. Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have all filed updated S-1 forms with the SEC in recent days. These filings suggest that ETF launches could begin as early as mid-November. Separately, Ripple also confirmed it has acquired Palisade, a crypto custody firm. The move follows its earlier acquisition of Hidden Road and a collaboration with GTreasury, as Ripple expands its reach in financial infrastructure services. The post Can Ripple’s XRP Hold the Line?

According to Matt Hogan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, that future is now. The era of conservative 1% Bitcoin institutional allocation is rapidly ending as the cryptocurrency matures into a mainstream asset class. Why is Bitcoin institutional allocation changing so dramatically? Matt Hogan describes Bitcoin’s current phase as a ‘quiet IPO’ – a crucial transition period where the asset moves from speculative innovation to established institutional holding. This shift mirrors how successful tech companies evolve after going public, where founders gradually reduce stakes while institutions become long-term investors. The traditional 1% Bitcoin institutional allocation served as a cautious starting point for many wealth managers and pension funds. However, Hogan suggests this conservative approach no longer reflects Bitcoin’s growing maturity and proven track record. What’s driving the surge in Bitcoin institutional allocation? Three powerful factors are accelerating institutional adoption beyond the 1% threshold: ETF inflows creating unprecedented accessibility Regulatory clarity reducing uncertainty for large investors Growing institutional demand from pension funds and asset managers Despite recent price corrections, Bitcoin remains up approximately 9% year-to-date. More importantly, its fundamentals continue strengthening as institutional participation deepens. How does this affect your investment strategy? The changing Bitcoin institutional allocation landscape presents both opportunities and considerations for investors. As institutions increase their exposure, they bring stability and legitimacy that can reduce volatility over time. However, investors should understand that higher institutional participation also means increased correlation with traditional markets. This evolving dynamic requires careful portfolio planning and risk management. The shift in Bitcoin institutional allocation represents more than just numbers changing – it signals a fundamental transformation in how professional investors view digital assets. What does the future hold for Bitcoin institutional allocation? As Bitcoin continues its maturation process, Hogan believes we’ll see allocations grow significantly beyond the traditional 1% marker. This progression follows the natural evolution of any emerging asset class as it gains acceptance and demonstrates staying power. The current correction phase, while challenging for some investors, actually strengthens Bitcoin’s long-term foundation by shaking out weak hands and allowing stronger institutional players to establish positions. Conclusion: A new era for Bitcoin investment The transformation in Bitcoin institutional allocation from cautious 1% positions to meaningful portfolio components marks a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption. As regulatory frameworks solidify and institutional infrastructure improves, Bitcoin’s role in diversified portfolios will continue expanding. The quiet IPO phase Hogan describes represents the calm before what could be a storm of institutional capital flowing into digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions What is the current average Bitcoin institutional allocation? While exact figures vary, many institutions started with 1-2% allocations but are now increasing to 3-5% as confidence grows. Why are institutions increasing their Bitcoin exposure now? ETF approvals, regulatory clarity, and proven track record are giving institutions the confidence to move beyond token allocations. How does Bitcoin’s ‘quiet IPO’ phase benefit investors? This transition period brings stability, reduced volatility, and institutional-grade infrastructure that benefits all market participants. What risks come with higher Bitcoin institutional allocation? Increased correlation with traditional markets and potential regulatory changes remain key considerations for investors. Can retail investors benefit from this institutional trend? Yes, retail investors can leverage the same ETFs and platforms institutions use, gaining exposure to the same market dynamics. How might Bitcoin institutional allocation evolve in 2024? Expect continued growth as more pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers incorporate Bitcoin into their standard investment frameworks.

Decline in crypto prices wiped almost $70 billion from the sector’s total market capitalization. In particular, nearly 486,069 traders were liquidated during this downturn, according to CoinGlass data . Ethereum ( ETH ) and Bitcoin ( BTC ) led the losses, accounting for $679.9 million and $644 million in liquidations, respectively. Long positions dominated the wipeout, representing nearly 79% of total liquidations ($1.67 billion). Crypto Liquidation Heatmap (24H). Source: CoinGlass Bearish rallies among major large-cap assets have raised concerns following recent lows. Over the last 24 hours, BTC recorded a low of $98,962, while ETH touched $3,063. At the time of writing, BTC was trading 2.45% lower at $101,746, and Ethereum had slid 4.79% to $3,317, putting ETH in the red year-to-date. In the U.S. ETF market, notable daily outflows have been observed. Bitcoin ETFs recorded their sixth consecutive day of outflows, totaling $577.74 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs marked their fifth consecutive day, reaching $219.37 million, as per data on SoSovalue . What caused the crash and what might happen next Trump’s tariff threats against China unsettled both crypto and stock markets, leading to major pullbacks. The Federal Reserve’s rate cut, paired with Powell’s warning against expecting more cuts, added to investor caution and extended the sell-off. Although the recent $2.1 billion liquidation is less dramatic than the $19 billion sell-off seen in early October, the drop of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies to crucial support zones signals the potential for further corrections. Drawing on Bitcoin’s historical price patterns, on-chain crypto analyst Ali noted : “At present, the 50-week moving average sits near $102,000. If Bitcoin closes below and fails to reclaim this level, history suggests the potential for another ~60% correction, which would project a downside target around $40,000.” Bitcoin price movement vs. 50W SMA.

Stevie referenced a post from August in which Schwartz told followers that they had until November 4 to figure out “what the Roku channel is.” On November 3, just one day earlier, Schwartz posted an image of New York’s PIXO11 television station logo, sparking speculation about a hidden meaning. Stevie’s post highlights that Schwartz’s mention of PIXO11 could be tied to the earlier Roku reference through gematria, the study of numerical values assigned to words and phrases. By comparing the numerical equivalents of certain phrases, Stevie highlighted that “Roku channel” and “PIXO two” both equal 122. He explained that “11” in PIXO11 could be viewed as 1+1, symbolizing “two,” making “PIXO two” a possible coded version of PIXO11. The discovery appeared to reinforce the idea that Schwartz’s posts often include cryptic patterns. Remember when David Schwartz posted “𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗹 𝗡𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝟰𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗼 𝗳𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗼𝗸𝘂 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀.”? Well today, November 3rd, David makes a post with the word “PIXO 11”.

Schwartz made it exactly one day before the date he mentioned in his August message, which some followers interpreted as deliberate. Within the XRP community, Schwartz’s habit of posting puzzles or enigmatic remarks has long been a source of intrigue. Many of his followers believe these coded messages could foreshadow upcoming Ripple announcements or signal major market developments. Stevie ended his analysis with the phrase “Buckle up,” denoting his expectation for an XRP mega rally . The recurrence of the number 122 across both phrases added to the speculation that something tied to those references could coincide with November 4. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Possible Relevance to Ripple and XRP While Schwartz did not clarify any connection between his posts and Ripple, XRP supporters often link his activity to company milestones or broader market events. Ripple has recently expanded into institutional services through Ripple Prime and continues to advance its real-world asset integration efforts. If Schwartz’s cryptic messages are related to these developments, they could reflect growing confidence in XRP’s strategic position. The timing of this post, paired with the focus on recurring numbers and patterns, could indicate that something relevant to the XRP ecosystem is approaching.

According to the police, this is the biggest case of suspected financial fraud in Hong Kong’s history. Chief Superintendent Ernest Wong Chun-yue of the commercial crime bureau has stated that Interpol was hunting for two masterminds and a core member of JPEX. That followed local police laying charges against six core members, seven influencers, and individuals involved in over-the-counter (OTC) operations, and three fake account holders. The suspects have been charged with conspiracy to defraud, fraudulently inducing investment, and money laundering. One of them is Joseph Lam, a former lawyer and social media influencer. Interpol issues red notices for three fugitives believed to be key players To date, 80 individuals, including 14 key members of a criminal syndicate, have been arrested, with a total of HK$228 million seized, since the investigation began in September 2023. The arrests followed an announcement by the SFC that JPEX was unlicensed and lacked the authority to operate its crypto trading platform in the city. SFC said some investors had complained of being unable to withdraw their virtual assets from JPEX accounts or of finding their balances were reduced and altered. At the same time, JPEX announced that it was suspending trading on its platform. It said in a statement that it was “negotiating with … third-party market makers to resolve the liquidity shortage.” Later on, JPEX complained of “unfair treatment by relevant institutions” in Hong Kong. It accused an unidentified third-party market maker of “maliciously” freezing funds. As a result, the police froze their bank accounts worth $1 million and seized three properties valued at $5.6 million. So far, more than 2,700 people have fallen victim to the alleged scam. Wong said the investigation was “highly difficult and complex” because of the number of victims and the massive amount of data, including bank, crypto transaction records and digital forensics. “During an investigation, police need time to handle exhibits and evidence. We need to unravel the whole affair and look for useful information,” he said . The 16 accused are scheduled to appear in Eastern Court on Thursday. Meanwhile, authorities have said that Interpol issued red notices for three fugitives, Mok Tsun-ting, Cheung Chon-cheong, and Kwok Ho-lun, who are believed to have played central roles in the scheme. A red notice is a request to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition. Hong Kong authorities freeze millions linked to Prince Group In other news, Police in Hong Kong and Taiwan have frozen $354 million worth of assets linked to Cambodia’s Prince Group . According to reports , the assets frozen are believed to be the proceeds of crime. The assets include cash, stocks, and funds. The report says that no one has been caught. Previously, authorities in the US and UK accused Chen and his network of running scam centers with forced labor and of moving billions of dollars in stolen money all over the world. The US charged Chen and seized $15 billion in Bitcoin from him. The US revealed that its group, which had assets in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, had operated undetected for more than a decade. The US Treasury Department put sanctions on 146 groups and people in the network, including Chen. Even after ongoing efforts to catch crypto criminals, Hong Kong authorities have proposed more lenient capital requirements for financial institutions holding certain crypto assets. As reported by Cryptopolitan, crypto coins built on permissionless blockchain networks could qualify for lower bank capital requirements if their issuer implements functional risk management and mitigation measures.

A colossal sum of Ethereum, totaling an astounding $621 million, has been strategically withdrawn from Binance by an anonymous investor. This massive move has caught the attention of market watchers and signals a potentially bullish outlook for the second-largest cryptocurrency. What’s Driving This ETH Whale Accumulation? On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain first brought this intriguing development to light. Over the past two days, this particular investor executed a substantial withdrawal, moving 174,166 ETH directly from Binance. This isn’t just a simple transfer; it represents a calculated maneuver that speaks volumes about the whale’s confidence in Ethereum’s future. Key figures: Total ETH withdrawn: 174,166 ETH Approximate value: $621 million Source: Binance exchange Such large-scale movements are closely watched, as they often precede significant market shifts. The scale of this particular ETH whale accumulation suggests a strong conviction. The Strategic Play Behind the Massive Withdrawal What makes this ETH whale accumulation particularly fascinating is the investor’s prior actions. Approximately two weeks before this withdrawal, the same whale engaged in a sophisticated financial play. They borrowed 66,000 ETH, leveraging 610 million USDC as collateral on the decentralized lending protocol Aave. These borrowed funds were then deposited onto an exchange. The sequence of events: Borrowed: 66,000 ETH using 610 million USDC collateral on Aave. Deposited: The borrowed ETH onto an exchange (likely Binance, though not explicitly stated for the deposit, the withdrawal is from Binance). Repaid: The Aave debt. Currently holds: 108,105 ETH, demonstrating a strategic long-term position. Lookonchain further highlighted that after successfully repaying their debt, the whale still retains a significant holding of 108,105 ETH. This strategic maneuver has already yielded a profit exceeding $29 million, underscoring the investor’s sharp market timing and risk management. This isn’t mere speculation; it’s a clear demonstration of a well-executed strategy to increase their ETH whale accumulation . What Does This Significant ETH Whale Accumulation Signal for the Market? The implications of such a substantial withdrawal are multi-faceted. When a large amount of cryptocurrency is moved off an exchange, it typically reduces the available supply on those platforms. This reduction can, in turn, create upward pressure on prices, as fewer tokens are available for immediate sale. Potential market impacts: Reduced exchange supply: Less ETH available for trading, potentially driving up prices. Bullish sentiment: Signals strong confidence from a major investor, which can influence retail traders. Long-term holding: Suggests the whale believes in Ethereum’s future growth rather than short-term trading. For many, this ETH whale accumulation is a clear indicator of bullish sentiment. Whales often possess deep insights and resources, making their actions a bellwether for broader market trends. Their move away from exchanges suggests an intent to hold for the long term, rather than preparing for a quick sell-off. Navigating the Waters: Your Takeaway from Whale Activity While whale movements can be influential, it’s crucial for individual investors to approach such signals with caution and conduct their own research. This particular ETH whale accumulation event highlights the power of on-chain data in understanding market dynamics. It showcases how sophisticated players position themselves in anticipation of future price action. Understanding these patterns can provide valuable context, but never substitute for your own due diligence. Consider the broader market conditions, technological developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, and your personal risk tolerance. The recent withdrawal of $621 million in ETH from Binance by an anonymous whale is a powerful testament to the ongoing ETH whale accumulation trend. This strategic maneuver, involving an Aave loan and subsequent profit, underscores a strong belief in Ethereum’s potential. As these large investors make their calculated moves, they often set the stage for broader market sentiment. While their actions offer intriguing insights, always remember to pair such observations with thorough personal research to navigate the dynamic crypto landscape effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is ETH whale accumulation? ETH whale accumulation refers to large, wealthy investors (often called “whales”) buying and holding significant amounts of Ethereum, often moving it off exchanges into private wallets, signaling a long-term bullish outlook. 2. Who is the anonymous whale mentioned in the article? The specific identity of the whale remains anonymous, as is common in cryptocurrency transactions. Their activity is tracked through public blockchain data by firms like Lookonchain. 3. What does withdrawing ETH from Binance signify? Withdrawing ETH from an exchange like Binance typically indicates that the investor intends to hold the assets for the long term, rather than trading them immediately. It reduces the supply available on exchanges, which can be a bullish signal. 4. How did the whale make a profit of over $29 million? The whale initially borrowed ETH against USDC collateral on Aave. After repaying this debt, the remaining ETH they hold (108,105 ETH) is worth significantly more than their initial capital outlay, resulting in a profit exceeding $29 million. 5. Should I follow whale movements when making investment decisions? While whale movements can offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential trends, they should not be the sole basis for your investment decisions. Always conduct your own thorough research, understand the risks, and consider your personal financial goals. Did you find this deep dive into ETH whale accumulation insightful?

Here’s What You Need To Know,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-bitunix-a-safe-exchange-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"The Bitunix crypto exchange has grown into one of the leading centralized exchanges (CEXs) on the market, with billions of dollars in daily trading volume, verified proof-of-reserves, and hundreds of crypto trading pairs. Even though the exchange holds a solid 8/10 trust score on CoinGecko and operates with a comprehensive security framework, traders can never be too cautious when deciding which platforms to trust. Overall, there are numerous reasons supporting the argument that Bitunix is a safe exchange for trading and holding cryptocurrencies. Its advanced security systems, massive trading volume, and positive feedback from analysts and industry experts all reinforce its credibility and growing reputation. Bitunix: A Beginner’s Guide Bitunix was established in 2021 and has since made its mark on the crypto market. The exchange weathered the 2022 bear market crash even as many others failed, and has steadily grown its share of both users and trading volume. As a result, Bitunix has become a go-to exchange for many traders, especially those looking to trade with leverage. The platform currently supports more than 565 cryptocurrencies and trading pairs.Its 24-hour trading volume regularly exceeds one billion dollars, making it one of the top exchanges by global volume according to data from CoinGecko. Bitunix caters mainly to experienced, high-risk traders, offering over 200 leveraged trading pairs and leverage of up to 125x. It also features a robust liquidation mechanism designed to protect traders from costly mistakes in volatile market conditions. Bitunix combines a fast registration process with a user-friendly verification system, allowing traders to start quickly. The exchange operates under global compliance standards, maintains a protection fund, and offers some of the best liquidity in the market through its One Chart platform for beginners and pros. Fees on Bitunix vary according to a tiered VIP system, where higher-volume traders receive reduced rates. Overall, the platform’s fee structure is competitive and similar to those found on other leading centralized exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, or Coinbase. Bitunix trading volume. Source: CoinGecko Bitunix History: No Hacks Reported Since its launch in 2021, no major hacks have been reported. This means that billions of dollars have moved through the exchange without a single major exploit. Although the exchange hasn’t been live for as long as many of its competitors, this track record should reassure traders about the overall safety and reliability of the platform. Arguably, this consistent record also highlights the success of the security measures employed by Bitunix. Following several high-profile exchange breaches, such as the Bybit exchange incident, it has become clear that only platforms with grade-A security standards can be trusted. Bitunix’s ability to operate without a single major security event reinforces its growing reputation as a secure and well-managed exchange. Assets Secured Through Multi-Sig Wallets and More There are several security measures that Bitunix has implemented to guarantee the safety of user funds and to reduce the possibility of a major exploit from hackers. Although no centralized exchange is 100% safe, these measures provide considerable reassurance for Bitunix users. Multi-Signature Cold Wallets: The majority of user funds are stored offline in multi-signature wallets, which require multiple authorizations before any transfer can occur. This prevents a single compromised account or insider from accessing large reserves. Hot and Cold Wallet Segregation: Only a small percentage of assets are kept in hot wallets for daily operations, while the rest remain in secure cold storage to minimize exposure to online threats. Regular Penetration Testing and Audits: Bitunix conducts routine third-party security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that its systems meet industry best practices. Proof of Reserves Verification: The exchange maintains a public proof of reserves system, allowing traders to confirm that all user assets are fully backed on-chain and that Bitunix operates with transparency. Insurance and Risk Monitoring: In the unlikely event of a breach, Bitunix maintains an emergency fund and employs continuous risk monitoring tools to detect suspicious activity before it becomes a threat. Is Bitunix a KYC-Compliant Exchange? Like all top centralized exchanges, Bitunix maintains full KYC compliance. Every registered user must complete verification to access certain features, keeping the platform safe, transparent, and compliant with global financial regulations. Final Thoughts: Is Bitunix Safe? Bitunix is a leading exchange, which means it’s constantly in the crosshairs of malicious actors looking to access user funds. The exchange’s security measures are comprehensive, and as a result, it boasts an impressive track record with no major attacks reported. This should reassure traders and investors that they can trust Bitunix to provide a secure and reliable trading environment.",Press Release,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-05 13:36:58

Speaking at the ongoing Ripple Swell conference, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg pointed to next week for the launch of XRP ETFs. “We are ready to launch the XRP ETF next week.” McClurg's statements were interpreted as a significant turning point for XRP and broader altcoin ETFs. Steven McClurg also said that XRP will become the second most recognized cryptocurrency on Wall Street after Bitcoin. McClurg also added that XRP ETFs could attract $5 billion in inflows from institutional investors within 30 days of their launch. “XRP's real-world availability and strong community support could make the XRP ETF the biggest ETF success to date.” McClurg noted that while Ethereum ETFs have recently suffered from outflows from Grayscale's ETHE trust, XRP doesn't suffer the same structural disadvantages. He added that XRP doesn't have native staking, meaning ETF investors don't lose out on returns by holding the ETF instead of the asset. Canary CEO Steven McClurg, in a statement regarding the Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, said, “After the Ethereum ETFs, Litecoin and Hedera will be the next altcoin ETFs.

The answer lies in a surprising source: the U.S. shutdown liquidity drain. This phenomenon is reshaping crypto markets, and understanding it could help you navigate these turbulent times. Let’s break down how government actions are influencing your digital assets. What is the U.S. shutdown liquidity drain? The U.S. shutdown liquidity drain occurs when the government’s financial maneuvers reduce the amount of dollars available in the market. During a shutdown, the Treasury issues bonds to secure funds, locking up cash in accounts like the Treasury General Account (TGA). This contraction in liquidity makes it harder for investors to access capital, affecting riskier assets like Bitcoin. Essentially, less money in circulation means fewer resources to fuel crypto growth. How does this liquidity drain impact Bitcoin? Bitcoin is highly sensitive to shifts in dollar liquidity. When the U.S. shutdown liquidity drain tightens financial conditions, investors may sell Bitcoin to cover losses or reduce exposure. For example, in mid-October, Bitcoin weakened even as the Nasdaq hit record highs, showing its unique vulnerability. Key indicators like the SOFR-FDTR spread widening to 30 basis points signal this stress, making crypto markets jittery. Why should you care about these market signals? Monitoring the U.S. shutdown liquidity drain helps you anticipate Bitcoin’s movements. This drain isn’t just a temporary issue; it reflects broader economic tensions that can lead to prolonged declines. However, it also sets the stage for potential rebounds. When the shutdown ends and liquidity returns, Bitcoin could surge, especially with supportive policies like fiscal spending or rate cuts. Benefit: Early awareness allows you to buy low during dips. Challenge: Volatility may test your investment strategy. Actionable insight: Track Treasury announcements and Fed policies to time your moves. What’s the outlook for Bitcoin post-shutdown? Once the U.S. shutdown liquidity drain reverses, Bitcoin is poised for recovery. Historical patterns suggest that injected liquidity can boost prices rapidly. Analysts predict that combined with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, this could accelerate gains. Stay alert for signs of market stabilization, as they often precede bullish trends in crypto. In summary, the U.S. shutdown liquidity drain is a critical factor in Bitcoin’s recent decline, but it also offers opportunities for savvy investors. By understanding these dynamics, you can better manage risks and capitalize on future upswings. Frequently Asked Questions What causes a U.S. shutdown liquidity drain? It happens when the U.S. government issues bonds during a shutdown, absorbing market dollars into accounts like the TGA, reducing available liquidity. How long does the liquidity drain affect Bitcoin? Effects can last until the shutdown resolves and liquidity is reinjected, but market reactions may persist based on investor sentiment. Can Bitcoin recover from this drain? Yes, history shows Bitcoin often rebounds when liquidity returns, especially if supported by economic stimuli. What other assets are impacted? Risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies generally feel the pinch, but Bitcoin’s volatility makes it more pronounced. How can I protect my investments? Diversify your portfolio and stay informed on Treasury and Fed actions to mitigate risks. Is this a recurring issue? Yes, government shutdowns and liquidity shifts are periodic, so learning these patterns can aid long-term strategy. If you found this analysis helpful, share it on social media to help others understand the U.S. shutdown liquidity drain and its effects on Bitcoin.

This robust employment data comes at a crucial time as policymakers and investors watch for signals about economic strength. What Do the Latest ADP Non-Farm Payrolls Numbers Reveal? The October ADP non-farm payrolls report showed a gain of 42,000 private sector jobs, comfortably beating the forecast of 32,000. This data, compiled from payroll information of over 500,000 companies, provides valuable early insight into employment trends before the official government release. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) releases this report monthly, giving economists and market participants a preliminary look at employment conditions. The stronger-than-expected numbers suggest underlying resilience in the job market despite various economic headwinds. Why Should You Care About ADP Non-Farm Payrolls? Understanding ADP non-farm payrolls matters because they serve as an important economic indicator that influences multiple aspects of financial markets and policy decisions. Here’s why this data point commands attention: Early indicator : Releases two days before official government data Market mover : Influences stock and bond market reactions Policy signal : Guides Federal Reserve interest rate decisions Economic health : Reflects private sector hiring trends How Does This Impact Federal Reserve Decisions? The Federal Reserve closely monitors employment data, including ADP non-farm payrolls , when setting monetary policy. Strong job growth like October’s 42,000 gain could influence the Fed to maintain or potentially raise interest rates to prevent economic overheating. Conversely, weak employment figures might prompt consideration of rate cuts to stimulate economic activity. Therefore, the ADP non-farm payrolls report serves as a crucial input for the central bank’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. What’s the Difference Between ADP and Government Employment Reports? While both reports measure employment, key differences exist between ADP non-farm payrolls and the official Bureau of Labor Statistics data: Coverage : ADP covers only private sector employment Timing : ADP releases two days earlier than government data Methodology : ADP uses actual payroll data from client companies Scope : Government report includes public sector jobs What Actionable Insights Can We Draw From October’s Data? The stronger-than-expected ADP non-farm payrolls reading provides several important takeaways for businesses and investors. The 42,000 job addition suggests continued private sector resilience despite economic uncertainties. This positive momentum in ADP non-farm payrolls indicates that businesses remain confident enough to continue hiring, supporting overall economic growth. However, it’s essential to watch subsequent reports for confirmation of this trend. Conclusion: Reading Between the Lines of Employment Data The October ADP non-farm payrolls report delivers encouraging news about US economic strength, with the 42,000 job addition exceeding expectations. This data point serves as a valuable early indicator of labor market conditions and provides crucial information for policymakers and market participants alike. While one month’s data doesn’t define a trend, the positive surprise in ADP non-farm payrolls suggests underlying economic resilience that warrants continued monitoring in coming months. Frequently Asked Questions What are ADP non-farm payrolls? ADP non-farm payrolls represent private sector employment changes based on payroll data from over 500,000 companies, released monthly by Automatic Data Processing. How accurate is the ADP report compared to government data? While ADP data provides valuable early insight, it sometimes differs from the official government report due to different methodologies and coverage. Why do markets react to ADP employment data? Markets react because the data provides early signals about labor market strength, which influences Federal Reserve policy and economic outlook. What sectors showed the strongest growth in October? The October report showed broad-based gains across multiple private sector industries, though specific sector breakdowns vary monthly. How often is ADP non-farm payrolls data released? The report releases monthly, typically two days before the official government employment report. Can ADP data predict recession or economic expansion? While not a perfect predictor, sustained trends in ADP data can signal broader economic shifts when combined with other indicators. Found this analysis helpful?

The asset is down over 6% in the last 24 hours and more than 17% in the past seven days, based on data from CoinGecko. After a strong run earlier this year, the latest move brings ETH back to key technical levels. ETH/BTC Drops into Accumulation Zone The ETH/BTC chart shows the pair returning to an area marked by past buying. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe pointed out that the price has pulled back more than expected, but still sits in a zone where accumulation has happened before. He said, “A little deeper than expected on ETH, but this is still the level that I think is wise to look for potential accumulations.” ETH/BTC is now trading near 0.0326 BTC, a zone that lines up with previous consolidation. This level acted as resistance earlier in 2025 and could now serve as support. Meanwhile, technical indicators show mixed signals. Weekly RSI is still above oversold territory. On the daily chart, the Stochastic RSI is deep in the oversold range. That suggests the recent selling may be slowing. The MACD is still negative, but the histogram is showing smaller red bars, which may point to weakening downside pressure.

His chart shows potential pauses around $5,600, $6,400, and $7,200. But Downside Still in Play Martinez also shared a less optimistic view. If ETH cannot get back above $4,000 soon, the price could slide to $2,400 or even $1,700. In a separate post, trader Ted said ETH came close to $3,000 before bouncing. He added: “The crucial level to reclaim for Ethereum is $3,500–$3,600.” If the price gets rejected at that range, another move toward $2,800 may follow. At this point, Ethereum is sitting at an important zone. Buyers and sellers are watching closely to see if this level holds—or if the downtrend continues.

This strategic move brings their total Solana holdings to an impressive 2,106,989 SOL, as reported by The Block. This substantial increase underscores Upexi’s continued confidence in the Solana ecosystem and its long-term potential. What Drives Upexi’s Growing Solana Holdings? The decision to bolster their Solana holdings is a key aspect of Upexi’s broader investment strategy. This isn’t just a casual purchase; it reflects a calculated move within the volatile crypto market. One crucial metric guiding such decisions is the company’s market capitalization to net asset value (mNAV). Upexi’s current mNAV stands at approximately 0.7. This metric indicates whether a company’s market capitalization is trading at a premium or discount relative to the value of its underlying crypto holdings. A figure above one suggests potential overvaluation, while a figure below one, like Upexi’s 0.7, signals undervaluation. Therefore, a lower mNAV can make further crypto acquisitions, such as this significant Upexi SOL investment , particularly attractive. It suggests the market might not be fully appreciating the value of the company’s digital assets. Understanding the Significance of Upexi’s Strategic SOL Investment This latest acquisition of SOL is more than just numbers; it sends a clear signal to the market. Firstly, it highlights continued institutional interest in Solana, a blockchain known for its high transaction speeds and low costs. Many believe Solana’s robust infrastructure positions it as a strong competitor in the decentralized application (dApp) space. Secondly, Upexi’s consistent accumulation demonstrates a long-term bullish outlook on Solana’s future. For an e-commerce firm, integrating or investing in blockchain technology could offer various benefits, from supply chain transparency to payment processing efficiencies. This sustained Upexi SOL investment could pave the way for future integrations or simply serve as a valuable treasury asset. Exploring the Implications for Investors and the Market What does Upexi’s substantial Solana accumulation mean for other investors? It suggests that established companies are actively seeking value within the cryptocurrency market. This kind of corporate endorsement can often inspire confidence among retail and institutional investors alike. Moreover, it reinforces the narrative of increasing mainstream adoption for digital assets. The consistent growth in Upexi’s Solana holdings could also influence market sentiment for SOL. As more companies disclose significant crypto assets, it adds a layer of stability and legitimacy to the overall digital asset space. This ongoing Upexi SOL investment serves as a tangible example of a company putting its capital behind a specific blockchain. Investors watching Upexi might consider: Portfolio Diversification: How Upexi uses crypto to diversify its assets. Valuation Metrics: The importance of metrics like mNAV in assessing companies with crypto holdings. Blockchain Fundamentals: Solana’s underlying technology and its potential for growth. What’s Next for Upexi and the Solana Ecosystem? The future implications of Upexi’s strategy are certainly worth watching. Will Upexi continue to expand its Upexi SOL investment ? Given its current mNAV and apparent conviction in Solana, further acquisitions are a distinct possibility. Such continued accumulation could further solidify Solana’s position as a preferred institutional asset. For the Solana ecosystem, having a Nasdaq-listed company as a significant holder adds a layer of credibility and potential for future partnerships or integrations. As Solana continues to develop its network and attract more developers, the backing of companies like Upexi becomes increasingly valuable. Conclusion: A Bold Move in the Digital Asset Landscape Upexi’s recent and significant acquisition of an additional 88,750 SOL since September 10, pushing its total holdings past the 2 million mark, marks a compelling development in the cryptocurrency investment space. This strategic Upexi SOL investment , influenced by an attractive mNAV of 0.7, signals strong institutional confidence in Solana’s future. It not only bolsters Upexi’s digital asset portfolio but also provides a fascinating case study for how traditional companies are navigating and investing in the evolving world of blockchain. As the lines between traditional finance and decentralized assets continue to blur, Upexi’s moves offer valuable insights into the ongoing institutional embrace of cryptocurrencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Upexi? Upexi is a Nasdaq-listed e-commerce firm that focuses on acquiring and growing businesses, particularly in the consumer products and digital marketing sectors. It has also become a notable investor in the cryptocurrency space, specifically in Solana (SOL). What is Solana (SOL)? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its fast transaction speeds and low costs. It supports decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, aiming to provide a scalable infrastructure for various blockchain-based projects. What does Upexi’s mNAV of 0.7 mean? mNAV, or market capitalization to net asset value, indicates whether a company’s market value is trading at a premium or discount to its crypto holdings. An mNAV of 0.7 suggests that Upexi’s market capitalization is currently trading at a discount compared to the value of its crypto assets, implying potential undervaluation. Why is Upexi investing so heavily in SOL? Upexi’s substantial Upexi SOL investment likely stems from a strategic belief in Solana’s long-term potential, its robust technology, and the attractive valuation suggested by its mNAV. It reflects a calculated move to diversify assets and capitalize on perceived opportunities within the crypto market. How does this Upexi SOL investment impact the broader crypto market? Significant institutional investments like Upexi’s can boost market confidence in specific cryptocurrencies and the overall digital asset space. It signals increasing mainstream adoption and legitimacy, potentially encouraging other companies and investors to explore similar strategies.

GrowThePie, a crypto analytics platform, predicts that the Ethereum Mainnet may reach 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) by 2031, driven by the rapid expansion of layer 2 (L2) solutions. According to GrowThePie, the Ethereum Mainnet processed an average of 18.6 transactions per second (TPS) last month. The blockchain data site argued that the network must increase throughput by approximately 537 times from its current level of 18.6 TPS to reach its long-term scaling objective of 10,000 TPS. From 2015 to the present, ETH has scaled from about 0.71 TPS to 18.6 TPS, a 26.2x increase.

Arbitrum dominates DeFi in terms of utility and transactions. Source: GrowThePie Arbitrum One leads on-chain activity with 28.93% in DeFi and 21.22% in Utility applications. The network’s presence in decentralized finance and cross-chain connections is evident in its 14.88% share of all transactions overall. On-chain data reveal that Optimism Mainnet’s layer 2 indicators have demonstrated steady growth across key fundamentals between August and November 2025. There were 38.5K active addresses, 2.03 million transactions, and an average throughput of 8.3 Mgas/s. The network secured a total value of $2.75 billion with a stablecoin supply of $653.67 million and $142.48 in app income. The ETH L2 ecosystem continues to gain momentum, driven by ZKSync’s surge and the emergence of new scaling patterns. Last week, a tweet from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin triggered a surge in the price of ZKsync. “ZKsync has been doing a lot of underrated and valuable work in the Ethereum ecosystem. Excited to see this come from them!” – Vitalik Buterin , Ethereum Co-founder. On October 31, Alex Gluchowski, the co-founder of ZKsync, stated on X (Twitter) that the ZKsync Atlas improvement will result in almost no costs, 15k+ TPS, and 1-second ZK finality. He claimed that L2s can now rely on ETH as the institutional capital liquidity center for real-time transactions. Gluchowski explained that Atlas reduces L1 to L2 interop latency below an ETH block’s finality time. He added that Atlas reduces L2 to L2 interop latency to about one second. Gluchowski explained that the reduction implies that a separate liquidity center is no longer needed for institutional and RWA flows, where participants really wait for ETH finality. ETH TPS surges while L2 networks cut transaction costs GrowThePie claimed that with future advancements, the ETH ecosystem’s objective is to scale by about three times annually. The platform emphasized that the pace of TPS is expected to quicken after years of consistent progress. The platform stated that by the end of the decade, the pace would surpass today’s 18.6 TPS, reaching 10,000 TPS. Ethereum Mainnet targets massive 10,000 TPS by 2031. Source: GrowThePie Ethereum Mainnet has steadily increased its capacity and efficiency since launch, without compromising security or decentralization. The crypto analytics platform emphasized that the Ethereum Mainnet underwent several major renovations that helped to increase its capacity and efficiency gradually. As of today, the ETH ecosystem is sustaining strong on-chain performance, with an average of 499.1 transactions per second (TPS). ETH ecosystem experienced an all-time high of 5,513 TPS and a 24-hour peak of 4,343 TPS. Token transfer fees, on the other hand, show the inefficiencies of Mainnet and L2 networks. Ethereum Mainnet transactions typically incur a cost of $0.7023 per transfer, whereas L2 networks charge only $0.0031. On-chain economic activity is still changing. Application revenue has increased to $41.8 million, of which 15.73% comes from L2s. L2s account for 7.77% of the stablecoin supply, which has increased to $188.6 billion at the same time.

The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios.

Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. Investing Risk . Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment held by the Fund to be more volatile than the market generally. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. As of the date of this prospectus, in addition to the risks associated with the software industry, BMNR is subject to many risks that can negatively impact its revenue and viability including, but not limited to, supply or manufacturing delays, increased material or labor costs or shortages, reduced demand for its products, product liability claims, and the ability to attract, hire and retain key employees or qualified personnel. The trading price of BMNR common stock historically has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Additionally, a large proportion of BMNR’s common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for its common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. BMNR is a highly dynamic company, and its operations, including its products and services, may change. Digital Assets Risk. The Fund(s) is subject to the digital assets risk due to its investment exposure to BMNR, GEMI as BMNR, GEMI holds digital assets in its corporate treasury. The trading prices of many digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have experienced extreme volatility and may continue to do so. Extreme volatility in the future, including further declines in the trading prices of Bitcoin or Ether, could have a material adverse effect on the Fund. Bitcoins and Ether are bearer instruments and the loss or destruction of a private key required to access a Bitcoin or Ether may be irreversible. If a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, the owner would be unable to access the Bitcoin or Ether corresponding to that private key and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the digital asset network. Digital asset networks and the software used to operate them are in the early stages of development. Given the recentness of the development of digital asset networks, Bitcoin or Ethereum may not function as intended and parties may be unwilling to use Bitcoin or Ethereum, which would dampen the growth, if any, of digital asset networks. Governance of many digital asset networks are by voluntary consensus and open competition. As a result, there may be a lack of consensus or clarity on the governance of the digital asset networks, which may stymie a digital asset network’s utility and ability to grow and face challenges . There is a lack of consensus regarding the regulation of Bitcoin and Ethereum and their respective markets. As a result of the growth in the size of the Bitcoin or Ether markets, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies (including FinCEN, SEC, OCC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, state financial institution regulators, and others) have been examining the operations of digital asset networks, digital asset users and digital asset markets. Many of these state and federal agencies have brought enforcement actions or issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital assets to investors. Ongoing and future regulatory actions with respect to digital assets may alter, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the nature of an investment in a digital asset. Blockchain Risk. Blockchain companies may be adversely impacted by government regulations or economic conditions. Blockchain technology is new and its uses are in many cases untested or unclear. These companies may also have significant exposure to fluctuations in the spot prices of digital assets, particularly to the extent that demand for a company’s hardware or services may increase as the spot price of digital assets increase. Blockchain companies typically face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. In addition, many blockchain companies store sensitive consumer information and could be the target of cybersecurity attacks and other types of theft, which could have a negative impact on these companies. Access to a given blockchain may require a specific cryptographic key (in effect a string of characters granting unique access to initiate transactions related to specific digital assets) or set of keys, the theft, loss, or destruction of which, either by accident or as a result of the efforts of a third party, could irrevocably impair a claim to the digital assets stored on that blockchain. Many blockchain companies currently operate under less regulatory scrutiny than traditional financial services companies and banks, but there is significant risk that regulatory oversight could increase in the future. Higher levels of regulation could increase costs and adversely impact the current business models of some blockchain companies. For example, restrictions imposed by foreign governments, including China, on the use and mining of digital assets, may adversely impact blockchain companies and in turn the Fund. These companies could be negatively impacted by disruptions in service caused by hardware or software failure, or by interruptions or delays in service by third-party data center hosting facilities and maintenance providers. Blockchain companies involved in digital assets may face slow adoption rates and be subject to higher levels of regulatory scrutiny in the future, which could severely impact the viability of these companies. blockchain companies, especially smaller companies, tend to be more volatile than companies that do not rely heavily on technology. The customers and/or suppliers of blockchain companies may be concentrated in a particular country, region or industry. Any adverse event affecting one of these countries, regions or industries could have a negative impact on blockchain companies. PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund's future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus. INVESTMENT RISKS : Investing in the Funds involves a high degree of risk. As with any investment, there is a risk that you could lose all or a portion of your investment in the Funds. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if GEMI, BLSH or BMNR respectively, has flat performance, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if GEMI, BLSH or BMNR’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day.

Just as a government shutdown can create widespread economic uncertainty, a similar, extended challenge is currently gripping the digital asset space: Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty . This persistent lack of clear, unified guidelines is casting a long shadow over the market, influencing everything from innovation to investor confidence. Understanding this complex landscape is vital for anyone involved in crypto today. What is Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty? At its core, Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty refers to the ongoing lack of comprehensive, consistent, and globally harmonized legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Many governments worldwide are still grappling with how to classify, tax, and oversee digital assets. This creates a patchwork of rules that can be confusing and contradictory. This prolonged state of flux means that businesses and investors operate without a clear roadmap. They often face: Unpredictable enforcement actions. Varying interpretations of existing laws. Difficulties in planning long-term strategies. Consequently, this can stifle innovation and deter mainstream institutional adoption, as large entities often require regulatory clarity before making significant commitments. How Does Prolonged Uncertainty Affect the Crypto Market? The extended period of Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty has several profound impacts on the market. Firstly, it creates a climate of fear and hesitation among potential investors. Without clear rules, many institutional players remain on the sidelines, waiting for more predictable operating conditions. This absence of major capital inflows can limit market growth and liquidity. Moreover, it poses significant challenges for crypto startups and established companies alike. Developing new products and services becomes a high-risk endeavor when the legal landscape can shift dramatically overnight. Companies might hesitate to invest heavily in research and development, or they may choose to relocate to jurisdictions with more favorable or clearer regulations. This leads to a brain drain and a potential loss of innovation in regions with ambiguous policies. Key Challenges Include: Innovation Hindrance: Startups struggle to build and scale without knowing future legal obligations. Investor Hesitation: Institutional money remains cautious, impacting market cap and stability. Compliance Costs: Companies spend vast resources navigating disparate and evolving legal requirements. Market Volatility: Regulatory news, even rumors, can trigger significant price swings. Navigating the Murky Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors and Innovators Despite the pervasive Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty , there are proactive steps that both investors and innovators can take. For investors, diversification is key. Consider spreading investments across various asset classes and projects that demonstrate strong fundamentals and a commitment to compliance. Staying informed about global regulatory developments is also crucial. Following reputable news sources and engaging with policy discussions can provide early warnings and insights. For innovators and projects, prioritizing legal counsel and proactive engagement with regulators is paramount. Building robust compliance frameworks from the outset, even in uncertain environments, can position a project for long-term success. Focusing on decentralized solutions that inherently reduce reliance on central authorities can also be a strategic advantage. Furthermore, exploring jurisdictions that offer clearer regulatory sandboxes or frameworks can provide a temporary haven for development and testing. Actionable Insights: For Investors: Diversify portfolios, stay updated on global regulatory news, and prioritize projects with clear compliance strategies. For Innovators: Engage legal experts early, build compliance into your core design, and explore friendly regulatory environments. What Lies Ahead for Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty? The future of Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty remains a hot topic of debate. Many experts believe that a global, harmonized approach is inevitable, though the timeline for such an agreement is unclear. Initiatives by international bodies and a growing understanding of blockchain technology among policymakers offer a glimmer of hope. However, until concrete frameworks are established, market participants must continue to adapt and remain vigilant. The prolonged nature of this regulatory limbo tests the resilience of the crypto ecosystem. While it presents significant hurdles, it also forces the industry to mature, prioritize security, and develop more robust, transparent systems. The eventual clarity will likely pave the way for unprecedented growth and wider adoption, but the journey through this uncertain period requires patience and strategic foresight. FAQs: Addressing Your Concerns About Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty Q1: What are the main causes of Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty? A1: The main causes include the novelty of the technology, its decentralized nature, varying national interests, and the challenge of classifying digital assets as securities, commodities, or currencies. Q2: How does Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty impact institutional adoption? A2: It significantly hinders institutional adoption as large financial institutions require clear legal frameworks to manage risk, ensure compliance, and satisfy their own regulatory obligations before investing heavily in crypto. Q3: Are there any countries with clear crypto regulations? A3: Some countries like Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland have made significant progress in establishing clearer regulatory frameworks for certain aspects of crypto, offering more certainty than others. Q4: What should individual investors do during periods of high Crypto Regulatory Uncertainty? A4: Individual investors should focus on educating themselves, diversifying their portfolios, investing only what they can afford to lose, and choosing reputable platforms that prioritize compliance and security. Q5: Will global regulatory harmonization ever be achieved for cryptocurrencies? A5: While challenging due to diverse national interests, there’s a growing consensus that some form of global coordination is necessary. International bodies are working towards this, but it will likely be a gradual process. If you found this article insightful, please share it with your network!

54059760,621541,1762351219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54059760.jpeg,Where Does The US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Stand? Senator Lummis Speaks Out,https://bitcoinist.com/strategic-bitcoin-reserve-senator-lummis/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis used an early-morning X post on Nov. 5 (Europe) to endorse a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and to praise the administration’s stance. “I truly believe the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is the only solution to offset our national debt,” she wrote, adding that she “applaud[s] @POTUS and his administration for embracing the SBR, and I look forward to getting it done.” Where Does The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Stand? In a Nov. 4 segment on “Bloomberg Crypto,” Lummis addressed how the reserve would be built and, specifically, whether it would come from selling US gold . “I have not,” she said when asked if there was traction on converting gold into bitcoin. “I think the administration is looking at ideas other than using our gold certificates, marking them to market, and converting them to bitcoin. There are other ways to have a strategic bitcoin reserve other than converting our gold certificates. Secretary Scott Bessent is looking at those matters as well as the folks at the White House.” She framed bitcoin as a long-term asset: “I’m glad they are embracing the notion of a bitcoin strategic reserve. It is an asset that will grow over time and help offset the burgeoning growth in our national debt.” Lummis also gave a status update on the crypto market-structure bill, describing day-to-day, bipartisan staff work aimed at clearing issues before a Senate Banking Committee vote. “Right now, we are working at the staff levels every single day These are bipartisan discussions […] We are making tremendous progress at that level […] making sure that [the bill] incorporates both-party changes and has been vetted by industry so they will understand what they are being asked to do from a regulatory point of view.” On Senate Democrats, she said, “We have been working with them since July […] Lately, intensely to make sure they are comfortable with the draft […] These conversations at this point are very successful. They are slower than we hoped,” adding that the goal is to avoid after-the-fact renegotiations. Asked whether “President Trump’s pardon of the Binance CEO” affected momentum, Lummis separated that episode from policy work. “Not to my knowledge. Market structure is very different from that issue […] We are trying to stay focused on market structure moving forward rather than looking in the rearview mirror.” Previously, Lummis has outlined the legislative order as stablecoins first (GENIUS Act), then market structure (the CLARITY package), followed by the Bitcoin Reserve bill. Her latest comments keep that sequence intact while signaling White House engagement on the reserve concept and ongoing bipartisan negotiations on the market-structure text.

Blockchain companies involved in digital assets may face slow adoption rates and be subject to higher levels of regulatory scrutiny in the future, which could severely impact the viability of these companies. blockchain companies, especially smaller companies, tend to be more volatile than companies that do not rely heavily on technology. The customers and/or suppliers of blockchain companies may be concentrated in a particular country, region or industry. Any adverse event affecting one of these countries, regions or industries could have a negative impact on blockchain companies.

All Averages are asset-weighted. Newly launched Funds have risks associated with a limited operating history. The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day.

Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. Investing Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment held by the Fund to be more volatile than the market generally. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. As of the date of this prospectus, in addition to the risks associated with the software industry, BMNR is subject to many risks that can negatively impact its revenue and viability including, but not limited to, supply or manufacturing delays, increased material or labor costs or shortages, reduced demand for its products, product liability claims, and the ability to attract, hire and retain key employees or qualified personnel. The trading price of BMNR common stock historically has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Additionally, a large proportion of BMNR’s common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for its common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. BMNR is a highly dynamic company, and its operations, including its products and services, may change. Digital Assets Risk. The Fund(s) is subject to the digital assets risk due to its investment exposure to BMNR, GEMI as BMNR, GEMI holds digital assets in its corporate treasury. The trading prices of many digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have experienced extreme volatility and may continue to do so. Extreme volatility in the future, including further declines in the trading prices of Bitcoin or Ether, could have a material adverse effect on the Fund. Bitcoins and Ether are bearer instruments and the loss or destruction of a private key required to access a Bitcoin or Ether may be irreversible. If a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, the owner would be unable to access the Bitcoin or Ether corresponding to that private key and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the digital asset network. Digital asset networks and the software used to operate them are in the early stages of development. Given the recentness of the development of digital asset networks, Bitcoin or Ethereum may not function as intended and parties may be unwilling to use Bitcoin or Ethereum, which would dampen the growth, if any, of digital asset networks. Governance of many digital asset networks are by voluntary consensus and open competition. As a result, there may be a lack of consensus or clarity on the governance of the digital asset networks, which may stymie a digital asset network’s utility and ability to grow and face challenges. There is a lack of consensus regarding the regulation of Bitcoin and Ethereum and their respective markets. As a result of the growth in the size of the Bitcoin or Ether markets, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies (including FinCEN, SEC, OCC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, state financial institution regulators, and others) have been examining the operations of digital asset networks, digital asset users and digital asset markets. Many of these state and federal agencies have brought enforcement actions or issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital assets to investors. Ongoing and future regulatory actions with respect to digital assets may alter, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the nature of an investment in a digital asset. Blockchain Risk. Blockchain companies may be adversely impacted by government regulations or economic conditions. Blockchain technology is new and its uses are in many cases untested or unclear. These companies may also have significant exposure to fluctuations in the spot prices of digital assets, particularly to the extent that demand for a company’s hardware or services may increase as the spot price of digital assets increase. Blockchain companies typically face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. In addition, many blockchain companies store sensitive consumer information and could be the target of cybersecurity attacks and other types of theft, which could have a negative impact on these companies. Access to a given blockchain may require a specific cryptographic key (in effect a string of characters granting unique access to initiate transactions related to specific digital assets) or set of keys, the theft, loss, or destruction of which, either by accident or as a result of the efforts of a third party, could irrevocably impair a claim to the digital assets stored on that blockchain. Many blockchain companies currently operate under less regulatory scrutiny than traditional financial services companies and banks, but there is significant risk that regulatory oversight could increase in the future. Higher levels of regulation could increase costs and adversely impact the current business models of some blockchain companies. For example, restrictions imposed by foreign governments, including China, on the use and mining of digital assets, may adversely impact blockchain companies and in turn the Fund. These companies could be negatively impacted by disruptions in service caused by hardware or software failure, or by interruptions or delays in service by third-party data center hosting facilities and maintenance providers. Blockchain companies involved in digital assets may face slow adoption rates and be subject to higher levels of regulatory scrutiny in the future, which could severely impact the viability of these companies. blockchain companies, especially smaller companies, tend to be more volatile than companies that do not rely heavily on technology. The customers and/or suppliers of blockchain companies may be concentrated in a particular country, region or industry.

According to a recent analysis, the world’s leading cryptocurrency has settled into a balanced, sideways market. This holding pattern is largely due to remarkably low selling pressure from long-term investors, creating a unique moment as the market awaits fresh catalysts. Understanding Bitcoin’s Current Holding Pattern A recent deep dive by CryptoQuant contributor Arabchain sheds light on the current market dynamics. Arabchain explains that Bitcoin is presently trading below its moving average. This position reflects a period of mild selling pressure and a noticeable slowdown in upward momentum over recent days. However, this isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm for long-term holders. Mild Selling Pressure: The slight dip below the moving average indicates some profit-taking or minor corrections, but nothing drastic. Slowing Momentum: The market isn’t seeing aggressive buying, leading to a more stable, less volatile trading environment. Crucially, the unrealized loss indicator, a key metric for understanding investor sentiment, stands at a significantly low level of 0.06. This figure suggests that only a small minority of traders on platforms like Binance are currently experiencing losses. This data is vital because it implies the market has not yet entered a widespread sell-off phase. Long-term investors, in particular, are showing little inclination to offload their assets, contributing to Bitcoin’s stable stance. Why Are Long-Term Bitcoin Investors Staying Resilient? The resilience of long-term Bitcoin investors is a powerful signal. When the unrealized loss indicator is low, it often points to a market where most participants are either in profit or close to their entry price. This scenario reduces the psychological pressure to sell, even during periods of sideways movement. This steady behavior indicates a mature market where conviction among seasoned investors remains strong. They are choosing to hold onto their Bitcoin , suggesting a belief in its future potential rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. This collective patience prevents the kind of cascade selling that can trigger significant price drops, thus maintaining the current balanced state. The absence of significant selling pressure from these core holders is a foundational element supporting Bitcoin’s current stability. It demonstrates a market less susceptible to panic, even when new catalysts are scarce. This steadfastness is a testament to the evolving nature of cryptocurrency investing. What’s Next for Bitcoin: Key Price Levels to Watch While Bitcoin is currently in a holding pattern, Arabchain’s analysis also outlines potential triggers for its next significant move. Understanding these key levels is essential for any investor or enthusiast following the market. Upward Momentum: If the price manages to recover and surge above its moving average, upward momentum could quickly resume. This scenario would likely attract new buying interest and potentially push Bitcoin into a fresh growth phase. Correction Trigger: Conversely, a significant drop below the critical $100,000 mark could initiate a full-blown correction. This level acts as a psychological and technical support point, and breaching it might signal a shift towards a more bearish sentiment. Ultimately, the market is waiting for new catalysts. These could range from significant institutional adoption news, macroeconomic shifts, regulatory clarity, or technological advancements within the crypto space. Until such catalysts emerge, Bitcoin is likely to continue its current balanced trading, reflecting the strong resolve of its long-term investor base. The Enduring Patience of Bitcoin Holders In conclusion, Bitcoin finds itself in a period of remarkable equilibrium. Despite mild selling pressure and a slowdown in upward momentum, the unwavering commitment of long-term investors is keeping the market stable. The low unrealized loss indicator highlights a collective patience, preventing a large-scale sell-off. While the path ahead depends on new catalysts and key price levels, the current holding pattern underscores the growing maturity and resilience of the Bitcoin ecosystem. This calm before a potential storm or surge makes it a fascinating time to observe the leading digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does “holding pattern” mean for Bitcoin? A “holding pattern” for Bitcoin means the price is trading sideways in a relatively balanced market. There’s no strong upward or downward trend, indicating a period of consolidation as it awaits new market catalysts. Who is Arabchain, and why is their analysis relevant? Arabchain is a contributor to CryptoQuant, a reputable on-chain data and analytics platform. Their analysis is relevant because it leverages specific market indicators, like the unrealized loss indicator, to provide insights into investor behavior and market sentiment, contributing to the overall understanding of Bitcoin’s price action. What is the “unrealized loss indicator”? The unrealized loss indicator measures the percentage of coins currently held at a loss. A significantly low level, like 0.06 mentioned by Arabchain, suggests that only a small fraction of investors are underwater on their positions, which typically reduces the likelihood of widespread selling. What price levels are crucial for Bitcoin right now? According to the analysis, a recovery above its moving average could signal renewed upward momentum. Conversely, a drop below $100,000 is highlighted as a critical level that could trigger a full-blown market correction for Bitcoin. What could trigger a major price move for Bitcoin? Major price moves for Bitcoin are typically triggered by new catalysts. These could include significant macroeconomic developments, increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, or substantial technological upgrades within the cryptocurrency space.

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-liquidity-flood-incoming-heres-the-signal/,"The global market may be entering a new era of monetary expansion. Analysts believe the latest policy shift by the Federal Reserve could reshape asset flows worldwide. For XRP investors, this could mark a defining moment as liquidity begins to redirect toward tokenized systems and blockchain-based rails. The Fed’s Latest Move and Its Implications The Federal Reserve has officially cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Alongside the rate cut, it announced the end of quantitative tightening by December 1, 2025. This decision signals a pivot from monetary contraction to a more accommodative stance. Ending quantitative tightening means the Fed will stop shrinking its balance sheet and begin reinvesting in maturing assets. Such a move increases the amount of liquidity circulating in the financial system. #XRP LIQUIDITY FLOOD INCOMING pic.twitter.com/OzmH1HlwHP — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 4, 2025 What Liquidity Expansion Means for Crypto Whenever the cost of borrowing falls and liquidity rises, risk-on assets tend to respond aggressively. Cheaper money often fuels investment in alternative markets, including cryptocurrencies. Historically, rate cuts have triggered major rallies in the digital asset sector. Bitcoin surged nearly tenfold after the 2020 easing cycle. Ethereum also rallied sharply in 2021 under similar liquidity conditions. These patterns suggest that renewed easing could again ignite a strong upward trend in crypto assets. Ripple Bull Winkle’s Take on the Coming Flood Ripple Bull Winkle, a well-known crypto analyst, shared his perspective in a video posted on X. He declared, “Breaking news, everyone — the Fed just pulled the trigger. Liquidity flood is incoming.” He noted that the combination of rate cuts and the end of tightening would reintroduce “cheap money” into global markets. According to him, this time the liquidity won’t primarily benefit stocks but will instead flow into tokenized assets, stablecoins, and blockchain settlement networks. He emphasized, “This pivot isn’t random — it is engineered. Ripple is positioned right at the crossfire of monetary policy and blockchain utility.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why XRP May Stand at the Center of It All Ripple’s network already underpins real-world tokenization and institutional settlements . With Ripple’s technology facilitating stablecoin transfers and cross-border payments, XRP could become one of the major beneficiaries of this policy shift. Liquidity moving into tokenized assets naturally demands efficient settlement rails, and XRP’s structure fits this requirement perfectly. A Note of Caution and Perspective While optimism is rising, market reactions to monetary policy can take time. The Federal Reserve remains cautious and data-dependent. Inflation management remains a priority, and any unexpected rise in consumer prices could delay further easing. Therefore, while liquidity may begin to expand, investors should remain aware of timing risks and short-term volatility. In conclusion, Ripple Bull Winkle’s warning resonates across the market: liquidity is returning, and blockchain may be its first destination. The coming months will reveal whether XRP becomes a leading vessel in this flood of capital. For holders, the signal is clear — global liquidity is shifting, and XRP stands in a powerful position to receive it.

Recent analysis reveals that over 28% of Bitcoin supply is at a loss, potentially marking a crucial turning point for the cryptocurrency market. This situation often indicates that we might be approaching a market bottom, presenting unique opportunities for savvy investors. What Does Bitcoin Supply at Loss Really Mean? When we talk about Bitcoin supply at loss, we’re referring to coins purchased at higher prices than their current market value. CryptoQuant contributor I. Moreno’s analysis shows that more than 28% of circulating Bitcoin currently falls into this category. This metric serves as a powerful market indicator because it reflects investor psychology and potential price support levels. The current situation suggests we’ve reached a psychological inflection point. Historically, when this percentage of Bitcoin supply is at loss, the market tends to find support. However, it’s important to remember that further corrections could still occur before a sustained recovery begins. Why Should You Care About Bitcoin Supply Metrics? Understanding Bitcoin supply at loss helps you make informed investment decisions. Here are key reasons why this metric matters: It indicates potential buying opportunities It helps identify market sentiment extremes It provides historical context for price movements It signals when fear might be dominating the market Moreno emphasizes that this range has historically coincided with short-term bottoms for Bitcoin. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, this pattern has proven reliable in previous market cycles. How Can Investors Use This Information? Smart investors monitor Bitcoin supply at loss to time their entry points. When a significant portion of supply is underwater, it often means weaker hands have sold, reducing selling pressure. This creates conditions where even modest buying can push prices higher. However, always remember to: Diversify your portfolio Only invest what you can afford to lose Consider dollar-cost averaging The current Bitcoin supply at loss situation suggests we might be in accumulation territory. While volatility may continue, historical patterns indicate this could be an advantageous time for long-term investors. What’s Next for Bitcoin Investors? Monitoring Bitcoin supply at loss provides valuable insights, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Market conditions can change rapidly, and multiple factors influence cryptocurrency prices. Therefore, combine this metric with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. The key takeaway is simple: when Bitcoin supply at loss reaches these levels, it often precedes significant price movements. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to crypto, understanding these patterns can help you navigate market cycles more effectively. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of Bitcoin supply is currently at profit? Approximately 72% of Bitcoin supply remains in profit, though this fluctuates with price changes. How often does Bitcoin supply at loss reach these levels? This typically occurs during major market corrections and has happened several times in Bitcoin’s history. Does Bitcoin supply at loss guarantee a price bottom? While it strongly suggests a potential bottom, no single metric can guarantee market movements with absolute certainty. How quickly do prices typically recover after these levels? Recovery times vary, but historical data shows bounces often occur within weeks to months. Should beginners use this metric for trading decisions? It’s best used as part of a comprehensive analysis strategy rather than as a standalone signal. Where can I find current Bitcoin supply at loss data? Several analytics platforms like CryptoQuant provide real-time on-chain metrics including supply in profit/loss. Found this analysis helpful?

As of November 5, BTC trades near $104,000 , even as the U.S. M2 money supply climbed to $22.21 trillion and global M2 reached $95.8 trillion , a divergence from their previously tight correlation. Analysts cite U.S. Treasury behavior, long-term holder distribution, and Bitcoin’s rising 85% correlation with the NASDAQ as key drivers, along with miners increasingly shifting resources from Bitcoin hashing to AI compute . CryptoQuant data paints a more concerning picture. Bitcoin has now fallen below its 365-day moving average (~$102K) — a level that acted as the “last line of defense” before the 2022 bear market fully unfolded. The firm’s Bull Score Index has hit zero for the first time since June 2022, indicating extremely weak fundamentals. If BTC fails to reclaim the $100K band quickly, the Traders’ Realized Price model suggests a potential slide toward $72K within 1–2 months. Under a network-valuation lens based on Metcalfe’s Law, the next major support sits around $91K , a level Bitcoin hovered near from late 2024 to mid-2025. On-chain data reveals mounting psychological stress. Nearly one-third of all Bitcoin in circulation is now held at a loss , indicating that pressure is shifting from new entrants to broader segments of the market. Source: CryptoQuant Historically, these levels often coincide with exhaustion points, moments where selling dries up and durable bottoms form. But if fear continues rising and long-term holders begin derisking, any short-term rebound could turn into an exit rally rather than the start of a new uptrend, gradually eroding demand and conviction. The market now sits at a fragile equilibrium between fear, liquidity, and patience. If selling pressure continues while BTC remains under key technical levels, the structure of this bull cycle may be tested more severely. If, however, capitulation peaks and liquidity returns, potentially aided by ongoing Fed rate cuts, this region could become the next major accumulation zone.

According to Citibank’s latest analysis, crypto investor sentiment took a massive hit from October’s record-breaking liquidation event, creating ripple effects across the entire digital asset landscape. This development explains why many investors are suddenly questioning their positions. What Exactly Happened to Crypto Investor Sentiment? Citibank identified October 10th as the critical turning point when a massive forced liquidation occurred. This event represented the worst liquidation on record, directly damaging crypto investor sentiment beyond previous market corrections. The bank’s report highlights how such events create fear and uncertainty among market participants. How Did Liquidation Impact Market Dynamics? The forced selling created a domino effect across cryptocurrency markets. We saw three immediate consequences: Exchange-traded fund demand declined significantly Technical indicators worsened across major cryptocurrencies Long-term investors began considering position reductions This triple threat further eroded crypto investor sentiment, creating challenging conditions for market recovery. Why Should You Care About Damaged Crypto Investor Sentiment? When crypto investor sentiment suffers this dramatically, it affects everyone in the ecosystem. Retail investors become hesitant to enter positions, while institutional players may delay planned investments. The Citibank report suggests that recovering crypto investor sentiment will require both time and positive market developments. What Does This Mean for Future Market Recovery? Rebuilding crypto investor sentiment represents the crucial next step for market stabilization. However, the damage from October’s event may have longer-lasting effects than typical market corrections. Market participants should monitor key indicators like ETF flows and trading volumes for signs of improving crypto investor sentiment. Conclusion: Navigating the New Market Reality The Citibank analysis provides crucial insights into how sudden liquidation events can devastate crypto investor sentiment. Understanding these market mechanics helps investors make informed decisions during volatile periods. While current conditions appear challenging, historical patterns suggest markets eventually recover as crypto investor sentiment improves. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the October liquidation event? The exact trigger remains unclear, but Citibank identified it as the worst forced liquidation in recorded history, involving substantial positions across multiple cryptocurrencies. How long does damaged investor sentiment typically last? Recovery time varies, but significant events like October’s liquidation can affect market psychology for several months until new positive developments emerge. Should investors sell during such events? Every investor’s situation differs, but panic selling often locks in losses. Many experts recommend assessing positions based on long-term strategy rather than short-term sentiment swings. Are ETFs still a good cryptocurrency investment? While current demand has declined, cryptocurrency ETFs remain popular for regulated exposure to digital assets. Their recovery will depend on improving market conditions. What signs indicate returning investor confidence? Watch for increasing trading volumes, reduced volatility, renewed institutional interest, and positive regulatory developments as indicators of healing crypto investor sentiment. How can investors protect themselves from future liquidation events? Diversification, position sizing, and understanding leverage risks can help mitigate the impact of sudden market moves on individual portfolios. Found this analysis helpful?

This has earned him a great deal of respect in the crypto and NFT communities over time. For instance, he recently helped uncover and trace a theft involving about $3.05 million worth of XRP tokens that were stolen from a user’s Ellipal cold wallet.

In 2024, losses dropped by another 70%, bringing them down to $47 million. In October 2025, scammers hacked into the BNB Chain’s official X account. They posted phishing links that resulted in an $8,000 theft. The hack used fake WalletConnect prompts and stole $22,000 from injected coins. It showed that hacks into social media accounts can undermine trust even when blockchain systems remain intact. The network plans major upgrades to better the speed and security with a target of 5,000 swaps per second, gasless transactions, and new Rust-based systems. It’s also building Rust-based clients and AI-powered transaction tools.

BNB Chain strikes a balance between Ethereum’s safety and Solana’s speed. On the other hand, a small group of validators makes the centralization risks even higher.

The token’s staggered burn mechanism will use 27% of this. To that end, Bullish BNB price predictions can be maintained even in bearish conditions thanks to the spread of supply. The mechanism has reduced concentration risk and makes BNB less vulnerable to manipulation or excessive volatility. Analysts say that if the positive trend continues, BNB could move toward the $1,200–$1,300 range in the coming weeks. However, there’s also a chance it could slip if Bitcoin or Ethereum drops sharply. On the downside, prices near $1,080 are seen as a key support zone. Meanwhile, the coin is up 1.67% in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $959.9.

Major cryptocurrencies all saw major losses. Bitcoin ( BTC ), down 8% on the week, tested the critical $100,000 support level, while Ethereum ( ETH ) dropped to $3,300, plummeting 16% over the same period. Institutional investors also pulled $1.15 billion from Bitcoin ETFs last week, signaling waning sentiment among traditional institutions, which were the key driver behind Bitcoin’s rally to $126,000 last month. Crypto market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The downturn has resulted in $2.1 billion in overnight liquidations recorded on Wednesday, as approximately 486,069 traders were liquidated during this period. Ethereum and Bitcoin were once again the biggest casualties, losing $679.9 million and $644 million, respectively. Long positions bore the brunt, making up nearly 79% of total liquidations, or $1.67 billion. Are crypto fundamentals strong? Despite the price carnage, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas remains positive that Bitcoin can pull through, citing solid annualized returns: Even with the pullback Bitcoin is up 300% since BlackRock filed for an ETF 30 months ago. That's nearly 80% annualized. Relax. pic.twitter.com/Nx0OJgiVVW — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 5, 2025 “Even with the pullback Bitcoin is up 300% since BlackRock filed for an ETF 30 months ago. That’s nearly 80% annualized. Relax,” wrote Balchunas. The implication seems to be that the current downturn is an overreaction driven by technical factors and leverage, not a fundamental issue. Namely, as crypto is hypersensitive to technical changes, minor shocks can easily translate into major drawdowns. Still, while the analyst may be optimistic, the downward trajectory has sparked fears of another so-called crypto winter, or a prolonged bearish period. For instance, some forecasts , such as those by analyst Ali Martinez, warn that Ethereum could drop to as low as $1,700 if it fails to break past $4,000. The worst-case scenario: Ethereum $ETH fails to reclaim $4,000, breaks through $3,800 support, and drops to $2,400 or $1,700. pic.twitter.com/oKK5VbVRd0 — Ali (@ali_charts) November 4, 2025 The anxiety is emphasized by other markets, such as the ongoing tech selloff that saw Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR ) dropping 8% despite strong earnings, as well as the S&P 500’s 1.2% dip amid AI-driven valuation concerns.

For the first time on Solana, block building becomes decentralized, transparent, and validator-driven. In conjunction with the launch of Harmonic, the team also announced its $6 million seed round, led by Paradigm. In Solana’s existing architecture, each validator takes turns as a leader, building and proposing blocks during their assigned slot. While efficient, this design concentrates block-level control in one operator at a time, prioritizing weighted stake over performance. Harmonic replaces that bottleneck with a coordinated aggregation layer that routes builder proposals to validators in real time, introducing structured block propagation similar to a high-frequency trading order router. “Block building shouldn’t be a black box,” said Ben Coverston, Co-Founder of Harmonic. “Validators should decide what goes into a block, not a single operator or off-chain relay. Harmonic restores choice, competition, and transparency to block production on Solana. In doing so, we aim to bring Solana closer to the deterministic reliability of financial exchange engines such as Nasdaq’s OUCH and INET systems, which are designed for speed, continuous operation and zero downtime.” Through its aggregation layer, Harmonic continuously collects block proposals from independent builders and presents them to validators in real time. Validators can adopt custom policies to guide block selection, including: MEV optimization: Maximize yield from arbitrage or priority fees. Content rules: Enforce inclusion or exclusion lists for specific transactions or protocols. Policy alignment: Prioritize fairness, compliance, or ecosystem preferences. “Solana already leads the industry in raw performance, processing thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality,” said Jakob Povšič, Co-Founder of Harmonic. “By introducing open competition in block building, we push that advantage even further toward the precision, consistency, and throughput of a global exchange engine.” By opening block construction to multiple builders, Harmonic ensures that value discovery remains competitive and validators retain full sovereignty over their block decisions. Parallel block sourcing unlocks new performance ceilings for Solana, which represents one of the largest and fastest-growing validator economies in crypto, with more than $72 billion in active stake across ~1,000 validators. “Harmonic’s open aggregation model transforms Solana’s block production into a continuously optimized and competitive marketplace,” said Frankie, Investing and Research Partner at Paradigm. “The result is exchange-grade performance capable of approaching Nasdaq speed in both reliability and throughput.

The recent price movements have sparked significant discussion among top analysts, particularly after Galaxy Digital made a surprising adjustment to their Bitcoin price target. This revision comes at a crucial time for cryptocurrency investors seeking clarity in volatile market conditions. Why Did Galaxy Digital Adjust Their Bitcoin Price Target? Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, recently revised his year-end Bitcoin price target downward to $120,000 from the previous $185,000 projection. This significant adjustment followed Bitcoin’s drop below the $100,000 threshold, indicating changing market dynamics. The new Bitcoin price target reflects current market realities while maintaining a bullish long-term outlook. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? The revised Bitcoin price target suggests several important considerations for investors. First, it acknowledges the current market pressure while maintaining confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. However, not all analysts share the same perspective on market timing and investment strategy. Geoffrey Kendrick of Standard Chartered offered a contrasting view, suggesting the overnight decline might represent the final downward movement. He recommended a staggered approach to buying during price dips, providing actionable advice for investors navigating current market conditions. How Should You Approach Bitcoin Investing Now? Understanding these expert opinions helps shape smarter investment decisions. Consider these key points: Diversified timing : Implement a staggered buying strategy during price corrections Long-term perspective : Focus on fundamental value rather than short-term fluctuations Risk management : Allocate only what you can afford to potential volatility Expert monitoring : Stay informed about changing analyst projections and market conditions What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory? The differing opinions between major financial institutions highlight the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. While Galaxy Digital’s revised Bitcoin price target suggests tempered expectations, other analysts see potential buying opportunities. This diversity of opinion actually strengthens market analysis by providing multiple perspectives for consideration. Market participants should note that price targets represent educated projections rather than guarantees. The evolving Bitcoin price target reflects ongoing assessment of market conditions, regulatory developments, and global economic factors that influence cryptocurrency valuations. Final Thoughts on Bitcoin Market Analysis The recent adjustment to Galaxy Digital’s Bitcoin price target serves as an important reminder about market volatility and the importance of balanced investment strategies. While short-term projections may change, the long-term potential of Bitcoin continues to attract both institutional and retail interest. Smart investors will use these analyst updates to inform their decisions rather than dictate them entirely. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Galaxy Digital lower their Bitcoin price target? Galaxy Digital adjusted their Bitcoin price target after the cryptocurrency fell below $100,000, reflecting current market conditions and revised expectations for year-end performance. What is Standard Chartered’s view on Bitcoin’s recent price drop? Geoffrey Kendrick of Standard Chartered believes the overnight decline might be the final downward movement and recommends a staggered buy-the-dip strategy for investors. How reliable are Bitcoin price targets from financial institutions? Bitcoin price targets represent expert analysis based on current data, but cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile and unpredictable. These projections should inform rather than dictate investment decisions. What strategy should I use for Bitcoin investing during volatility? Experts recommend dollar-cost averaging, thorough research, risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective when investing in Bitcoin during volatile periods. How often do institutions update their Bitcoin price targets? Financial institutions typically update their Bitcoin price targets when significant market movements occur or when new fundamental information becomes available that affects their analysis. Should I be concerned about the lowered Bitcoin price target? Price target adjustments are normal in volatile markets. Investors should focus on their personal investment strategy, risk tolerance, and long-term goals rather than reacting to single analyst updates. Found this analysis helpful?

Analysis Firm Explains in Detail!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/did-bitcoin-btc-enter-a-bear-market-after-sharp-declines-in-october-and-november-analysis-firm-explains-in-detail/,"In the face of the sharp and sudden declines in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, the BTC price fell below the critical level of $ 100,000. While bearish rhetoric increased in the face of this decline in BTC, one analyst said that BTC was consolidating after mass liquidations and had not entered a bear market. Speaking to The Block, K33 Research president Vetle Lunde said that following large-scale leverage liquidations, a potential bottom has formed in Bitcoin and the price has entered a consolidation phase. Lunde, who stated that K33 Research called October “Rotten October,” attributes the recent decline to the limited liquidity and fear-driven atmosphere that followed the historic deleveraging event on October 10. The analyst also noted that the BTC futures premium on the CME has fallen to its lowest level since the US regional banking crisis in 2023, reflecting cautious investor sentiment. Lunde noted that the current market structure is a typical period of consolidation rather than the beginning of a bear market, describing the current phase in Bitcoin as a process of getting rid of excessive leverage before a major rally characterized by sharp volatility and stagnant trends. Lunde added that selling pressure from long-term investors in Bitcoin is gradually decreasing, and the effects of liquidations are fading. The analyst last argued that once the BTC sell-off stabilizes, investor sentiment will likely improve, potentially pushing the market back into a bullish phase. *This is not investment advice.

This Nasdaq-listed firm, known for its significant SOL cryptocurrency investments, is making waves in the financial world with this bold decision. But what does this Solana share buyback really mean for investors and the broader digital asset market? Why This Solana Share Buyback Matters Now The timing of this Solana share buyback couldn’t be more significant. Companies holding digital assets are increasingly turning to share repurchases as a strategic tool. This approach helps address the common challenge of trading at discounts to net asset value while supporting stock performance. According to The Block’s reporting, this trend reflects a growing sophistication in how companies manage their cryptocurrency treasuries. The $100 million Solana share buyback represents a substantial commitment to shareholder value. How Share Buybacks Benefit Investors This Solana share buyback creates multiple advantages for current shareholders. When companies repurchase their own shares, they effectively reduce the number of outstanding shares in the market. This action can lead to: Increased earnings per share Improved stock valuation metrics Enhanced investor confidence Better alignment with net asset value The Solana share buyback specifically targets the gap between the company’s market price and its actual asset value. This strategic move demonstrates management’s confidence in the company’s future prospects. The Digital Asset Treasury Revolution What makes this Solana share buyback particularly interesting is its connection to cryptocurrency holdings. Companies with substantial digital asset treasuries are discovering new ways to leverage these assets for corporate finance strategies. The $100 million Solana share buyback follows a pattern we’re seeing across the industry. More firms are recognizing that their cryptocurrency investments can serve as powerful tools for capital management. This approach represents a maturation of the digital asset space. What Investors Should Watch For As this Solana share buyback progresses, investors should monitor several key indicators. The execution timeline, purchase prices, and market response will all provide valuable insights. Additionally, watch how this move influences other companies with similar digital asset exposure. The success of this Solana share buyback could set a precedent for how cryptocurrency-heavy companies manage their capital structures in the future. Conclusion: A Strategic Move Worth Watching The $100 million Solana share buyback represents more than just a corporate action—it signals a new era of sophisticated digital asset management. This bold strategy demonstrates how companies are leveraging cryptocurrency holdings to create shareholder value while navigating market dynamics. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, such strategic moves will likely become increasingly common among forward-thinking companies. Frequently Asked Questions What is a share buyback? A share buyback occurs when a company repurchases its own outstanding shares from the market, reducing the total number of shares available to investors. Why would a company initiate a share buyback? Companies typically initiate buybacks to boost shareholder value, support stock prices, utilize excess cash, or address valuation discounts relative to their assets. How does the Solana share buyback affect stock price? The Solana share buyback can potentially increase the stock price by reducing supply, signaling management confidence, and improving per-share metrics. What makes this buyback different from traditional ones? This Solana share buyback is notable because the company holds significant cryptocurrency assets, making it part of a new trend in digital asset treasury management. When will the buyback be completed? The company hasn’t specified an exact timeline, but such programs typically occur over several months or quarters based on market conditions. Can investors participate in the buyback? No, share buybacks are conducted by the company itself in the open market or through tender offers, not through direct investor participation.

Google has faced significant scrutiny in the U.S. and abroad over its app store practices. Regulators have long questioned how much control the company exerts over Android, and the case with Epic is a step in addressing those concerns. Epic and Google’s five-year antitrust battle finally ends Google and Epic Games Inc., the maker of Fortnite, have reached a settlement in a legal battle that’s lasted for five years so far. The dispute is over app revenue distribution and payment rules on Android devices. Epic accused Google of using its power to restrict how apps are distributed and monetized on Android. The financial agreements in the settlement weren’t disclosed, but it was filed in a San Francisco federal court following a series of major court-ordered changes to Google’s Play Store. After the verdict, U.S. District Judge James Donato ordered Google to open up Android to outside app stores and alternative payment methods. Google was also banned from giving special treatment to its own services on Android phones. Developers were given the right to direct users toward payment options that are cheaper for them outside the Play Store. This move is expected to reduce Google’s commission fees. The settlement will largely maintain the court’s requirements with some modifications. Both companies told the court they plan to adjust the earlier order as part of their agreement. New rules for Google Play and app developers Under the terms of the proposed deal, Google will still have to allow developers to offer alternative payment options, but with defined commission caps. Purchases made outside of the Play Store will now carry commissions of either 9% or 20%, depending on the type of transaction. Judge Donato’s earlier order required Google to share its full Play Store catalog with competitors. The new settlement replaces that rule with a system of “registered app stores” that will receive the same treatment as the Google Play Store on Android devices, ensuring fairer competition without forcing Google to share its entire app database. “The parties have agreed to resolve their disputes with a settlement that both parties believe will advance the evolution of the Android platform,” the companies said in a joint filing. The deal will also end related litigation involving Samsung Electronics Co. Sameer Samat, Google’s head of Android, said the new rules are designed to give developers more of a choice and allow for flexibility. Other benefits include lower fees, more room for competition, and the safety of users. Epic Games’ CEO Tim Sweeney also praised the deal. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Police first exposed the case in September 2023, making it one of the city’s largest financial fraud probes, with losses of approximately HK$1.616 billion reported by 2,636 complainants as of February. A November 7 South China Morning Post report cited Chief Superintendent Ernest Wong Chun-yue of the commercial crime bureau saying Interpol is pursuing two ringleaders and one core member of the operation. 16 charged in JPEX crypto fraud case – over 2 years since initial arrests. In full: https://t.co/hYQVWFUa2G — Hong Kong Free Press HKFP (@hkfp) November 5, 2025 JPEX Crypto Fraud Leaders on Interpol’s Red Notice List Local authorities have pressed charges against six principal members, seven promoters, and others who allegedly conspired to lure Hong Kong residents into virtual asset investments before stealing and laundering their money. As per reports, police have now made 80 arrests and frozen assets totaling HK$228 million, including HK$14.5 million in cryptocurrency, plus real estate, luxury cars, bank funds, and cash. Security Bureau figures show 666 victims have declined to take further action, 659 remain unreachable, and 1,311 have given formal statements. Senior Superintendent Fanny Kung Hing-fun noted that several suspects escaped before arrests began, prompting police to issue Interpol red notices for the three fugitives. This prosecution is the first JPEX crypto fraud instance of charges filed under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance The six principal members, seven promoters, and OTC participants face accusations of fraudulently or recklessly convincing others to invest in virtual assets. Conviction carries up to HK$1 million in fines and seven years in prison. All 16 defendants now face money laundering charges, including Lam and promoter Chan Wing-yee, and the group will appear in Eastern Court on Thursday morning.

SFC Exposes False License Claims by JPEX Promoters Notably, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) disclosed that JPEX-affiliated cash-for-crypto outlets and social media promoters falsely claimed the platform was pursuing regulatory approval when no application existed. Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu endorsed the commission’s approach of publishing “transparent and clear” details about crypto companies seeking licenses and those already approved. Lee added that “This clear information will assist investors to make decisions as to what they should do when they consider making an investment.” Security Chief Tang also announced that authorities are now collaborating with the commission to curb fraud like that of JPEX through enhanced education on safe trading practices. Commission data shows roughly 11 platforms, including HashKey, OSL, HKVAX, Bullish, BGE, and HKBitEx, have secured licenses for retail cryptocurrency trading in Hong Kong.

This isn’t science fiction—it’s happening right now, and the implications for global finance are profound. How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Currency Markets The integration of artificial intelligence into financial markets represents one of the most significant developments in modern economics. AI algorithms now process vast amounts of data to predict currency movements, identify trading patterns, and execute transactions at speeds impossible for human traders. These systems analyze everything from geopolitical events to social media sentiment, creating a new paradigm for how the US dollar interacts with global markets. The US Dollar in the Age of Intelligent Systems As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, its impact on the US dollar grows increasingly complex. AI-driven trading accounts for a substantial portion of daily foreign exchange volume, creating both opportunities and challenges for dollar stability. The Federal Reserve now employs machine learning models to better understand economic trends and make more informed decisions about interest rates and monetary policy. AI Application Impact on US Dollar Timeframe Algorithmic Trading Increased volatility and liquidity Immediate Risk Assessment More accurate currency valuation Short-term Economic Forecasting Better monetary policy decisions Medium-term Payment Systems Reduced transaction costs Long-term Monetary Policy Meets Machine Learning Central banks worldwide are embracing artificial intelligence to enhance their monetary policy frameworks. The Federal Reserve uses AI models to analyze economic indicators, predict inflation trends, and assess the impact of policy changes on the US dollar. This technological advancement allows for more responsive and data-driven decision-making, potentially reducing the risk of policy errors that could destabilize currency markets. Real-time economic monitoring through AI systems Predictive analytics for inflation and employment trends Stress testing of financial systems using machine learning Automated regulatory compliance and risk management Currency Markets Revolutionized by AI Technology The transformation of currency markets through artificial intelligence represents a fundamental shift in how the US dollar is traded and valued. High-frequency trading algorithms, powered by sophisticated AI, now dominate foreign exchange markets, executing millions of transactions daily. These systems can identify arbitrage opportunities and market inefficiencies that human traders would miss, creating a more efficient but potentially more volatile trading environment for the world’s primary reserve currency. Economic Forecasting in the AI Era Artificial intelligence has revolutionized economic forecasting, providing unprecedented insights into the future trajectory of the US dollar. Machine learning models analyze complex relationships between economic variables, geopolitical events, and market sentiment to generate more accurate predictions. This enhanced forecasting capability helps businesses, investors, and policymakers make better decisions regarding dollar-denominated assets and international trade. What Challenges Does AI Pose for the US Dollar? While artificial intelligence offers numerous benefits, it also presents significant challenges for the US dollar’s stability and dominance. The concentration of AI capabilities among large financial institutions could create systemic risks, while the potential for algorithmic herding behavior might amplify market movements. Additionally, the development of AI-driven alternative financial systems could challenge the dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve currency. Actionable Insights for Navigating the AI-Dollar Relationship Understanding the intersection of artificial intelligence and the US dollar is crucial for investors, businesses, and policymakers. Key strategies include monitoring AI adoption in financial institutions, diversifying currency exposure, and staying informed about regulatory developments. The rapid evolution of AI technology means that the relationship between artificial intelligence and the US dollar will continue to evolve, requiring ongoing adaptation and learning. FAQs How is the Federal Reserve using artificial intelligence? The Federal Reserve employs AI for economic forecasting, risk assessment, and monitoring financial stability. Chairman Jerome Powell has acknowledged the growing importance of technological tools in monetary policy. Which companies are leading AI development in finance? Major technology firms like Google and Microsoft , along with financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase , are at the forefront of AI applications in currency markets and dollar-related financial services. Can AI predict US dollar fluctuations accurately? While AI models have improved prediction accuracy, currency markets remain influenced by unpredictable human behavior and unexpected geopolitical events, limiting complete forecasting reliability. Conclusion The integration of artificial intelligence with the US dollar represents a transformative moment in global finance. From revolutionizing currency markets to enhancing monetary policy, AI’s impact is both profound and far-reaching. While challenges remain, the intelligent application of artificial intelligence offers the potential for more stable, efficient, and responsive financial systems. The future of the US dollar will increasingly be shaped by algorithms and machine learning, creating both opportunities and responsibilities for all market participants.

54062694,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88646,1762358414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SUI Price Prediction – SUI Eyes Breakout to $2 as Presale Hype Around Noomez Builds Momentum,https://timestabloid.com/sui-price-prediction-sui-eyes-breakout-to-2-as-presale-hype/,"The SUI price prediction narrative is heating up as the Layer-1 token tests key levels near the $2 mark. After a year defined by steep swings and cautious optimism, SUI finds itself balancing between recovery potential and market fatigue. Analysts remain divided, some expect a continued cooldown, while others see early signs of a breakout. At the same time, a new presale contender, Noomez ($NNZ) , is making noise for its structured tokenomics and deflationary design, attracting traders searching for stability and calculated upside instead of another volatility cycle. SUI Price Now – Market Snapshot and Volatility Context As of early November 2025, the SUI price now sits around $2.05, reflecting a cautious phase after weeks of steady declines. Technical indicators point to continued downward pressure: the 50-day SMA hovers near $3.04, while the 200-day SMA sits close at $3.09, confirming a short-term bearish crossover. With volatility at 15.15% and only 47% green days, traders are watching the $2 support closely. For SUI to regain confidence, it needs to reclaim resistance near $2.28 and prove volume strength beyond short-lived rallies. SUI Price Prediction Before 2025 Ends – Can It Reclaim the Upside? With less than two months left in 2025, the SUI price prediction trend reflects a market still searching for direction. The token trades near $2.05, slightly above its short-term support, while forecasts suggest a modest pullback toward $1.50 before any potential rebound. Analysts estimate a year-end average near $1.58, marking a -24.9% dip from previous peaks. However, the Fear & Greed Index at 21 (Extreme Fear) may point to an opportunity zone rather than a collapse. Historically, similar readings have preceded slow accumulation phases, conditions that could favor recovery once liquidity rotates back into mid-cap Layer-1 assets. SUI Price 2030 – Growth Forecast and Adoption Curve Looking beyond short-term resistance battles, the SUI price 2030 outlook paints a steadier picture of expansion. Long-range forecasts suggest a trading window between $3.49 and $8.43, signaling potential returns of over 300% if adoption continues at its current pace. This projection stems from SUI’s growing traction in developer ecosystems and its efficiency-focused Layer-1 architecture designed to handle high-volume dApps. If ecosystem partnerships hold and scalability keeps improving, the project could re-enter stronger price territory heading into the next decade. A New Wave of Hype – Why Noomez ($NNZ) Keeps Entering the Conversation While SUI struggles to sustain momentum, Noomez ($NNZ) has rapidly become one of 2025’s most talked-about presales. Currently in Stage 2 and priced at $0.0000123 , and with 13,670.30 already raised, the project follows a structured 28-stage deflationary model where every unsold token is burned after each round. This on-chain transparency, backed by an audit and KYC-verified team, has helped Noomez stand out amid volatile markets. Its framework includes a fixed 280B supply, up to 66% APY staking, and a 10% referral system, all managed through the Noom Engine and visible via the Noom Gauge. For investors watching SUI’s consolidation, Noomez represents a measurable, rule-based alternative in an unpredictable market. Inside the Noom Economy – The Five Arcs of the Presale Journey Every stage of Noomez ($NNZ) feeds into a larger framework known as the Noom Map , which unfolds through five arcs. This structure gives the presale a cinematic flow rather than a static sale page. Arc I – The Foundation (Q3 2025): The groundwork begins. Nik lands, social channels go live, and the whitelist opens, establishing early community trust and visibility. Arc II – The Awakening (Q4 2025): The presale launches alongside the Stage X Million airdrops, introducing the dynamic 28-stage curve and early liquidity inflows. Arc III – The Vault Signal (Q1 2026): The first major milestone, Stage 14 vault unlocks, signaling mid-phase acceleration and drawing renewed volume from earlier holders. Arc IV – The Coin Rises (Q2 2026): The narrative peaks. The final vault and NFT drops align with a one-hour launch countdown, merging token and community events. Arc V – The Engine Ignites (Q3 2026): Trading opens, staking activates, and ecosystem partnerships go live, shifting Noomez from presale hype to active circulation. By linking technical events with narrative arcs, Noomez turns token distribution into an evolving journey, keeping investor attention anchored long after Stage 1 ends. Pro Tip: Before joining any presale, check if it publishes live burn and vesting data on-chain. Verified metrics, like those shown on Noomez’s Noom Gauge, help you separate real utility from speculative promises.

54062725,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=849243,1762358442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54062725.jpeg,Anti-CZ Whale Flips Bullish: Now Long $109M In Ethereum While Holding Massive Meme Shorts,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/anti-cz-whale-flips-bullish-now-long-109m-in-ethereum-while-holding-massive-meme-shorts/,"The crypto market faced a violent downturn, with Ethereum breaking below the $3,100 level while Bitcoin lost the critical $100,000 mark, triggering widespread liquidation and fear-driven selling. Panic quickly rippled across the market, and sentiment flipped sharply bearish as traders rushed to reduce exposure, price targets vanished from social media, and risk assets saw a cascade of exits. In moments like these, emotions often outweigh fundamentals — and this week was a clear reminder of that dynamic. Related Reading: Balancer Hacker Now Converting Loot to Ethereum: Stolen Funds Surge To $116.6M However, even in periods of sharp fear, not all market participants behave the same. Some notable players have begun shifting their stance, hinting that strategic positioning may already be underway beneath the panic. Among them is the well-known Anti-CZ Whale — a trader who gained attention after aggressively shorting ASTER immediately following Changpeng Zhao’s public post announcing he bought ASTER. That trade paid off massively as ASTER surged briefly and then retraced sharply, delivering this whale tens of millions in unrealized profit. Now, in a notable shift, this trader has flipped from shorting Ethereum to going long, signaling renewed conviction despite the market’s emotional breakdown. As fear peaks, sophisticated players may already be preparing for the next phase — raising the question: is this capitulation… or opportunity? Whale Rotates Into ETH Long as Market Panic Peaks According to Lookonchain, the well-known Anti-CZ Whale has executed a notable portfolio shift, flipping from shorting Ethereum to taking a long position worth 32,802 ETH (~$109 million). Now, the whale is maintaining a 58.27M ASTER short (~$59.7M), signaling conviction that ASTER’s weakness may continue despite recent volatility. Alongside this, the whale holds a 1.99B kPEPE short (~$11.3M), a bet against speculative memecoin flows during uncertainty. Meanwhile, a small 130,566 DOGE long (~$21.5K) appears more symbolic than directional, likely serving as a hedge or sentiment gauge rather than a major conviction play. The standout move is clearly the ETH long, signaling the whale views Ethereum’s drop below $3,100 as oversold rather than structurally bearish. Taking such a position during peak fear suggests an expectation of recovery once forced liquidations cool and liquidity stabilizes. While broader sentiment remains fragile, this shift implies sophisticated capital may already be positioning for an eventual rebound — reinforcing ETH’s role as a core asset even amid aggressive market stress. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Scores Nearly $100M On ASTER And Altcoin Shorts As Market Sells Off ETH Price Technical Outlook: Testing Key Support as Panic Selling Eases Ethereum is attempting to stabilize after a steep breakdown below the $3,500 region, with price now reacting around the $3,300 zone. This level aligns closely with the 200-day moving average (red line), making it a critical support area for bulls to defend. The recent candle structure shows heavy volatility and high sell-side volume, confirming panic-driven liquidations as the primary force behind the move — rather than a fundamental shift in trend. The aggressive flush followed a series of lower highs throughout October, signaling weakening momentum before the breakdown. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages (blue and green) are trending down and currently overhead, adding pressure and reinforcing the short-term bearish structure. A recovery above the 50-day MA would be an early sign of strength, but Ethereum must reclaim the $3,500 zone to regain bullish control. Related Reading: Whale Piles Into ASTER Shorts After CZ’s Comment – $52.8M On the Line Volume has spiked dramatically, suggesting capitulation behavior — often near cycle pivot points. The wick near $3,150 hints that buyers stepped in aggressively at lows, consistent with accumulation dynamics observed among sophisticated traders. If ETH holds above the 200-day MA and builds a base here, it could set up a relief rally. A sustained break below $3,150, however, risks further downside toward $2,900 as liquidity pockets remain thin below current levels.

54062946,621652,1762358454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54062946.jpeg,"Why Did The Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000? The Bear Market Is Here",https://bitcoinist.com/why-did-the-bitcoin-price-crash/,"The Bitcoin price has fallen below $100,000 for the first time in four months, wiping out nearly 6% of its value within a single day. The drop can be attributed to a strengthening US dollar, outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, and massive liquidations across the crypto futures market, causing investors to question whether the long-anticipated bear market has finally arrived. Notably, Bitcoin’s correction also rippled through the entire crypto sector, where the total market capitalization fell below $3.5 trillion for the first time in months. Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $100,000 Bitcoin has spent the past 30 days with a lack of clear bullish price action. Although it started October with a rally to break above $126,000 for the first time, which was a new all-time high, the majority of October was highlighted by the leading cryptocurrency struggling to leave the $107,000 to $110,000 price range behind. The prolonged period of sideways trading hinted at a lack of strong buying pressure, and the weakness has spilled into November. This has, in turn, caused the leading cryptocurrency to crash below $100,000 in the past 24 hours, albeit only for a short period. A surging US dollar has become one of the biggest headwinds for Bitcoin’s recent price action. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar’s strength against a basket of major currencies, climbed above 100 for the first time since August. This move reflected growing investor preference for safer assets, especially as uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s next interest-rate decision continues to hang over global markets. The impact of this has been most visible in the crypto sector, where confidence has eroded quickly . Bitcoin and Ethereum fell massively as traders exited leveraged positions en masse. The sudden sell-off created a chain reaction of liquidations across exchanges that wiped out billions of dollars in futures positions within hours. In Bitcoin’s case, its market cap dropped by as high as 5.8% in just 24 hours, falling to around $2 trillion. Trading activity has surged massively during the downturn, crossing over $100 billion. Is A Bear Market On The Horizon? The crash below $100,000 opens up questions about whether the bear market has officially begun. The Bitcoin price is still up 8% on a yearly basis, but the scale of recent losses alongside the rising US dollar index points to a more cautious phase ahead. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has already rebounded above $100,000 and is now pushing towards $102,000. The rebound means that a section of traders has seized the opportunity to accumulate more during the dip, and Bitcoin is now trading at $101,770. If the Bitcoin price slips below $100,000 again, then it opens up the possibility of an extended decline towards $90,000. On the other hand, bullish technical analysis shows that the crash caused Bitcoin to touch its 50-week moving average, a level that’s always preceded a new all-time high. The last time this support was tested was in April 2025, and what followed was a powerful rebound that sent the Bitcoin price soaring more than 50% to reach $125,000 in the months that followed.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-05 16:00:54

After months of consolidation, the token ignited a powerful upward rally that captured global attention. In a recent X post, analyst ChartNerd reminded followers that “this time last year” marked the beginning of that explosive move. His reminder reignited i nterest in what truly happened during that surge and what it might mean now. Data from CoinMarketCap confirm that XRP traded around $0.503 on November 4, 2024. ChartNerd pointed to that moment as the starting base of the parabolic rise. The following weeks saw strong buying pressure, as institutional activity increased and optimism spread after Ripple’s network expansion milestones. This time last year is where $XRP started the parabolic run to new ATHs pic.twitter.com/mR2fE91jZb — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 4, 2025 The Parabolic Surge and Its Peak By January 16, 2025, XRP reached an intraday high near $3.388, according to major exchanges. That represented a 573% increase from the early November level. This surge coincided with broader liquidity inflows into the crypto market and renewed attention on cross-border settlement technology. Analysts described the move as one of XRP’s most significant rallies since 2021. Reapplying the 2024 Percentage Gain To understand potential implications, we applied the same percentage gain to today’s price. As of report time, XRP trades around $2.24. Multiplying that figure by 573% gives a hypothetical price target of $15.08. This projection is purely mathematical, not predictive. Market conditions in 2025 differ sharply from those of 2024, making identical performance unlikely. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What ChartNerd’s Reminder Means for Traders ChartNerd’s observation does more than recall the past— it underscores timing and pattern recognition. His focus on early November shows how small price consolidations can precede large structural moves. Traders who study such setups understand that historical parabolas are rare but repeatable in structure, not in scale. The lesson is to identify rhythm and momentum early rather than chase vertical spikes. Final Thoughts XRP’s 2024 rally from $0.503 to $3.388 remains a defining moment for the token. ChartNerd’s reflection offers valuable context for today’s market environment. If history rhymes, not repeats, XRP may again move powerfully —but under new liquidity conditions and regulatory clarity. The math tells one story; the market will tell the next.

With Nvidia’s upcoming Rubin GPUs expected to draw up to 600 kilowatts per rack – nearly double the power of today’s fastest EV chargers – traditional cooling methods are hitting their limits. One innovative startup, Alloy Enterprises, believes the answer lies in an unexpected place: stacks of metal. The Growing AI Heat Problem in Modern Data Centers The AI heat problem has become increasingly urgent as computational demands skyrocket. When Nvidia announced its Rubin series GPUs in March, the industry faced a sobering reality: data center racks are becoming power-hungry monsters. At 600 kilowatts, these systems generate enough heat to challenge even the most advanced cooling infrastructure. The situation becomes even more critical when you consider that peripheral chips – memory and networking hardware – account for about 20% of a server’s cooling load. Innovative Data Center Cooling Breakthrough Alloy Enterprises has developed a revolutionary approach to data center cooling that could transform how we manage heat in AI infrastructure. Their technology uses additive manufacturing to create solid cooling plates from copper sheets, specifically designed for GPUs and supporting components. Unlike traditional methods, their process creates seamless cold plates that can withstand the high pressures of liquid cooling systems. Key Advantages of Alloy’s Liquid Cooling Technology 35% better thermal performance than competitors Seamless construction eliminates potential leak points Ability to create features as small as 50 microns Uses corrosion-resistant copper for optimal heat conduction More cost-effective than 3D printing alternatives Advanced Liquid Cooling Technology Explained What makes Alloy’s liquid cooling technology unique is their proprietary ‘stack forging’ process. Instead of traditional machining or 3D printing, the company takes sheets of metal and bonds them using heat and pressure. This diffusion bonding technique creates cold plates that are essentially single blocks of metal with no seams and no porosity issues. The result is a product that maintains raw material properties while offering superior thermal performance. Cooling Method Thermal Performance Cost Efficiency Reliability Traditional Machining Standard High Medium (seam issues) 3D Printing Good Low Medium (porosity) Alloy Stack Forging Excellent (35% better) Medium High (seamless) Revolutionary GPU Cooling Solutions The demand for effective GPU cooling solutions has never been higher. As racks approach 480 kilowatts on their way to 600 kilowatts, engineers must find ways to liquid cool everything from RAM to networking chips. Alloy’s approach addresses this challenge head-on with cold plates capable of squeezing into tight spots while handling the demanding requirements of modern AI hardware. Alloy Enterprises: The Company Behind the Innovation Founded by CEO Ali Forsyth, Alloy Enterprises initially developed their technology for aluminum alloys but quickly pivoted to copper as data center interest grew. The company’s manufacturing process involves cutting copper sheets with lasers, applying inhibitors to prevent unwanted bonding, and using diffusion bonding to create solid metal blocks. According to Forsyth, the response since their June product announcement has been overwhelming, with interest from “all the big names” in the data center industry. FAQs About AI Cooling Technology What makes the AI heat problem so challenging? The AI heat problem stems from the enormous power requirements of modern GPUs and supporting hardware. As computational density increases, traditional air cooling becomes insufficient, requiring more advanced liquid cooling solutions. How does Alloy Enterprises’ technology differ from 3D printing? Unlike 3D printing, which can create porous structures, Alloy’s stack forging process produces solid metal blocks with no seams and maintains the raw material’s strength properties. What companies are involved in advanced cooling solutions? Major players include Nvidia with their high-power GPUs and innovative startups like Alloy Enterprises developing specialized cooling technologies. Industry leaders like Google Cloud and Microsoft are also heavily invested in data center cooling research. Who is leading Alloy Enterprises? The company is led by CEO Ali Forsyth , who has guided the company’s focus toward solving the critical cooling challenges facing modern data centers.

The GIA’s first $100,000 fund deployment was announced at the Global Impact Forum in Copenhagen, hosted by the BGA and the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) AltFinLab. Our very own @BurntFondue is in Copenhagen speaking at the Blockchain for Good Alliance Awards and sharing XION's mission of verifying anything @ChainforGood https://t.co/xzKNONhuf8 pic.twitter.com/GBSsEIWaqt — XION (@burnt_xion) November 4, 2025 The accelerator’s mission is to identify, fund, and incubate early-stage projects that leverage blockchain for measurable social good, using XION’s verification infrastructure to ensure transparency and accountability. “The Blockchain for Good initiative was launched to bring about social good through blockchain technology, and we look forward to advancing that mission further with the launch of the Global Impact Accelerator,” said Helen Liu, Co-CEO of Bybit, which supports the BGA initiative. Blockchain for Social Impact The Global Impact Accelerator marks progress in the BGA–XION partnership. XION said it is showing broader engagement with governments, NGOs, and institutions to promote verifiable and trusted digital ecosystems. The collaboration seeks to help mission-driven entrepreneurs scale their solutions responsibly and sustainably. “The launch of the Global Impact Accelerator brings us one step closer to realizing blockchain’s potential for measurable social progress,” said Freya Chen, Executive Director of the BGA. “By combining XION’s unique verification infrastructure with the BGA’s mission-driven network, we’re empowering innovators who can both prove and scale their impact.” Rigorous Selection and Mentorship Process According to XION, all participating projects will undergo a strict selection process to ensure clear alignment with SDG targets, tangible impact potential, and long-term business viability. The GIA will also collaborate with HackQuest to assess each team’s technical capacity, scalability, and ability to execute on their mission. Successful applicants will receive funding, technical support, mentorship, and introductions to strategic venture capital partners. Building Proof-Based Public Infrastructure Anthony Anzalone, founder of XION, said this latest initiative is designed to help build evidence-based public infrastructure that governments, NGOs, and citizens can trust. “Trust is paramount in government programs. For XION, verification is fundamental for digital infrastructure in a world where trust is the scarcest resource,” Anzalone said. “BGA and XION will offer a model for verifiable, inclusive public systems that work for everyone—without technical gatekeepers,” adds Anzalone. Fireblocks Hooks XION Into Its $10T Platform In October, Fireblocks, the $8 billion crypto infrastructure provider, announced that it has integrated XION, a next-generation Layer-1 blockchain built for mainstream adoption. XION claims the partnership is a step toward bringing blockchain to the masses—removing the complexity of wallets, seed phrases, and unpredictable gas fees that have long deterred institutional and consumer use. With Fireblocks’ platform securing over $10 trillion in digital asset transactions, the integration allows banks, enterprises, and brands to explore blockchain-based programs across payments, loyalty, gaming, and tokenization. Market Performance and Token Momentum While XION has made strides in building institutional partnerships and real-world use cases, its token has yet to gain strong market momentum. Currently trading at around $0.49, XION’s market capitalization sits near $21 million, with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of roughly $100 million, according to CoinMarketCap. The token’s price has seen a sharp decline since its early highs near launch, reflecting a broader trend where infrastructure-focused blockchain projects often lag in retail popularity compared to meme coins or high-yield DeFi tokens. However, trading volumes have recently shown signs of renewed activity—up over 40% in the past 24 hours—suggesting that investor interest could return as the project’s real-world impact and partnerships, such as the Global Impact Accelerator, gain visibility.

Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,880, up 0.8% in the last day. However, professionals continue to pick Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the cryptocurrency to invest in, thanks to their organized presale and innovative DeFi solutions offered in addition to what ETH does. Indeed, the best cryptocurrency investment opportunity should be one with proven demand, together with unrealized potential, just like Mutuum Finance. Ethereum’s Strong Momentum Ethereum has been making the news with the huge gains recorded by their ETFs, which raised $668 million in just one month. Also, the trading volumes were at $55.25 billion, with the ETH currently selling at $3,880, which is an indicator of renewed activity in the altcoin market. Vitalik Buterin pointed out the ZKsync Atlas upgrade, which displays faster transaction processing, reducing costs in the process. However, with all such developments, there is hope, although experts explain that the maturity of ETH inhibits huge gains in relation to newer alternatives. Looking at the crypto news, Ethereum remains dependable, but in being well-established, gains trail newcomers such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $18,400,000 in their presale event, attracting 17,700 investors in totality, all of whom understand the current best option to invest in the crypto market. Currently, the project is in Phase 6, with each token going at $0.035, which is 250% more in value compared to the initial purchase in Phase 1, when each cost $0.01, with 85% of the tokens sold out. Investors earn 420% profit with the $0.06 launch price. Phase 6 sells out quickly, with little time to grab tokens at this level before the opening of Phase 7, with a 20% increase to $0.04. Anyone who holds back will be watching newcomers buy spots at higher levels, missing out on the opportunity to leverage their investment in the crypto world. Also, the project team has recently rolled out a data-tracking platform with the 24-hour leaderboard of the first 50 holders, in which every day the leader gets rewarded with $500 MUTM by completing one transaction, which then resets at 00:00 UTC. Dual-Market Lending Innovation What sets Mutuum Finance apart is their peer-to-contract (P2C) markets, in which users stash their own cryptocurrency units such as ETH or USDT in collective pools that borrowers then borrow money from in return for automatic returns to the stakers. mtTokens, in the form of interest-bearing receipts, allow their holders to withdraw both their money and returns at a later date. On another level, peer-to-peer (P2P) markets support direct lending against less liquid tokens, with custom terms contributing to flexibility and gains beyond what the vast ETH ecosystem can support. This makes MUTM the best cryptocurrency to buy, with terms designed for yield seekers. The Buy-And-Distribute Mechanism Increase Through the protocol, the fees generated are used to purchase MUTM tokens, which in turn distribute rewards to mtToken stakers, creating a cyclic mechanism whereby the higher the user base, the more the tokens appreciate in value, ensuring sustained benefits in terms of ensuring investments appreciate over time, making it the best crypto coin to buy. When activity increases, the scarcity of tokens also increases, meaning even more rewards for early supporters. Analysts prefer MUTM’s internal driving forces to ETH, since external upgrades in the latter take much longer. The ETF inflows and $3,880 pricing demonstrate the solidity of Ethereum; however, Mutuum Finance stands out as the cryptocurrency to invest in now based on the presale offers. Those investors acting quickly reap the rewards of the potential offered by the leading cryptocurrency before the costs surge. Join the presale today to secure your spot and build lasting returns.

This groundbreaking vision is becoming reality as Ripple and Mastercard join forces to test XRP Ledger credit card settlements. The collaboration, announced at Ripple Swell 2025, could fundamentally change how we process payments. What Are XRP Ledger Credit Card Settlements? XRP Ledger credit card settlements represent a major leap in payment processing. Instead of traditional banking systems, transactions would settle directly on the XRP Ledger using the RLUSD stablecoin. This system involves multiple key players including WebBank and Gemini, creating a comprehensive testing environment for this innovative approach. How Will This New Settlement System Work? The proposed XRP Ledger credit card settlements operate through a streamlined process. When you make a credit card purchase, the transaction would convert to RLUSD stablecoin and settle on the XRP Ledger. This eliminates multiple intermediaries typically involved in credit card processing. Key benefits of this approach include: Faster settlement times – transactions complete in seconds rather than days Reduced costs – cutting out middlemen lowers processing fees Enhanced transparency – blockchain provides clear transaction records Global accessibility – operates across borders without currency conversion issues Why Is This Partnership So Significant? The collaboration between Ripple and Mastercard brings together blockchain innovation with traditional payment infrastructure. Mastercard’s extensive network combined with Ripple’s XRP Ledger technology creates a powerful synergy. This partnership demonstrates how established financial institutions are embracing blockchain solutions for real-world applications. Moreover, the involvement of WebBank and Gemini adds crucial elements to the testing phase. WebBank brings traditional banking expertise while Gemini contributes cryptocurrency exchange experience. This diverse partnership ensures comprehensive testing of the XRP Ledger credit card settlements system. What Challenges Lie Ahead? Despite the exciting potential, several hurdles remain for XRP Ledger credit card settlements. Regulatory approval represents the most significant challenge. Financial authorities worldwide will need to review and approve this new settlement method before widespread adoption. Additional considerations include: Integration with existing payment systems Consumer education and adoption Security and fraud prevention measures Scalability for global transaction volumes When Can We Expect Implementation? The timeline for XRP Ledger credit card settlements depends heavily on regulatory approvals. The partners plan to onboard RLUSD to the XRP Ledger within the next few months, pending necessary clearances. However, full-scale implementation might take longer as the system undergoes rigorous testing and refinement. This development follows growing interest in blockchain-based payment solutions. Many financial institutions recognize the efficiency benefits of distributed ledger technology. The XRP Ledger credit card settlements project represents a concrete step toward mainstream blockchain adoption in everyday financial transactions. Conclusion: A New Era for Payments The Ripple-Mastercard partnership marks a pivotal moment in financial technology evolution. XRP Ledger credit card settlements could revolutionize how we think about payment processing, combining blockchain efficiency with traditional payment convenience. As regulatory approvals progress, this innovation promises to deliver faster, cheaper, and more transparent credit card transactions for consumers and businesses worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions What is RLUSD stablecoin? RLUSD is a stablecoin designed for use on the XRP Ledger. It maintains a stable value pegged to the US dollar, making it suitable for payment settlements and financial transactions. How will this affect everyday credit card users? Initially, most users won’t notice changes in their payment experience. However, over time, they may benefit from lower fees and faster transaction processing as the system matures. Is this system secure? The XRP Ledger has proven security through years of operation. The partnership with established financial institutions like Mastercard ensures additional security measures and compliance standards. When will this be available to the public? Public availability depends on successful testing and regulatory approvals. The partners aim for initial implementation within the next few months, with broader rollout following successful pilot programs. Will this work with existing credit cards? Yes, the system is designed to work with current credit card infrastructure. The blockchain settlement happens behind the scenes, so users can continue using their existing cards normally. What countries will this be available in? Initial testing will likely focus on specific regions, with global expansion depending on regulatory approvals in different jurisdictions and successful pilot results. Found this article insightful?

54064970,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=849422,1762363848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54064970.jpeg,"Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Decouple From Bitcoin, Here’s What Would Happen",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-will-decouple-from-bitcoin/,"Crypto analyst Arthur has predicted that the XRP price is preparing to decouple from Bitcoin (BTC). For years, XRP’s price movements have mirrored those of BTC, but according to Arthur, the market is evolving in ways that could soon set XRP apart. The emergence of Ripple’s new institutional brokerage platform and recent acquisitions, alongside the growing strength of its associated stablecoin, are key drivers that the analyst believes could drive this separation. XRP Price Set To Break Away From Bitcoin Arthur’s recent thread shared on X social media paints a confident picture of XRP’s future. He argues that the cryptocurrency is starting to chart its own course, breaking away from Bitcoin’s influence. Traditionally, XRP’s price has followed BTC’s overall direction and trajectory, rising and falling in tandem with the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Why This Analyst Is More Bullish On XRP Over Ethereum For The Short-Term However, Arthur believes that the latest developments surrounding Ripple, a crypto payments company, could significantly change this dynamic. He points to Ripple Prime as the biggest factor that could drive this shift. Notably, Ripple Prime is a digital asset spot prime brokerage that Ripple recently launched following its acquisition of Hidden Road. The brokerage platform offers OTC spot trading, Foreign Exchange (FX), derivatives, and swaps, all seamlessly integrated with XRP and RLUSD, Ripple’s regulated stablecoin. By offering Wall Street a means to enter the blockchain finance market, Arthur contends that Ripple Prime could redefine how institutions view digital assets like XRP. Instead of being swayed by broader market sentiment, this institutional demand from Ripple’s new brokerage platform and ongoing developments could drive XRP’s value based on measurable utility. Additionally, it could finally establish the cryptocurrency as a standalone asset rather than one that constantly tracks Bitcoin’s movements. In his analysis, Arthur frames Bitcoin as a speculative digital asset, while XRP is viewed as a form of financial infrastructure. He explains that this is a crucial distinction considering infrastructure assets are typically driven by real-world adoption and utility, rather than “hype cycles.” With RLUSD surpassing a $1 billion market cap just a year after its launch, the analyst maintains that Ripple has established a stable and transparent institutional framework that effectively balances liquidity and compliance. Through this setup, RLUSD provides price stability, while XRP offers transaction liquidity, creating a financial ecosystem designed for real-world use, which is ideal for driving price growth. Regulation And Utility Shifts To Redefine XRP’s Identity Arthur expands on his analysis by connecting Ripple’s recent developments to a broader picture. He explains that institutions using Ripple Prime to settle payments with XRP and RLUSD are driven by different incentives. They do not care about Bitcoin and are not chasing speculative gains like typical crypto traders, but prioritize efficiency, regulation, and liquidity. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Why He Bought A Massive Stack Of XRP, ‘It’s Not A Gamble’ He also highlighted the potential impact of the upcoming CLARITY Act in the US. If passed, the analyst says that the bill could reclassify XRP as a commodity, moving it away from the “crypto basket” and placing it in the same regulatory category as assets like gold. Through this combination of legal clarity, stablecoin integration, asset class change, and subsequent institutional demand, Arthur says that XRP’s price will gradually decouple from Bitcoin.

The funding round is a clear signal that deep-pocketed investors see value in Ripple’s payments rails, product roadmap, and regulatory progress. But whether that corporate vote of confidence translates into durable trust or price momentum for XRP is more complicated than the headline suggests. Ripple’s $40 billion valuation: What’s behind it The $40 billion figure reflects more than a single cheque; it’s a synthesis of investor belief in Ripple’s business trajectory. The $500 million strategic round gives the company fresh capital to accelerate product rollouts: think custody, stablecoin rails, enterprise settlement services, marketplace integrations, and to pursue targeted M&A that bolsters its payments stack. Institutional backers are increasingly comfortable funding the company side of the equation now that regulatory uncertainty has eased compared with prior years, turning a legal overhang into a more navigable business risk. In short, the valuation prices future revenue potential from enterprise payments, licensing, and token-adjacent services rather than a bet on speculative retail demand for XRP, reinforcing Ripple’s positioning as a long-term infrastructure provider in the broader digital asset economy. What it means for confidence in XRP The funding round is a strong vote of confidence in Ripple, the company, not an automatic seal of approval for XRP, the token. Institutional investors are buying into predictable enterprise cash flows, product-market fit, and a cleaner regulatory storyline; those are corporate fundamentals. Token markets, however, respond to different forces: liquidity, macro sentiment, exchange listings, on-chain demand, and regulatory rulings that affect how tokens can be sold or used. If Ripple uses its new capital to accelerate custody products , prime services, and payment rails that route liquidity through XRP, it could create a slow-burn increase in real institutional demand. That pathway, institutional on-ramps, custody AUM growth, and commercial settlement use cases is the most credible mechanisms for the rise to help XRP materially. Conversely, the company can be well-funded and still face muted token reaction if macro conditions sour, if token-specific legal limits remain, or if management struggles to execute. For investors, the cleanest way to treat the news is: view the round as de-risking Ripple’s enterprise future and as a green light for strategic expansion, but stop short of treating the valuation as proof XRP will rally. Track custody assets under management, institutional listings, and large on-chain flows as early indicators that company strength is converting into token demand. Also watch regulatory developments closely; even subtle reversals could reintroduce selling pressure.

According to the budget , the upcoming legislation will require issuers to maintain adequate reserves, implement redemption mechanisms, create risk management systems, and protect user data. It will also include national security measures to preserve the integrity of the Canadian financial system. The Bank of Canada will allocate $10 million from the Consolidated Revenue Fund over two years (2026–2027) to launch the framework. After that, the program’s annual operating cost of about $5 million will be funded by fees from stablecoin issuers. At the same time, lawmakers are preparing amendments to the Retail Payments Act, strengthening oversight of payment providers that use stablecoins. Officials say these steps will create a comprehensive system of control and accountability for digital transactions. Canada Joins the Global Trend in Regulating Stablecoins With this move, Canada joins the growing global effort to bring stablecoins under formal supervision. The United States has already passed the GENIUS Act, the European Union introduced MiCA, and Japan and South Korea are drafting similar frameworks. As of November 5, 2025, the total stablecoin market stands at $305.9 billion, according to DefiLIama. Standard Chartered Bank forecasts that up to $1 trillion could flow from emerging market bank deposits into stablecoins by 2028, underscoring the urgency of regulation.

Over the past several hours, the bulls have managed to reclaim some lost ground, while three key factors signal that a more significant resurgence could be on the way. Time for a Rally Again? The leading digital asset has been on an evident downtrend lately, with its valuation tumbling by nearly 10% in the past week. The market’s bearish tone hit a peak on November 4, when BTC temporarily plunged to around $99,000. Those curious to learn more about what triggered the crash can refer to our dedicated article here . Somewhat expected, the negative performance of bitcoin caused panic across the crypto space, and the popular Fear and Greed Index, which follows the investors’ sentiment, entered “Extreme Fear” territory. BTC Fear and Greed, Source: alternative.me While this may sound like more bad news, it can also be interpreted as a bullish element. “Extreme Fear” levels sometimes signal that the bottom is already reached, indicating a possible buying opportunity, whereas the crypto market is rather unique and often moves against people’s expectations. X user ALLINCYPTO highlighted some previous occasions in the past few years when the Fear and Greed Index dropped to similar lows, and each time BTC’s price rebounded shortly after. The next factor worth paying attention to is the amount of bitcoin stored on crypto exchanges. CryptoQuant’s data shows that the figure continues to hover around the seven-year low of approximately 2.38 million BTC reached on November 3, reflecting reduced selling pressure rather than a shift towards centralized platforms with the potential goal of widespread profit-taking. BTC Exchange Reserve, Source: CryptoQuant Last but not least, we will touch upon BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes and helps traders identify reversal points. The technical analysis tool ranges from 0 to 100, and readings around or under 30 suggest the asset could be oversold and poised for a rally. As of this moment, the RSI stands at approximately 32. BTC RSI, Source: CryptoWaves The Next Targets? Currently, BTC trades at just under $103,000, and numerous industry participants believe the rebound has just begun. According to Coin Bureau, the asset’s price has touched its 50-week moving average, a level that has historically preceded a new all-time high. Some market observers think the prolonged shutdown of the US government could be among the reasons negatively impacting BTC and the entire cryptocurrency sector. That said, they claimed that the eventual restart could act as a major catalyst. X user Gordon recalled that a similar government shutdown occurred in early 2019, and once operations resumed, BTC’s valuation exploded.

That’s the revolutionary vision behind Wabi, the new AI-powered platform from Replika founder Eugenia Kuyda that just secured $20 million in pre-seed funding from top Silicon Valley investors. This groundbreaking platform is set to transform how ordinary people interact with technology. What Makes Wabi Platform Different From Traditional App Development? The Wabi platform represents a fundamental shift in software creation. Unlike traditional development that requires coding skills, Wabi enables anyone to create functional apps through simple text prompts. Users can type requests like ‘build me an AI therapy app’ or ‘create a daily dog picture generator’ and watch as the platform handles everything from icon design to database setup. How Wabi Platform Simplifies AI App Creation Wabi’s approach to AI app creation eliminates technical barriers that have traditionally kept non-programmers from building software. The platform automatically generates complete applications based on user descriptions, handling complex backend tasks like: User interface design and layout Database configuration and management Icon creation and branding elements Integration with AI models like ChatGPT or Gemini The Social Dimension of No-Code Development Wabi’s true innovation lies in combining no-code development with social features.

Swell 2025: We have closed a $500 million strategic investment at a $40 billion valuation, led by Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities: https://t.co/orsBjdkWbE → $95B+ in total Ripple Payments payment volume → $1B+ $RLUSD stablecoin market cap → 6 strategic… — Ripple (@Ripple) November 5, 2025 The new round marks further progress in Ripple’s strongest year to date, reinforcing investor confidence in the company’s growth trajectory and long-term strategy. Institutional Confidence and Record Valuation Ripple’s latest raise follows a $1 billion tender offer completed earlier this year at the same valuation, showing strong institutional demand to gain exposure to the company’s equity. Over recent years, Ripple has repurchased more than 25% of its outstanding shares, providing liquidity for shareholders and early employees while attracting new strategic partners. The decision to onboard institutional investors with deep roots in finance shows Ripple’s intent to strengthen its institutional network as it expands globally. “This investment reflects both Ripple’s incredible momentum and further validation of the market opportunity we’re aggressively pursuing,” said Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO. “We started in 2012 with one use case—payments—and have since expanded that success into custody, stablecoins, prime brokerage, and corporate treasury, leveraging digital assets like XRP,” adds Garlinghouse. Expansion Through Acquisitions and Product Development Ripple said in just over two years it has completed six acquisitions, including two valued at over $1 billion, broadening its footprint across payments, custody, and stablecoins. Additionally, the company acquired Rail, a stablecoin infrastructure provider, which has become a key pillar of Ripple Payments, its full-service cross-border platform. By integrating Ripple USD (RLUSD) and XRP, Ripple has created an efficient on-and-off ramp for global businesses seeking faster, lower-cost international transactions. Ripple now holds 75 regulatory licenses, allowing it to move money on behalf of clients and streamline liquidity management. Total Ripple Payments volumes have surpassed $95 billion, showing accelerating adoption among enterprise clients. Driving Stablecoin and Treasury Development Following the GENIUS Act, which clarified stablecoin regulations in major markets, institutions are increasingly adopting Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin for treasury payments, settlement, and collateral use cases. Ripple’s October acquisition of GTreasury, a leader in corporate cash management, extends that capability. GTreasury oversees trillions of dollars in transactions for Fortune 500 clients eager to leverage stablecoins for 24/7 capital efficiency. Ripple Prime and the Next Phase of Growth Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road, now rebranded as Ripple Prime, has strengthened its institutional trading and financing capabilities. Since integration, client collateral has doubled, daily transactions exceed 60 million, and the platform has tripled in size. Ripple Prime now offers collateralized lending for XRP and supports a rapidly expanding base of institutions trading XRP-based products. With RLUSD surpassing a $1 billion market cap less than a year after launch, Ripple’s diversified ecosystem—spanning payments, stablecoins, and prime brokerage—positions the company as one of the most influential players bridging traditional finance and digital assets.

The Prospects Are Frightening!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-far-could-bitcoin-btc-fall-below-100000-the-prospects-are-frightening/,"Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sudden drop of over 7% the previous day, dropping below the $100,000 level for the first time since June. This decline represents a drop of more than 20% from the peak recorded just a month ago, and predictions of further declines are growing in the market. According to Bloomberg, experts predict that unlike the sudden crash last October, this decline will not be a one-time event and could fall below $90,000 or even down to $80,000. At this point, options traders are the first to expect further declines. According to CoinGlass, approximately $2 billion worth of crypto positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours. While this figure is quite low compared to the $19 billion forced liquidation that occurred during the October crash last month, Bitcoin futures open interest remains low. Options traders are also revealing that they expect further declines through their $80,000 put options. 10x Research founder Markus Thielen said that the recent decline in Bitcoin is different from the sudden drop experienced on October 11, that forced sales were effective in the October crash, but sales from long-term investors were effective in the recent decline. Stating that the market has become increasingly unstable due to the selling of long-term investors, Thielen said that the total assets of those holding 100 to 1,000 Bitcoins have decreased sharply. Noting that whales are selling but not buying at all, Thielen warned that this decline could continue until next spring. “During the 2021-2022 bear market, large quantities of over 1 million Bitcoin were sold over the course of about a year, and a sell-off on this scale could be repeated. A catastrophic collapse is not expected, but there appears to be room for further declines. Given the potential downside, I predict Bitcoin could fall to $85,000.” *This is not investment advice.

The move marks the first Bitcoin sale by a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) firm and is seen as a significant shift in how crypto-rich companies manage leverage. Sequans adopted a Bitcoin accumulation strategy in July 2025, growing its holdings to 3,234 BTC, funded largely through bond issuance. In late October 2025, Arkham Intelligence reported that the company had transferred part of its Bitcoin holdings to Coinbase Prime, sparking speculation of a potential sale. Sequans later confirmed that the liquidation of part of its Bitcoin portfolio enabled it to reduce total debt by 50%, from $189 million to $94.5 million. As of November 4, 2025, Sequans held 2,264 BTC valued at roughly $240 million. The company also lowered its debt-to-NAV (Net Asset Value) ratio to 39%, which it described as a “more prudent leverage ratio.” A Tactical Step Toward Financial Stability Sequans said the move gives it greater flexibility to manage risk, optimize operations, and pursue new opportunities. The bond buyback is also part of a broader effort to reduce the number of American Depositary Shares (ADS) listed on U.S. exchanges, a measure the firm believes will increase yield and boost resilience. “Our Bitcoin treasury management strategy remains unchanged,” said Sequans CEO Georges Karam. Despite the sale, Sequans’ market performance remains weak. According to the company’s official website, its market Net Asset Value (mNAV) stands at 0.77, meaning its shares trade at a discount compared to the value of its Bitcoin portfolio. Data from TradingView shows the stock has declined 16.6% over the past day and 40.5% over the past month. Earlier, analyst Omid Malekan warned that actions by Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) firms such as Sequans could intensify volatility and accelerate stress across the broader crypto market.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-05 17:51:12

That translates to a 75% gain, even as most altcoins suffer steep sell-offs triggered by the prolonged U.S. government shutdown and renewed fears of slowing economic growth. Across a sea of red, $ICP stood alone today. • ICP was the top performer out of the top 100 coins by market cap. • Internet Computer price was up 23.018% • Social mentions hit a 52-Week high of 7,644. https://t.co/msWy0xEvKI pic.twitter.com/iXfirXLnNy — LunarCrush Social Analytics (@LunarCrush) November 5, 2025 Not what most market participants would have expected after the Internet Computer price hit an all-time low around this time last month. ICP has found new relevance in this institution-led market cycle: Institutional use-cases need rails that offer web speed and scale, at manageable computing costs. The narrative positions Internet Computer as a direct competitor to web service providers like AWS, serving as a bridge to bring institutions’ operations and applications on-chain. ICP 2.0 has further strengthened that case, introducing the AI-powered app builder Caffeine, Internet Identity 2.0 for decentralized authentication, expanded cross-chain interoperability, and deflationary tokenomics. Internet Computer Price Prediction: How Much Further Can ICP Go? The price surge comes after ICP invalidated a month-long descending triangle, a typically bearish setup that threatened to extend its downtrend, but instead broke upward. The bullish move has triggered the breakout of a broader year-long descending channel pattern, though current momentum suggests a near-term cooldown. The MACD histogram has seen its quickest rise since the late-2024 bull market, opening the door to a sell-off, while the RSI hovers near the 70 overbought threshold, hinting at buyer exhaustion. A correction is likely the next step as early investors take profits and late entrants move to minimise losses, with a probable short-term bottom forming around the $4.20 demand zone. Still, if the channel breakout fully plays out, ICP could climb another 90% toward $10, and with growing market attention and institutional narrative momentum, a 200% move to retest of 2024 highs at $16 remains on the table.

Events like these remind us that even the most prominent digital assets remain vulnerable to cascading sell-offs and sharp price swings . For those seeking greater stability in digital markets, RentStac (RNS) offers a fundamentally different approachcombining blockchain technology with the proven performance of income-generating real estate . Risk Management Through Real-World Asset Backing Unlike many cryptocurrencies driven purely by speculation , the (RNS) token is backed by tangible, income-producing real estate . Each property included in the protocol is managed through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) , which secures legal ownership and isolates the risks associated with individual assets. This structure provides regulatory protection and ensures that token value is supported by real-world assets , not just market sentiment. Consistent Value Growth Driven by Real Estate Income RentStac (RNS) channels the income generated from its property portfolio into systematic token buybacks . The repurchased tokens are permanently removed from circulation , reducing total supply and supporting steady value appreciation for existing holders. Profit distribution is managed through automated smart contracts , which allocate returns to holders based on their share in the protocol. Transparent Profit Distribution and Automated Growth Investors in RentStac (RNS) receive profits directly, regardless of broader crypto market conditions. Returns are accumulated automatically according to participation within the protocol, and every stage of the process is transparent and verifiable on the blockchain . All buybacks, profit distributions, and supply reductions are executed via audited smart contracts , ensuring full clarity in fund management and performance reporting. Example Scenario: Participation and Return Calculation For example, an allocation of $1,000 during the presale at the current price of $0.025 per (RNS) token, combined with a 100% bonus , results in an effective cost of $0.0125 per token , giving a total of 80,000 (RNS) tokens. As RentStac (RNS) continues implementing its buyback and profit distribution model , participants can see their position strengthen over time. This process steadily increases each holder’s share of the protocol’s total value, as token prices appreciate in line with real estate income and the platform’s operational progress , rather than fluctuating purely with market sentiment. Secure Protocol Operations and Liquidity The RentStac (RNS) system is built on multi-signature escrow wallets , ensuring that funds are released only for verified real estate acquisitions and approved milestones . Security is further reinforced through independent audits currently in progress , and every step—from property income collection to profit distribution—is visible on-chain . Investors also benefit from instant liquidity , as tokens can be traded freely on secondary marketplaces , offering flexibility previously unavailable in traditional real estate investing. Enduring Stability in Times of Market Stress Events such as large-scale Bitcoin liquidations underscore the need for diversification and the advantage of anchoring digital portfolios in assets tied to real economic activity. RentStac (RNS) provides a clear and transparent system for generating passive profits and steady value growth , even amid the volatility of the broader crypto market.

Pundit Shares Theory On What Is Driving Bitcoin, Ethereum Price Crashes",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ethereum-crash-driver/,"Crypto pundit Butcher has suggested that Binance and market maker Wintermute may be responsible for the Bitcoin and Ethereum price crashes. The pundit also alluded to the October 10 crypto market crash and how both firms contributed to the crash. Pundit Blames Binance and Wintermute For Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Crashes In an X post , Butcher alleged that Binance and Wintermute are responsible for the recent Bitcoin and Ethereum price crashes. He explained that in the past 30 days, these firms have traded $34.5 billion between themselves. The pundit further revealed that the crypto exchange sends BTC and ETH in chunks of $10 million to $100 million to Wintermute wallets hours before every major dump. Wintermute then sells these coins on the market, triggering a cascade of liquidations. Butcher stated that Binance and Wintermute used this playbook during the October 10 Bitcoin and Ethereum price crash , which contributed to the $19 billion liquidation event. He revealed that on that day, Wintermute received $700 million from Binance, and then spot sell walls appeared on every pair, followed by $19 billion in longs liquidated in 90 minutes. The pundit claimed that Wintermute bought back these coins at a 30% discount. He noted that Binance benefits by pocketing the funding rate fees while Wintermute pockets the spread. Butcher further alleged that both firms used a similar playbook during last week’s Bitcoin and Ethereum price crash, dumping $1.14 billion in BTC . This resulted in $1.16 billion in liquidations. The Bitcoin and Ethereum price have extended their decline this week, with BTC dropping below $100,000 yesterday for the first time since June. ETH also dropped to as low as $3,100 on the day, recording a 10% loss in the process. Butcher again claimed that Binance was responsible for the crash, stating that there was “total manipulation” from the crypto exchange. This came as he declared that retail investors weren’t responsible for the selling pressure. Market Still Expected To Bounce Back Market expert Raoul Pal suggested that the crypto market is still going to bounce back despite the Bitcoin and Ethereum price crashes. He expects the bull market to resume when the U.S. government shutdown ends, noting that the shutdown is currently causing a sharp tightening of liquidity. Pal noted that the global liquidity is still on the rise, suggesting that some of this liquidity could spark a bounce in the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices once the shutdown ends. The expert further remarked that the treasury could spend up to $350 billion in a couple of months once the shutdown ends and quantitative easing begins . The dollar is also expected to weaken once liquidity begins to flow, which is a positive for the crypto market.",Crypto News|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto pundit Butcher|ETH|Ethereum|Raoul Pal|Wintermute,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-05 18:00:05

Sora’s innovative approach to content creation could attract users looking for something beyond traditional video editing. This move highlights OpenAI’s ambition to transcend its role as a pure AI research company and become a direct consumer-facing platform, leveraging its cutting-edge AI models to disrupt established markets. The Evolving Creator Economy and Digital Assets The rise of AI-generated content has profound implications for the creator economy. As tools like Sora AI become more sophisticated, creators can produce content at an unprecedented scale and level of personalization. This could lead to new forms of digital assets, where AI-generated videos, perhaps even tied to unique digital identities or NFTs, become valuable commodities. The ability to quickly iterate on video concepts and produce high-quality output could empower a new generation of digital artists and entrepreneurs, blurring the lines between human and AI creativity. Navigating Challenges: Deepfakes, Copyright, and Responsible AI Innovation often comes with challenges, and OpenAI Sora is no exception. The power of an AI video generator to create realistic and engaging content also raises significant ethical and legal questions, particularly concerning deepfakes and intellectual property. Addressing the Deepfake Dilemma Soon after its initial launch, Sora faced criticism regarding its potential misuse for generating “deepfake” content. A notable incident involved users uploading disrespectful videos depicting historical figures, including Martin Luther King Jr. This immediately highlighted the need for robust ethical guardrails. In response, OpenAI swiftly paused the generation of content featuring Dr. King and significantly strengthened its content moderation policies and filtering mechanisms. This demonstrates a proactive approach to mitigating potential harm and ensuring responsible AI deployment. Copyright Concerns and Policy Shifts Another area of contention involved the generation of copyrighted characters, such as SpongeBob and Pikachu. Initially, Sora operated on an “opt-out” system for rights holders, meaning content could be generated unless a specific request was made to prevent it. Following backlash, OpenAI wisely pivoted to an “opt-in” system for rights holders. This crucial policy change places the onus on creators to grant permission for their intellectual property to be used in AI generation, offering greater protection and control to copyright holders. Legal Disputes: The “Cameo” Conundrum Adding to its early challenges, OpenAI is currently embroiled in a legal dispute with the celebrity video-making platform Cameo . The dispute centers on the name of Sora’s flagship feature, “Cameos,” which the celebrity service claims infringes on its trademark. This legal battle underscores the complexities of naming and branding in a rapidly evolving technological landscape, where similar functionalities can lead to direct conflicts. The Path Forward: Ethical AI Development These challenges highlight the critical importance of responsible AI development. OpenAI’s responses—strengthening guardrails, changing copyright policies, and navigating legal disputes—are crucial steps in building trust and ensuring that powerful AI tools like Sora are used for creation and empowerment rather than misinformation or infringement. The ongoing evolution of these policies will be key to Sora’s long-term success and public acceptance. What’s Next for the AI Video Generator? Future Innovations OpenAI is not resting on its laurels. The company has ambitious plans to continuously enhance OpenAI Sora , promising a roadmap filled with exciting new features that will further empower users and expand the capabilities of its AI video generator . These upcoming innovations are set to make Sora even more versatile and user-friendly. Expanded Character Cameos Looking ahead, OpenAI plans to introduce more diverse character cameos. This will extend beyond human likenesses to include the ability for users to create AI-generated videos featuring their beloved pets and even inanimate objects. Imagine generating a video of your dog talking, or your favorite toy coming to life in a whimsical narrative. This feature will unlock entirely new avenues for creative expression and personalized storytelling, catering to a broader range of user interests. Basic Video Editing Tools To provide users with more control over their creations, Sora will soon integrate basic video editing tools. A key addition will be the ability to stitch multiple clips together. This functionality, while seemingly fundamental, is crucial for crafting more complex and coherent video narratives. Users will be able to combine different AI-generated scenes, add transitions, and refine their storytelling, moving beyond single-clip generation to more elaborate productions directly within the app. Customized Social Feeds Recognizing the diverse preferences of its user base, Sora also plans to introduce features that help users customize their social feeds. The focus will shift towards enabling users to curate content from selected individuals rather than being overwhelmed by a large, undifferentiated audience. This move aims to enhance the user experience by providing a more personalized and relevant content discovery journey, fostering stronger connections within specific creative communities. The Vision for AI in Media These planned features indicate OpenAI’s long-term vision for Sora: to evolve it into a comprehensive platform for AI-powered media creation and consumption. By continuously adding advanced capabilities and refining user experience, Sora aims to remain at the forefront of the AI video generation space, influencing how digital content is produced, shared, and experienced across the globe. Getting Started with Android AI App: Tips for Creators For anyone eager to dive into the world of AI-generated video, getting started with the Android AI app , Sora, is straightforward. This powerful tool puts the future of video creation directly into your hands, but a few tips can help you maximize its potential and ensure a smooth creative journey. Downloading and Installation First, ensure your Android device meets the minimum system requirements. Then, simply navigate to the Google Play Store , search for “Sora by OpenAI,” and tap install. The process is quick and user-friendly, typical of most modern mobile applications. Once installed, you’ll be prompted to create an account or log in, after which you can begin exploring its features. Tips for Creating Compelling Videos with Sora Be Specific with Prompts: The quality of your AI-generated video largely depends on the clarity and detail of your text prompts. Instead of “a dog running,” try “a golden retriever playfully chasing a frisbee on a sunny beach at sunset, with a slight breeze.” Experiment with “Cameos”: Don’t shy away from using the “Cameos” feature. Upload high-quality images or short video clips of yourself or subjects to get the best results. Experiment with different activities and settings to see the diverse outcomes Sora can produce. Explore the Social Feed: Engage with the community. Watching what others create can provide inspiration and ideas for your own projects. Learn from their prompts and visual styles. Iterate and Refine: AI generation is often an iterative process. Don’t expect perfection on the first try. Generate several versions, tweak your prompts, and refine until you achieve the desired outcome. Understand Limitations: While powerful, Sora is still an evolving technology. There might be instances where the AI struggles with complex physics, specific character interactions, or nuanced emotions. Acknowledge these limitations and adjust your expectations or prompts accordingly. Best Practices for Responsible AI Use As a user of an advanced AI video generator , adhering to ethical guidelines is paramount: Respect Copyright: Only use images or likenesses for which you have explicit permission or that are in the public domain. Remember OpenAI’s shift to an “opt-in” policy for copyrighted characters. Avoid Misinformation: Do not use Sora to create deepfakes or content intended to deceive, spread misinformation, or harm individuals. OpenAI’s guardrails are in place, but user responsibility is crucial. Privacy Awareness: Be mindful of privacy when generating videos, especially if they involve identifiable individuals. By following these guidelines, you can leverage Sora’s immense creative power responsibly, contributing positively to the evolving digital landscape.

Then a presale opens with clear rules, live tracking, and low fees, and the signal cuts through instantly. Observers saw it firsthand when friends chasing random listings paused, watched Noomez’s Noom Gauge update in real time, and pivoted. Noomez ($NNZ) keeps costs lean on BSC and structures scarcity from day one, a combo that stands out. New Crypto Coins 2025: Why $NNZ Tops The List Noomez is running a 28-stage presale that ties each stage to transparent progress on the Noom Gauge. Any unsold tokens at a stage close get permanently burned, creating built-in scarcity that analysts call Impressive for long-term token dynamics. Fixed supply is 280 billion $NNZ on BSC, with presale allocation at 50 percent. That clarity reduces guesswork and adds wow factor compared to chaotic launches. Pro Tip: Bookmark the Noom Gauge before buying. It shows stage status and helps avoid FOMO-based entries. Tokenomics Built For Clarity And Scarcity The framework is simple to follow and hard to game. Presale allocation sits at 140 billion $NNZ , liquidity is planned at 15 percent, and the team allocation vests across 6 to 12 months. Unsold tokens are burned automatically at each stage end, a deflationary rule that can reduce sell pressure as the presale advances. That is a massive differentiator for those seeking new crypto coins to buy without hidden surprises. The Price Path Public materials outline a climb in Noomez ($NNZ) from $0.00001 at Stage 1 toward a higher terminal stage price across the full run, a structure that rewards earlier entries and aligns with demand momentum. The staged path has been highlighted across multiple announcements surrounding the launch window. Fun Fact: The Noom Gauge concept turns a typical progress bar into a supply-and-demand meter that lights up as stages complete. Staking And Utility Beyond The Presale Noomez coverage indicates staking is planned to begin roughly 30 days after launch, distributing rewards directly to wallets. That design can curb impulsive exits and encourage holders to participate, a dynamic many analysts link to healthier post-launch liquidity. For seekers of new crypto coins 2025 , this adds a practical utility layer instead of hype alone. How To Find New Crypto Coins Early Spotting winners early is part discipline, part data. Use this checklist when evaluating how to find new crypto coins early: Public presale structure with stage-by-stage pricing like Noomez . On-chain or publicly verifiable burns of unsold tokens. Clear token allocation , liquidity lock plans, and vesting schedules. Active channels on X for timely updates. Independent coverage that reiterates the model without contradictions. When those boxes align, momentum can explode as the community sees measurable progress, not just jaw-dropping slogans.

Despite the current downturn, prominent macro analyst Raoul Pal is telling investors that a massive wave of global fiscal and monetary stimulus is on the horizon, setting the stage for a powerful crypto recovery. Pal and Hayes Point to Liquidity as Crypto’s Next Big Catalyst Pal’s optimism stands out in a market still reeling from steep losses. Bitcoin, trading near $102,500 at the time of this writing, has dropped nearly 10% in the past week and around 18% over the last month. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has fallen nearly 30% in the same period, per data from CoinGecko. However, Pal insists this turbulence is temporary, describing it as a “window of pain” before a coming liquidity flood. His bullish thesis is centered on the approaching end of quantitative tightening (QT) and the expected return of fiscal spending once the U.S. shutdown comes to an end. The analyst pointed out that roughly $10 trillion in government debt must be rolled over in the next 12 months, calling this “the only game in town.” And when Treasury spending resumes, estimated between $250 billion and $350 billion, he expects liquidity to expand, the dollar to weaken, and risk markets to strengthen. Pal also predicted that the upcoming CLARITY Act, which aims to provide clearer crypto regulations, could pave the way for wider institutional adoption. Combined with potential rate cuts, changes to bank balance sheet rules (SLR), and global fiscal stimulus from China and Japan, he sees a synchronized macro setup building toward 2026’s U.S. elections, which, according to him, is designed to “goose the economy.” The market watcher is not alone in his cheery outlook. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also echoed similar sentiments earlier today, linking Bitcoin’s slide to an 8% drop in U.S. dollar liquidity since July. He said that once Treasury balances fall post-shutdown, dollar liquidity will rebound, pushing BTC higher. Hayes also wrote in the latest edition of his Substack that investors should expect “a choppy market until stealth QE begins.” Market Still Fragile but Macro Outlook Turning Brighter The liquidity drain has weighed heavily on digital assets, with the market losing nearly $400 billion this week, pushing total capitalization down to around $3.2 trillion at one point. But despite the volatility, analysts are stressing that the selloff appears technical rather than fundamental, driven by leverage and forced liquidations rather than deteriorating demand. Bitfinex Alpha noted that long-term Bitcoin holders are still offloading roughly 104,000 BTC per month, showing profit-taking rather than panic. Meanwhile, institutional traders have stayed cautious, waiting for clearer signals after the Federal Reserve’s October rate cut.

As the token holds steady around $2.22, an important message from noted analyst Dark Defender has echoed through trading desks: the previously outlined structures remain intact. XRP’s price at $2.22 reflects recent consolidation phases in a broader crypto cooldown. External data suggest momentum is muted, yet structural supports for XRP appear intact , according to the broader commentary around the token. Analysts have flagged this period as one of accumulation rather than breakdown. Technical Framework from Dark Defender Dark Defender has emphasized that the structural scenario he charted earlier remains relevant—this includes wave patterns, support/resistance zones, and high-time-frame setups. In his earlier work, he compared XRP’s current monthly structure to the bullish regime of 2017, noting the return of impulsive wave characteristics. Good Morning, #XRP friends! XRP is at $2.2222. Our previous structures are still valid. pic.twitter.com/pM1pZ3fcRL — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) November 5, 2025 He also signaled that the pattern currently is neither the weak corrective setup seen in 2021 nor one to ignore. What This Means for Holders For those holding XRP, the message is straightforward: previous support levels and structure interpretations still matter. Dark Defender’s reassurance implies that the base scenario he laid out remains valid. This means that holding positions or structuring trades around those levels can still make sense—provided the structure doesn’t break. Conversely, any breach of key zones would force a review of the plan. Loss of those levels would impair the bullish narrative and likely require a fresh structural map. Risk Considerations & Strategy It is important to remember that structure does not guarantee breakout or sharp upside. External factors—from regulatory shifts to macro risk appetites—still play a large role. The message from Dark Defender offers confidence in structure, not certainty. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As such, it remains prudent to apply risk management: define stop-loss thresholds, avoid overleveraging, and watch for confirmation of trend rather than blind faith. Look for signs of structural failure (e.g., monthly close below key support) as triggers to reassess. Watch also for momentum divergence, volume contraction, or invalidation of wave counts. Final Thought The price of XRP may feel quiet, but in analytical terms, that often means the foundations are being laid. Dark Defender’s message— “our previous structures are still valid” —is a technical reassurance. For committed holders and traders, that means staying disciplined, adhering to the plan, and waiting for the signal that the next move has begun. When it does, you’ll want to be ready.

BTC is rebuilding short liquidity, which led to a rapid recovery back above $103,000. | Source: Coinglass The presence of short liquidity does not guarantee a price rise, but may become a key factor for expanding the price of BTC, at least in the short term. BTC open interest recently recovered by $1B in the past day, rising to $33.52B. Over 71% of BTC positions are long on average. Hyperliquid is the exception, with over 43% of whales taking up short positions. The accumulated short liquidity has been high for a few days, but it does not guarantee a non-stop climb.

BTC has still not lost its ascending channel and has not shown signs of a bear market, but its price fluctuations still cause concerns.

The move immediately caused $5.9M in short liquidations for BTC, and $9.6M in ETH short positions. While this is only a small fraction of available liquidity, the short squeeze was at least partially realized. On a four-hour basis, BTC saw $18.33M in short liquidations. On a 24-hour basis, long liquidations still dominated, with over $300M in BTC longs liquidated. There are other signs of a market bottom.

In a startling turn of events, major exchanges saw an astounding $346 million worth of futures contracts liquidated within a single hour. This immediate financial impact serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and high stakes involved in derivatives trading within the digital asset space. Over the past 24 hours, the total figure swelled to an alarming $1,633 million in liquidated futures, underscoring a period of intense market pressure and rapid price movements. Understanding Crypto Futures Liquidation What exactly is a crypto futures liquidation , and why does it matter? Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date. Traders often use leverage, borrowing funds to amplify their potential returns. While leverage can boost profits, it also magnifies losses. A liquidation occurs when a trader’s position falls below a certain margin requirement, meaning they no longer have enough collateral to cover potential losses. When this happens, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. This mechanism protects the exchange and the lender but can be devastating for the trader. It is a common occurrence in highly volatile markets, and its scale often reflects significant price swings. The Recent Shockwave: $346 Million in an Hour The recent event saw a staggering $346 million in crypto futures liquidation within a mere sixty minutes. This rapid unwinding of positions indicates an abrupt and substantial price movement that caught many leveraged traders off guard. Such swift liquidations often trigger a cascading effect, where forced selling further drives down prices, leading to more liquidations. This phenomenon can exacerbate market downturns, creating a ‘liquidation cascade’ that accelerates price declines. The 24-hour total of $1.633 billion further highlights the widespread impact across various cryptocurrencies and trading pairs. Bitcoin and Ethereum, being the largest assets, typically account for a significant portion of these liquidations due to their high trading volumes and open interest in futures markets. Why Do These Massive Liquidations Happen? Several factors contribute to large-scale crypto futures liquidation events: Sudden Price Swings: Unexpected news, whale movements, or macroeconomic factors can cause rapid price changes, pushing leveraged positions into negative territory. High Leverage: Many traders use extremely high leverage (e.g., 50x, 100x), meaning even small price movements can lead to liquidation. Market Contagion: A liquidation in one asset or exchange can sometimes spill over, affecting sentiment and prices across the broader market. Lack of Stop-Loss Orders: Traders who do not set appropriate stop-loss orders are more vulnerable to sudden market shifts. These events serve as a stark reminder of the risks associated with highly leveraged trading in an unregulated and often unpredictable market. Impact on Traders and the Broader Market For individual traders, a crypto futures liquidation can mean significant, often total, loss of their invested capital. It is a painful experience that can deter participation in futures markets. Beyond individual losses, these events also affect overall market sentiment. Large liquidations can: Indicate bearish sentiment if the liquidations are predominantly long positions. Increase market volatility as forced selling adds to price pressure. Shake investor confidence, especially among newer participants. However, liquidations also clear out over-leveraged positions, potentially setting the stage for a healthier, more sustainable market rebound once the dust settles. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Traders Understanding the risks of crypto futures liquidation is crucial. Here are some actionable insights for traders: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessive leverage. Use only what you are comfortable losing. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses automatically. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into highly leveraged futures positions. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis to anticipate potential price movements. Understand Margin Requirements: Be aware of the margin levels required by your exchange and monitor your positions closely. Responsible trading practices are paramount to surviving and thriving in the volatile crypto futures market. The recent $346 million crypto futures liquidation event serves as a powerful testament to the high-risk, high-reward nature of derivatives trading in the cryptocurrency space. While such events can be devastating for individual traders caught on the wrong side, they are an intrinsic part of a dynamic market. For those engaging with futures, prudence, risk management, and continuous learning are not just advisable but essential for long-term success. Understanding these market mechanics helps traders navigate the complexities and make more informed decisions, ultimately fostering a more resilient trading strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when futures are ‘liquidated’? A1: Liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position in a futures contract falls below the required margin level. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, resulting in the loss of the trader’s collateral. Q2: Why did such a large crypto futures liquidation happen so quickly? A2: Large liquidations happen quickly due to sudden and significant price movements in the underlying asset. When prices move sharply against many highly leveraged positions simultaneously, it triggers a cascade of automatic closures. Q3: How does leverage contribute to crypto futures liquidation? A3: Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. While it can increase profits on favorable price movements, it also means a smaller adverse price movement can quickly deplete a trader’s margin, leading to liquidation. Q4: Are crypto futures liquidations common? A4: Yes, liquidations are a common occurrence in the volatile cryptocurrency futures market, especially during periods of high price fluctuations. The scale of liquidations varies significantly. Q5: What can traders do to avoid crypto futures liquidation? A5: Traders can minimize the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, diversifying their portfolio, and closely monitoring market conditions and their margin levels.

During a recent press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declared that President Donald Trump has officially put an end to the Biden administration’s perceived “war on the crypto industry,” as reported by Watcher.Guru. This statement signals a dramatic shift in the political landscape surrounding digital assets and sets the stage for a new chapter in Trump crypto policy . What does this mean for investors, innovators, and the future of decentralized finance? Let’s dive in. What Does This Bold Declaration About Trump Crypto Policy Signify? This significant declaration, while currently lacking immediate detailed context, suggests a clear pivot in governmental approach towards the burgeoning crypto sector. For years, many in the crypto community have felt burdened by what they perceived as an adversarial regulatory environment under the current administration. The mention of “ending the war” implies a move towards a more supportive or at least less restrictive stance. A Shift in Sentiment: This statement could instantly boost market confidence, signaling a more favorable regulatory climate. Innovation Boost: A less hostile environment might encourage more innovation and investment within the U.S. Global Competitiveness: The U.S. could solidify its position as a leader in blockchain technology, attracting talent and capital that might otherwise go elsewhere. The precise details of this new Trump crypto policy are eagerly awaited, but the sentiment alone is enough to spark considerable optimism across the industry. The Perceived “War on Crypto” and Its Impact Before this recent announcement, the Biden administration’s approach to cryptocurrency was often characterized by heightened scrutiny and calls for stricter regulation. This included various initiatives and statements from agencies like the SEC, Treasury, and Federal Reserve, which many industry participants interpreted as attempts to stifle growth rather than foster responsible innovation. The challenges faced by the crypto industry under this climate included: Regulatory Uncertainty: A lack of clear guidelines often left businesses and investors in limbo, hindering long-term planning. Enforcement Actions: Increased legal actions against crypto firms created an atmosphere of fear and caution. Banking Difficulties: Many crypto businesses struggled to secure traditional banking services due to perceived risks. This environment led to concerns that the U.S. was falling behind other nations embracing digital assets. The idea of a new Trump crypto policy offers a potential reprieve from these pressures. What Could a Pro-Crypto Trump Crypto Policy Look Like? While specifics are scarce, a pro-crypto stance from a future Trump administration could manifest in several ways. We might see initiatives aimed at creating clearer regulatory frameworks, fostering technological development, and perhaps even embracing digital currencies more openly. Potential aspects of an evolving Trump crypto policy could include: Clearer Regulations: Developing a comprehensive, bipartisan framework that provides legal certainty for crypto businesses. Innovation Incentives: Encouraging blockchain and crypto innovation through tax breaks or grants. Protection for Investors: Implementing safeguards that protect consumers without stifling legitimate industry growth. Dialogue with Industry: Establishing open communication channels between policymakers and crypto leaders to shape effective policies. This potential shift could redefine the U.S.’s role in the global digital economy, moving from a cautious observer to an active participant and leader. Navigating the Future of Crypto Under New Leadership The implications of this announcement are vast. While the full scope of President Trump’s vision for crypto will unfold over time, the initial statement has certainly ignited discussions and speculation. It highlights the growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s importance on the global stage and its increasing influence in political discourse. For those involved in the crypto space, this moment serves as a reminder of how quickly policy can shift and the profound impact such changes can have. Staying informed and understanding the nuances of evolving regulations, particularly regarding Trump crypto policy , will be crucial for navigating the market effectively. Conclusion: The White House announcement regarding President Trump’s intent to end the “war on crypto” marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset industry. It signals a potential transition from a period of perceived hostility to one of greater acceptance and support. While the specifics of this new Trump crypto policy are yet to be detailed, the underlying sentiment promises a more favorable environment for innovation, investment, and growth within the U.S. crypto ecosystem. This development could truly unleash the full potential of digital currencies and blockchain technology, reshaping the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “ending the war on crypto” mean for the industry?
