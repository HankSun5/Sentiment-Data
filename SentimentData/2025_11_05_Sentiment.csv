Here’s Why",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/this-presale-token-will-hit-1-investors-say-heres-why/,"While the broader crypto market is caught in a storm of volatility and uncertainty, one under-the-radar project is quietly capturing the attention of smart money. Forget the meme coins and speculative hype—investors are piling into RentStac (RNS) , a presale token with a clear and inevitable path to the $1 mark. This isn’t wishful thinking. The immense confidence from early backers is built on a rock-solid foundation: a groundbreaking model that links the blockchain to the time-tested stability of the real estate market. As the project smashes through its fundraising goals, the conversation has shifted from if it will reach $1 to how much early investors will profit when it does. A New Paradigm: Real-World Assets on the Blockchain For too long, the crypto space has been a high-stakes casino. Fortunes are made and lost based on social media trends, whale manipulation, and speculative frenzy. RentStac is leading a revolution away from this chaos by offering something radically different: an asset backed by tangible, income-producing properties. The concept is simple yet powerful. RentStac acquires a portfolio of rental properties, and its (RNS) token represents a fractional share of this real estate. The rental income generated each month is then distributed directly to the token holders. This creates a “real yield” that is completely disconnected from crypto market volatility. The value of your investment is backed by property deeds and rental contracts, providing a level of security that purely digital assets can never match. It’s a game-changer for anyone looking to build sustainable wealth. The Inevitable Path to $1: A Simple Calculation The conviction that (RNS) will hit $1 is backed by the project’s explosive presale performance. Having already raised over $412,222, RentStac is demonstrating overwhelming market demand for a stable, asset-backed investment as it charges toward its first $1 million milestone. To reward its visionary community, RentStac is running a limited-time 100% token bonus. This offer doubles any investment made during the presale and is the engine behind the massive return potential. Let’s look at the numbers. The current presale price for (RNS) is just $0.025 per token. If you invest $500 today, you receive 20,000 RNS tokens. But with the 100% bonus, you get an additional 20,000 tokens for free, bringing your total to an incredible 40,000 RNS tokens. When (RNS) reaches the $1 valuation that investors and analysts project, your 40,000 tokens will be worth $40,000. Your initial $500 investment will have generated an extraordinary return. This simple math reveals the staggering upside and explains why early backers are so certain about the token’s future. What This Means for Your Portfolio The crypto market is maturing. The era of gambling on baseless hype is ending, and a new focus on real-world utility and tangible value is taking over. RentStac is not just part of this trend; it is leading it. The project offers a straightforward and powerful way to earn passive income from the stability of the real estate market, without the high costs and barriers of traditional property ownership. It’s the perfect hedge against market volatility and a foundational asset for any serious investor’s portfolio. With a groundbreaking model, immense investor confidence, and a presale bonus that doubles your stake from day one, RentStac isn’t just another token. It represents a new frontier in finance. The journey to $1 has already begun, and those who get in now are positioning themselves for the greatest rewards.

Data from Coinglass showed that more than $1.27 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out in 24 hours, with long traders accounting for nearly 90% of the losses. The slide follows Bitcoin’s break below its 200-day moving average near $109,800, a critical support zone that had held firm for four months. The Bitcoin price drop triggered widespread panic, pushing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 21, signaling “extreme fear.” Altcoins mirrored the weakness, with Ethereum (ETH) dropping 6% to $3,500, Solana (SOL) sliding 10% below $160, and XRP shedding 5.5%. Market analysts attributed the downturn to renewed uncertainty over Federal Reserve policy. Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks last week tempered expectations of a December rate cut, sending Treasury yields higher and weakening investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. ETF Outflows and Whale Selling Amplify Pressure Further fueling the downturn, Bitcoin ETFs saw significant redemptions, totaling $186.5 million on Monday, the largest single-day outflow since early 2024. According to Farside Investors, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was solely responsible for the drawdown, while other major ETFs like Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB remained neutral. The sharp ETF withdrawals coincided with an intensification of whale activity across exchanges. Data from Lookonchain revealed that long-term holders moved over 400,000 BTC, around 2% of the total supply, to trading platforms in the past 30 days. One early investor reportedly transferred 13,000 BTC ($1.4 billion) since October, while another whale deposited over 3,200 BTC to Kraken. Analysts suggest that these moves signal mounting profit-taking and a weakening of conviction among long-term holders. Despite rising self-custody activity on Binance, on-chain data from CryptoQuant indicated that dip-buying momentum remains fragile, suggesting accumulation may not yet be strong enough to reverse the trend. Bitcoin Price Support at $100K in Focus as Sentiment Turns Bearish With the Bitcoin price now hovering below key technical levels, analysts warn that a retest of the $100,000 psychological threshold is likely. Breaking this level could expose BTC to deeper losses, potentially reaching $77,000, aligning with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement zone and the April 2025 lows. Still, some strategists maintain that the long-term bull trend remains intact. “Each correction since 2023 has been followed by renewed accumulation near the 50-week moving average,” said Joel Kruger of LMAX. “The current pullback may be painful, but it’s consistent with Bitcoin’s cyclical structure.” As market fear intensifies and ETF flows remain negative, the Bitcoin price’s ability to defend the $100K level could determine whether the next phase is a temporary correction or the start of a deeper retracement.

According to an extensive fundamental analysis shared by Mr. Wall Street on X, the recent months of price stagnation and sudden drops are part of a larger accumulation phase dominated by institutional players. The overall setup, he argued, points clearly to Bitcoin’s eventual climb back above $120,000. Institutional Accumulation And Controlled Bitcoin Price Range The analyst’s first point is how Bitcoin has been trading within a 120-day range, oscillating between $107,000 and $123,000 to form what is a controlled consolidation range by institutions intended to push out weak retail investors. Mr. Wall Street noted that Bitcoin’s structure remains fundamentally bullish despite the prolonged sideways movement. Related Reading: Donald Trump Makes Nice With China, But Why Are The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Still Crashing? Each attempt to break out above $120,000 strongly or below the $107,000 support has failed, a sign that large institutions are actively controlling liquidity within this narrow band. Every crash within this period, including the one caused by the Binance sell-off and Trump’s tariff war with China, was met by strong institutional bids near the $107,000 zone, even when Bitcoin went on a flash crash to $101,000. Therefore, there is no technical or structural weakness that invalidates the bullish thesis. The imbalance to the upside, he added, is sufficient to push Bitcoin back to trading in the $120,000 and $123,000 range, which is the Value Area High. Mr. Wall Street also tied Bitcoin’s coming surge to changes within the Federal Reserve’s policies. He pointed out that despite claiming to end quantitative tightening, the Fed has quietly injected billions into the banking system through repo operations and mortgage-backed securities purchases. He highlighted a single Friday where $50.35 billion entered the system. According to him, this liquidity will ultimately find its way into risk assets, including Bitcoin, in a pattern similar to the 2019 monetary response that preceded crypto’s 2020 and 2021 bull run. Although he warned that a fabricated crash could precede the next liquidity wave, this will only strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term position for another move to $120,000 and possibly higher. Gold And Bitcoin In The Battle For The Real Store Of Value Mr. Wall Street also called attention to the psychological side of the current cycle, which has been highlighted by some investors gravitating towards gold. He argued that retail investors are being pushed to gold through manipulated narratives of stagflation and economic fear, while institutions quietly buy Bitcoin. “What’s ironic is that the same logic that drives people to buy gold should be making them buy Bitcoin instead,” he said. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals What Traders Are Missing After The Bitcoin Price Spike To $116,000 The ongoing gold hype is to distract the public while institutions accumulate Bitcoin at discount levels. Once retail participants exit the crypto market entirely, then there is going to be a move upward that redefines Bitcoin’s price level. As he concluded, the boring sideways phase is nearing its end, and the next aggressive move, one that could carry Bitcoin back above $120,000, is only a matter of time. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,200.

The announcement was made on Monday, as Ripple USD (RLUSD), the network’s native stablecoin, hit the $1 billion milestone in market cap. Ripple Prime breaks ground in the US today with the launch of digital asset spot prime brokerage capabilities – allowing clients to execute OTC spot transactions across the most prominent digital assets and stablecoins, including $XRP and $RLUSD . https://t.co/zTYb4MrPX4 — Ripple (@Ripple) November 3, 2025 Ripple Prime is the result of a prior acquisition of Hidden Road. The two companies have combined their licenses to offer OTC trading to U.S. institutional customers, facilitating the trading of crypto assets. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Needs to Stay Above This Level to Start Recovering XRP has gone down by 5% in the past 24 hours, and currently sits at $2.27. Trading volumes have exploded by nearly 100% to almost $8 billion, accounting for 6% of the token’s circulating supply. The token is now approaching what could be considered its last line of defense before a bigger decline. At $2.20, the market will decide if the latest developments are bad enough to kickstart a bear market, or buyers may step in to scoop up the token with the expectation that these ecosystem growth initiatives will lift it by year’s end. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory in the 4-hour chart, increasing the odds of a bounce off this level. If that happens, we could see XRP hitting $3 soon , meaning a 36% upside potential in the near term. As momentum begins to return, early crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could see the biggest gains. With over $25 million already raised, the project is building a faster, cheaper version of Bitcoin that supports smart contracts, trading apps, and new use cases that the original network was never built for. Bitcoin Hyper Brings Speed and Simplicity to BTC – Early Buyers Could See Big Gains Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings Solana’s speed and low fees to Bitcoin, unlocking fast and affordable crypto features for BTC holders. Bitcoin Hyper is building a faster, smarter version of Bitcoin that fixes some of its biggest problems – like slow transactions and the lack of apps. Using the Hyper Bridge, anyone can send their BTC to a secure wallet and instantly get the same amount on the Bitcoin Hyper network. Once you’re in, you can do things that regular Bitcoin doesn’t allow – like earning rewards, staking, lending, and using apps for trading, payments, and even meme coins. Crypto analysts say that as more exchanges and big investors adopt the network, demand for $HYPER could surge – giving early buyers a major advantage. To buy $HYPER before its next price increase, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper official website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can swap USDT or SOL to complete the transaction or use a bank card instead. Buy $HYPER Here.

These three altcoins have witnessed drops of at least 5% in the past 24 hours, extending a period of on-and-off negativity that began in late July. Yet they are now all so far in the red that a big rebound could be on its way, while one new token in particular looks ready to rally once it launches in the next few weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETF Arrival Could Push Altcoin Above $4 in December XRP has dropped to $2.27 today, marking a 5.5% loss in 24 hours and a 25% decline in a month. The altcoin has struggled in recent weeks, along with the wider market, yet it remains up by 350% in a year, making it the best-performing top-ten coin within this timeframe. This puts it in a commanding position to continue rising once the market regains some optimism, particularly when upwards of ten XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the next few weeks . The launch of these funds will drive institutional money towards XRP, boosting its price in much the same way ETFs boosted Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now may therefore be a great time to buy XRP, seeing as how its chart shows the coin in such an oversold position. Source: TradingView As we can see from the chart above, XRP’s indicators have been languishing in weakened positions for three months now, give or take. Its relative strength index (yellow) has plunged in the past day, falling back towards the 30 level. It could therefore bottom out soon, with XRP likely to rebound in price, potentially returning to $3 by the end of the month. And if we do see a wave of XRP ETF launches soon, it could top $4 by the end of 2025. Crypto Price Prediction: Official Trump ($TRUMP) – Meme Coin Showing Renewed Momentum After Tough Summer At $7.24, TRUMP is down by 5% in 24 hours, although it does hold on to a 6% gain in a week and a 23% increase in a fortnight. On the other hand, investors should bear in mind that it has suffered a 90% drop since reaching an ATH of $73.43 on January 19. We can interpret this fact in one of two ways, with the first being that such a huge drop is a sign of a coin in terminal decline. However, a more positive interpretation is that this gives TRUMP big potential to make a disproportionate comeback once the market becomes more bullish. Its chart today also shows that it has regained momentum in recent days, following a difficult summer. Source: TradingView Its RSI remains above 50 after the short-lived breakout rally it enjoyed at the end of October, while its MACD (orange, blue) has also turned positive in the past couple of days. As such, TRUMP may be close to another rally, which could see it push towards $10 in the next couple of weeks. From there, an ETF-inspired market-wide rally could see it climb to $20 or $30 by the end of December. Crypto Price Prediction: BNB Coin ($BNB) – Exchange Token Ready to Set New ATHs in Weeks BNB has also fallen by just over 5% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $957 representing a 15% drop in a week and a 17% decline in a month. Otherwise, BNB is in good shape, having posted a decent 71% gain in the past year. It has also recently set a record high of $1,369, a price which it attained only 22 days ago. Put differently, it retains some bullish medium- and long-term momentum, so we would expect BNB to return to growth once market sentiment picks up. This could happen as soon as the first wave of altcoin ETF approvals and launches takes place, which may be only a matter of weeks. If so, BNB would leap from its currently undervalued position, with its chart today suggesting that it may be close to a bottom. Source: TradingView Its RSI and its MACD have both fallen to decidedly negative positions, and don’t have too much space to fall lower. Because of this, we could see BNB return to $1,000 in the next day or two, while it could reach $1,300 again by December. And given Binance’s dominant position as the biggest exchange in the market, the coin could set new records before 2026 arrives. Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENODE Raises $2 Million as Presale Snowballs: Could It 100x in 2026? The three coins above all have the potential to make some very strong gains in the next couple of months, but they won’t be the only alts to do well in the near future. Traders may also want to investigate newer coins, including presale tokens, since these can often outpace the market as they list for the first time and enter price discovery. One of the most promising presale tokens right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based token that’s about to launch a mine-to-earn platform. PEPENODE is heating up 2M Raised! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/jd6PLovBJX — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 31, 2025 It has raised more than $2 million in its sale, which will end in the next few weeks. This is an encouraging sign of its growing popularity and of how successful it could be once it launches. And what’s exciting about PEPENODE is that it’s about to launch crypto’s first mine-to-earn platform. What this means is that it will give users the chance to grow and run their own virtual mining rigs, which they can use to earn rewards in other coins. By spending PEPENODE to buy more virtual nodes, users can increase the rewards they earn. This provides a strong incentive to acquire more PEPENODE, something which should boost demand over time. Also boosting demand is the fact that holders can stake PEPENODE for a regular staking income, with the current APY above 600%. This all makes PEPENODE one of the more bullish new tokens arriving on the market right now. Investors can buy it early by going to the PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. The coin is currently selling at $0.0011317, although this price will continue to rise for the duration of the sale.

Fink’s remarks, made during the Future Investment Initiative (FII) event in Riyadh, focused on how tokenization could transform the movement of money and assets worldwide, a development that many XRP supporters see as aligned with Ripple’s long-term vision. During his address, Fink stated that central banks around the world are now exploring how quickly they can digitize their currencies. He explained that this shift raises important questions about the future of the U.S. dollar, as well as the relevance of established payment companies such as Visa and Mastercard in a fully digital economy. Larry Fink Calls Tokenization the Next Major Financial Evolution Fink emphasized that while artificial intelligence dominates most conversations about financial innovation, the tokenization of assets and currencies represents an equally powerful trend. He described tokenization as a technological advancement that could streamline global finance by improving how transactions are processed and settled. According to him, many governments and institutions still underestimate the scale of this transformation. Larry Fink just confirmed what we’ve been saying for years, every central bank currency will be digitized, every ETF and asset will be tokenized, and they’ll all need a cross-border settlement layer. The plumbing of global finance is being rebuilt, and #XRP is the foundation. pic.twitter.com/hu0yArQeX7 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 29, 2025 His comments quickly gained attention within the XRP community, where advocates have long maintained that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is well-positioned to support the tokenization era. Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist and a well-known XRP proponent, responded to Fink’s remarks by suggesting that they validate the long-standing view that XRP could underpin a new, tokenized financial infrastructure. Aljarrah asserted that in a future where central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other assets exist on tokenized platforms, a unified settlement network will be necessary. He argued that XRP’s design allows it to serve as the global bridge asset connecting diverse financial systems. Ripple’s Growing Focus on Tokenization Ripple’s own executives have echoed similar sentiments in recent years. In 2023, David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, confirmed that the XRPL’s development strategy would increasingly focus on tokenization capabilities. Bitwise, a major digital asset management firm, also named XRP as one of the tokens offering the most direct exposure to the anticipated growth of the tokenization sector. These developments have helped position XRP at the center of the broader discussion about how blockchain technology might power the future of financial markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How High Could XRP Go If Tokenization Becomes Mainstream? To estimate what this global shift could mean for XRP’s valuation, a hypothetical scenario generated by Google’s Gemini AI offered an optimistic outlook. According to Gemini, the market for tokenized assets could expand to between $10 trillion and $26 trillion by 2030. Using a middle estimate of $15 trillion, Gemini projected that if the XRPL captured even 1–5% of that total market, XRP’s market capitalization could range from $6 trillion to $30 trillion. With roughly 60 billion XRP currently in circulation, this projection would place XRP’s price between $100 and $500 per token, assuming consistent adoption and supply conditions. However, Gemini emphasized that such an outcome would depend on several key factors, including regulatory clarity for digital assets, widespread institutional use of XRP for settlement, and Ripple’s ability to maintain a technological edge over competitors like Ethereum and Solana. It also noted that XRP’s deflationary token burn mechanism could gradually decrease supply over time, potentially reinforcing upward price momentum if demand increases. Although these estimates remain speculative, the renewed discussion following Larry Fink’s comments underscores a growing belief that tokenization could reshape global finance and that XRP might play a meaningful role in that transformation.

This move aims to attract more clients away from Google’s Chromebooks and Microsoft’s basic Windows PCs. The tech giant’s decision has sparked debates in the industry. Sources familiar with the situation suggest that this new device will be particularly useful for individuals who primarily work on documents, browse the internet, or edit light media. Additionally, they mentioned that the device specifically targets casual users, students, and businesses. Meanwhile, apart from an affordable Mac, Apple is also considering potential iPad buyers who may prefer a more traditional laptop experience, the sources said, maintaining anonymity. Apple aims to solidify its position as the leader in the tech industry Apple’s unreleased, low-cost budget Mac , known by the code name J700, is currently being tested and is in the early stages of production with suppliers outside the US, according to sources close to the matter. According to them, the Cupertino-based tech firm intends to launch the new device probably in the first half of next year. When reporters contacted a representative from the tech giant for comment on the situation, the spokesperson declined to respond. This news marks a significant shift in Apple’s operations, as the company has been renowned for producing cutting-edge devices that generate substantial profits. Interestingly, the tech company has vowed not to pursue market share by offering cheaper products. Regarding creating a budget-friendly Mac, the sources acknowledged that Chromebooks increasingly threaten Apple. This affordable laptop operates on Google’s Chrome OS, a lightweight, cloud-based operating system. In the meantime, Apple noted another opportunity to solidify its position as a leader in the tech ecosystem. This was after reports revealed that some individuals were unhappy with Microsoft Corp.’s change to Windows 11, which left them without security updates for the older software version. With this issue raised, the tech giant aims to appeal to Windows users. Following the release of this information, Apple’s stock reportedly rose slightly by less than 1%, reaching an all-time high of $270.25. Considering the advantages surrounding its recent decision, the tech company plans to price its new laptop below $1,000 by utilizing simpler components. This new device will feature a more basic LCD and an iPhone processor. Moreover, it will have the smallest screen of any current Mac model, measuring just below the 13.6-inch display found in the MacBook Air. This marks the first scenario in which the tech giant uses an iPhone processor in a Mac, rather than a chip specifically designed for computers. Still, internal tests indicate that this smartphone chip may outperform the M1 chip, which was designed just a few years ago. It is worth noting that Apple initially used iPhone chips in its iPads, but later transitioned those devices to its M-series processors for higher-end models. Apple to expand its footprint in schools with the creation of a budget-friendly Mac Analysts researched and discovered that Apple had already tested the market before news of creating a budget-friendly Mac leaked. This was after it provided a discounted M1 MacBook Air for less than $700 via Walmart and other stores. However, the analysts still insist that the new model will feature an entirely new design, rather than an older version, at a lower price. On the other hand, sources have mentioned that Apple’s most affordable Mac in the current market is the M4 MacBook Air. The device is priced at $999 but can go down to $899 with educational discounts. Chromebooks are available for a few hundred dollars, while high-end models cost about $600. The sources also noted that many students prefer using Apple’s basic iPad with the Magic Keyboard Folio, which is priced at about $600. The upcoming Mac would be priced similarly but include advanced features such as the added benefits of macOS software, a built-in keyboard, and better battery life. Therefore, the tech giant could attract both students and regular consumers, the sources said.

The company brought in just $5.02 billion in revenue, falling far below the $6 billion analysts predicted, according to the earnings report released after the bell. Adjusted earnings landed at 35 cents per share, also missing the expected 40 cents. But oh that wasn’t the only red flag. Revenue fell 15% compared to the same period last year, when the company reported $5.94 billion. The warning signs were there two weeks ago when Super Micro gave an early peek and slashed its revenue guidance to $5 billion, down from the earlier $6 billion to $7 billion range. The company said some expected revenue had been delayed to the next quarter due to “design win upgrades.” Super Micro’s net income got hammered too, dropping to $168.3 million, or 26 cents a share, compared to $424.3 million, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Even for a company tied to the AI server boom, these numbers showed a sharp slowdown. Super Micro says better Q2 is coming despite AI slowdown concerns In the middle of the earnings call, Super Micro tried to calm investors by raising guidance for the current quarter. The company now expects revenue between $10 billion and $11 billion, which is well above the $7.83 billion analyst consensus from LSEG. The delayed server builds are expected to ship this quarter, which may explain the bullish outlook. Even with the company’s tight grip on the AI server market, there are signs of pressure. Some analysts say Dell has started to pull ahead in market share. Though Super Micro has benefited from high demand for servers packed with Nvidia GPUs, growth has clearly slowed. Before this earnings report, the stock had jumped 55% this year. That gain now looks shaky. For the full fiscal year that ended June 30, Super Micro reported $22.0 billion in revenue, up from $15.0 billion in the previous fiscal year. But profit dropped, as net income came in at $1.0 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, down from $1.2 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share, the year before. Profit margins shrink as company outlines fiscal 2026 expectations The company’s non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal 2025 was 11.2%, after adjusting for $25 million in stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP net income totaled $1.3 billion, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $2.12 the previous year. The adjustments included a $239 million loss tied to extinguishing convertible notes and related tax effects of $75 million. There was also a $23 million write-off and $8 million in tax impacts. As of the end of June, Super Micro reported $5.2 billion in cash and equivalents, and $4.8 billion in total bank debt and convertible notes. Rounding up the earnings press release, Super Micro said it expects net sales between $6.0 billion and $7.0 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, ending September 30, 2025. It also guided GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to $0.42, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.52, “assuming tax rates of 13.0% and 15.5%, and share counts of 631 million and 644 million, respectively,” said the earnings report. Included in the GAAP forecast is a $69 million in stock-based compensation, with $20 million in excluded tax effects under the non-GAAP metric. And for the full fiscal year 2026, Super Micro is projecting at least $33.0 billion in revenue.

According to people familiar with the matter, the letter was reportedly sent on Friday, with Amazon accusing Perplexity of violating its terms of service by allowing its browser agent, Comet, to buy items on Amazon without disclosing that it was acting on behalf of a user. Perplexity , valued at around $20 billion, denied wrongdoing, saying the move was a “bullying tactic” by Amazon to suppress competition in the fast-evolving market for AI-powered browsing and shopping tools. Amazon accuses perplexity of breaking its conditions Perplexity’s Comet browser, launched in July this year, can research and, like in this case, purchase products on behalf of users, among a host of other things. Amazon’s complaint , however, claims that Perplexity’s agent failed to properly identify itself and in some cases logged directly into users’ Amazon accounts as if it were a standard Chrome browser. The company said this “degraded the customer experience” by bypassing personalization systems and introducing inaccuracies in delivery estimates and pricing. Amazon’s conditions for its online store make it clear that no one is allowed to use bots or automated tools to scrape data or make purchases. “We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers should operate openly and respect service provider decisions,” Amazon’s spokesperson Lara Hendrickson wrote in a statement, adding that Amazon has been sending requests to Perplexity to “remove Amazon from the Comet experience, particularly in light of the degraded shopping and customer service experience it provides.” Perplexity’s response In a draft blog post responding to the letter, Perplexity accused Amazon of trying to “eliminate user rights” in order to boost advertising revenue, while maintaining that its Comet browser neither trains on nor scrapes data from Amazon’s site. Perplexity’s chief executive officer, Aravind Srinivas, rejected Amazon’s characterization and stated that agents should have all the same rights and responsibilities as a human user. He added that “it’s not Amazon’s job to survey who is shopping on behalf of whom.” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy appeared to acknowledge the challenge during an earnings call last week, noting that most AI shopping agents currently deliver “not good” customer experiences due to limited personalization and inconsistent fulfillment data. Still, he hinted that partnerships with third-party developers could emerge in the future. “I do think we will find ways to collaborate,” Jassy said. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is also an investor in Perplexity AI. Competition and control in the AI era Amazon’s objections come as it develops its own set of AI-driven shopping tools . Earlier this year, it introduced “Buy For Me,” which lets users purchase items from brand websites within its app, and “Rufus,” an AI assistant capable of recommending and adding products to a cart. It recently launched another AI feature known as “Help Me Decide,” and this feature helps hesitant buyers make a buying decision faster. Some observers see the company’s action against Perplexity as a defensive move to protect its ecosystem and its advertising business, which earns billions of dollars annually by selling sponsored product placements in search results.

That was enough to push the stock lower in extended trading. The company said adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.20, beating the $1.16 consensus. Revenue reached $9.25 billion, ahead of the $8.74 billion estimate. Revenue rose 36% compared to the same quarter last year. The quarter ended on September 27. Net income was $1.24 billion, or 75 cents per share, up from $771 million, or 47 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. For the fourth quarter, AMD guided to about $9.6 billion in revenue, which implies 25% growth year over year.Analysts were expecting around $9.15 billion. The company said it expects an adjusted gross margin of 54.5%, which matched StreetAccount’s forecast.AMD repeated that the guidance does not include any revenue from shipments of its Instinct MI308 chips to China. Executives said during the release, “We are not including revenue from China‑bound MI308 shipments in the outlook at this time,” repeating the same stance from last quarter. AMD shares had climbed 107% year‑to‑date ahead of these results, while the Nasdaq had risen 21% over the same period. AMD outlines major AI infrastructure partnerships AMD reached a strategic agreement with OpenAI last month. The arrangement could lead to OpenAI holding as much as 10% of AMD.As part of the deal, OpenAI plans to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs across multiple chip generations. The first 1‑gigawatt portion is expected to roll out in the second half of next year. For years, OpenAI and many other AI developers primarily used Nvidia GPUs to train and run large models. The shift signals growing supply and ecosystem diversification. Oracle said in October it plans to deploy 50,000 AMD Instinct MI450 chips in its cloud next year. AMD also introduced its new “Helios” rack‑scale design and said it supports the Open Rack Wide standard introduced by Meta at the Open Compute Project Global Summit. Cisco and AMD expanded their collaboration with G42 to build a large‑scale cluster in the UAE using AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs.IBM and AMD announced a multi‑year effort to support Zyphra with clusters running AMD Instinct MI350X GPUs for multimodal models. Cohere is increasing its use of AMD Instinct GPU infrastructure across its enterprise lineup.Vultr said AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs are now available across its cloud network. DigitalOcean expanded cloud offerings to include AMD Instinct MI325X now and MI350X later this year. Tech Mahindra will bring AMD Instinct GPUs and AMD EPYC CPUs into its Cloud BlazeTech platform. The U.S. Department of Energy announced two upcoming supercomputers based on AMD hardware. The Lux AI system will use AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs, AMD EPYC CPUs, and AMD Pensando networking. The Discovery system, expected in 2028, will run on next‑gen AMD EPYC “Venice” CPUs and AMD Instinct MI430X GPUs, part of AMD’s new MI400 Series. Data center, client, and gaming segments show broad growth AMD’s data center business generated $4.34 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 22%. Analysts were expecting $4.13 billion. Client revenue came in at $2.75 billion, up 46%, beating the $2.61 billion consensus. Gaming revenue totaled $1.30 billion, up 181%, above the $1.05 billion estimate. Amazon, a meaningful cloud customer, disclosed in a filing that it sold all 822,234 of its AMD shares as of September 30. The position was originally built in the first quarter. AMD released ROCm 7 software to improve training and inference performance. The company also completed the divestiture of its ZT Systems data center manufacturing business to Sanmina. AMD partners expanded cloud services powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors. AWS said its new Amazon EC2 M8a instances deliver up to 30% better performance than the prior generation. Oracle introduced new X11 platforms powered by the same processors. IBM and AMD also announced plans to combine quantum computing with high‑performance compute in future architectures. AMD updated its PC and gaming lines with Ryzen Threadripper 9000WX, Threadripper PRO 9000X, and FSR 4. FSR 4 support doubled to more than 85 games. The company expanded its embedded line with AMD EPYC Embedded 4005 and Ryzen Embedded 9000 processors for industrial and edge computing.

Over the past 30 days, Cardano has dropped 37%, but the recent spike in 24-hour trading volume to $1.6 billion suggests buyers are stepping in fast. On-chain data from CoinGlass reveals that exchange netflows have remained mostly negative since October, meaning large investors are pulling tokens into cold storage instead of selling. This behavior often signals long-term conviction, as whales tend to load up quietly before major moves. With ADA now hovering at key support, the token could enter a consolidation phase before mounting a fresh rally – especially if institutional interest continues to climb. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Hits Former Trend Line Resistance from Above Cardano has tapped a key trend line resistance, and all eyes are now on whether buyers will step up to flip this zone into support. A decisive bounce here could mark the beginning of ADA’s next rally. However, the token is still trading below its 200-day exponential moving average – a level it must reclaim to confirm a bullish shift in momentum. The $0.53 zone is the key support to watch. Holding above it could spark a short-term breakout, especially as traders look to reenter positions after last week’s brutal sell-off. With billions wiped from the market, even a modest ADA recovery could spark a fresh wave of FOMO. For investors who hold through volatility, Best Wallet offers a smarter way to stay ahead – combining secure storage, low-fee swaps, and early access to emerging tokens, all in one seamless, mobile-first platform. As presales gain momentum, tools like this are becoming essential for spotting the next breakout before it goes mainstream. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Powers a New Level of User Experience Now in early presale, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is reshaping what a wallet can be – bringing together powerful trading tools, frictionless payments, and first access to top-tier presales inside a clean, user-friendly ecosystem. The wallet already supports over 60 blockchains, features low fees, and includes an integrated DEX that connects to 200+ decentralized exchanges. Now, with the launch of its native token $BEST, users will gain access to even more perks — from reduced transaction costs to exclusive presale access before listings go public. $BEST holders can also take part in staking for rewards and be the first to try out new product releases like the upcoming Best Card, which will let users spend crypto directly at stores, ATMs, and online. As the wallet’s popularity increases, the demand for $BEST will rise as well, especially as it gets users discounts on fees. To buy $BEST, simply visit the official Best Wallet Token website and link up your wallet (download the Best Wallet app here). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead.

Die Regierung präsentiert den Schritt als Signal für mehr Innovationsfreiheit und ein Ende der als feindlich wahrgenommenen Kryptopolitik der Biden-Ära. Gleichzeitig verschärft ein historischer Regierungs-Shutdown die wirtschaftliche Unsicherheit in den USA. Ein politischer Donnerschlag erschüttert Washington und die globale Finanzwelt zugleich. Mit der überraschenden Begnadigung von Binance-Gründer Changpeng “CZ” Zhao setzt US-Präsident Donald Trump ein deutliches Zeichen für seine neue Kryptostrategie. Während Befürworter von einem Neuanfang in der digitalen Wirtschaft sprechen, warnen Kritiker vor einem gefährlichen Präzedenzfall . Gleichzeitig steckt das Land im längsten Regierungs Shutdown der US-Geschichte, der Märkte und Bürger verunsichert. Was bedeutet dieser Schritt für die globale Kryptolandschaft und die wirtschaftliche Zukunft der USA? Ein Blick auf die Hintergründe und politischen Dynamiken. Trump setzt auf Krypto und Innovation Die Entscheidung, den Binance-Gründer Changpeng Zhao zu begnadigen, sorgt weltweit für Schlagzeilen. Trump bezeichnet den Schritt als Beginn einer neuen Ära, in der Innovation statt Sanktionen im Vordergrund stehen soll. Laut seiner Regierung markiert die Begnadigung den Bruch mit einer Politik, die digitale Technologien ausbremste und Talente ins Ausland drängte. Beobachter sehen darin ein klares politisches Signal: Die USA sollen wieder führend im Kryptosektor werden und ein attraktiver Standort für Blockchain-Unternehmen sein. Gleichzeitig steht die Entscheidung im Kontrast zu Trumps vorherigen Aussagen. Noch vor wenigen Tagen behauptete er, Zhao gar nicht zu kennen. Nun löscht die Begnadigung sämtliche strafrechtlichen Konsequenzen im Zusammenhang mit AML-Verstößen bei Binance. Kritiker fragen sich daher, ob politische Motive oder wirtschaftliche Interessen im Vordergrund standen. Befürworter hingegen feiern die Rückkehr einer unternehmerfreundlichen Finanzpolitik. Weiße Haus spricht von Ende des “Kryptokrieges” Pressesprecherin Karoline Leavitt betonte in Washington die Ambitionen der Regierung. Sie sprach von einem “Ende des Biden-Krieges gegen Krypto” und hob das Recht des Präsidenten hervor, Unternehmer zu schützen und Innovation zu fördern. Aus Sicht des Weißen Hauses ist der Pardon ein wirtschaftspolitisches Signal an Investoren, Technologen und Finanzmärkte weltweit. Die USA sollen wieder als Heimat für digitale Finanzsysteme gelten, nicht als Feind. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Gleichzeitig kritisieren Analysten den Tonfall, da er eine klare politische Frontbildung erkennen lässt. Während Trump Wachstum und Freiheit betone, verweisen Juristen auf die Bedeutung konsequenter Aufsicht im Finanzsektor. Die Begnadigung könnte damit zu einem Schlachtfeld zwischen Innovationsfreiheit und Regulierungssicherheit werden – zwei Themen, die global zunehmend im Fokus stehen. CZ bleibt umstrittene Figur der Finanzwelt Changpeng Zhao ist einer der bekanntesten Unternehmer der Kryptobranche. Sein Einfluss auf die globale digitale Finanzwelt ist enorm, doch die Vergangenheit bleibt kontrovers. Seine Verurteilung wegen Compliance-Fehlern und die anschließende viermonatige Haft hatten klare Signale gesetzt. Nun könnte die Begnadigung als Einladung für aggressive Expansion und risikofreudige Finanzmodelle verstanden werden. I’m still shocked that stories like this which come out daily still get largely ignored. The most corrupt person to ever hold any public office in US history. I will keep posting them every day and try to amplify them, even when most media doesn’t care. https://t.co/R9YUs3C4H4 pic.twitter.com/NwVpoyp9bC — Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) October 30, 2025 Auch Zhao selbst polarisiert weiterhin. Viele bewundern ihn als Visionär, der Kryptowährungen massentauglich machte. Andere sehen in ihm ein Symbol für unzureichende Aufsicht und Systemrisiken. Die Trump-Entscheidung verstärkt diese Spannungen und könnte in Zukunft neue Debatten über Verantwortung und Innovation auslösen. Shutdown bringt Märkte ins Wanken Parallel zur Begnadigung erschüttert ein historischer Regierungs-Shutdown die USA. Seit mehr als fünf Wochen stehen Bundesbehörden still, weil sich Regierung und Demokraten nicht auf ein Budget einigen. Der Stillstand lähmt öffentliche Dienste, schwächt Verbrauchervertrauen und belastet Unternehmen. Finanzmärkte reagieren nervös, da politische Unsicherheit oft zu Kapitalflucht führt. Beim US-Shutdown stehen Millionen Amerikaner vor leeren Tellern. Das wichtigste Lebensmittelhilfeprogramm wird ab dem 1. November nicht mehr finanziert. Während dessen ist Trump mit Badumbauten beschäftigt. https://t.co/D6CixtpDDz pic.twitter.com/LUEgwufk8A — Volkat (@DortmundaBerlin) November 1, 2025 Analysten berichten zudem von verstärkter Volatilität bei Aktien und Kryptowährungen. Die Kombination aus politischem Stillstand und starkem Eingriff in die Kryptopolitik schafft ein komplexes, kaum kalkulierbares Umfeld. Für viele Beobachter offenbart diese Situation die strukturellen Spannungen zwischen Regierung, Finanzsystem und technologischem Wandel. Trump-Lager gibt Demokraten die Schuld Trumps Berater nutzen die Situation, um klar Position zu beziehen. Sie werfen den Demokraten vor, wirtschaftliche Innovation zu blockieren und politische Machtspiele über das Wohl der Bürger zu stellen. Die Begnadigung Zhaos und die geplante Kryptostrategie seien Belege einer pro-wirtschaftlichen Agenda, so die Sicht des Weißen Hauses. Das Narrativ: Republikaner fördern Wachstum, Demokraten verhindern Fortschritt. Doch auch diese Darstellung ist umstritten. Kritiker argumentieren, dass Polarisierung und symbolische Politik zu Instabilität führen. Ökonomen warnen zudem vor langfristigen Schäden durch politische Blockaden. Während das Weiße Haus auf Dynamik und Zukunft setzt, fordern Marktbeobachter klare Regeln und verlässliche Prozesse. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Wie es für die USA weitergeht Die kommenden Wochen werden entscheidend sein. Die wirtschaftliche Lage bleibt angespannt, und die internationale Finanzwelt beobachtet jeden Schritt genau. Ob die Begnadigung ein mutiger Zukunftsschritt oder ein riskanter Präzedenzfall ist, zeigt sich erst langfristig. Fest steht: Die USA senden gemischte Signale, die Unsicherheit schaffen, aber auch Chancen bieten könnten. Die Diskussion um Kryptowährungen, staatliche Kontrolle und technologische Freiheit wird weiter an Fahrt gewinnen. Gleichzeitig bleibt die Lösung des Shutdowns dringend, um Vertrauen zurückzugewinnen. Für Anleger, Technologieunternehmen und Bürger beginnt eine Phase, die sowohl enorme Möglichkeiten als auch erhebliche Risiken birgt. Bitcoin Hyper: Aufgebaut auf einem zunehmend krypto-freundlichen Amerika Die politische Stimmung in den USA wird immer krypto-freundlicher. Gesetzgeber, große Unternehmen und Finanzinstitutionen erkennen zunehmend das Potenzial digitaler Assets – allen voran Bitcoin. Diese wachsende Unterstützung sorgt dafür, dass Bitcoin immer stärker institutionalisiert wird und seinen Platz im globalen Finanzsystem festigt. Genau hier setzt Bitcoin Hyper an: Es baut direkt auf der Sicherheit des Bitcoin-Netzwerks auf und erweitert es um die Geschwindigkeit und Programmierbarkeit der Solana-Technologie. Während die USA den Weg für eine breite Bitcoin-Adoption ebnen, schafft Bitcoin Hyper die technische Grundlage, damit Bitcoin nicht nur gehalten, sondern aktiv genutzt werden kann. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Mit Bitcoin wachsen in einer neuen Ära $HYPER ist der Utility-Token, der dieses Layer-2-Ökosystem antreibt. Je stärker Bitcoin durch politische Unterstützung und institutionelles Kapital in den USA wächst, desto größer wird der Bedarf an skalierbaren Lösungen, die BTC im Alltag brauchbar machen. Bitcoin bleibt die Basis – Bitcoin Hyper liefert die Funktionalität. In einer Zukunft, in der Bitcoin immer stärker verankert wird, kann $HYPER als technischer Erweiterungsbaustein direkt von dieser Entwicklung profitieren.

The disagreement follows a letter last month from the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) urging the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to reject Coinbase’s application because it could destabilize traditional banking. In a le tter to the OCC, the ICBA states that it “strongly opposes” Coinbase’s bid to establish Coinbase National Trust Company, as it considers the crypto exchange’s model to be “untested and risky.” The group stated that the company may face challenges in crypto market downturns and lacks the same protections and oversight as traditional banks. Coinbase said the OCC, which regulates national banks and trust companies, will determine whether it may operate under a federal charter. This change would put the digital currency exchange under direct federal oversight and expand its business by allowing it to offer custodial services, as well as trading, clearing, and settlement services. Coinbase fires back: “Banks fear competition, not risk” Coinbase’s CLO publicly criticized the ICBA position in a post on X. “Imagine opposing a regulated trust charter because you prefer crypto to remain unregulated,” he wrote. “That’s the ICBA’s position — another example of bank lobbyists digging regulatory moats to insulate themselves,” he said. Grewal’s words illustrate Coinbase’s increasing impatience with what it deems unfair resistance from traditional finance. The firm says it has no intention of becoming a full-service bank, but would prefer to operate within a single federal framework to enforce better, protect, and disclose its consumer practices. The national trust charter would ease the company’s administrative and regulatory burden across states, enabling it to bring more products to more customers. The company states that passing its proposed charter would enhance oversight of the firm’s activities by bringing it under OCC surveillance, a goal banks have long lobbied for in relation to crypto firms. Within Coinbase, this development is viewed as a milestone toward its mission of bridging the legacy financial world with the complex crypto economy. The executives note that subjecting crypto institutions to the same level of oversight as banks currently receive will foster confidence, attract institutional investors, and reduce systemic risk. Banks fight to keep control of the financial system At the center of the clash is a question that could determine the future evolution of global banking: Should crypto firms be allowed to operate under essentially the same federal framework as traditional banks, or should they remain separate and closely regulated? The banking industry holds a near monopoly on the infrastructure that enables cash to circulate, deposits to be secured, and trust in the financial system. The rise of cryptocurrency and businesses like Coinbase, which provide services such as custody, trading, and settlement, is posing a threat to some of that stranglehold. If Coinbase were awarded a federal trust charter, the company would have automatic access to the state, local, and tribal regulatory structure that banks use to conduct business across all 50 states. Less friction, quicker innovation, and perhaps even a new model for financial inclusion that bypasses intermediaries as we’ve traditionally known them. However, old-school banks believe that this would establish a risky precedent. Digital-asset companies have yet to demonstrate that they can handle risks such as money laundering, cybersecurity attacks, and market fluctuations under real-world banking conditions, they say. Adding a similar federal designation for such companies could create fissures in the system that allow companies that don’t take deposits or maintain reserves to benefit from the same kind of national footprint and credibility as banks. They have fear that transcends compliance. Crypto companies like Coinbase can already serve millions, if not tens of millions, of customers with relatively little physical infrastructure, relying solely on technology and automation, as opposed to branches or complex legacy systems. This efficiency may pose a threat to the typical business models of banks.

The initiative, which runs until November 13 at 04:00 (UTC), is designed to encourage increased activity on the platform through a mix of trading, staking, and referral-based participation. Overview of the Campaign The event, titled “Your Chance to 420,000 XRP”, gives both new and existing users multiple ways to earn XRP rewards. Participants can qualify by engaging in three key activities: trading and depositing XRP, staking their holdings, or joining Bitrue’s new XRP launchpool to multiply returns. To be eligible for rewards, users are required to complete Bitrue’s Level 1 Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification. The platform also clarified that any withdrawals during the campaign period could impact eligibility. All rewards from the event will be distributed within two weeks after the campaign concludes. Deposit and Trading Event The first component of the campaign centers on deposits and trading. Bitrue is offering incentives to users who deposit and trade at least 100 XRP on its spot market. A dedicated 250,000 XRP prize pool has been allocated for this event. Additionally, Bitrue will provide a 20% welcome bonus to the first 500 new users who meet the trading and deposit requirements. The exchange defines “new users” as individuals who registered on Bitrue after January 1, 2025, and have not made any previous deposits. Users can further increase their earnings by inviting others to join the platform, with referral bonuses of up to 50 XRP for each qualified trader introduced to Bitrue. Staking Opportunities The second part of the promotion focuses on staking rewards, offering users flexible and fixed-term options depending on their registration status. New users can access a seven-day flexible staking plan with an impressive 80% annual percentage yield (APY) and guaranteed returns. Existing users can participate in a 15-day fixed-term staking option that offers 3% APY. These staking programs are designed to encourage long-term participation while providing steady incentives to holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Launchpool for Multiplying Rewards In the campaign’s third stage, Bitrue introduces a new XRP launchpool, which officially goes live on November 4. Both new and existing users can participate and earn up to 50% APY through this feature. The launchpool allows participants to increase their XRP holdings without active trading, providing another route to accumulate rewards during the campaign period. Bitrue has consistently positioned itself as one of the most XRP-friendly exchanges in the digital asset industry. Since listing the token in 2018, the platform has steadily expanded its XRP-related offerings , introducing over 90 trading pairs by March 2024. In addition to regular trading services, Bitrue has previously hosted several XRP-specific promotions, including a $50,000 XRP giveaway in March 2024. The latest 420,000 XRP campaign reinforces Bitrue’s ongoing confidence in XRP’s role within the broader crypto ecosystem and highlights the exchange’s commitment to fostering engagement within the community. Through this event, Bitrue not only rewards active users but also continues to strengthen its connection to the XRP ecosystem, a relationship that has remained consistent through fluctuating market conditions.

With sellers pushing toward the $102,000 zone, BTC is now at a moment that may mark the final washout before a major rebound. The coming days could be decisive in determining whether Bitcoin finds its footing or continues its decline. Bitcoin Faces Pressure Below $108,000 As Bears Regain Control Crypto analyst Crypto Candy shared insights into Bitcoin’s latest price action, noting that the flagship cryptocurrency tried to hold the $107,000–$108,000 support zone but ultimately failed to do so, closing below that level. This development signals a potential shift in market dynamics, as the $107,000–$108,000 zone may now act as a strong resistance area. Related Reading: Head And Shoulders Pattern Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $100,000 Crypto Candy further explained that if the downward momentum continues, Bitcoin could retrace deeper toward the $99,000–$101,000 range, an area viewed as a critical support zone where fresh buying interest might emerge. A dip into this range could also help clear out weak positions and create healthier conditions for a long-term rebound. However, the analyst added that if Bitcoin manages to reclaim and hold above the $107,000–$108,000 zone, it would signal that bullish strength is returning to the market. Such a breakout could restore confidence among investors, paving the way for renewed upward momentum and possibly another push toward higher targets. $102,000: The Ideal Flush Zone Before The Next Big Move In his latest BTC daily update, Super฿ro emphasized the critical role of the $102,000 support zone, describing it as an ideal area for the market to flush out remaining leveraged long positions. This kind of shakeout is often necessary to clear weak hands and set the stage for a more sustainable bullish continuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A ‘Do-Or-Die’ Level As Cycle Faces First Real Test: Analyst Super฿ro further noted that once this cleanup phase concludes, Bitcoin could see a sharp rebound, primarily fueled by a short squeeze from traders caught on the wrong side of the market. As shorts begin to close their positions, buying pressure could intensify, creating a rapid upward move that reclaims lost levels. That said, the crypto analyst has warned that a break below the $101,000 level would not be ideal, as it might signal that market weakness is deeper than anticipated. Still, he maintains confidence in the broader picture, highlighting that high-timeframe (HTF) indicators remain supportive of a potential rebound. Presently, the price of BTC is hovering around $104,000, indicating a more than 3% decline over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, its trading volume has picked up pace, rising by over 79% in the same time frame.

54039754,620273,1762300847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54039754.jpeg,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: 28,600 BTC Sold At A Loss",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holders-capitulate-28600-btc/,"Bitcoin has slipped below the $105,000 level, signaling mounting selling pressure and a notable rise in volatility as the market enters a critical phase. After months of strong resilience and repeated defenses of key support zones, bulls are now on the back foot, struggling to regain momentum while bears attempt to force BTC toward the psychological $100,000 threshold. Despite the sharp pullback, Bitcoin is still trading near important demand levels that previously acted as a base for significant upside movements — placing the market at a pivotal crossroads. According to data highlighted by top analyst Darkfost, short-term behavior is intensifying the sell-off. Short-term holders (STHs) continue sending Bitcoin to exchanges at a loss, with around 28,600 BTC currently being realized at negative profit. This aligns with heightened capitulation pressure, where newer market participants are exiting positions amid fear and short-term panic rather than a conviction-based strategy. While long-term on-chain metrics remain relatively stable, the market is now watching closely to see whether demand absorbs this wave of selling — or whether momentum shifts decisively in favor of the bears. With macro uncertainty still looming and liquidity thinning across major assets, the next few sessions could determine Bitcoin’s near-term direction. Short-Term Holders Remain Under Pressure According to Darkfost, the short-term holder (STH) cohort remains the key source of sell-side pressure in the current phase of the Bitcoin market. The analyst highlights that we can still expect a stronger capitulation from STHs, as their SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) continues to hover around 1 — a level that historically reflects indecision and stress. When SOPR hovers around parity, it indicates that short-term holders are either selling at break-even or only slightly above or below cost, suggesting little conviction and a lack of willingness to hold through volatility. This behavior also aligns with another critical pattern: each time Bitcoin approaches the STH realized price, roughly around $112,500, the market sees waves of profit-taking or break-even selling. Instead of holding through potential reversals, short-term participants are consistently exiting positions as soon as the price recovers toward their entry level. This repeated supply response near the STH cost basis has effectively become a rotating ceiling for BTC, preventing clean continuation and creating a structurally heavy price environment in the short term. Darkfost notes that this behavior signals doubt, fatigue, and heightened sensitivity to drawdowns among recent buyers. While long-term holders remain largely steady and are not contributing meaningfully to sell pressure, the STH cohort continues to react to every bounce with caution — a dynamic that often precedes final shakeouts or deeper wick-down events before trend continuation. BTC Tests Weekly Support Zone as Momentum Weakens and Sellers Tighten Control Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a decisive shift in momentum, with price sliding toward the $103,000–$105,000 support area and testing the 50-week moving average after a period of sustained weakness. The market has now posted several lower highs from the peak near $127,000, signaling a gradual transition from strong uptrend behavior to consolidation — and now, potential trend vulnerability if buyers fail to defend current levels. The recent weekly candle shows a sharp wick to the downside and increased selling volume, reflecting panic-driven exits and short-term capitulation. Despite this, price remains above a key structural support zone that held during previous pullbacks earlier in the cycle, making this level crucial for bulls to protect. A decisive break below the 50-week MA could accelerate downside momentum and open the door to deeper retracement targets toward $95,000 or even $88,000 if risk aversion intensifies. However, macro trend structure still leans bullish over the long term as the 200-week moving average continues to trend upward and sits comfortably below the current price. For now, eyes remain on whether BTC can reclaim $110,000 in the coming sessions — a move that would signal absorption of selling pressure and prevent further deterioration of market sentiment.

With 26.2% early-stage gains already locked for the earliest swarm members, the conversation around the best 1000x crypto in this cycle just got itchy. As anchors like Cardano bleed red and Aster rides billionaire backing, a tiny meme insect is quietly building a hive, growing its swarm, and sneaking toward attention in a market where underdogs can break the internet faster than anyone refreshes a chart. Yes, the memes are loud. Yes, the mosquito wings are whirring. And yes, crypto watchers are wondering whether this bug is preparing a sting that turns tiny entries into oversized bags. Time for a Mosquito Moment? La Culex Flexes Meme Mischief and Math La Culex ($CULEX) calls itself crypto’s mosquito, and somehow the branding works. Memes show mosquitoes wearing aviators, mosquitoes chasing moon rockets, and mosquitoes refusing to let bags sleep. Tiny but relentless. Annoying but impossible to ignore. The project mixes meme humor with staking, referrals, and token burns designed to shrink supply and amp loyalty rewards. Early holders already see 26.2% gain in Stage 4, backing the idea that early swarms eat first. With over 500M tokens sold and a La Culex presale tally crossing $11,000, this insect is collecting more buzz than a Bitcoin halving thread during bull season. The token supply structure aims for fairness instead of stealth launches and secret VC seeds. A community-first flight path means new holders join the swarm rather than chase whales. Memes are half the story. Referrals and staking APY are the other half. Because even mosquitoes want sustainable feeding cycles. $7,500 Bag Scenario at Listing Price now: $0.00002458 Projected listing price: $0.007 $7,500 buys approximately 305,185,244 tokens. At $0.007 listing, that bag values near $2.13M. Not financial advice. Just math. Math that makes traders choke on coffee and start checking mosquito memes twice. Cardano Dips Hard While Bulls Look the Other Way Cardano investors woke up to a chart that needed tissues. According to Investing.com, ADA dropped 10.11% in a single day and remains down 82.29% from its $3.10 all-time high. That is not just a dip. That is a flashback to 2022 PTSD territory. Volume hit $1.5392B, yet price slid to $0.5489 while traders searched for green somewhere else. In the last 7 days alone, the coin shed 17.64%, turning excitement into eyebrow raises. ADA still holds massive long-term fundamentals and academic-grade blockchain architecture, but right now, short-term nerves are real. With Bitcoin dominance tightening at over 60% and Ethereum wobbling, the capital rotation into microcaps and early memes feels familiar. It is the historic pattern where oversized blue chips stagnate, and micro-cap weirdos with strong community energy take off while everyone debates logic. Aster Pumps With CZ Fuel as Hype Spreads While Cardano was feeling the pain, Aster rode a rocket on social feeds after Binance founder CZ publicly posted about buying ASTER. The market jumped over 30% in minutes, and trading volume exploded, according to Bitget Academy. CZ saying “I buy and hold” hit harder than a bull run meme. Wallet trackers saw a swarm of traders rushing in, and some compared the moment to his early support for BNB. Aster has real-world DeFi mechanics, leveraged trading, and a zero-knowledge upgrade coming, giving it actual depth beyond hype. Still, people are watching to see whether the rally sustains or sees short-term traders dump in waves. Final Thought: Best 1000x Crypto Bite Point? Cardano has history, Aster has backing, and La Culex has culture and early math that refuses to sit still. As the next wave of meme cycles gathers force, smart investors watch for new community sticks of dynamite. Small caps often explode hardest during rotation phases. The mosquito narrative taps into humor, simplicity, and those “what if” energy moments that spark wild runs. Crypto never rewards those waiting politely. It rewards the projects that show up flapping wings with conviction. If curiosity is a mosquito bite, this one is itching right where hype lives. No wonder La Culex is named the best 1000x crypto .

La Culex combines memes with staking, referral systems, and burn mechanics designed to support sustainable growth beyond humor. How risky are early meme tokens? Meme tokens carry high volatility and risk. They can surge fast, but they can also correct sharply. Research is key. Why is Cardano down lately? Cardano has faced market selling pressure, dropping 17% in the past week amid broader sentiment shifts and altcoin rotations. Why did Aster rally recently? Aster surged over 30% after Binance founder CZ disclosed buying $2M worth of ASTER tokens, boosting confidence and volume. Glossary Presale: Early token sale before public listing APY: Annual percentage yield for staking rewards ROI: Return on investment Burn Mechanism: Token removal to reduce supply Meme Coin: Crypto driven by culture, humor, and community energy ZK Tech: Zero-knowledge proofs for blockchain privacy Swarm: La Culex community nickname Summary La Culex is emerging as a surprising meme-based contender in the hunt for the best 1000x crypto as major chains like Cardano struggle and Aster rallies on CZ backing. In Stage 4 of its presale, La Culex has already delivered 26.2% gains for early buyers, selling over 500M tokens and crossing $11,000 in funding with more than 80 holders. With a $0.00002458 price and a $0.007 listing target, speculative ROI math fuels community interest, supported by staking, referral rewards, and token burns. Meanwhile, Cardano fell over 10% in one day and remains down 82% from its all-time high, while Aster surged over 30% following CZ’s public investment. The article examines sentiment rotation into smaller meme-driven assets, evaluates early-stage token mechanics, and emphasizes risk transparency. The tone blends humor and research, highlighting a unique narrative shift where a mosquito-themed token gains traction amid shifting market cycles.

54039757,621493,1762301853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54039757.jpeg,Bitcoin Experten reden Tacheles: Saylor und Kiyosaki geben ihre Jahresprognosen ab,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-experten-prognose-saylor-kiyosaki/,"Michael Saylor und Robert Kiyosaki erwarten eine deutliche Bitcoin-Rally bis Ende 2025. Beide verweisen auf langfristige Trends und die Bedeutung von emotionaler Disziplin in volatilen Märkten. Trotz kurzfristiger Schwankungen und Rücksetzer bei MicroStrategy zeigt sich das langfristige Vertrauen stark. Bitcoin sorgt erneut für Schlagzeilen. Zwei der bekanntesten Stimmen im Kryptomarkt senden bullische Signale – und das, obwohl der Kurs nach Rekordständen zuletzt korrigiert hat. Michael Saylor und Robert Kiyosaki bleiben überzeugt, dass BTC noch ganz am Anfang seiner Reise steht. Ihre Botschaft ist klar: Wer jetzt Nerven zeigt, könnte später belohnt werden. Prominente Prognosen für eine neue Bitcoin-Rally Bitcoin polarisiert wie kaum ein Asset und legt ein weiteres Kapitel intensiver Debatten hin. Nachdem der Kurs sein Rekordhoch erreicht hat, folgte eine scharfe Korrektur. Dennoch treten zwei der lautesten Fürsprecher auf den Plan und setzen ein Zeichen des Vertrauens. Michael Saylor und Robert Kiyosaki sind überzeugt, dass die Kryptowährung weiter steigen wird und neue Höchststände erreichbar sind. Während viele Anleger verunsichert reagieren, bleiben diese prominenten Marktbeobachter optimistisch. Sie sehen die aktuelle Phase als normalen Zyklus in einem langfristigen Aufwärtstrend. Ihre Prognosen spiegeln nicht nur Hoffnung wider, sondern basieren auf historischen Mustern und neuen Marktstrukturen. Für sie ist der Rückgang kein Signal zur Panik, sondern eine Chance zum Handeln. Michael Saylor sieht strukturelle Stärke im Markt Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman von MicroStrategy, betont die wachsende Stabilität des BTC-Ökosystems. Trotz des jüngsten Schocks von Milliardenliquidationen sieht er eine robuste Marktstruktur. Laut Saylor bleibt der Aufwärtstrend bestehen, da Volatilität sinkt und institutionelle Nutzung zunimmt. Sein Kursziel von $150.000 bis Ende 2025 basiert auf Analysten-Konsens und langfristiger Fundamentalanalyse. Er geht sogar weiter und spricht von einem möglichen Anstieg bis hin zu siebenstelligen Beträgen innerhalb weniger Jahre. Seine Firma setzt diese Überzeugung in Taten um und kaufte zuletzt erneut hunderte Bitcoin. MicroStrategys Strategie bleibt klar: Bitcoin als primäres Wertaufbewahrungsmittel. Dass die Aktie von MicroStrategy parallel zur Korrektur fiel, zeigt die starke Bindung an den Kryptomarkt. MicroStrategy bleibt auf Einkaufskurs Die jüngste Akquisition von 390 BTC unterstreicht das Vertrauen des Unternehmens. Mit über 640.000 Bitcoin hält MicroStrategy eine Position, die im Krypto-Sektor nahezu einzigartig ist. Trotz Kursverlusten von rund 13% im Aktienpreis bleibt die Strategie unverändert. Für Saylor ist Bitcoin ein langfristiges Anlagevehikel, das traditionelle Finanzsysteme herausfordert. During the Strategy earnings call Saylor said that MSTR is a 10 year hold when a few minutes earlier the CEO presented figures based on BTC hitting $150k in…. checks watch ….60 days. You couldn't make this up! pic.twitter.com/NVbptYHLdZ — Skag (@superskag) November 1, 2025 Die Marktreaktion zeigt jedoch, dass Anleger kurzfristig sensibel auf Preisbewegungen reagieren. Der Rückgang bestätigt die enge Korrelation zwischen Bitcoin-Preis und Unternehmensbewertung. Dennoch sieht Saylor diese Schwankungen gelassen. Sein Fokus liegt klar auf langfristigen Wertzuwächsen und strukturellem Wachstum des Bitcoin-Netzwerks, nicht auf täglichen Kursbewegungen. Kiyosaki setzt auf emotionale Stärke und Kursziele Robert Kiyosaki, Bestseller-Autor und bekannter Investor, teilt eine noch aggressivere Prognose. Auf X erklärte er, dass BTC bis Jahresende $200.000 erreichen könne. Er betont jedoch nicht nur Zahlen, sondern das emotionale Management beim Investieren. Angst sei laut ihm der häufigste Grund, Chancen zu verpassen. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Kiyosaki erklärt, dass Anleger mehr verlieren, wenn sie aus Furcht handeln statt rational. Er selbst hält nach eigenen Aussagen BTC im Millionenbereich. Seine Sichtweise spricht besonders Kleinanleger an, die sich in volatilen Märkten schnell verunsichern lassen. Für ihn ist Bitcoin ein Werkzeug zur finanziellen Freiheit und Absicherung gegen Inflation. Marktdaten zeigen gemischtes Stimmungsbild Bitcoin handelt aktuell nahe $111.000 und liegt damit unter seinem Allzeithoch. Handelsvolumen und Futures-Finanzierung haben nachgelassen, was auf geringere Marktaktivität hinweist. Gleichzeitig zeigen institutionelle Zuflüsse, dass das Interesse großer Anleger weiter besteht. Analysten sehen den Rückzug daher eher als Mid-Cycle-Korrektur, nicht als Trendbruch. On-Chain-Daten bestätigen verstärkte Akkumulation, da mehr Coins von Börsen abgezogen werden. Niedrigere Liquidität erhöht zwar kurzfristiges Risiko, doch langfristige Anleger nutzen Rücksetzer zum Kauf. Diese Dynamik stützt die These eines gesunden Marktumfeldes. Geduld und Strategie scheinen derzeit wichtiger als schnelle Entscheidungen. Langfristige Perspektive trotz kurzfristiger Schwankungen Sowohl Saylor als auch Kiyosaki verweisen auf die Bedeutung des langfristigen Blicks. Ihre Einschätzungen beruhen auf strukturellen Trends, nicht auf tagesaktuellen Charts. Beide gehen davon aus, dass BTC weiter wachsen wird, gestützt durch institutionelle Nachfrage und klare Angebotsstruktur. Die aktuelle Unsicherheit sei temporär und Teil des Zyklus. Für Anleger bedeutet dies: Ruhe bewahren, Risiken kennen und langfristig denken. Emotionale Disziplin wird zum Schlüssel in einer hochdynamischen Anlageklasse. Wer BTC als langfristige Investition betrachtet, könnte von zukünftigen Kursanstiegen profitieren. Die Vision bleibt klar: ein digitaler Wertspeicher mit globaler Reichweite und enormem Wachstumspotenzial. Bitcoin Hyper: Profiteur eines prognostizierten Anstiegs von BTC Viele Experten prognostizieren für dieses Jahr einen deutlichen Anstieg von BTC. Mit steigendem Interesse und institutioneller Teilnahme gewinnt BTC weiter an Bedeutung. Bitcoin Hyper baut direkt auf dieser Entwicklung auf: Es verbindet die Sicherheit von Bitcoin mit der Geschwindigkeit von Solana und macht BTC anwendbar – nicht nur ein Wertaufbewahrungsmittel. Gelangt Bitcoin in eine neue Wachstumsphase, steht Bitcoin Hyper bereit, davon zu profitieren. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für BTC Hyper! $HYPER: Wenn BTC steigt, könnte Hyper mitsteigen $HYPER ist der Token, der diese Erweiterung möglich macht. Steigt BTC wie von Experten erwartet, steigt auch der Bedarf an Lösungen, die BTC nutzbar machen. Hyper erfüllt genau diesen Bedarf – und $HYPER könnte von dieser Dynamik mittel- bis langfristig profitieren.

This move would position Gemini among the many financial firms entering a new field of prediction markets. Reports highlighted that this market will provide a controlled method for betting on outcomes of elections, sports games, and other events. The launch represents Gemini’s effort to diversify its offerings amid a competitive crypto exchange market. Gemini aims to remain competitive in the crypto space Recently, Gemini has been making significant moves to strengthen its position in the crypto space . To begin with, the firm applied for regulatory approval to establish its own derivatives exchange, which is designated as a contract market. This update followed discussions by the cryptocurrency exchange’s officials about using this exchange for trading prediction contracts. The application is still under review. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that securing approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a new exchange can take a considerable amount of time, often spanning months or even years. The delays may also occur if a government shutdown takes place. Another significant milestone in the ecosystem is that several exchanges and retail investment brokers have decided to collaborate with existing prediction market platforms that already hold the necessary licenses, rather than starting from scratch. An example of these platforms is Robinhood, which offers its clients event contracts from Kalshi Inc. If Gemini moves forward with its plans, the company can compete against key players such as trading exchange Kalshi, which is already registered with the US derivatives regulator, and Polymarket, which seeks to resume operations in the US soon. Trump Media and Technology Group also entered the growing trend of prediction markets, partnering with Crypto.com. The predictions are expected to be integrated with Truth Social , Trump’s social media platform. Truth Social will use Crypto.com Derivatives North America as a clearinghouse, tapping a CFTC-registered platform. The initial testing of Truth Predict, the new market, is expected to commence soon. Prediction markets face significant regulatory challenges. Following the growing trend among companies to participate in prediction markets, established exchange companies such as CME Group Inc. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. have reportedly entered the prediction market. Moreover, Gemini’s major competitor in the crypto industry, Coinbase Global Inc., pointed out in recent earnings calls that it aims to branch out into event contracts. According to the company, this move is part of its expansive goal to become an “Everything Exchange” for different financial products. On the other hand, Gemini announced in a regulatory filing that it intended to launch event contracts for predictions connected to sports, finance, politics, and economics before its initial public offering in September this year. Since going public, the firm’s stock has drastically declined by 40% from its debut price. Its IPO prospectus explained that Gemini is not currently profitable. The legal document also highlighted that the cryptocurrency exchange only accounts for a small portion of crypto trading in the US. This situation prompted a Needham analyst to comment on the matter. The analyst acknowledged that the prediction markets present an ideal opportunity for Gemini to expand its services beyond what it currently provides. However, reports noted that prediction markets still face major regulatory challenges. For example, while CFTC has granted Kalshi permission to introduce new markets, state gaming regulators, who usually manage sports betting, have opposed this decision in court.

In a new essay titled “Hallelujah” published on November 4, 2025, the former BitMEX CEO lays out a balance-sheet-driven case that persistent US fiscal deficits, hedge-fund demand for Treasuries financed via repo, and the Fed’s need to cap funding stress will translate into incremental dollar liquidity that ultimately “pumps the price of Bitcoin and other cryptos.” As he frames the core mechanism: “Government issued debt grows the money supply.” Hayes’ logic chain begins with an observation on political incentives and the arithmetic of public finance. Governments can fund spending with “savings or debt,” and in his view elected officials “will always favor borrowing from the future to get re-elected in the present.” For the United States, he contends that the trajectory is already set: “Here are the estimates from the TBTF banksters, and a few US government agencies. As you can see, the estimates are for ~$2 trillion deficits funded by ~$2 trillion of borrowing.” In his model, once one accepts that “Yearly Federal Deficit = Yearly Treasury Debt Issuance Amount,” the next critical question is who actually buys that debt, and on what financing. Fed’s Stealth QE Will “Pump Crypto” He dismisses foreign central banks as dependable marginal buyers after the US sanctioned and immobilized Russian reserves in 2022. “If Pax Americana is willing to steal Russia’s money… then no foreign owner of treasuries is ever safe,” he writes, concluding reserve managers “would rather buy gold than treasuries.” He likewise downplays the capacity of the US household sector given that “the 2024 personal savings rate was 4.6%” while “the US federal deficit was 6% of GDP,” and he argues the largest US money-center banks have increased their Treasury holdings by only “~$300 billion” in fiscal 2025 against issuance of “$1,992 billion,” making them meaningful but not decisive. Related Reading: Caution In The Crypto Market: Expert Warns Of Bearish Phase Unfolding This November Instead, Hayes positions relative-value hedge funds—particularly those booking positions via Cayman vehicles—as the marginal, price-setting bid for US duration. Citing a recent Federal Reserve study, he quotes: “Cayman Islands hedge funds purchased, on net, $1.2 trillion of Treasury securities… [between] January 2022 and December 2024… [and] absorbed 37% of net issuance of notes and bonds.” The trade architecture is straightforward: “Buy a cash treasury debt security vs. sell the corresponding treasury futures contract,” then lever the tiny basis through repo funding. Because the edge is “measured in basis points,” the trade only works if leverage is cheap and predictable every day. That funnel leads directly to the SRF. Hayes lays out the Fed’s short-rate corridor—“Upper and Lower Fed Funds; currently these equal 4.00% and 3.75% respectively”—and the policy plumbing that keeps market rates inside it: the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) at the lower bound for money-market funds (MMFs) and banks, interest on reserve balances (IORB) for banks in the middle, and the SRF at the upper bound as the emergency spigot. Lower Fed Funds = RRP < IORB < SRF = Upper Fed Funds,” he summarizes, adding that the target, SOFR, normally oscillates inside the band. Stress occurs “when SOFR trades above the Upper Fed Funds,” which he calls “a problem” because “the filthy fiat financial system shuts down” once participants can’t roll overnight leverage at a stable rate. In his telling, the cash supply that cushions SOFR is structurally thinner than it was when the Fed began quantitative tightening in early 2022. MMFs, he says, have drained the RRP to zero because “the T-bill rate is so attractive,” making them less available as repo cash providers. That leaves banks, who will supply liquidity so long as they have ample reserves, but “banks lost trillions in reserves since the Fed began QT.” Set against that diminished supply of cash is relentless demand for repo financing from RV funds, whose “marginal” Treasury purchases must be levered. If SOFR threatens to pierce the ceiling and repo becomes unreliable, the Fed’s SRF must backstop the system to prevent a funding accident. “Because a similar situation occurred in 2019, the Fed created the SRF,” Hayes writes. “The Fed can supply an infinite amount of cash using its printing press at SRF as long as one provides an acceptable form of collateral.” His conclusion is blunt: “If the SRF balances are above zero, then we know the Fed is cashing the checks of the politicians using printed money.” Hayes labels this dynamic “Stealth QE.” He argues the optics of outright balance-sheet expansion via asset purchases are now politically toxic—“QE is a dirty word… QE = money printing = inflation”—so the central bank will prefer to meet marginal dollar demand via SRF lending rather than by visibly creating excess reserves. What This Means For The Crypto Market The result is functionally similar from a liquidity standpoint, in his view: repo credit distributed by the Fed against Treasuries still increases spendable dollars in the system to finance government borrowing. “This will buy some time, but eventually the exponential expansion of treasury debt issuance will force the repeated use of the SRF,” he writes. “Stealth QE will begin shortly. I don’t know when it will begin. But… the SRF balance must grow as the lender of last resort. As SRF balances grow, the amount of fiat dollars in the world expands as well. This phenomenon will reignite the Bitcoin bull market.” He also sketches a near-term tactical backdrop that helps explain recent market tone across crypto. While auctions are pulling cash into the Treasury General Account, he notes, fiscal spending has been temporarily impeded by the government shutdown, producing a net drain in private-sector liquidity.

Bear Case: These Forces Divide The Market “The Treasury General Account is above the $850 billion target by ~$150bn,” he writes, arguing that this “extra liquidity won’t get released into the markets until the government reopens,” contributing to “current softness in the crypto markets.” In other words, the same fiscal engine that ultimately forces the Fed’s hand via the SRF can, in the very short run, sap liquidity when issuance front-runs outlays. Hayes’ rhetoric remains intentionally sharp. He describes Treasuries as “dog shit” at prevailing real yields, calls the buy-side “debt shit eaters,” and opens with a hymn to Bitcoin’s monetary properties—“Praise be to Lord Satoshi that time and compounding interest exist regardless of who you are.” The provocation serves the point: if the marginal financing of US deficits increasingly relies on opaque backstops rather than transparent reserve creation, then crypto’s native, non-sovereign liquidity cycles will key off the same hidden plumbing. He distills the investment upshot in a single sentence: “Treasury Debt Amount Issued = Increase in Supply of Dollars.” The essay is not a calendar call. Hayes refuses to timestamp the inflection—“I don’t know when it will begin”—and he warns that “between now and when stealth QE begins, one has to husband capital. Expect a choppy market,” especially with shutdown dynamics distorting flows. But he is unequivocal on direction once SRF usage becomes persistent: “Stealth QE will begin shortly… [and] will reignite the Bitcoin bull market.” For crypto investors conditioned to watch CPI prints and FOMC dots, the message is to track money-market microstructure instead. In Hayes’ framework, when SRF balances stop being a rounding error and start trending, that is the tell that dollar liquidity has quietly flipped—and that crypto isn’t topping yet. At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.41 trillion.
