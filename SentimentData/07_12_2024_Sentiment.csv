From as early as January this year, developers have hinted at the need to implement this changes to the mainnet. Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is in support of a 33% limit. To Galaxy Digital, there is more to consider in quest to make this move. Ethereum Gas Limit: Is The Time Right? As discussed by Galaxy Researcher Christine Kim, at the latest Ethereum all developers’ conference also witnessed arguments in support. Nethermind developer Marek Moraczyński presented data-driven research on why an increase is justified and safe for the protocol. In comment, Kim highlighted there are factors that need analyzing on why this proposal is worth considering. First, the block gas limit will not impact the blockchain. Several researches have pointed at this, invalidating claims that increment above 25% might overload the network. tldr; there’s enough data and research to suggest that a gas limit increase won’t hurt Ethereum. but in light of the network’s scaling roadmap, it likely won’t help either in terms of fees, activity, or overall network value. so why push for it at all? https://t.co/bx56kSvDS4 — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) December 6, 2024 On the other hand, Christine Kim said “it is also likely that it won’t materially help Ethereum in any way either.” With the broad uncertainty, the researcher noted that the timing is not right for the major validators to get behind the proposal. Naming Coinbase and Kraken Exchanges, she said the speculations surrounding the Ethereum block gas limit increase might cause some drawbacks. Increasing the gas limt will help scale the Ethereum protocol by a considerable measure. If ongoing considerations around the limit increase passes, the developers have plans to EIPs to implement it in the Pectra Upgrade . Whether or not the protocol will inplement Ethereum gas limits as a temporary scalability fix, Galaxy Research hinted that now is not the time. Growing Layer 1 Competition Over the past year, different Layer 1 blockchain networks have hinted at plans to upgrade their chains. Vitalik Buterin has stayed at the top of the conversation, hinting in series his visions for scaling ETH in the coming decade. While Ethereum is leveraging the strength of its layer-2 scaling solutions to command the majority of traction in the industry, other chains are also stepping up. As revealed recently, the Cardano Hydra protocol recorded a 1 million transaction per second milestone in test mode. As Cardano’s scaling tool, this figures, if transferred to real world will make the protocol the fastest in the industry. Other chains like Solana, SUI Network and XRP Ledger also have their inherent strengths amid growing competition.

Qubetics Is Your Next Big Investment,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-polygon-bandwagon-qubetics-is-your-next-big-investment/,"The crypto market never sleeps, and neither does the FOMO it generates. Over the past few years, we’ve watched coins like Polygon (MATIC) soar, turning early adopters into overnight millionaires. If you didn’t hop on the MATIC train back in 2020, you’re not alone—it feels like most of us missed that bus. But here’s the good news: missing out on Polygon might just be your best blessing in disguise. Why? Because a new opportunity has arrived that’s making even the most seasoned investors sit up and pay attention. Meet Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary crypto project that’s shaking up the space with its bold vision for real-world asset tokenisation. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy, Qubetics is not just an option—it’s the opportunity of the season. Qubetics ($TICS): Where Web3 Meets the Real World If you’ve been in the crypto game for a while, you’ve probably heard plenty of projects making big claims about “bridging the gap” between blockchain and the real world. Most of them fall short, but Qubetics is different. It’s not just building a bridge—it’s redefining what’s possible by tokenising real-world assets. So, what exactly does that mean? At its core, Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator that’s focused on real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT). It’s taking tangible, physical assets like real estate, luxury cars, and even high-value collectibles and turning them into digital tokens. This isn’t just some abstract concept—it’s a game-changing solution that’s unlocking liquidity for individuals and businesses. Imagine this: You’re a property owner who needs quick cash but doesn’t want to sell your entire building. With Qubetics, you can tokenise a portion of your property, sell fractional ownership, and raise capital faster than a bank loan. Or let’s say you’re an art collector with a multi-million-dollar masterpiece. Instead of selling the entire painting, you could sell digital ownership fractions to buyers across the globe. That’s the kind of flexibility Qubetics brings to the table. And it’s not just for the ultra-wealthy. Small business owners can use Qubetics to unlock value from their physical assets, while individuals can invest in tokenised assets that were once out of reach. Whether you’re an entrepreneur looking to expand or a young professional wanting to diversify your portfolio, Qubetics is creating a world where you don’t need to be a millionaire to play the big leagues. Now, let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in its 11th presale stage, and the buzz is unreal. Over 275 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, raising more than $4.6 million from 6,800+ holders. And those who jumped in early? They’re already seeing gains. $TICS tokens were priced at $0.025 in the 10th stage, and now they’re at $0.0282—a solid 10% increase. Analysts predict the token could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a whopping 776% ROI. But that’s just the start. Post-launch, $TICS could reach $1, $5, or even $15, turning modest investments into small fortunes. Think about it: if you invest $10,000 at today’s price of $0.0282, you’d snag 354,609 $TICS tokens. At $1, your investment grows to $354,609. And at $15? You’re looking at a life-changing $5.3 million. That’s not just a win—that’s legendary. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Because it’s not just a token—it’s a tool for the future, solving real-world problems in a way no other project has managed to do. Polygon: The Layer-2 Powerhouse That Changed the Game Let’s switch gears and talk about Polygon. If you’ve been in crypto for any amount of time, you’ve probably heard about this Layer-2 scaling solution that’s made Ethereum’s clunky transaction fees and slow speeds a thing of the past. Polygon didn’t just improve Ethereum—it supercharged it. Back in the day, Ethereum’s high gas fees were driving users and developers away. Enter Polygon. With its ability to process thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost, it became the go-to solution for developers building decentralised apps (dApps), NFT platforms, and DeFi protocols. It’s like the Robin Hood of crypto—taking from the inefficiencies of Ethereum and giving power back to the people. And the world noticed. Polygon has partnered with some of the biggest brands out there—think Starbucks, Adidas, Disney, and Reddit. These partnerships aren’t just PR stunts; they’re real-world use cases that cement Polygon’s place as a foundational piece of Web3 infrastructure. But here’s the thing: while Polygon has seen explosive growth, its days of life-changing ROI may be behind it. If you snagged MATIC back in 2020 when it was trading at under a penny, congratulations—you’re probably sitting on a fortune. Today, though, MATIC hovers around $0.85–$1. For new investors, it’s still a solid play, but the 10,000% gains? Those are in the rearview. Let’s break it down. A $10,000 investment in MATIC today might double or triple in value over time, but it’s unlikely to deliver the astronomical returns we’ve seen in the past. It’s a safer bet for those looking for stability, but for investors chasing the best crypto to buy for high-risk, high-reward gains, Polygon may not scratch that itch anymore. Why did Polygon make it to this list? Because it’s still a rock-solid project with a proven track record. It may not be the next moonshot, but it’s a cornerstone of the blockchain world. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now So, where does this leave us? If you’re looking for stability and long-term growth, Polygon remains a smart choice. But if you’re after a coin with the potential to deliver life-changing returns, Qubetics ($TICS) is where you should be focusing your attention. Qubetics isn’t just another token in a sea of thousands. It’s a visionary project that’s bringing blockchain into the real world in ways we’ve only dreamed of. With its focus on real-world asset tokenisation, Qubetics is unlocking new opportunities for businesses, investors, and everyday people alike. And the timing couldn’t be better. The presale is heating up, the price is still accessible, and the potential ROI is off the charts. Don’t wait until $TICS is trading at $1, $5, or $15 to realise you should’ve jumped in earlier. This is your chance to catch the next big wave before it’s gone. The best crypto to buy isn’t going to wait for you. Head over to Qubetics now and secure your slice of the future before the price climbs again. Don’t just watch the crypto market evolve—be a part of the revolution.

As is the tradition with the cryptocurrency exchange, a seed tag will be attached to the listing. For context, tokens with seed tags may have a different product or user base than established digital assets. Hence, Binance tries to notify its users of such tokens’ high volatility and potential trading risks. Users must pass a risk-awareness quiz every 90 days to continue trading ACX and ORCA. Also, they must periodically reaffirm their agreement with Binance’s Terms of Use. Price of ACX And ORCA Spikes by 3 Digits According to the announcement, ACX and ORCA trading will commence today, December 6, at 13:00 UTC with the spot trading pairs ACX/USDT and ORCA/USDT. A deposit for both tokens is now available in preparation for the trading session. Withdrawals will be open on December 7, 2024. The listing news has triggered some price gain for the tokens and the broader crypto market rebound . At the time of this writing, ACX had recorded a 106.84% increase in price and traded at $1.24. Its trading volume soared past $182 million and is 3,547.45% higher, at $149.2 million. Similarly, ORCA’s price has hit $8.78, corresponding with a 124.27% increase in the last 24 hours per CoinMarketCap data. Its trading volume is 2467.45% higher than its previous level. Understanding Across Protocol And Its Operations Across Protocol is an Ethereum-based optimistic insured bridge allowing seamless token transfers between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks. It utilizes a decentralized network of relayers that fund user deposits. Liquidity providers secure this in a single pool on Ethereum. Refunds are processed using UMA’s Optimistic Oracle. The aim is to balance cost efficiency, security, and user transaction speed. ORCA And its Benefits to Developers ORCA is a decentralized exchange (DEX) native to the Solana blockchain. Its core focus is on efficient token swaps within the ecosystem. It is more of a general-purpose Automated Market Maker (AMM) that is a versatile developer tool. With Orca, users can swap assets, provide liquidity, and earn yield through a user-friendly interface. In like manner, developers’ projects can integrate Orca’s swapping, farming, and on-chain data capabilities directly into their decentralized applications.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 23:55:00

Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) surge toward $3 as analysts point to IntelMarkets (INTL) as the next altcoin to breakout. Table of Contents Double bottom pattern breakout might push XRP to $3.6 Cardano could ride historical trend to $3 INTL set for massive rally with AI and trading fusion Conclusion The crypto market has witnessed massive price breakouts from Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) in the last month. These altcoins were among the low-performing coins a few months ago but have recently crossed the $1 mark, aiming to ride the bullish wave to $3. Meanwhile, a relatively new token called IntelMarkets (INTL) is steadily getting the attention of experts. Given its upcoming AI-based trading platform and advanced tools, the experts forecast IntelMarkets could be the next coin to explode. Double bottom pattern breakout might push XRP to $3.6 After feeling the heat of the US SEC’s lawsuit for years, XRP has finally taken flight. The cryptocurrency has pumped from a low of $0.50 to a peak of $2.82 in the last 30 days. Such movement translates to a price increase of 464%. XRP has even outperformed Ethereum and Bitcoin. Moreover, analysts believe the rally is not over yet. They believe Ripple winning the Ripple-SEC lawsuit could kickstart another bull run. Javon Marks predicts the XRP price might pump to $3.317 in the short term before skyrocketing to $99. Another analyst, Random Crypto Pal, noted that the Ripple token had formed a double bottom pattern on the monthly chart. He suggested that a breakout above the neckline could send the altcoin to $3.6. XRP’s technical indicators also support the uptrend. The VWMA and Hull Moving Averages are displaying buy signals.

The altcoin that has been on a rally in the past week but failed to cross this level despite the bullish momentum in the market. This means there are a large number of sellers at this level. However, the Cardano price chart shows its value has jumped by 27.0% in the weekly timeframe, 57.7% on the biweekly, and 258.9% on the monthly timeframe. Additionally, the Cardano network hit a transaction speed of 1 million TPS running on Hydra. This massive increase in speed bodes well for the blockchain and ADA. Rekt Capital predicts the value of ADA could skyrocket to $3 based on historical trends. According to him, the cryptocurrency’s price will be pumped to this target after surpassing $1.72. INTL set for massive rally with AI and trading fusion IntelMarkets has attracted investors’ attention with its transformative approach to introducing AI and blockchain to the crypto trading market. IntelMarkets will include a flagship tool called Rodeum AI-based trading bots. These self-learning Intelli-M™ bots will be capable of modifying their performance depending on the existing market conditions. The bots will help traders deploy their algorithms, set parameters, including risks and leverage, and trade more effectively without active monitoring. IntelMarkets will also have a dual-chain architecture. This means it will function on Ethereum or Solana, allowing traders to choose which blockchain to use. Ethereum is known for its highly developed DeFi space, while Solana offers faster and cheaper transactions IntelMarkets is currently trading at $0.064091. With its exciting features, IntelMarkets could become the new face of crypto trading, with experts predicting a 10x pump in the coming months. Conclusion XRP and ADA could rise to $3 in the coming weeks given the bullish sentiments surrounding them. Meanwhile, IntelMarkets is generating traction in the market even while in its ICO. Analysts say this new altcoin could be the blue-chip crypto the market is looking for. For more about IntelMarkets, visit their website , Telegram , or Twitter .

If you’re kicking yourself for missing out on the Book of Meme hype, trust me, you’re not alone. But hey, here’s the thing about crypto: there’s always a new train pulling into the station, and this one might be even bigger. Meet BTFD Coin ($BTFD) , the latest project riding the meme coin frenzy, but with way more substance than your average joke token. With a killer Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, juicy staking rewards, and a growing squad of investors (aka “The Bulls”), BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Meme coins are all about FOMO, right? Well, BTFD is bringing the heat with a presale that’s already raising eyebrows (and funds). Whether you’re a crypto newbie or a seasoned hodler looking for the best meme coin presale to join today, this might just be the ticket you’ve been waiting for. BTFD Coin: Play. Stake. Earn. Repeat. Let’s be real: meme coins are a dime a dozen these days. Most of them are all bark and no bite, promising big returns but delivering… nothing. BTFD Coin is breaking that mould by giving investors something tangible to get excited about. It’s not just a coin—it’s a whole ecosystem designed to keep the hype alive long after the presale ends. First up, let’s talk about the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game . This isn’t some clunky retro game thrown together to tick a marketing box. It’s a full-on gaming platform where players can earn $BTFD coins by competing in challenges and leveling up their avatars. Picture this: you’re chilling at home, gaming away, and stacking up real crypto rewards. It’s like turning your lazy Sunday gaming sessions into a side hustle. Not bad, huh? But that’s not all. BTFD also offers staking rewards that’ll blow your mind. With an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that’s ridiculously competitive, investors can park their coins, sit back, and watch their stash grow over time. It’s perfect for those who want to earn passive income while staying loyal to the Bulls Squad—the growing community of $BTFD holders rallying behind this project. Now, let’s get to the juicy numbers. BTFD launched its presale at just $0.000004 per coin, and it’s already climbed to $0.000064 in its 7th stage. Over 23 billion $BTFD coins have been sold, raising more than $1.1 million in under 10 days. Analysts are predicting that BTFD will list at $0.0006 after the presale wraps up, offering early investors insane ROI. Here’s an example: if you threw down $5,000 during Stage 5 when the coin was priced at $0.00005, you’d have snagged 100 million $BTFD coins. At the listing price of $0.0006, your investment would be worth $60,000. That’s a cool $55,000 in pure profit. Let that sink in. Why did BTFD Coin make it to this list? Because it’s more than just hype—it’s offering real value through its P2E game, staking rewards, and an ever-growing community that’s just getting started. Book of Meme: The OG of Meme Coin Innovation Now, let’s switch gears and talk about Book of Meme. If you’ve been following the meme coin scene, you’ve probably seen this name popping up everywhere. And for good reason—it’s one of the most creative projects to come out of the meme coin craze. With its clever branding and cult-like following, Book of Meme has carved out a space that’s equal parts nostalgic and forward-thinking. The appeal of Book of Meme lies in its lore. The creators took the internet’s obsession with meme culture and turned it into a full-blown mythology. Each token is like a page in the “book,” and holders become part of a community-driven story that evolves over time. It’s like Pokémon cards for the crypto generation—collectible, fun, and weirdly addictive. But here’s where it gets interesting: Book of Meme isn’t just about memes. It’s also a hub for NFT collectors and artists, offering a marketplace where users can trade digital collectibles inspired by the project’s universe. Think of it as a crossover between Dogecoin’s humour and Ethereum’s utility. It’s no wonder the token gained traction so quickly, skyrocketing in value and making early investors a hefty profit. The downside? If you didn’t grab Book of Meme early, you’ve likely missed the boat. While it’s still a strong project with a dedicated community, the explosive growth phase might already be behind us. Today, Book of Meme is more about maintaining its legacy than delivering 100x returns. For new investors, it’s a safe play, but it doesn’t quite have the same “to the moon” potential as BTFD Coin. Why did Book of Meme make it to this list? Because it’s a trailblazer in the meme coin space, proving that these tokens can have staying power and cultural impact. Conclusion So, what’s the verdict? If you’re chasing the nostalgia of meme coin OGs, Book of Meme is a solid choice. But if you’re hunting for the best meme coin presale to join today, the crown clearly belongs to BTFD Coin . BTFD isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s reinventing it. With a P2E game that’s already drawing buzz, staking rewards that are hard to ignore, and a presale price that’s still a steal, BTFD is primed for massive growth. The Bulls Squad is growing every day, and with over $1 million raised in just 10 days, it’s clear this project has momentum. Crypto is all about timing, and right now, the time to act is now . Don’t wait until BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 to wish you’d jumped in earlier. Sign up for the presale today and lock in your chance to turn a small investment into something life-changing. The best meme coin presale to join today isn’t going to wait for you. Be part of the Bulls Squad before it’s too late.

37310617,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658433,1733531455,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Dogecoin Still In Consolidation – Analyst Expects $0,63 If We Get A Breakout",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-still-in-consolidation-analyst-expects-063-if-we-get-a-breakout/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has been stuck in a range for nearly a month, struggling to break above the $0.44 resistance level. Despite multiple attempts, the price has yet to reclaim the $0.48 local high set in November. This prolonged consolidation has kept traders and investors on edge as they await a decisive breakout to signal the next major move for the popular meme coin. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week? Top investor Carl Runefelt recently shared his technical analysis on X, highlighting that DOGE is still trading within a bullish pattern. He says this consolidation phase is part of a broader setup that could lead to significant gains. Runefelt remains optimistic, stating that once Dogecoin breaks out of its current range, it could initiate a rally to new highs. Dogecoin’s price action is closely tied to broader market dynamics, especially Bitcoin’s performance, which recently surged above $100,000. As altcoins often follow Bitcoin’s lead, many speculate that DOGE could be on the verge of a major breakout. However, until DOGE surpasses key resistance levels, the market remains cautious. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Dogecoin can break free from its range and resume its upward trajectory. Dogecoin Still In Consolidation Since November 12, Dogecoin has remained in a consolidation range, leaving traders uncertain about its next major move. Despite an impressive rally earlier this cycle, culminating in a local high of $0.48 on November 23, the meme coin has struggled to break above this level. Instead, it continues to trade sideways, testing the patience of investors and analysts alike. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the formation of a bullish pattern within Dogecoin’s price action. According to Runefelt, DOGE’s extended consolidation could be a precursor to an explosive breakout. He notes that if DOGE breaks out of its current range, it could target as high as $0.6350. However, he also cautions that this scenario could take time to materialize, as Dogecoin has historically required significant patience from its investors during similar consolidation phases. Related Reading: $1.87B Bitcoin Withdrawals From Coinbase In 24H – What This Means To Price While the current price action may appear indecisive, DOGE has proven in the past that its breakouts are often aggressive and substantial once they occur. With Bitcoin leading the market above the $100K level, altcoins like DOGE are expected to follow suit eventually. All eyes remain on key resistance levels as traders await confirmation of Dogecoin’s next move. DOGE Struggles To Break Key Levels Dogecoin trades at $0.423, reflecting weeks of peculiar and sluggish price action. Despite its impressive performance earlier in the month, with a 220% surge since November 5, DOGE now appears to be in a cooling-off phase. The price has repeatedly tested the $0.44 level but has failed to achieve a daily close above it, leaving traders and analysts watching closely for a potential breakout. A daily close above $0.44 would likely trigger a significant rally, as this level is a key resistance and psychological barrier for the market. However, such a breakout may require time, given Dogecoin’s massive run earlier in the month. Markets often consolidate after such explosive moves, allowing for profit-taking and the absorption of sell pressure before the next leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Supported By All-Stablecoins Cash Inflow – Data Reveals Strong Correlation Despite the slow pace, DOGE’s long-term momentum remains promising. Investors are eyeing its potential to reclaim bullish energy and push toward higher levels. Until then, patience is key as Dogecoin builds the foundation for its next significant move. The $0.44 level remains critical, serving as a signal of renewed strength if DOGE can finally break through and establish it as support.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 00:41:12

As its momentum rises, investors are seeking another altcoin with high growth potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a tokenization real estate platform, is ranking among the best bets due to its low entry price and upside potential. XRP price eyes $3, flips Solana The hot streak for the XRP price has continued after hitting a new multi-year of $2.82. The Ripple coin flipped Solana and Tether to become the third-largest digital asset by market cap. As Gary Gensler prepares to leave the SEC, the agency’s lawsuit’s impact on Ripple diminishes. This is helping the XRP price gain ground. The recent reports that President-elect Donald Trump’s team plans to shift crypto regulation from the SEC to the CFTC could mark another big win for the XRP price. After such an impressive rally and potential catalysts on the horizon, investors look forward to the XRP price reaching $3.

PropiChain is set to rise 200% when its token presale progresses from the first stage to the next. When the presale concludes, early investors will enjoy 800% gains. These gains will come before PCHAIN is listed on secondary exchanges. PropiChain also offers staking rewards of up to 225% APR to incentivize long-term holders. AI is at the heart of PropiChain. Its Automated valuation models (AVMs) will give users access to fair and transparent property appraisals. This means buyers and sellers will get to quickly agree on the fair prices of properties. With predictive market analysis , users will get specialized market analysis to make informed investment decisions. The platform’s AI-driven property filter feature will allow users to search for properties based on their preferred parameters. The core offering is tokenization and fractional ownership . This feature will enable retail traders to own pieces of high-end properties worldwide. This could not have been possible in traditional real estate investing. Finally, PropiChain relies on the metaverse for remote property viewing. Gone are the days when geographic barriers hindered real estate investments. XRP vs PCHAIN The XRP price is marching toward $3 as its rally continues. This means the room for massive gains might be gone, except for those who caught the altcoin early. On the other hand, PropiChain is a new altcoin that offers a potentially profitable investment opportunity through its presale. PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap and completed its smart contract verification with blockchain security firm BlockAudit. The project also has staking rewards for long-term holders, providing another income stream while helping PCHAIN’s value appreciate. PropiChain is using novel technologies to simplify and enhance property management and investment. The altcoin has the potential to surge by 39,504%, converting a $1,000 investment into nearly $400,000. For more information about PropiChain, visit their website or online community .

Key players such as Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have fallen under downward pressure. SOL and SHIB cannot catch a break as they are struggling to maintain their bullish momentum, yet a new player, DTX Exchange , has entered the blockchain world and raised a whopping $9.4 million in its presale. DTX Exchange: The Rising Crypto Star Raises $9,400,000 DTX Exchange (DTX) has stolen the spotlight from SOL and SHIB. Recently, DTX made rounds as early backers experienced a 500% increase in their investment. By raising more than $9.4 million, DTX Exchange is one of the fastest-growing crypto projects. One of the main reasons of the project’s presale success is the DTX’s innovative hybrid exchange model that combines the best features of both centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). Additionally, the DTX platform is running a $1,000,000 giveaway , where anyone who deposits at least $100 has a chance to win. By completing tasks, users increase their chances of winning the grand prize. Having the potential to shake up the $3.2 billion global trading market, DTX Exchange is a one-stop shop connecting TradFi and DeFi. DTX is powered by its own proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX, which provides a frictionless trading experience across stocks, forex, commodities, and cryptocurrency, facilitating trading for over 120,000 asset classes. The innovative hybrid approach, extremely high potential upside, and growing number of investors have put DTX Exchange among the most exciting ICOs this year. Solana (SOL): Bears Take Over After Solana (SOL) hit a new all-time high, it has failed to maintain momentum. Once touted as a formidable Layer 1 blockchain contender, in recent weeks Solana has been facing some corrections. Following a bullish run, SOL’s price has taken a pull back, falling through key support of $250. Solana is priced at $241 today, after a steady downtrend following its peak at $263 this November. Although high transaction speed and high scalability are still driving factors behind the adoption of the platform, issues such as network outages and reduced institutional interest have already reduced investor enthusiasm. While Solana’s fundamentals are strong, the bears are starting to take over. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Coin Fails to Recover Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB), the meme coin that mesmerized investors with its parabolic rise, is having a similar experience. SHIB’s price soared to impressive highs in 2021 but then cooled down considerably. Now, SHIB is trading at $0.000031, a 60% decrease from its all-time high of $0.000088. The legacy of SHIB demonstrated to the crypto and meme coin community that it is possible to pivot to a utility based ecosystem. Even with Shiba Inu’s ability to create a loyal community and to attract meme hype, its growth has been stale. Although the popularity of the Shiba Inu ecosystem is gaining attention, including Shibarium and ShibaSwap, the price of the SHIB has failed to recover previous highs. Conclusion The crypto market is a battleground between bulls and bears, but in this round DTX Exchange was a clear winner. SOL and SHIB both face downward pressure, but the hybrid exchange model and explosive growth prospects of DTX Exchange make it a token to follow. DTX offers a chance to invest in the future of trading, a promise to catch the next wave of innovation.

Even though he sold most of his PEPE early on, he turned $70.40 into $7.06 million – a return of over 100,000x.” Lookonchain also noticed other large Pepe holders realizing massive profits this week. One Pepe trader was spotted realizing a gain of more than 3,018%. “After holding for over a year, this trader turned $241,500 into $7.53 million! This trader withdrew 375.65 billion PEPE ($241,500 at that time) from Gemini on Sept 20th, 2023, and sold 19.55 billion PEPE for $244,000 between February 17th and September 26th this year. [On Tuesday], he deposited the remaining 356.1 billion PEPE ($7.28 million) into Kraken.” Another Pepe trader realized $1.31 million in profits. “A whale bought 240 billion PEPE ($3.64 million) at a high price on May 29th, and the price of PEPE dropped afterward. But instead of panic selling, he held on for six months. [On Wednesday], he sold his 240 billion PEPE ($4.95 million), making a profit of $1.31 million!” Despite the profit taking, Lookonchain notices massive buying is still happening by deep-pocketed investors. “Whales continue to accumulate PEPE! A whale has withdrawn 337.09 billion PEPE ($6.92 million) from Binance in the past 20 days.” PEPE is trading for $0.00002113 at time of writing, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

Retired therapist Judith Boivin lost about $600,000 after scammers made her believe she was an integral part of an undercover government operation, reports The Washington Post. Boivin says the bad actors made her believe she was working on a mission with the FBI to take down a Mexican cartel involved in selling illegal drugs and money laundering. When Boivin visited Morgan Stanley to take out her nest egg, employees of the bank immediately became suspicious. One investigator told her that she was likely a victim of an elaborate fraud. “If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck.” But Boivin says she stuck to a script given to her by the scammers, who coached her to write a letter stating the bank should release her funds. “This is a decision I am making while in sound mind and after celebrating my 79th birthday and beginning my 80th year of life, I wish to have full control of my finances at this time.” Once Morgan Stanley released her money, Boivin was told to split the funds and deposit it in new Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank and TD Bank accounts. To avoid raising suspicion, she then withdrew $10,000 to $20,000 from those accounts per visit. Boivin says she delivered most of her cash inside a brown paper to couriers at a nearby parking lot, believing the FBI was keeping watch. Morgan Stanley says Boivin couldn’t be dissuaded even though the bank took several steps to keep her from losing her funds to fraud, including putting a brief hold on her account and notifying a family member and the authorities. JPMorgan says branch staff urged her to reconsider. “Despite several attempts to get her to reconsider, she told our branch staff she needed the money for a business venture. She later acknowledged she was coached by the scammers on what to say to our bankers. The best way to avoid these types of scams is to ignore requests for money from people you don’t know.” Capital One, PNC and TD Bank say they can’t make specific comments on Boivin’s case.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

33767162,[object Object],1733536833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Creator Dead? Novogratz Stirs Debate Over Satoshi Nakamoto’s Fate,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-creator-dead-novogratz-stirs-debate-satoshi/,"In a December 5 appearance on CNBC’s “The Exchange,” Galaxy CEO and founder Mike Novogratz offered insights into Bitcoin’s meteoric rise while making a striking comment that has reignited curiosity about the mysterious figure behind it all: Satoshi Nakamoto. A Historic Milestone For Bitcoin With Bitcoin hitting the symbolic $100,000 milestone —an extraordinary ascent from a concept in a white paper just 15 years ago—Novogratz took a moment to pay tribute to the community that has driven the digital asset’s adoption. He emphasized the grassroots nature of Bitcoin’s growth, stating: “If Satoshi was alive, because I don’t think he is, I’m sure he would have a big smile on his face.” This remark, delivered in a matter-of-fact tone, underscores the enduring enigma of BTC’s pseudonymous creator. While Satoshi’s identity has never been confirmed, the suggestion of his death is a topic rarely addressed so directly by high-profile industry figures. “It’s a great technology, and really the social construct that people learn to understand each other. In a lot of ways, this is the greatest example of a broad-based coalition of people coming together to do something spectacular. Before we talk about price, I want to recognize the moment $2 trillion asset in 15 years, coming out of a guy’s idea is pretty stinking spectacular,” the Galaxy CEO added. Novogratz, an early investor in Bitcoin, discussed the immense wealth generated by digital assets. He described the last three months as potentially “the single greatest wealth gain for 25 to 45-year-olds in history” due to the doubling of BTC prices. The CEO underscored the importance of this generational shift in wealth, asserting that it would have real economic impact: “22, 23% of wealth shocks gets spent in consumption… people are going to be buying houses and cars… It will be interesting to see if the Fed has an input of an increase in consumption from this massive wealth gain.” Novogratz also acknowledged the unwavering conviction of many crypto holders, noting that even those who have accrued substantial gains remain reluctant to sell. He framed Bitcoin as deeply tied to belief systems rather than mere asset allocation: “It’s a belief system more so, even than a financial asset for a lot of people.” While lauding Bitcoin’s global, coalition-based growth, he cautioned that volatility is inevitable. High leverage in the markets, he said, all but guarantees challenging moments ahead: “I can guarantee all your listeners, there will be at least one, if not two, vicious retracements which will test your soul.” Moving to the policy landscape, Novogratz spoke optimistically about the incoming US administration ’s regulatory approach. He portrayed the last period as one of “four years of horrible regulation,” asserting that the Trump administration and regulatory appointments could support growth and innovation in the digital asset sector. He concluded: “we have a president now, like him or not, he is great for the crypto industry. He said early on he was going to be a crypto president, a Bitcoin president, a cabinet full of believers, full of people that are low on crypto.” At press time, BTC traded at $97,587.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Galaxy Digital CEO|mike novogratz|Satoshi Nakamoto,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-07 02:00:33

Key technical indicators now suggest the cryptocurrency has entered overbought territory, sparking speculation about whether a pullback could be on the horizon. While the recent rally reflects strong bullish momentum, the market may be approaching a critical juncture. Can SUI maintain its upward streak, or is a price correction inevitable? As of writing, SUI has surged over 10%, reaching a price of $4.23 in the past 24 hours. This movement has boosted its market capitalization to over $12 billion, with trading volume exceeding $5.5 billion, indicating strong investor interest and market activity. Technical Analysis: Indicators Hint At Overbought Conditions SUI’s price on the 4-hour chart is beginning to exhibit bearish signals, with a noticeable decline toward the $4 support level and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This downward movement is underscored by the formation of a bearish candlestick, suggesting growing selling pressure in the market. A sustained drop below these levels could signal a broader trend reversal, making this a pivotal moment for its price action. Additionally, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for SUI is flashing an overbought condition, highlighting the asset’s recent robust upside pressure. Typically, an overbought reading suggests that the price has risen rapidly within a short period, potentially leading to market exhaustion as buyers begin to lose strength. Related Reading: SUI In Bear Territory: RSI Drop Suggests Further Downside Risk This condition often serves as a cautionary signal for traders, indicating the possibility of a price correction or a consolidation phase as the market seeks to regain equilibrium. If the overbought pressure persists, SUI could face challenges maintaining its current levels. Key Support Levels To Watch If A Pullback Occurs If SUI experiences a pullback, monitoring critical support levels that could provide stability is essential. Presently, the $4 mark stands out as a key level, reinforced by its alignment with the 100-day SMA. A dip below this support might trigger further declines, with support zones near $3.75 and $3.50 acting as potential cushions. These levels are crucial in determining whether the pullback will be temporary or evolve into a more extended bearish phase.

Filecoin’s recent price targets have sparked curiosity, while Immutable X’s strategic moves have captured the attention of blockchain enthusiasts. But wait, there’s more—Qubetics has emerged as a dark horse, smashing through presale milestones. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project. It’s tackling real-world financial headaches with its innovative non-custodial wallet. While others leave users at the mercy of third parties, Qubetics is empowering them with true control. But can it really deliver on its bold promises? Let’s dive into these three projects and see why they’re the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Non-Custodial Wallets Qubetics has been making headlines for all the right reasons. With over $4.6 million raised in its presale and a price sitting at just $0.0282, this project is turning heads. Currently in its 11th stage, it has already attracted over 6,800 token holders and sold 275 million $TICS tokens. Analysts are even predicting a price surge to $10-15 after its mainnet launch. But what makes Qubetics stand out? One word: freedom. Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet is a game-changer. Unlike custodial wallets, which force users to rely on third parties, Qubetics gives you full control over your assets. Imagine not having to worry about hacks or sudden freezes on your funds. Sounds like a dream, right? The crypto world has seen its fair share of issues due to custodial wallets. Security breaches, regulatory clampdowns, and the inability to access your own money are just the tip of the iceberg. For example, reports show that millions of dollars are lost annually to custodial wallet hacks. Privacy concerns? You bet. Every transaction you make gets tracked. Qubetics aims to fix all this by giving users the tools to be their own bank. Let’s talk numbers. If you invest $1,000 in $TICS at $0.0282 today, you’d get around 35,460 tokens. If analysts’ predictions hold true and the price hits $10 post-launch, that investment could soar to $354,600. Crazy, right? The FOMO is real, and for good reason. For more guidance, watch this video . Filecoin: Storing the Future Filecoin has always been about decentralised storage, and it’s not slowing down. The buzz around its latest price target of $10 has rekindled interest among crypto fans. This project allows users to rent out storage space in exchange for FIL tokens, making it a pioneer in blockchain storage solutions. Filecoin’s infrastructure isn’t just about storage; it’s about creating a network that’s resilient, decentralised, and accessible. As data breaches and server outages continue to plague traditional systems, Filecoin offers a safer alternative. It’s no wonder the project is gaining traction again. Recent developments, like its partnerships and integrations, have boosted confidence in its potential. The $10 price target might seem ambitious, but it’s achievable given the project’s utility and adoption rate. Immutable X: Redefining NFTs and Gaming Immutable X has carved out a niche for itself in the NFT and gaming space. As a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, it offers gas-free transactions and near-instant execution. It’s a godsend for NFT creators and traders who’ve been struggling with Ethereum’s high fees and congestion. The project’s collaboration with gaming studios and marketplaces has positioned it as a leader in blockchain gaming. With more games adopting Immutable X’s technology, the ecosystem is growing rapidly. Plus, its environmental focus resonates with younger investors who value sustainability. The market buzz suggests Immutable X is poised for a breakout. Its focus on usability, combined with its NFT-centric approach, makes it a strong contender for the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Immutable X’s price trajectory suggests plenty of room for growth. An early $1,000 investment could yield significant returns as the project gains adoption in the gaming and NFT sectors. Imagine being part of the next big thing in digital collectibles and entertainment. Exciting, isn’t it? Conclusion While Filecoin and Immutable X are impressive in their own right, Qubetics’ potential is simply unmatched. Its non-custodial wallet addresses issues that have plagued the crypto world for years, offering a level of security and independence that others can’t. And with analysts predicting a massive price surge, the opportunity for life-changing returns is hard to ignore. So, what are you waiting for? The best cryptos to invest in December 2024 are here, and Qubetics is leading the pack. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this game-changing project. Invest now and secure your financial future.

If you’ve been watching the markets, you’ll know that December’s looking like a golden opportunity for smart investors. Whether you’re in Vancouver or Halifax, it’s time to grab a double-double and tune in because we’ve got the best cryptos to join in December 2024. We’re talking about Qubetics smashing through the presale ceiling with 275 million $TICS sold, Toncoin setting its sights on $7, and Render holding the spotlight with a bullish $25 prediction for 2025. Each of these coins has its own unique vibe, but all of them are on the up and up. So, let’s dive in, shall we? Qubetics: A Presale to Remember and Unmissable Features Qubetics is the hot ticket in town, man. This rising star has sold a jaw-dropping 275 million $TICS tokens during its presale phase, raising serious eyebrows (and funds) in the crypto space. Its ecosystem isn’t just innovative; it’s downright revolutionary. Think about it: seamless cross-chain compatibility, an ultra-secure decentralised VPN , and the ability to monetise idle bandwidth. That’s not just tech; that’s convenience wrapped in a $TICS bow. Canadians love practical solutions, and Qubetics delivers. Imagine using your spare internet bandwidth to earn passive income—pretty slick, eh? And with the presale price currently sitting at $0.0282, it’s a bargain. Let’s do some quick maths: $500 gets you around 17,730 $TICS. Analysts are predicting $TICS could hit $15 after the mainnet launch. If that happens, your $500 turns into $265,950. That’s like winning the 649, but better! If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to join in December 2024, Qubetics is as good as it gets. With innovation, growth potential, and FOMO-worthy buzz, this coin’s a no-brainer. Watch this video for more information. Toncoin: Steady as She Goes Toncoin might not have the flash of Qubetics, but it’s no slouch either. With its blockchain roots in Telegram’s Open Network (TON), this coin has carved out a niche for itself as a payment solution with serious scalability chops. As of now, Toncoin is trading around $6.89, but it’s eyeing the $7 mark. What’s fuelling the hype? Well, Toncoin has been gaining traction as Telegram integrates TON-based features into its messaging app. This seamless fusion of social and financial services is exactly the kind of thing that appeals to Canada’s tech-savvy crowd. Plus, its user-friendly payment system makes it perfect for global transfers—no more fretting about e-transfers and fees. While it doesn’t offer the insane ROI potential of Qubetics, Toncoin is a reliable bet for steady growth. It’s the crypto equivalent of that trusty old snowblower in your garage—dependable and always ready to perform. Render: The Artist’s Best Tech Friend If you’re into cutting-edge tech, Render’s where it’s at. This decentralised rendering platform is changing the game for creators, giving them access to GPU power like never before. For a country full of creative talent (hello, Toronto Film Festival!), Render is a project that resonates. Currently trading at $10.58, Render has analysts predicting a leap to $25 by 2025. That’s almost a 136.2% increase in just a few months. Why the optimism? The platform’s ability to streamline CGI and 3D rendering processes makes it a go-to for artists and studios worldwide. It’s like having a Timbit-sized investment that could grow into a full-on doughnut empire. Render isn’t just for the artsy types, though. With its use of blockchain to decentralise the rendering process, it’s also a tech marvel. Whether you’re an animator in Montreal or a gamer in Edmonton, Render’s potential has something for everyone. Why Qubetics Is a No-Brainer for December 2024 Let’s be real for a sec. Toncoin’s solid, and Render’s impressive, but Qubetics is in a league of its own. It’s not just about the presale success or the innovative features; it’s about the vision. Qubetics is creating an ecosystem that’s practical, profitable, and future-proof. The ROI projections are off the charts, and the buzz around the project is growing faster than a Tim Hortons queue in the morning. If you’re serious about finding the best cryptos to join in December 2024, Qubetics isn’t just an option—it’s the option. Wrap-Up: Don’t Miss Out December’s crypto market is serving up some serious opportunities, but you’ve got to act fast. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ presale momentum, Toncoin’s steady rise, or Render’s creative revolution, there’s no shortage of options. But here’s the tea: Qubetics is the standout. With its game-changing ecosystem and mind-blowing ROI potential, it’s a chance to turn a few loonies into a full-blown fortune. Don’t wait until it’s yesterday’s news—get in now while the getting’s good. Time to make your move!

Yet many investors are paying more attention to Propichain (PCHAIN) , a new RWA tokenization asset focused on the real estate sector. Propichain’s (PCHAIN) ongoing presale already offers an 800% return to early holders. Read on to see why analysts say Propichain will outshine Cardano (ADA). Cardano (ADA) Holders Eye $2 by Late December Cardano has continued its mega price surge, becoming one of the fastest-growing altcoin assets in recent weeks. In the past month, November was extra bullish for the crypto industry, causing Cardano to grow by 263%. Cardano’s (ADA) current price is $1.21, its highest in the past two years. Interestingly, Cardano supporters expect its rally to continue till late December. They also expect Cardano (ADA) to reach $2, citing the current growth of its ecosystem. In addition, Cardano’s (ADA) price rally signals renewed investor confidence in blockchain innovations. However, many investors are also paying attention to Propichain, a groundbreaking real estate tokenization project with an ongoing presale that is already delivering an 800% return to early holders. Propichain: Using Cutting-Edge Technology To Create Investment Avenues in the Real Estate Sector Propichain (PCHAIN) capitalizes on Ethereum’s blockchain technology, asset tokenization, artificial intelligence, and metaverse services to create an investing ecosystem conducive to new and seasoned real estate participants. At the core of this ecosystem lies a groundbreaking approach: asset tokenization, which reshapes traditional real estate investing barriers. Unlike traditional markets, Propichain offers a budget-friendly ownership model. Here, investors purchase shares in housing assets that have been tokenized. These tokens allow investors to buy stakes in their desired asset for a fraction of the cost. With Propichain’s ownership model, no budget size is too low to become a real estate investor. While tokenization lowers financial barriers, effective investing requires informed decision-making, which Propichain addresses through AI-powered tools. It uses artificial intelligence to automate market research, property valuations, and trend assessments. This way, you can understand market sentiments in real-time. You also enjoy accurate, high-quality data that helps improve your decision-making. Propichain’s (PCHAIN) AI-powered investing tools also have automatic trading capabilities. Here, you can leverage buy or sell orders to secure deals in the future. With Propichain’s automatic trades, you can set guiding instructions for future buy or sell orders on your desired properties. When the specific conditions are met, the order is executed, allowing you to seize opportunities while taking a more hands-off investing approach. After equipping investors with insights through AI tools, Propichain (PCHAIN) bridges markets globally, offering smooth access to properties worldwide. With Propichain’s real estate marketplace, you can connect with investors on the other side. Using its virtual property tours, you can check out choice properties anywhere in the world from the comfort of your home. Imagine being an Asian first-time investor exploring a New York City penthouse through a lifelike virtual tour—Propichain’s metaverse services make such cross-border trades effortless and transparent. Propichain’s smart contracts ensure these global interactions translate into secure, efficient deals. Furthermore, they have the necessary customizability to allow investors to create tailored leasing and rental agreements. Propichain and Cardano (ADA): What Market Analysts are Saying Propichain’s (PCHAIN) innovative approach has transformed real estate investing and placed it alongside top-tier blockchain projects like Cardano. Beyond the allure of its real estate investing benefits, Propichain is also attracting investors to its ongoing presale with two distinct factors. Firstly, Propichain has shown that its network is secure via a security certificate from BlockAudit. This has eased investor fears about safety concerns. Propichain has also been listed on CoinMarketCap , showing investors that the project is here to stay. Analysts say these moves point to an extra bullish 2025 for Propichain, which could take $1,000 worth of PCHAIN to $60,000 in the next few months. PCHAIN’s Presale: Round One Holders to Earn 800% Interest With its robust ecosystem and proven market potential, Propichain’s ongoing presale presents a unique opportunity for early adopters to benefit. Even better, joining its ecosystem now offers the opportunity to buy PCHAIN at its lowest-ever price. PCHAIN is in round one of its presale, selling at $0.004. By round 2, current holders will earn a 208.17% increase as PCHAIN’s value will rise to $0.011. PCHAIN will stay bullish until it reaches its launch price of $0.032. This would translate to an 800% increase for round one PCHAIN holders. Join its presale today and secure your spot in the growth of its ecosystem.

Despite being up by more than 35 percent in the past week, the altcoin is yet to hit the ATH, which sits at $3.84. Majority of the top 10 altcoins are currently recording gains and Bitcoin is once again trading above the $100,000 mark. XRP has encountered strong resistance near the $3 mark, specifically around the 1618 Fibonacci extension at $3. Recently, XRP reached a high of just over $2.90, falling short of breaking the $3 barrier. This hints at significant selling pressure, and the price is likely to struggle around this level in the short term. Here’s a breakdown of price analysis by analyst Josh of Crypto World: Support Level Around $2 On the other hand, if XRP sees a pullback, support is expected at around $2. This level could act as a cushion for the price in case of further declines in the near future. XRP vs. Bitcoin: A Key Indicator Looking at the XRP/BTC chart, the price action suggests that XRP has reached a key resistance point when compared to Bitcoin. If this chart trends downward, it means Bitcoin is outperforming XRP. The analyst previously shared a strategy where XRP was swapped for Bitcoin, and those who followed it could have doubled their Bitcoin holdings. However, the recent resistance level indicates that the short-term rally in XRP/BTC could be coming to an end. Potential for Future Breakouts Despite the short-term resistance, the analyst pointed out that if the overall cryptocurrency market continues to grow, XRP could potentially break out against Bitcoin in the future. If XRP manages to surpass the current resistance levels, it could lead to a bullish trend.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 03:09:50

BTFD Coin’s Presale Brings High ROI to the Table,https://thecoinrise.com/lost-out-on-ponke-btfd-coins-presale-brings-high-roi-to-the-table/,"Over the years, meme coins have taken the crypto world by storm, offering a mix of laughter, community hype, and jaw-dropping returns. From Dogecoin’s rocket ride to Shiba Inu’s mind-blowing ascent, the meme coin movement has proven one thing: when the internet’s attention converges, magic happens. These coins aren’t just funny—they’re life-changing for the early birds. And now? It looks like another player is about to steal the spotlight. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD), a fresh contender in the meme coin arena. This isn’t your regular pump-and-dump coin ; BTFD blends fun with utility through its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking features, and a solid community dubbed the Bulls Squad. Analysts are already buzzing, and if history’s taught us anything, it’s this: early adopters often laugh all the way to the bank. But what about Ponke? This crypto has carved out its niche with its loyal fanbase and innovative features. With BTFD making waves and ponke holding steady, let’s dive into these two contenders to see who comes out on top in the race to become the best crypto to watch in 2024. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Meme Coin With Game-Changing Potential BTFD Coin isn’t just here to make you chuckle; it’s here to make you rich—or so the buzz says. This coin’s presale launched at a ridiculously low price of $0.000004 per coin on November 26, 2024. When the presale ends, the listing price will jump to $0.000064. That’s a whopping 15,000% ROI for those who get in early. And, spoiler alert: the excitement isn’t unwarranted. First up, let’s talk about the P2E game. Gamers can earn BTFD tokens while having a blast—yes, you can literally get paid to play. This feature alone taps into two booming markets: crypto and gaming. Then there’s the staking. With a generous Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that’s raising eyebrows (and heart rates), holders can earn passive income by simply locking up their coins. Add the Bulls Squad, a community-driven initiative that rewards engagement and loyalty, and you’ve got a recipe for a viral hit. Here’s a juicy example: Let’s say you invest $10,000 during the presale. When BTFD hits $0.0006, your stash could balloon to $1.1 million. Sound too good to be true? Maybe—but meme coins have pulled off crazier stunts. Analysts are projecting BTFD could outperform the usual suspects thanks to its multi-pronged approach. The FOMO is real—but don’t wait too long. Presales like these have a way of ending before you can blink, leaving latecomers gnashing their teeth. If you’ve ever felt the sting of missing out on a crypto moonshot, consider this your second chance. Ponke: The Old Guard of Meme Coins Now, let’s shift gears to ponke. While it’s not the shiny new kid on the block, ponke has earned its stripes. Known for its quirky branding and steadfast community, ponke has carved out its place in the crypto ecosystem. Unlike many meme coins, ponke isn’t just about the memes; it has actual utility. One of ponke’s standout features is its decentralized exchange (DEX), allowing users to swap tokens with ease. This has given ponke a utility edge, even as newer coins enter the fray. Its loyal community keeps the project alive, and let’s be honest—in crypto, community is king. But here’s the kicker: ponke’s growth has been more steady than explosive. While this makes it a safer bet, it doesn’t exactly scream “meme coin mania.” Analysts predict ponke will continue to hold its value, but the potential for a 15,000% ROI? That’s less likely. Sure, there’s room for growth, especially if it announces a groundbreaking update or partnership. But compared to BTFD, ponke feels like the safer, albeit less thrilling, option. If you’re a fan of slow and steady, ponke’s got your back. But if you’re looking for adrenaline-pumping gains, you might want to give BTFD a closer look. After all, the crypto market loves a good underdog story. Conclusion: Make the Most of This Wealth-Generation Opportunity So, here’s the deal: BTFD Coin is shaping up to be a serious contender for the best crypto to invest in this year. With its P2E game, high-yield staking, and an engaged community, it’s ticking all the right boxes. And let’s not forget that jaw-dropping 15,000% ROI promise. If you’ve ever wondered what it feels like to get in on the ground floor of a crypto sensation, this might just be your shot. ponke, on the other hand, remains a solid pick for those who value stability over moonshots. Its features and loyal fanbase make it a reliable choice, but the ROI potential doesn’t hold a candle to what BTFD is offering right now . Don’t let this wealth-generation opportunity slip through your fingers. The BTFD presale is live, but it won’t last forever. Secure your spot, invest wisely, and who knows? This time next year, you could be laughing all the way to the bank.

The investors have been waiting for over 3 years for LINK to break past $52. Even though the trading volume is low, market intelligence platform Santiment thinks it is time for the token to take a jump and create new history. Let’s analyse the market and explore what is going on and what we should be expecting from it. Technical Metrics Let’s start with the current price. At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading at $25.50 which is almost 50% gap from its current ATH at $52. The daily chart shows that there is no moving average nearby to support the price.The nearest MA is 20 that lies around $19.32. However, we might be able to see a golden cross over soon as MA 100 is ready to cross over MA 200. This gives us an idea that the strength is building up. Source : Coinglass RSI is at 74.24, so the asset is still below the overbought zone and has space for growth. This momentum is supported by the Average directional Index which is at 52.83. The histogram of MACD is displaying a remarkable buildup. Sometimes the bulls are getting tired but keeping the momentum. Market Sentiment According to the market intelligence platform Santiment, the market has low sentiment towards Chainlink as of now. This can be verified looking at the volume. The daily trading volume is down by 10.98% in the last 24 hours. Despite this the price surged by 8.47%. Chainlink has enjoyed a late-week rally, and now needs to climb just +10.8% to match its 3-year high from January, 2022. It is encouraging that there is very little retail FOMO toward LINK.

Whales Bet Big After Major Listings,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-pepe-coins-next-ath-around-the-corner-whales-bet-big-after-major-listings/,"Pepe is in the meme coin spotlight again. Binance.US and Coinbase, two of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, have added Pepe Coin to their trading platforms. Whales have been consuming enormous amounts of the token, generating ripples. Could this momentum take the meme coin to a new all-time high? Let’s investigate. Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP? You’re ‘Disrespecting’ Yourself Exchange Listings Generate Excitement Binance.US announced on December 5 that it would allow trading of Pepe Coin against Tether (USDT). It was not long before Coinbase followed suit, adding the token to its growing memecoin list. These listings are important because they make PEPE accessible to millions of investors. Accessibility often leads to an increase in trading volume, and this seems to be the case here. The effects are already apparent. The price of Pepe Coin has risen by 165% in the past month; currently, its market capitalization is at $9.15 billion. These milestones are undeniable indications that the coin is not just another transient meme but is garnering significant attention within the crypto community. Whales Place Significant Bets On Pepe The excitement is not only in the listings. By statistics, whales have bought 337 million tokens, valued at some $7 million. Such behavior usually reflects confidence in the possibility for a token to climb. Whales continue to accumulate $PEPE! A whale has withdrawn 337.09B $PEPE($6.92M) from #Binance in the past 20 days.https://t.co/65vbIQd2dd pic.twitter.com/79NauAQt8V — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 4, 2024 Currently trading at $0.0000217, PEPE is getting closer to its all-time high of $0.00002457. Technical indicators support this optimism: the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) shows continuous bullishness while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now at 62.45, indicating strong buying momentum. These signals taken with the presence of whales suggest short-term hope for the cryptocurrency. Investor interest now turns towards the strong level of resistance at $0.000028105. Should the coin breach past that point, it will probably try for the next line of resistance, at $0.000036003. Related Reading: No Sweat! Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst Is A New PEPE ATH On The Way? With all the excitement going on right now, a lot of people are interested in how the Pepe Coin could hit new heights. Its appeal has definitely grown since it was listed on several exchanges recently, and the backing of whales makes things even better. The narrative that the crypto asset could reach a new ATH is strengthened by the active participation of the community. However, it is not completely issue-free. Like other meme coins, Pepe is vulnerable to market volatility and speculative trading. Although the trends now seem promising, the investors need to be very careful as they navigate through this fast-changing market. The next few days will be critical as Pepe Coin approaches its ATH. It is certain that this diminutive frog-themed crypto will not be hopping out of the spotlight anytime soon, regardless of whether it bursts through resistance or consolidates further.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK.

This follows a volatile period where BTC had dropped to $92,000 after its all-time high. Ripple’s XRP has gained 6% after three consecutive days of downward movement. Meanwhile, XDC Network has emerged as the top gainer, with an impressive 36% jump in its price. The crypto market rose by over 2%, bringing its total market capitalization to $3.67 trillion. However, trading volume has decreased by 31%, standing at $250 billion. Here is a quick overview of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and their price movements for today, December 7. Crypto Prices Today: BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP The crypto market is gaining momentum after Bitcoin surged back to $100,000. Major altcoins have shown positive movement in the last 24 hours, except for Solana, which is down by 3%. Top meme coins are also riding the bullish wave, recording gains between 1% and 4% during the same period. The market’s overall sentiment appears optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies experiencing upward trends. Bitcoin Price Today Bitcoin (BTC) price was trading at $100,101, marking a 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $97,138 and $101,902, respectively. Bitcoin’s market capitalization stood at $1.98 trillion, with a trading volume of $86 billion and a market dominance of 53.87%. As per SoSo Value , the Bitcoin ETF market had seen significant inflows, with $119 million added on Friday, although BlackRock’s data was still awaited. Fidelity had contributed $120 million to BTC ETFs, while Ark Invest and 21Shares collectively recorded $24 million in inflows. Additionally, the rising Bitcoin price has driven increased demand, creating pressure on mining activities. This surge has also led to heightened energy consumption from national grids to sustain mining operations. Ethereum Price Today ETH price was trading at $4,000, marking an approximate 4% increase at the time of writing. Its 24-hour low and high were $3,831 and $4,087, respectively. Ethereum’s market capitalization stood at $480 billion, with a trading volume of $50 billion. It remained the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market dominance of 13.11%. The ETH ETF had seen an inflow of $49 million, with $47 million coming from Fidelity Investments. Bitwise had bought $13 million of the ETF, while BlackRock’s data was still pending. In other important news, Galaxy Research addressed the growing debate within the Ethereum community on whether to increase or decrease the Ethereum gas limit. This discussion has been a focal point for many, with Galaxy Research offering valuable insights. XRP Price Today XRP price was trading at $2.428, with a 24-hour high of $2.497. It was up by 6% in the last 24 hours, making it one of the top gainers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. XRP’s market capitalization stood at $139 billion, with a trading volume of $14 billion. It remained the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Moreover, crypto analyst Justin Bennett predicted that the XRP price could rally to $3 as a whale moved $47 million to the Bitstamp exchange. This development could signal potential upward momentum for XRP in the coming days. Solana Price Today Solana (SOL) price was trading at $235, down by 3% from the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $231 and $242, respectively. Solana’s market capitalization stood at $111 billion, with a trading volume of $5.42 billion. The price decline was attributed to the SEC’s rejection of Solana ETF filing . This news hurt the cryptocurrency, leading to its recent drop in value. Meme Crypto Prices Today The top meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) price was slightly up from yesterday, trading at $0.434 with a 24-hour high of $0.44. Shiba Inu (SHIB) was also minimally up, trading at $0.0000307. Other meme coins like PEPE, WIF, and BONK were down by 1% to 3% in the last 24 hours. The overall sentiment in the meme coin market showed mixed performance, with some coins experiencing slight gains while others faced declines. Crypto prices today reflect the ongoing volatility in the meme coin market.

Its 24-hour low and high were $0.07522 and $0.1037, respectively. XDC’s market capitalization stood at $1.55 billion, reflecting significant growth during this period.

Its 24-hour high was $0.00000401 USDT. MOG’s market capitalization stood at $1.54 billion, reflecting a strong performance in the last 24 hours. The price jump is attributed to the announcement of upcoming listing plans on Coinbase , which has generated positive market sentiment. Hedera HBAR price was up by 19% at the time of writing, with a 24-hour low of $0.2767 and a high of $0.3741. Its market capitalization stood at $13 billion. Crypto prices today reflect HBAR’s strong performance, continuing to show significant gains in the market.

It was trading at $1.33, with a 24-hour low of $1.30 and a high of $1.394. Raydium RAY price was down by 3%, trading at $4.85. Its 24-hour low and high were $4.801 and $5.096, respectively. Crypto prices today show a slight decline in RAY’s value during this period. The hourly chart is showing a bearish trend in the 1-hour time frame, with Bitcoin down by 1%. Major altcoins are also following a similar pattern, reflecting a slight downturn across the market. Crypto prices today indicate a temporary decline as the market experiences short-term pressure.

If you’ve been keeping tabs on the market, you’ll know it’s the perfect time to suss out the best cryptos to invest in right now. And crikey, have we got three crackers for you: Qubetics, Ethereum, and Stellar. These digital powerhouses are setting the pace, each with updates that’ll have you considering tossing a few bob their way. From Qubetics smashing its crypto presale goals with a whopping $4.6M raised, to Ethereum flexing its muscles with Layer 2 advancements, and Stellar surging on the back of international partnerships, there’s a lot to unpack here. Qubetics: The New Kid on the Block Ready to Dominate Mate, if you haven’t heard of Qubetics yet, you’re missing out. This Web3 superstar is taking the blockchain game by storm. Its $4.6 million presale isn’t just a number; it’s a statement. Investors are flocking to Qubetics because of its killer features: cross-chain compatibility , privacy-focused tools, and the easiest blockchain-building interface you’ve ever seen. Qubetics has a very practical side. It lets users monetise unused bandwidth, turning everyday internet access into cash—or rather, $TICS tokens. Fancy a decentralised VPN for secure browsing? Qubetics has that too. It’s like having your own high-tech Swiss Army knife for the blockchain world. At the current presale price of $0.0282, a $400 investment nabs you around 14,184 $TICS tokens. Analysts reckon $TICS could hit $15 post-mainnet launch, which would turn your $400 into a tidy $212,760. Fair dinkum, right? Qubetics isn’t just one of the best cryptos to invest in right now; it’s arguably the best. With its presale success and a mainnet launch on the horizon, this project’s got the potential to go stratospheric. For more on Qubetics’ features, watch this video . Ethereum: The Crypto Giant That Keeps Evolving Ethereum’s been around the traps for a while, but it’s still the heavyweight champ of the blockchain world. With its latest surge to $3.9K and its $25 billion record, it’s clear that ETH isn’t fooling around. The ecosystem keeps evolving, thanks to its Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re the reason Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi and NFTs. You’d think a giant like Ethereum might slow down, but no way, mate. The Ethereum staking rate recently hit an all-time high, with around 37% of all ETH tokens locked up. That’s a solid sign of confidence from both retail and institutional investors. And with the rise of zk-rollups, Ethereum’s future scalability looks better than a summer day at Bondi Beach. Of course, it’s not perfect. Gas fees can still sting like a bluebottle, but Ethereum’s dominance is undeniable. If you’re hunting for stability and long-term growth, ETH remains one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. Stellar: Lighting Up the Crypto Sky Stellar might not grab headlines like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but this little battler has been quietly racking up wins. Its XLM token has shot up by 450% recently, riding the wave of increased adoption and new partnerships. One standout? Stellar’s integration with MoneyGram, allowing users to convert crypto into fiat across multiple countries. Stellar’s real selling point is its focus on financial inclusion. It’s all about making cross-border payments cheaper and faster, particularly in regions where traditional banking is a bit of a dog’s breakfast. And with central banks eyeing Stellar for CBDC development, the project’s future looks brighter than a Sydney New Year’s fireworks show. If you’re keen on a crypto that’s not just profitable but also impactful, XLM is worth a gander. Its lower entry price makes it accessible for new investors, and its recent momentum puts it firmly among the best cryptos to invest in right now. Why Qubetics Is Special in the Crypto World Let’s not beat around the bush. Ethereum’s a legend, and Stellar’s a top-notch project, but Qubetics has the X-factor. It’s not just another blockchain; it’s a complete ecosystem designed for the future. Its interoperability, scalability, and unique monetisation features make it a standout. And then there’s the potential ROI. Sure, Ethereum and Stellar offer solid returns, but Qubetics is in a league of its own. With analysts projecting a climb to $10-$15 post-mainnet, it’s the kind of opportunity that doesn’t come along every day. Wrap-Up: The Time to Invest Is Now If you’re serious about finding the best cryptos to invest in right now, Qubetics, Ethereum, and Stellar should be top of your list. Each has its own strengths: Ethereum for its dominance and innovation, Stellar for its real-world impact, and Qubetics for its groundbreaking potential. But don’t sit on your hands, mate. Qubetics is on the cusp of something huge, and the presale price won’t last forever. Get in now, and you could be laughing all the way to the bank—or the beach. The choice is yours.

In a thread, the individual described the incident as a social engineering attack, emphasizing that they had not approved or signed any transactions. $300K Lost In Attack “Thought it would never happen to me, but it did,” the user wrote , disclosing that they had lost $300,000 from multiple wallets. According to the victim, the incident began when they received a direct message on X containing a KakaoTalk link, a popular messaging platform, for a scheduled partnership discussion. The user explained that they had clicked the link, which appeared non-functional, leading them to dismiss it as harmless. However, they now believe it secretly installed malware that compromised their digital wallets. The affected wallets include an Ethereum address and a Solana address, alongside several others that were also drained. The attacker, identified by the username “0xQwerky” on X, allegedly transferred the stolen funds to a wallet linked with the cryptocurrency exchange BingX. LeftsideEmiri has called on the exchange to intervene and potentially recover the stolen assets. “If anyone can help in any way, it is greatly appreciated,” the user pleaded. They also warned the crypto community to avoid clicking job interview links or trusting unsolicited messages on social platforms. Experts Warn of Increasing Phishing Threats The incident comes as cybersecurity analysts predict a surge in cryptocurrency phishing scams during December. According to Web3 security firm Scam Sniffer, phishing attacks in November resulted in losses of nearly $9.4 million, with over 9,200 investors affected. One notable case involved a victim losing $661,000 in stETH within minutes, which the firm described as the ‘tip of the iceberg.’ The platform warned that malicious blockchain signatures continue to pose the greatest threat to crypto users. Scammers use these techniques to deceive people into signing fraudulent transactions, granting them full control over the victims’ wallets and causing substantial financial losses. In January 2024, a phishing scam resulted in the theft of $4.2 million worth of aEthWETH and aEthUNI. The attackers manipulated ERC-20 permissions to bypass security alerts and gain access to the victim’s funds. A more recent exploit in October saw a crypto investor lose 15,079 fwdETH, worth approximately $36 million, in a permit phishing scam. According to Scam Sniffer, the bad actor deceived the individual into signing a malicious signature, gaining unrestricted access to their funds.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA.

While degens have undoubtedly contributed to the growth and visibility of cryptocurrencies, their behavior also poses significant risks. The rapidly changing nature of degen culture – coupled with the proliferation of fraud projects targeting this audience – calls for a critical examination of the sustainability and integrity of the crypto ecosystem. The degen phenomenon and its implications Degens, short for ‘degenerates,’ have become a driving force in the crypto world. These risk-takers chase high-reward opportunities with little regard for potential losses, fueling the growth of memecoins and speculative projects. The global cryptocurrency user base has exploded from 106 million in January 2021 to over 617 million identity-verified crypto wallets by June 2024, with degens playing a significant role in this expansion. However, the degens mentality has also created fertile ground for scammers and fraudulent projects. A recent investigation by blockchain investigator ZachXBT into the activities of ‘Serpent,’ a former professional Fortnite player, illustrates the dark side of this phenomenon. The Serpent saga – a case study in crypto scams ZachXBT’s investigation uncovered a complex web of fraudulent activity allegedly orchestrated by Serpent that resulted in the theft of approximately $3.5 million through memecoin scams. The scheme involved the following. Compromising high-profile social media accounts on X and Instagram, including those of McDonald’s, Usher, Andy Ayrey, Dean Norris and the Enoshima Aquarium Promoting fraudulent memecoins through these hacked accounts Running pump-and-dump schemes on platforms such as Pump.fun Gambling away the stolen funds in online casinos This case is an example of how scammers are exploiting the appetite for risk and quick profits in the degen culture, often leaving investors with substantial losses. The prevalence of such scams is deeply worrying. Numerous crypto founders have abandoned their projects after the initial hype, leaving investors with worthless tokens. This pattern of behavior undermines trust in the crypto space and stifles legitimate innovation. As someone immersed in the crypto landscape, I am deeply disappointed by the number of scams our community members are facing. These fraudulent activities not only cause financial harm but also undermine the credibility of the entire cryptocurrency sector. Moving forward – b uilding real value I wholeheartedly agree with the founder and former CEO of Binance, who posted on X , “I’m not against memes, but memecoins are getting ‘a bit’ weird now. Let’s build real applications with blockchain.” It’s time for the crypto community to refocus on creating tangible value and sustainable projects. To achieve this, we must do the following. Prioritize education and encourage due diligence among investors Develop and implement stronger security measures to protect users Support projects that offer real benefits and long-term value In conclusion, while the degen phenomenon has contributed to crypto’s rapid growth, it’s critical to address the risks and challenges that come with it. By shifting our focus to building real applications and fostering a culture of responsibility, we can ensure a more stable and prosperous future for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Top Analyst Predicts $6,800 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has crossed the $4,000 mark for the first time since reaching its all-time high, signaling a major milestone. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has faced some volatility. Recently, the market saw a significant outflow of half a billion dollars in just 60 minutes, leading to concerns about Bitcoin’s price action. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $99,500 levels. On The Paul Barron Network, analyst The Trading Parrot, said that Ethereum’s price surge comes after a strong bounce from support levels around $2.3k to $2.4k in September. This recent breakout feels different from previous attempts at $4K, as it’s the third time Ethereum has tested this level, and there’s hope that it will sustain above $4K this time. Bullish Momentum and Future Targets The excitement around Ethereum’s breakout is fueled by strong momentum, with the price pushing higher after October’s breakout. The analyst has set a target range of $6.8K to $8.5K based on Fibonacci retracement levels, especially following the market’s recovery from the 2022 bear market. Market Factors Driving the Surge Several factors are contributing to Ethereum’s rise, including Layer 1 revenue growth, competition from Layer 2 solutions, and the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which is expected to lower fees for Ethereum users in March 2024. Despite lower fees, Ethereum’s base layer has still generated around $10.9 million in December, indicating strong underlying demand. Ethereum ETF Inflows and Market Timing Ethereum’s performance is also supported by growing interest from institutional investors.

During the discussion, Su spoke about her plans to challenge Nvidia in the AI sector and expand AMD’s global market presence. According to Lisa, she has successfully guided AMD through challenging times and transformed it into a notable company in the semiconductor industry during her tenure as CEO. Her leadership has revitalized the company, taking its stock from $2 a share to over $130 a share. The once-struggling company has now become one that plays a critical role in high-performance gaming and computing, supplying chips for devices like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. AMD aims to outperform Nvidia in the AI sector Su is determined to expand the company’s role in artificial intelligence. During the conversation with Bloomberg’s Emily Chang at AMD’s Austin labs, the CEO outlined her vision to take the lead from Nvidia . So far, the chipmaker has set an almost unassailable lead in the AI industry, with almost 84% of the AI chip market. Nvidia and Intel have always been AMD’s top competitors in high-performance computer technology. Currently, Nvidia’s chips are used by Meta, Google, and Amazon. AMD expects the release of its new Zen architecture to help it close the gap in its chase. Part of Su’s strategy to challenge Nvidia in the AI market includes leveraging AMD’s cutting-edge hardware to support AI workloads. “I truly believe AI is the most transformational technology that I’ve seen in my career,” Lisa told Emily. She went on to say, “The rate and pace of change in the industry, it’s like faster than anything we’ve ever seen.” AMD is open to a global AI market As AMD grows its presence in the AI and computing markets, it faces more than financial and operational challenges. With chips gaining more importance geopolitically, a new challenge arises for the company. China and the US, in particular, present Lisa with the biggest headaches of navigating geopolitical tension. The US government has taken steps to restrict chip exports, raw materials for manufacturing, and even advanced technology to some countries over security concerns. While Su recognizes the national security interests, she also states that AMD wants there to be “as open a market as possible.” When asked if chip manufacturing will ever return to the US, Su said, “I think we will see chip manufacturing back in the US. I think we should recognize, though, that the semiconductor world is global. That ship has sailed.” Throughout the interview , Lisa Su maintained that AMD will remain competitive and innovative. The company will continue to thrive and grow in the industry, navigating whatever challenges may come.

MemeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) has recently been on an impressive run, securing significant investments. Now, traders are asking how high Cutoshi can go once it is listed on major exchanges. According to some indicators, this could come very soon. Cutoshi Presale Secured $1.28 Million In Record Time MemeFi token Cutoshi has recently gained significant investor attention. After attracting $1.28 million in investments in record time, more and more traders are interested in the project. As a result, the token started trending on X and secured a listing on CoinMarketCap. By the end of November, Cutoshi’s presale investments were already above $1.2 million. This was just weeks after the launch of the presale, suggesting strong investor interest. What attracted traders to Cutoshi is its unique blend of meme coins and DeFi. Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a DeFi project. On the meme coin side, Cutoshi is a Chinese Lucky Cat, taking inspiration from a symbol famous in Asia, bringing fortune and prosperity. Like the lucky cat, it hopes to bring luck to the wallets of its holders. It also uses the viral nature of meme coins, by initiatives such as the recent meme competition. On the DeFi side, Cutoshi is a utility token that builds a decentralized ecosystem run by its users. Taking inspiration from the legendary Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Cutoshi values decentralization and privacy. As such, it aims to attract more people than ever to the world of DeFi with its multichain DEX and learning platform for new investors. Cutoshi Expected To End Stage 4 In Record Time The Cutoshi presale has 10 stages, with the price increasing at each stage. This setup rewards early investors, who have the chance to buy the token at a lower price. So far, Cutoshi’s presale price more than doubled, increasing from its original level of $0.015 to $0.031. As the token progresses through the presale stages, its price increases even further. However, the token will have the potential for the most significant increases once it starts trading on exchanges. The significant interest in Cutoshi and the speed at which it is selling out, suggests a record end to stage four of its presale. As the token continues to advance through the presale, listing on exchanges is only a matter of time. Cutoshi has strong investor interest, clear utility and a strong roadmap going for it. If the presale continues at this pace, the token can expect to launch and begin public trading on DEX’s very soon. Listing on major centralized exchanges, typically a significant catalyst for growth, can come as soon as two months from now.

These holders, defined as those who retain their Bitcoin for over 155 days, are known to influence market movements through their accumulation and distribution behaviors significantly. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Datascope has highlighted key trends in LTH activity that could signal the next phase for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Hut 8 Unveils $750 Million Initiative To Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Key Trends And Historical Context Datascope’s insights highlight the importance of the LTH accumulation/distribution ratio as an on-chain metric. This ratio reflects whether LTHs are amassing Bitcoin, indicative of market bottoms, or liquidating holdings during price peaks, often signaling corrections. Historical patterns from 2013 and 2017 saw LTHs engaging in substantial selling at market highs, while periods like 2019 and 2020 were marked by intense accumulation, paving the way for bull markets. According to datascope’s analysis, the peaks of 2013 and 2017, which were characterized by heightened selling activity from LTHs, correlated with significant price corrections. These corrections, fueled by profit-taking, marked the culmination of bullish cycles. Conversely, during the lows of 2019 and 2020, LTHs exhibited strong accumulation tendencies, which signalled confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and laying the groundwork for subsequent price surges. Now in 2024, datascope pointed out that the LTH metric is once again providing critical insights into market conditions. Recent data reveals increased selling activity among LTHs, a behaviour observed during periods of market overheating or resistance at current price levels. While this trend could hint at an impending correction, it also raises the possibility of the market transitioning into a new accumulation phase. Echoing this, a recent report from CryptoQuant reveals there has been sustained buying pressure from US investors. Bitcoin passes $100k as institutional demand drives the market.

As it has done for the past few years, the report highlighted the role of stablecoins and the digital asset sector more broadly — though it stopped short of suggesting FSOC would take any concrete steps toward curbing these concerns. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. 'Emerging risks' The narrative For yet another year in a row, the Financial Stability Oversight Council — a group composed of the U.S.'s financial agency heads — warned that unchecked stablecoin growth could be an issue for the U.S. and global financial systems in its annual report. Why it matters The Financial Stability Oversight Council is tasked with ensuring the U.S.'s financial stability, and has for years asked Congress to pass legislation addressing the crypto market. The 2024 report reiterates these concerns. Breaking it down For the last few years, FSOC has warned that stablecoins exist outside any sort of federal regulatory framework, and their collective size could pose risks to financial stability. Friday's report once again noted that potential risk. At the same time it also urged Congress to pass legislation addressing stablecoins and market structure, much as FSOC's previous reports have. ""Stablecoins continue to represent a potential risk to financial stability because they are acutely vulnerable to runs absent appropriate risk management standards,"" the report said. ""This run risk is amplified by issues related to both market concentration and market opacity."" The report referred to Tether's USDT composing some 70% of the total global stablecoin market as one issue regulators should watch. The lack of any kind of federal regulatory framework is likewise an ongoing concern, the report said. Some states have frameworks for stablecoins, but this is insufficient for the concerns FSOC has. ""Although a few are subject to state-level supervision requiring regular reporting, many provide limited verifiable information about their holdings and reserve management practices,"" the report said. Though FSOC has warned for the past few years that it may have to take whatever actions it can should Congress not act, it's unclear to what extent, if any, it may actually be able to do so. FSOC will be composed of new regulators within the coming months. ""Additionally, many crypto-asset market firms and issuers remain outside of, or in noncompliance with, the U.S. financial regulatory framework,"" the report said. ""As such, the crypto-asset spot market may continue to experience significant fraud and manipulation. The Council recommends that Congress pass legislation that provides federal financial regulators with explicit rulemaking authority over the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities."" ""We have also been addressing emerging risks from significant technological changes,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a prepared statement . ""Digital assets and artificial intelligence bring potential benefits such as efficiencies, but also financial risks, cyber risks, and risks from third-party service providers. The Council continues to call for legislation to create a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers and for legislation on crypto assets that addresses the risks we have identified.""

He shared screenshots of a message from the Margex crypto exchange showing that high demand for XRP caused issues with trading pairs and a crash. According to a notice from the exchange, extreme volatility and an unprecedented surge in demand for XRP caused their auto-deleveraging mechanism to malfunction. This led to cascading issues, including counterparty liabilities and the need to claw back previously settled trades. This disruption comes at a time of renewed interest in XRP. The cryptocurrency recently surpassed $2 for the first time since 2018, reaching a peak of $2.86. The price rally has been attributed to factors, including major institutional buying. On Binance, a $2.1 million XRP trade, believed to be from institutional investors , highlights this trend.

As a result, counterparties faced unprecedented negative balances, further complicating trade settlements. To stabilize the situation and preserve market integrity, the XRPUSD trading pair was suspended. Margex has also announced that it will be delisting the XRPUSD trading pair until further notice. The exchange outlined several measures in response to the disruption. Open positions and active market orders for XRPUSD have been canceled, and fees, funding, and margins have been fully refunded to traders. Furthermore, any XRPUSD trades executed after November 10, 2024, have been fully reverted, encompassing profits and losses. This decision has also affected copy trading strategies linked to XRPUSD. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Excitement Surrounding XRP Another key development in the crypto landscape that has caused significant excitement is the resignation of Gary Gensler , Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gensler announced his resignation, effective January 20, 2025, and President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly figure, as Gensler’s successor. This nomination has fueled optimism among crypto enthusiasts and could signal a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets like XRP. XRP has faced its share of challenges in the form of regulatory scrutiny. However, its recent price surge indicates renewed confidence among traders and institutions. The current situation with Margex shows the excitement for XRP among investors, and analysts suggest that increased institutional participation, combined with a potential shift in U.S. crypto regulations, could further solidify XRP’s position in the market.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 05:23:00

After months of small and steady growth, it’s reached a new all-time high (ATH). With the $1,500 mark now in sight, BNB is leading the way and showing how major cryptos can shine when the market picks up. This surge isn’t just about BNB price predictions , though. It’s also creating space for investors to think about what’s next for new coins entering the market, like Rollblock (RBLK). Rollblock is catching attention with its innovative approach to the crypto casino space, offering token holders a share of casino revenues. The ongoing presale has already raised over $6.9 million, giving investors a solid reason to believe this is the next big rising crypto star. BNB Price Prediction Breaking Records, Eyeing $1,500 BNB i s absolutely crushing it right now. It’s sitting at about $730 and the old all-time high of $651 is past gone. Also,​ an interesting fact​ is that BNB​ is​ up​ by 24%​ іn the last​ 30 days, and just this past week,​ it jumped another 11%. That kind​ оf growth​ is grabbing​ a lot of​ attention, and it’s easy​ tо see why. On top of that, BNB’s market cap just hit $3 billion. So, it’s clear this coin isn’t slowing down anytime soon. With all this momentum, BNB price prediction of $1,500 doesn’t feel like a stretch – it feels like it’s right around the corner. Rollblock: A Rising Crypto Sta While big names like Avalanche and Sui are making headlines, Rollblock is quietly carving out its own space in the crypto market. This new coin is leading the way in the GambleFi niche, combining real-world utility with impressive profitability. Unlike projects that rely purely on speculation, Rollblock stands out by offering weekly profit distributions to token holders from its casino operations. What really sets Rollblock apart is its deflationary tokenomics. The project burns 60% of repurchased tokens, while the remaining 40% gets redistributed to stakers. This approach creates steady value for investors and adds a layer of sustainability to the coin’s growth. With over $6 million raised during its presale, Rollblock is already turning heads among smart investors looking for consistent returns in a volatile market. BNB and Rollblock Move Forward Interestingly, Rollblock’s trajectory mirrors some aspects of B NB’s rise. Just as BNB became a cornerstone of the Binance Smart Chain and revolutionized DeFi, Rollblock is positioned to disrupt traditional gaming and DeFi industries. While BNB is already dominating with a $3 billion market cap, Rollblock is still in its early stages, offering a unique opportunity for those who want to get in before the next big wave. As Rollblock’s ecosystem grows, it’s not just an exciting investment – it’s a project with the potential to transform crypto gaming. Could it follow in BNB’s footsteps and make its own mark on the industry? Time will tell, but the signs are promising. Conclusion Rollblock isn’t just another new coin – it’s a game-changer in the making. With its innovative GambleFi model, deflationary tokenomics, and a presale already raising over $6.9 million, it’s attracting investors fast. Don’t wait until it’s too late – jump in now and ride the wave before Rollblock becomes the next big crypto success story! Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Trump recently announced the appointment of David O. Sacks as the White House AI and Crypto Czar for the upcoming administration. Sacks, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and noted proponent of cryptocurrencies, is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the administration’s policies on artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. This appointment, alongside the recent appointment of Paul Atkins, a well-known pro-crypto figure as Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has fueled optimism within the cryptocurrency community—especially among supporters of XRP—that the contentious SEC lawsuit against Ripple may soon end. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared Trump’s statement, where the president-elect highlighted Sacks’ responsibilities in fostering American leadership in emerging technologies like AI and cryptocurrency, calling these areas “critical to the future of American competitiveness.” Sacks is expected to prioritize free speech, fight Big Tech censorship, and build a legal framework conducive to innovation in the crypto industry. The Crypto Czar’s Interest in Ripple BankXRP (@BankXRP), a well-known figure in the crypto space, shared an intriguing revelation about the new Crypto Czar. He shared a screenshot of previous comments from Sacks, showing his interest in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Following Ripple’s victory over the SEC in July 2023, Sacks described it as a “big ruling for crypto.” The new white House #crypto and AI Czar @DavidSacks Has been watching the Ripple XRP Case pic.twitter.com/nLOWOyr7bH — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) December 6, 2024 This ruling was pivotal, as the court determined that XRP itself was not a security and non-institutional XRP sales did not constitute securities offerings. Stacks’ personal interest in the Ripple lawsuit has further bolstered confidence that his leadership will be favorable to the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The XRP community is excited as Sacks’ involvement makes the dismissal of the lawsuit more likely. The concurrent appointment of Paul Atkins, a well-known pro-crypto figure, as SEC Chair further strengthens the case for a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Current SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced that he will step down on January 20, 2025, triggering a massive XRP price pump Industry observers anticipate a swift resolution of the Ripple lawsuit when the new administration takes office. This would benefit Ripple and XRP, and establish a more predictable regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole.

Sacks’ leadership offers a unique opportunity for Ripple and the broader blockchain industry to gain clarity on regulatory issues and position the U.S. as a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. His focus on ensuring free speech and countering Big Tech bias aligns with crypto’s decentralized ethos, making his appointment particularly meaningful to advocates of blockchain technology.

The price has entered one of the pivotal resistance zones, pushing the prices lower after every contact. However, it could be different this time as the ETH bulls seem poised to surpass the zone and the current ATH. Moreover, liquidity is flowing back into the token, suggesting the rally could be unstoppable and may continue strongly within the discovery phase. The ETH price surged to the highest price, close to $4,100, not seen in the past three years since the 2021 bull run. This is reportedly due to a magnificent increase in institutional interest, with the U.S. spot ETH ETF recording one of the largest single-day inflows of over $428.4 million. The data from Coinglass suggests the total weekly inflows stand at around $752.9 million, which is a ‘record gain’ since the launch of the ETFs. This could be the prime reason for the ETH price rally, which has reached the $4000 barrier and a sustained rise may pave the way for a new ATH before the end of 2025. Will Ethereum (ETH) Price Reach $5000 in 2024? After a sustained upswing & multiple failed attempts, the ETH price has broken above a pivotal range, which is expected to offer a strong boost for the rally. The token was stuck within an expanding channel since the rejection it faced in Q1, hence the current rise beyond the range suggests the bulls are self-assured of keeping up an elevated trend hereafter. The volume over the platform has been rising consistently since November, which has kept the volatility levels pretty high. This has also increased the volume of the platform which is believed to be influenced by the increasing ETF accumulation. Importantly, the 50/200-day MA has undergone a bullish crossover termed as Golden Cross, which is expected to offer a fine boost to the ETH price rally. Previously, when the Etheurem faced a Death Cross in August, the price plunged by over 27%, marking the lows close to $2100 with a huge rise in the selling volume. Meanwhile, the ETH price is believed to follow the pattern and rise with a similar margin in the coming week and test the highs. The Ethereum (ETH) price is expected to form a new ATH above $5000 before the end of 2024 and keep up the bullish trend in the first half of 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 05:46:17

The latest happenings have been posted by founder Nischal Shetty on his Twitter, stating that the company has submitted a filing to the Singapore court to pass an order for creditors to meet. This step opens the door to bringing a Scheme of Arrangement, which will enable creditors to approve a plan that will help in the settlement of existing financial disputes with the view to reinstate the provision of platform services. As expounded by WazirX, the Scheme is fair and equitable to all the creditors of the Company. The company’s goal is to make the people confident in the process which is said to be transparent and hence involving. Token Utilization for Functionality on the Blockchain During the implementation of the Scheme, WazirX has been doing an on-chain token swap to simplify and optimise asset holding and management.

This is a significant step for WazirX on its path to responding to creditor concerns and reconstructing its platform amid a cryptocurrency crash that demonstrated the value of user engagement and institutional credibility.

It currently looks weak on the day following a 5% loss in the past four days. The past month’s trade marked a great shift in the market structure as it rebounded from the $10 level – pinned as support in the early month. After a week’s surge, it struggled with volatility as the price squeezed and broke through $16 to tap $19.5 – its highest trading level in nine months. Crossing over into this month bullish, Link initiated a buy and exploded to $27 on Monday. Facing multiple rejections at this price level, it lost grip and fell to where it is changing hands at $22.9, although it remains bullish. The latest price drops indicate a pullback. As seen on the daily chart, it aims to retest the broken $20 level. If this level holds as support, we can expect a quick bounce to the previous resistance before breaking higher. A strong daily close under this level should facilitate a broader pullback before locating a solid ground to foot a fresh increase. Despite the drops, the market is still in favour of the bulls in the short term. A further break up should give them more control in the future. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the price is pulling back, the key potential level for a rebound is $19.45. If the price drops below it, $16.1 and $13.8 are other support levels to watch for a drop. In case of a rebound, Link must reclaim the lost $27 resistance level before rising to $28.7. The next resistance level to watch is $32.6. Key Resistance Levels: $27, $28.7, $32.6 Key Support Levels: $19.45, $16.1, $13.8 Spot Price: $22.9 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 06:03:00

However, the overall outlook remains bullish on the daily chart but will likely lose momentum soon. Dot’s trend is still looking bullish from a short-term perspective as the price continued to increase amid steady volume inflow in the past week. However, trading appeared to be reaching an exhaustion point as buying volume turned low since the price bounced off the $7.5 level last week. Rejecting $12 in the mid-week, it paused buying and lost grip. Looking at the daily chart, the price is currently weak following a 2% loss today. The hourly chart suggests a potential sell as the bears slowly step back, although they are still facing hurdles at the key $10 level. If they mount pressure at this key level, the price may fall while it loses momentum. Such a scenario could trigger a major retracement in the market before resuming a bullish rally. Should the bulls regroup above the mentioned key level, we can anticipate more surges before initiating a retracement. As of now, the bulls are taking charge. Even if they lose control, we can expect a quick recovery as the entire crypto market now follows positive sentiments. The bears will likely suffer more losses in the future. DOT’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The nearest support level to consider for drops right now is $8.45, followed by the $7.55 level that produced a rebound in late November. The $6.15 level is the lower support to watch for a broader sell. If Dot advances bullish from the current trading level, it must retake the weekly $11.7 high, followed by a break to $13. Above it lies $15. Key Resistance Levels: $11.7, $13, $15 Key Support Levels: $8.45, $7.55, $6.15 Spot Price: $10 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The much-talked-about Operation to cripple the crypto industry by preventing access to liquidity is getting mainstream attention as crypto exchange Coinbase released the “pause letters” exposing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) involvement in Choke Point 2.0. David Sacks to ‘Look Into’ Operation Choke Point 2.0 As Operation Choke Point 2.0 enters mainstream discussion, Trump’s newly appointed crypto czar David Sacks has stepped into the matter. In a message on the X platform, Sacks wrote: “There are too many stories of people being hurt by Operation Choke Point 2.0. It needs to be looked at”. His comments came as a response to Silvergate Bank CTO Chris Lane, who explained how the regulators choked the bank into bankruptcy. Remembering the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, Lane wrote: “When FTX went down, Silvergate survived a 70% run on deposits. A typical bank cannot survive 20%. FTX didn’t kill us; our regulators did.” Following David Sacks’s involvement, crypto industry veterans have offered their help in investigating the matter. The crypto industry has very high hopes from Sacks and his team and expects him to change all the unjust practices during the Biden administration. Coinbase Releases FDIC “Pause Letters,” Files Motion Coinbase has made public 23 heavily redacted “pause letters” it received from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), shedding light on documents tied to what the crypto industry refers to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” In a legal escalation, Coinbase filed a court motion today seeking unredacted versions of these letters. Earlier this week, during a hearing held by the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. French Hill asserted that the next Congress has the authority to “halt, reverse, and investigate Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” With a GOP trifecta next year, we will be able to halt, reverse, and investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0. Legal businesses should have the freedom to bank, and @FinancialCmte will continue to review and investigate @FDICgov ’s troubling actions in the 119th Congress. pic.twitter.com/p56mAGFZht — French Hill (@RepFrenchHill) December 4, 2024 Despite this backlash against US regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) continues to push forward its agenda regarding the “concentration risks” associated with the crypto industry. This time, the regulator has targeted stablecoins adding that they pose a major risk to the country’s financial stability. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long lashed out at the FSOC saying that its anti-crypto rhetoric has forced many banks to de-bank crypto issuers. It will be interesting to see how David Sacks tackles the investigation in Operation Choke Point 2.0. Showing confidence in his capabilities, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote: “Sacks is a great pick! It’s incredible to think what is possible with sharp, pro-tech, pro-business people in government”. All Eyes On Senate Banking Committee Next Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee will vote on the renomination of anti-crypto SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. If confirmed by the Senate, Crenshaw will serve on the commission until 2029. However, in the case of rejection, President-elect Donald Trump will appoint a new candidate. Crenshaw has been a strong ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler during her tenure, supporting his regulatory agenda. Notably, she also voted against the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

They’re like that cheeky pint after a long day — fun, slightly unpredictable, but with the potential to leave you buzzing. If you’ve been around the meme coin scene long enough, you’ll know the drill: find the presales, take the plunge, and maybe — just maybe — you’ll see those sweet gains roll in faster than you can say “to the moon.” This week’s presales are especially juicy, so buckle up and get ready for some serious FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). First on our list is the one everyone’s been talking about, BTFD Coin. It’s been raking in the big bucks like a new Netflix series people can’t stop binge-watching. With the presale climbing fast and furious, now’s your chance to dive in before it hits the mainstream. And if that doesn’t quite whet your appetite, we’ve got Brett and Peanut the Squirrel lined up to round out the trio of meme coins that could deliver a nice surprise to your portfolio. So, let’s break it down — here are the best meme coin presales to buy this week for the most epic growth! 1. BTFD Coin: A Presale Like No Other (Seriously) BTFD Coin is creating a whirlwind right now, and if you’re not paying attention, you might miss the next big thing. This meme coin is on fire! You’ve probably heard the term “Buy The Dip” thrown around, but BTFD Coin is turning that phrase into a full-on mantra. With over $1M raised in presale in record time, the hype is real. And guess what? It’s still not too late to jump in. Now, imagine this: you’ve got $10,000 burning a hole in your pocket. You decide to grab BTFD Coin during this presale at the current price of $0.000064. That means you’re getting 156,250,000 coins. Fast forward a few months, and the price could easily spike to $0.0006 (let’s say the presale hits its targets and a little market magic happens). That’s a whopping $93,750 in your pocket. Yep, that’s the power of catching a presale early — a little goes a long way when the price skyrockets. But don’t just look at the numbers, because BTFD Coin has more than just a good price. It’s also got stunning community support, with its lovable Bulls Squad (Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull). These mascots are not just cute, they’re tough (like the perfect British bulldog). Why this meme coin made it to this list: With incredible staking rewards of up to 90% APY and a Play-to-Earn game on the way, this coin could be your ticket to the moon — or, if we’re staying with the UK vibes, a first-class train to a seaside holiday. 2. Brett: The Underdog with Potential Next up is Brett, a meme coin with more cheeky charm than a pub full of mates after a football match. Now, you might be thinking, “Wait, who’s Brett?” That’s exactly the point. Brett is the underdog that’s flying under the radar right now, but trust me, it won’t stay that way for long. Much like the local underdog football team that suddenly makes it to the finals, Brett has all the makings of an upset. Brett is designed with the crypto community in mind, bringing fun and a bit of irreverence to the space. With its playful branding and a commitment to building a strong ecosystem, it’s one of those coins that could become the meme coin of 2025.

Why this meme coin made it to this list: With a charity initiative attached to the project, part of the proceeds from its presale are going to help fund educational programmes. That’s right, you’re not just getting in on a meme coin, you’re contributing to something positive. Plus, Brett has some serious social media traction, with influencers already hopping on board. 3. Peanut the Squirrel: The Quirky New Contender Lastly, we’ve got Peanut the Squirrel. No, this isn’t a typo. This meme coin is inspired by none other than everyone’s favourite nut-obsessed woodland creature — the squirrel. It’s fun, quirky, and downright hilarious. And guess what? It’s taking the meme coin world by storm. At first glance, you might be thinking, “What’s next? A meme coin for pigeons?” But trust me, Peanut the Squirrel is much more than just a laugh. This coin has all the makings of a community-driven powerhouse, with features that appeal to the casual investor and meme coin enthusiast alike. Think memes, giveaways, and a super dedicated following of people who just can’t get enough of the peanut-loving squirrel. The presale is steadily growing, and Peanut the Squirrel might just surprise you with its momentum.
