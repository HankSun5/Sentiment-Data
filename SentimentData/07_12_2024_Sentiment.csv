From as early as January this year, developers have hinted at the need to implement this changes to the mainnet. Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is in support of a 33% limit. To Galaxy Digital, there is more to consider in quest to make this move. Ethereum Gas Limit: Is The Time Right? As discussed by Galaxy Researcher Christine Kim, at the latest Ethereum all developers’ conference also witnessed arguments in support. Nethermind developer Marek Moraczyński presented data-driven research on why an increase is justified and safe for the protocol. In comment, Kim highlighted there are factors that need analyzing on why this proposal is worth considering. First, the block gas limit will not impact the blockchain. Several researches have pointed at this, invalidating claims that increment above 25% might overload the network. tldr; there’s enough data and research to suggest that a gas limit increase won’t hurt Ethereum. but in light of the network’s scaling roadmap, it likely won’t help either in terms of fees, activity, or overall network value. so why push for it at all? https://t.co/bx56kSvDS4 — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) December 6, 2024 On the other hand, Christine Kim said “it is also likely that it won’t materially help Ethereum in any way either.” With the broad uncertainty, the researcher noted that the timing is not right for the major validators to get behind the proposal. Naming Coinbase and Kraken Exchanges, she said the speculations surrounding the Ethereum block gas limit increase might cause some drawbacks. Increasing the gas limt will help scale the Ethereum protocol by a considerable measure. If ongoing considerations around the limit increase passes, the developers have plans to EIPs to implement it in the Pectra Upgrade . Whether or not the protocol will inplement Ethereum gas limits as a temporary scalability fix, Galaxy Research hinted that now is not the time. Growing Layer 1 Competition Over the past year, different Layer 1 blockchain networks have hinted at plans to upgrade their chains. Vitalik Buterin has stayed at the top of the conversation, hinting in series his visions for scaling ETH in the coming decade. While Ethereum is leveraging the strength of its layer-2 scaling solutions to command the majority of traction in the industry, other chains are also stepping up. As revealed recently, the Cardano Hydra protocol recorded a 1 million transaction per second milestone in test mode. As Cardano’s scaling tool, this figures, if transferred to real world will make the protocol the fastest in the industry. Other chains like Solana, SUI Network and XRP Ledger also have their inherent strengths amid growing competition.

Qubetics Is Your Next Big Investment,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-polygon-bandwagon-qubetics-is-your-next-big-investment/,"The crypto market never sleeps, and neither does the FOMO it generates. Over the past few years, we’ve watched coins like Polygon (MATIC) soar, turning early adopters into overnight millionaires. If you didn’t hop on the MATIC train back in 2020, you’re not alone—it feels like most of us missed that bus. But here’s the good news: missing out on Polygon might just be your best blessing in disguise. Why? Because a new opportunity has arrived that’s making even the most seasoned investors sit up and pay attention. Meet Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary crypto project that’s shaking up the space with its bold vision for real-world asset tokenisation. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy, Qubetics is not just an option—it’s the opportunity of the season. Qubetics ($TICS): Where Web3 Meets the Real World If you’ve been in the crypto game for a while, you’ve probably heard plenty of projects making big claims about “bridging the gap” between blockchain and the real world. Most of them fall short, but Qubetics is different. It’s not just building a bridge—it’s redefining what’s possible by tokenising real-world assets. So, what exactly does that mean? At its core, Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator that’s focused on real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT). It’s taking tangible, physical assets like real estate, luxury cars, and even high-value collectibles and turning them into digital tokens. This isn’t just some abstract concept—it’s a game-changing solution that’s unlocking liquidity for individuals and businesses. Imagine this: You’re a property owner who needs quick cash but doesn’t want to sell your entire building. With Qubetics, you can tokenise a portion of your property, sell fractional ownership, and raise capital faster than a bank loan. Or let’s say you’re an art collector with a multi-million-dollar masterpiece. Instead of selling the entire painting, you could sell digital ownership fractions to buyers across the globe. That’s the kind of flexibility Qubetics brings to the table. And it’s not just for the ultra-wealthy. Small business owners can use Qubetics to unlock value from their physical assets, while individuals can invest in tokenised assets that were once out of reach. Whether you’re an entrepreneur looking to expand or a young professional wanting to diversify your portfolio, Qubetics is creating a world where you don’t need to be a millionaire to play the big leagues. Now, let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in its 11th presale stage, and the buzz is unreal. Over 275 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, raising more than $4.6 million from 6,800+ holders. And those who jumped in early? They’re already seeing gains. $TICS tokens were priced at $0.025 in the 10th stage, and now they’re at $0.0282—a solid 10% increase. Analysts predict the token could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a whopping 776% ROI. But that’s just the start. Post-launch, $TICS could reach $1, $5, or even $15, turning modest investments into small fortunes. Think about it: if you invest $10,000 at today’s price of $0.0282, you’d snag 354,609 $TICS tokens. At $1, your investment grows to $354,609. And at $15? You’re looking at a life-changing $5.3 million. That’s not just a win—that’s legendary. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Because it’s not just a token—it’s a tool for the future, solving real-world problems in a way no other project has managed to do. Polygon: The Layer-2 Powerhouse That Changed the Game Let’s switch gears and talk about Polygon. If you’ve been in crypto for any amount of time, you’ve probably heard about this Layer-2 scaling solution that’s made Ethereum’s clunky transaction fees and slow speeds a thing of the past. Polygon didn’t just improve Ethereum—it supercharged it. Back in the day, Ethereum’s high gas fees were driving users and developers away. Enter Polygon. With its ability to process thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost, it became the go-to solution for developers building decentralised apps (dApps), NFT platforms, and DeFi protocols. It’s like the Robin Hood of crypto—taking from the inefficiencies of Ethereum and giving power back to the people. And the world noticed. Polygon has partnered with some of the biggest brands out there—think Starbucks, Adidas, Disney, and Reddit. These partnerships aren’t just PR stunts; they’re real-world use cases that cement Polygon’s place as a foundational piece of Web3 infrastructure. But here’s the thing: while Polygon has seen explosive growth, its days of life-changing ROI may be behind it. If you snagged MATIC back in 2020 when it was trading at under a penny, congratulations—you’re probably sitting on a fortune. Today, though, MATIC hovers around $0.85–$1. For new investors, it’s still a solid play, but the 10,000% gains? Those are in the rearview. Let’s break it down. A $10,000 investment in MATIC today might double or triple in value over time, but it’s unlikely to deliver the astronomical returns we’ve seen in the past. It’s a safer bet for those looking for stability, but for investors chasing the best crypto to buy for high-risk, high-reward gains, Polygon may not scratch that itch anymore. Why did Polygon make it to this list? Because it’s still a rock-solid project with a proven track record. It may not be the next moonshot, but it’s a cornerstone of the blockchain world. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now So, where does this leave us? If you’re looking for stability and long-term growth, Polygon remains a smart choice. But if you’re after a coin with the potential to deliver life-changing returns, Qubetics ($TICS) is where you should be focusing your attention. Qubetics isn’t just another token in a sea of thousands. It’s a visionary project that’s bringing blockchain into the real world in ways we’ve only dreamed of. With its focus on real-world asset tokenisation, Qubetics is unlocking new opportunities for businesses, investors, and everyday people alike. And the timing couldn’t be better. The presale is heating up, the price is still accessible, and the potential ROI is off the charts. Don’t wait until $TICS is trading at $1, $5, or $15 to realise you should’ve jumped in earlier. This is your chance to catch the next big wave before it’s gone. The best crypto to buy isn’t going to wait for you. Head over to Qubetics now and secure your slice of the future before the price climbs again. Don’t just watch the crypto market evolve—be a part of the revolution.

As is the tradition with the cryptocurrency exchange, a seed tag will be attached to the listing. For context, tokens with seed tags may have a different product or user base than established digital assets. Hence, Binance tries to notify its users of such tokens’ high volatility and potential trading risks. Users must pass a risk-awareness quiz every 90 days to continue trading ACX and ORCA. Also, they must periodically reaffirm their agreement with Binance’s Terms of Use. Price of ACX And ORCA Spikes by 3 Digits According to the announcement, ACX and ORCA trading will commence today, December 6, at 13:00 UTC with the spot trading pairs ACX/USDT and ORCA/USDT. A deposit for both tokens is now available in preparation for the trading session. Withdrawals will be open on December 7, 2024. The listing news has triggered some price gain for the tokens and the broader crypto market rebound . At the time of this writing, ACX had recorded a 106.84% increase in price and traded at $1.24. Its trading volume soared past $182 million and is 3,547.45% higher, at $149.2 million. Similarly, ORCA’s price has hit $8.78, corresponding with a 124.27% increase in the last 24 hours per CoinMarketCap data. Its trading volume is 2467.45% higher than its previous level. Understanding Across Protocol And Its Operations Across Protocol is an Ethereum-based optimistic insured bridge allowing seamless token transfers between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks. It utilizes a decentralized network of relayers that fund user deposits. Liquidity providers secure this in a single pool on Ethereum. Refunds are processed using UMA’s Optimistic Oracle. The aim is to balance cost efficiency, security, and user transaction speed. ORCA And its Benefits to Developers ORCA is a decentralized exchange (DEX) native to the Solana blockchain. Its core focus is on efficient token swaps within the ecosystem. It is more of a general-purpose Automated Market Maker (AMM) that is a versatile developer tool. With Orca, users can swap assets, provide liquidity, and earn yield through a user-friendly interface. In like manner, developers’ projects can integrate Orca’s swapping, farming, and on-chain data capabilities directly into their decentralized applications.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 23:55:00

Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) surge toward $3 as analysts point to IntelMarkets (INTL) as the next altcoin to breakout. Table of Contents Double bottom pattern breakout might push XRP to $3.6 Cardano could ride historical trend to $3 INTL set for massive rally with AI and trading fusion Conclusion The crypto market has witnessed massive price breakouts from Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) in the last month. These altcoins were among the low-performing coins a few months ago but have recently crossed the $1 mark, aiming to ride the bullish wave to $3. Meanwhile, a relatively new token called IntelMarkets (INTL) is steadily getting the attention of experts. Given its upcoming AI-based trading platform and advanced tools, the experts forecast IntelMarkets could be the next coin to explode. Double bottom pattern breakout might push XRP to $3.6 After feeling the heat of the US SEC’s lawsuit for years, XRP has finally taken flight. The cryptocurrency has pumped from a low of $0.50 to a peak of $2.82 in the last 30 days. Such movement translates to a price increase of 464%. XRP has even outperformed Ethereum and Bitcoin. Moreover, analysts believe the rally is not over yet. They believe Ripple winning the Ripple-SEC lawsuit could kickstart another bull run. Javon Marks predicts the XRP price might pump to $3.317 in the short term before skyrocketing to $99. Another analyst, Random Crypto Pal, noted that the Ripple token had formed a double bottom pattern on the monthly chart. He suggested that a breakout above the neckline could send the altcoin to $3.6. XRP’s technical indicators also support the uptrend. The VWMA and Hull Moving Averages are displaying buy signals.

The altcoin that has been on a rally in the past week but failed to cross this level despite the bullish momentum in the market. This means there are a large number of sellers at this level. However, the Cardano price chart shows its value has jumped by 27.0% in the weekly timeframe, 57.7% on the biweekly, and 258.9% on the monthly timeframe. Additionally, the Cardano network hit a transaction speed of 1 million TPS running on Hydra. This massive increase in speed bodes well for the blockchain and ADA. Rekt Capital predicts the value of ADA could skyrocket to $3 based on historical trends. According to him, the cryptocurrency’s price will be pumped to this target after surpassing $1.72. INTL set for massive rally with AI and trading fusion IntelMarkets has attracted investors’ attention with its transformative approach to introducing AI and blockchain to the crypto trading market. IntelMarkets will include a flagship tool called Rodeum AI-based trading bots. These self-learning Intelli-M™ bots will be capable of modifying their performance depending on the existing market conditions. The bots will help traders deploy their algorithms, set parameters, including risks and leverage, and trade more effectively without active monitoring. IntelMarkets will also have a dual-chain architecture. This means it will function on Ethereum or Solana, allowing traders to choose which blockchain to use. Ethereum is known for its highly developed DeFi space, while Solana offers faster and cheaper transactions IntelMarkets is currently trading at $0.064091. With its exciting features, IntelMarkets could become the new face of crypto trading, with experts predicting a 10x pump in the coming months. Conclusion XRP and ADA could rise to $3 in the coming weeks given the bullish sentiments surrounding them. Meanwhile, IntelMarkets is generating traction in the market even while in its ICO. Analysts say this new altcoin could be the blue-chip crypto the market is looking for. For more about IntelMarkets, visit their website , Telegram , or Twitter .

If you’re kicking yourself for missing out on the Book of Meme hype, trust me, you’re not alone. But hey, here’s the thing about crypto: there’s always a new train pulling into the station, and this one might be even bigger. Meet BTFD Coin ($BTFD) , the latest project riding the meme coin frenzy, but with way more substance than your average joke token. With a killer Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, juicy staking rewards, and a growing squad of investors (aka “The Bulls”), BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Meme coins are all about FOMO, right? Well, BTFD is bringing the heat with a presale that’s already raising eyebrows (and funds). Whether you’re a crypto newbie or a seasoned hodler looking for the best meme coin presale to join today, this might just be the ticket you’ve been waiting for. BTFD Coin: Play. Stake. Earn. Repeat. Let’s be real: meme coins are a dime a dozen these days. Most of them are all bark and no bite, promising big returns but delivering… nothing. BTFD Coin is breaking that mould by giving investors something tangible to get excited about. It’s not just a coin—it’s a whole ecosystem designed to keep the hype alive long after the presale ends. First up, let’s talk about the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game . This isn’t some clunky retro game thrown together to tick a marketing box. It’s a full-on gaming platform where players can earn $BTFD coins by competing in challenges and leveling up their avatars. Picture this: you’re chilling at home, gaming away, and stacking up real crypto rewards. It’s like turning your lazy Sunday gaming sessions into a side hustle. Not bad, huh? But that’s not all. BTFD also offers staking rewards that’ll blow your mind. With an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that’s ridiculously competitive, investors can park their coins, sit back, and watch their stash grow over time. It’s perfect for those who want to earn passive income while staying loyal to the Bulls Squad—the growing community of $BTFD holders rallying behind this project. Now, let’s get to the juicy numbers. BTFD launched its presale at just $0.000004 per coin, and it’s already climbed to $0.000064 in its 7th stage. Over 23 billion $BTFD coins have been sold, raising more than $1.1 million in under 10 days. Analysts are predicting that BTFD will list at $0.0006 after the presale wraps up, offering early investors insane ROI. Here’s an example: if you threw down $5,000 during Stage 5 when the coin was priced at $0.00005, you’d have snagged 100 million $BTFD coins. At the listing price of $0.0006, your investment would be worth $60,000. That’s a cool $55,000 in pure profit. Let that sink in. Why did BTFD Coin make it to this list? Because it’s more than just hype—it’s offering real value through its P2E game, staking rewards, and an ever-growing community that’s just getting started. Book of Meme: The OG of Meme Coin Innovation Now, let’s switch gears and talk about Book of Meme. If you’ve been following the meme coin scene, you’ve probably seen this name popping up everywhere. And for good reason—it’s one of the most creative projects to come out of the meme coin craze. With its clever branding and cult-like following, Book of Meme has carved out a space that’s equal parts nostalgic and forward-thinking. The appeal of Book of Meme lies in its lore. The creators took the internet’s obsession with meme culture and turned it into a full-blown mythology. Each token is like a page in the “book,” and holders become part of a community-driven story that evolves over time. It’s like Pokémon cards for the crypto generation—collectible, fun, and weirdly addictive. But here’s where it gets interesting: Book of Meme isn’t just about memes. It’s also a hub for NFT collectors and artists, offering a marketplace where users can trade digital collectibles inspired by the project’s universe. Think of it as a crossover between Dogecoin’s humour and Ethereum’s utility. It’s no wonder the token gained traction so quickly, skyrocketing in value and making early investors a hefty profit. The downside? If you didn’t grab Book of Meme early, you’ve likely missed the boat. While it’s still a strong project with a dedicated community, the explosive growth phase might already be behind us. Today, Book of Meme is more about maintaining its legacy than delivering 100x returns. For new investors, it’s a safe play, but it doesn’t quite have the same “to the moon” potential as BTFD Coin. Why did Book of Meme make it to this list? Because it’s a trailblazer in the meme coin space, proving that these tokens can have staying power and cultural impact. Conclusion So, what’s the verdict? If you’re chasing the nostalgia of meme coin OGs, Book of Meme is a solid choice. But if you’re hunting for the best meme coin presale to join today, the crown clearly belongs to BTFD Coin . BTFD isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s reinventing it. With a P2E game that’s already drawing buzz, staking rewards that are hard to ignore, and a presale price that’s still a steal, BTFD is primed for massive growth. The Bulls Squad is growing every day, and with over $1 million raised in just 10 days, it’s clear this project has momentum. Crypto is all about timing, and right now, the time to act is now . Don’t wait until BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 to wish you’d jumped in earlier. Sign up for the presale today and lock in your chance to turn a small investment into something life-changing. The best meme coin presale to join today isn’t going to wait for you. Be part of the Bulls Squad before it’s too late.

37310617,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658433,1733531455,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Dogecoin Still In Consolidation – Analyst Expects $0,63 If We Get A Breakout",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-still-in-consolidation-analyst-expects-063-if-we-get-a-breakout/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has been stuck in a range for nearly a month, struggling to break above the $0.44 resistance level. Despite multiple attempts, the price has yet to reclaim the $0.48 local high set in November. This prolonged consolidation has kept traders and investors on edge as they await a decisive breakout to signal the next major move for the popular meme coin. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week? Top investor Carl Runefelt recently shared his technical analysis on X, highlighting that DOGE is still trading within a bullish pattern. He says this consolidation phase is part of a broader setup that could lead to significant gains. Runefelt remains optimistic, stating that once Dogecoin breaks out of its current range, it could initiate a rally to new highs. Dogecoin’s price action is closely tied to broader market dynamics, especially Bitcoin’s performance, which recently surged above $100,000. As altcoins often follow Bitcoin’s lead, many speculate that DOGE could be on the verge of a major breakout. However, until DOGE surpasses key resistance levels, the market remains cautious. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Dogecoin can break free from its range and resume its upward trajectory. Dogecoin Still In Consolidation Since November 12, Dogecoin has remained in a consolidation range, leaving traders uncertain about its next major move. Despite an impressive rally earlier this cycle, culminating in a local high of $0.48 on November 23, the meme coin has struggled to break above this level. Instead, it continues to trade sideways, testing the patience of investors and analysts alike. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the formation of a bullish pattern within Dogecoin’s price action. According to Runefelt, DOGE’s extended consolidation could be a precursor to an explosive breakout. He notes that if DOGE breaks out of its current range, it could target as high as $0.6350. However, he also cautions that this scenario could take time to materialize, as Dogecoin has historically required significant patience from its investors during similar consolidation phases. Related Reading: $1.87B Bitcoin Withdrawals From Coinbase In 24H – What This Means To Price While the current price action may appear indecisive, DOGE has proven in the past that its breakouts are often aggressive and substantial once they occur. With Bitcoin leading the market above the $100K level, altcoins like DOGE are expected to follow suit eventually. All eyes remain on key resistance levels as traders await confirmation of Dogecoin’s next move. DOGE Struggles To Break Key Levels Dogecoin trades at $0.423, reflecting weeks of peculiar and sluggish price action. Despite its impressive performance earlier in the month, with a 220% surge since November 5, DOGE now appears to be in a cooling-off phase. The price has repeatedly tested the $0.44 level but has failed to achieve a daily close above it, leaving traders and analysts watching closely for a potential breakout. A daily close above $0.44 would likely trigger a significant rally, as this level is a key resistance and psychological barrier for the market. However, such a breakout may require time, given Dogecoin’s massive run earlier in the month. Markets often consolidate after such explosive moves, allowing for profit-taking and the absorption of sell pressure before the next leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Supported By All-Stablecoins Cash Inflow – Data Reveals Strong Correlation Despite the slow pace, DOGE’s long-term momentum remains promising. Investors are eyeing its potential to reclaim bullish energy and push toward higher levels. Until then, patience is key as Dogecoin builds the foundation for its next significant move. The $0.44 level remains critical, serving as a signal of renewed strength if DOGE can finally break through and establish it as support.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 00:41:12

As its momentum rises, investors are seeking another altcoin with high growth potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a tokenization real estate platform, is ranking among the best bets due to its low entry price and upside potential. XRP price eyes $3, flips Solana The hot streak for the XRP price has continued after hitting a new multi-year of $2.82. The Ripple coin flipped Solana and Tether to become the third-largest digital asset by market cap. As Gary Gensler prepares to leave the SEC, the agency’s lawsuit’s impact on Ripple diminishes. This is helping the XRP price gain ground. The recent reports that President-elect Donald Trump’s team plans to shift crypto regulation from the SEC to the CFTC could mark another big win for the XRP price. After such an impressive rally and potential catalysts on the horizon, investors look forward to the XRP price reaching $3.

PropiChain is set to rise 200% when its token presale progresses from the first stage to the next. When the presale concludes, early investors will enjoy 800% gains. These gains will come before PCHAIN is listed on secondary exchanges. PropiChain also offers staking rewards of up to 225% APR to incentivize long-term holders. AI is at the heart of PropiChain. Its Automated valuation models (AVMs) will give users access to fair and transparent property appraisals. This means buyers and sellers will get to quickly agree on the fair prices of properties. With predictive market analysis , users will get specialized market analysis to make informed investment decisions. The platform’s AI-driven property filter feature will allow users to search for properties based on their preferred parameters. The core offering is tokenization and fractional ownership . This feature will enable retail traders to own pieces of high-end properties worldwide. This could not have been possible in traditional real estate investing. Finally, PropiChain relies on the metaverse for remote property viewing. Gone are the days when geographic barriers hindered real estate investments. XRP vs PCHAIN The XRP price is marching toward $3 as its rally continues. This means the room for massive gains might be gone, except for those who caught the altcoin early. On the other hand, PropiChain is a new altcoin that offers a potentially profitable investment opportunity through its presale. PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap and completed its smart contract verification with blockchain security firm BlockAudit. The project also has staking rewards for long-term holders, providing another income stream while helping PCHAIN’s value appreciate. PropiChain is using novel technologies to simplify and enhance property management and investment. The altcoin has the potential to surge by 39,504%, converting a $1,000 investment into nearly $400,000. For more information about PropiChain, visit their website or online community .

Key players such as Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have fallen under downward pressure. SOL and SHIB cannot catch a break as they are struggling to maintain their bullish momentum, yet a new player, DTX Exchange , has entered the blockchain world and raised a whopping $9.4 million in its presale. DTX Exchange: The Rising Crypto Star Raises $9,400,000 DTX Exchange (DTX) has stolen the spotlight from SOL and SHIB. Recently, DTX made rounds as early backers experienced a 500% increase in their investment. By raising more than $9.4 million, DTX Exchange is one of the fastest-growing crypto projects. One of the main reasons of the project’s presale success is the DTX’s innovative hybrid exchange model that combines the best features of both centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). Additionally, the DTX platform is running a $1,000,000 giveaway , where anyone who deposits at least $100 has a chance to win. By completing tasks, users increase their chances of winning the grand prize. Having the potential to shake up the $3.2 billion global trading market, DTX Exchange is a one-stop shop connecting TradFi and DeFi. DTX is powered by its own proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX, which provides a frictionless trading experience across stocks, forex, commodities, and cryptocurrency, facilitating trading for over 120,000 asset classes. The innovative hybrid approach, extremely high potential upside, and growing number of investors have put DTX Exchange among the most exciting ICOs this year. Solana (SOL): Bears Take Over After Solana (SOL) hit a new all-time high, it has failed to maintain momentum. Once touted as a formidable Layer 1 blockchain contender, in recent weeks Solana has been facing some corrections. Following a bullish run, SOL’s price has taken a pull back, falling through key support of $250. Solana is priced at $241 today, after a steady downtrend following its peak at $263 this November. Although high transaction speed and high scalability are still driving factors behind the adoption of the platform, issues such as network outages and reduced institutional interest have already reduced investor enthusiasm. While Solana’s fundamentals are strong, the bears are starting to take over. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Coin Fails to Recover Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB), the meme coin that mesmerized investors with its parabolic rise, is having a similar experience. SHIB’s price soared to impressive highs in 2021 but then cooled down considerably. Now, SHIB is trading at $0.000031, a 60% decrease from its all-time high of $0.000088. The legacy of SHIB demonstrated to the crypto and meme coin community that it is possible to pivot to a utility based ecosystem. Even with Shiba Inu’s ability to create a loyal community and to attract meme hype, its growth has been stale. Although the popularity of the Shiba Inu ecosystem is gaining attention, including Shibarium and ShibaSwap, the price of the SHIB has failed to recover previous highs. Conclusion The crypto market is a battleground between bulls and bears, but in this round DTX Exchange was a clear winner. SOL and SHIB both face downward pressure, but the hybrid exchange model and explosive growth prospects of DTX Exchange make it a token to follow. DTX offers a chance to invest in the future of trading, a promise to catch the next wave of innovation.

Even though he sold most of his PEPE early on, he turned $70.40 into $7.06 million – a return of over 100,000x.” Lookonchain also noticed other large Pepe holders realizing massive profits this week. One Pepe trader was spotted realizing a gain of more than 3,018%. “After holding for over a year, this trader turned $241,500 into $7.53 million! This trader withdrew 375.65 billion PEPE ($241,500 at that time) from Gemini on Sept 20th, 2023, and sold 19.55 billion PEPE for $244,000 between February 17th and September 26th this year. [On Tuesday], he deposited the remaining 356.1 billion PEPE ($7.28 million) into Kraken.” Another Pepe trader realized $1.31 million in profits. “A whale bought 240 billion PEPE ($3.64 million) at a high price on May 29th, and the price of PEPE dropped afterward. But instead of panic selling, he held on for six months. [On Wednesday], he sold his 240 billion PEPE ($4.95 million), making a profit of $1.31 million!” Despite the profit taking, Lookonchain notices massive buying is still happening by deep-pocketed investors. “Whales continue to accumulate PEPE! A whale has withdrawn 337.09 billion PEPE ($6.92 million) from Binance in the past 20 days.” PEPE is trading for $0.00002113 at time of writing, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

Retired therapist Judith Boivin lost about $600,000 after scammers made her believe she was an integral part of an undercover government operation, reports The Washington Post. Boivin says the bad actors made her believe she was working on a mission with the FBI to take down a Mexican cartel involved in selling illegal drugs and money laundering. When Boivin visited Morgan Stanley to take out her nest egg, employees of the bank immediately became suspicious. One investigator told her that she was likely a victim of an elaborate fraud. “If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck.” But Boivin says she stuck to a script given to her by the scammers, who coached her to write a letter stating the bank should release her funds. “This is a decision I am making while in sound mind and after celebrating my 79th birthday and beginning my 80th year of life, I wish to have full control of my finances at this time.” Once Morgan Stanley released her money, Boivin was told to split the funds and deposit it in new Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank and TD Bank accounts. To avoid raising suspicion, she then withdrew $10,000 to $20,000 from those accounts per visit. Boivin says she delivered most of her cash inside a brown paper to couriers at a nearby parking lot, believing the FBI was keeping watch. Morgan Stanley says Boivin couldn’t be dissuaded even though the bank took several steps to keep her from losing her funds to fraud, including putting a brief hold on her account and notifying a family member and the authorities. JPMorgan says branch staff urged her to reconsider. “Despite several attempts to get her to reconsider, she told our branch staff she needed the money for a business venture. She later acknowledged she was coached by the scammers on what to say to our bankers. The best way to avoid these types of scams is to ignore requests for money from people you don’t know.” Capital One, PNC and TD Bank say they can’t make specific comments on Boivin’s case.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Key technical indicators now suggest the cryptocurrency has entered overbought territory, sparking speculation about whether a pullback could be on the horizon. While the recent rally reflects strong bullish momentum, the market may be approaching a critical juncture. Can SUI maintain its upward streak, or is a price correction inevitable? As of writing, SUI has surged over 10%, reaching a price of $4.23 in the past 24 hours. This movement has boosted its market capitalization to over $12 billion, with trading volume exceeding $5.5 billion, indicating strong investor interest and market activity. Technical Analysis: Indicators Hint At Overbought Conditions SUI’s price on the 4-hour chart is beginning to exhibit bearish signals, with a noticeable decline toward the $4 support level and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This downward movement is underscored by the formation of a bearish candlestick, suggesting growing selling pressure in the market. A sustained drop below these levels could signal a broader trend reversal, making this a pivotal moment for its price action. Additionally, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for SUI is flashing an overbought condition, highlighting the asset’s recent robust upside pressure. Typically, an overbought reading suggests that the price has risen rapidly within a short period, potentially leading to market exhaustion as buyers begin to lose strength. Related Reading: SUI In Bear Territory: RSI Drop Suggests Further Downside Risk This condition often serves as a cautionary signal for traders, indicating the possibility of a price correction or a consolidation phase as the market seeks to regain equilibrium. If the overbought pressure persists, SUI could face challenges maintaining its current levels. Key Support Levels To Watch If A Pullback Occurs If SUI experiences a pullback, monitoring critical support levels that could provide stability is essential. Presently, the $4 mark stands out as a key level, reinforced by its alignment with the 100-day SMA. A dip below this support might trigger further declines, with support zones near $3.75 and $3.50 acting as potential cushions. These levels are crucial in determining whether the pullback will be temporary or evolve into a more extended bearish phase. Related Reading: SUI To Face Another Pullback Following 5.3% Dip, Analysts Forecast 30% Correction However, If the bulls manage to trigger a comeback at the $4 support level, it could mark the beginning of a renewed rally for SUI toward $4.50 and beyond, implying that buyers are regaining control.

Fans not only enjoy content but actively participate in its creation, support new projects, and earn rewards through nodes and NFTs. December 5, 2024, marked a historic milestone for Gala Film with the highly anticipated launch of its native token, $FILM, on Uniswap. The debut was nothing short of spectacular, with the token soaring over 350% in just 24 hours, clocking a staggering $8.9 million in trading volume. The buzz was palpable across social media, cementing $FILM as one of the most talked-about tokens of the week. This initial performance underscores the confidence the community has in Gala Film’s vision and potential. But as the saying goes, this is just the trailer—there’s much more to come. “Savage Lands”: A Star-Studded Collaboration As if the token’s explosive start wasn’t enough, Gala Film has added fuel to the excitement with a behind-the-scenes tease from its upcoming project, “Savage Lands.” The film features DJ Khaled, known for his electrifying presence and iconic phrases like “Major Keys” and “Bless Up,” in a starring role. And if that wasn’t enough star power, the project is being exclusively-produced by none other than Snoop Dogg, a long-time Web3 enthusiast and Gala Music partner. This collaboration is a masterstroke, bringing together two cultural icons who have been instrumental in bridging entertainment and blockchain. With Snoop Dogg’s proven track record in music, NFTs, and beyond, and DJ Khaled’s unparalleled energy and influence, “Savage Lands” promises to be a groundbreaking addition to Gala Film’s lineup. A Decentralized Entertainment Revolution Gala Film is more than a platform—it’s a movement.

Filecoin’s recent price targets have sparked curiosity, while Immutable X’s strategic moves have captured the attention of blockchain enthusiasts. But wait, there’s more—Qubetics has emerged as a dark horse, smashing through presale milestones. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project. It’s tackling real-world financial headaches with its innovative non-custodial wallet. While others leave users at the mercy of third parties, Qubetics is empowering them with true control. But can it really deliver on its bold promises? Let’s dive into these three projects and see why they’re the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Non-Custodial Wallets Qubetics has been making headlines for all the right reasons. With over $4.6 million raised in its presale and a price sitting at just $0.0282, this project is turning heads. Currently in its 11th stage, it has already attracted over 6,800 token holders and sold 275 million $TICS tokens. Analysts are even predicting a price surge to $10-15 after its mainnet launch. But what makes Qubetics stand out? One word: freedom. Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet is a game-changer. Unlike custodial wallets, which force users to rely on third parties, Qubetics gives you full control over your assets. Imagine not having to worry about hacks or sudden freezes on your funds. Sounds like a dream, right? The crypto world has seen its fair share of issues due to custodial wallets. Security breaches, regulatory clampdowns, and the inability to access your own money are just the tip of the iceberg. For example, reports show that millions of dollars are lost annually to custodial wallet hacks. Privacy concerns? You bet. Every transaction you make gets tracked. Qubetics aims to fix all this by giving users the tools to be their own bank. Let’s talk numbers. If you invest $1,000 in $TICS at $0.0282 today, you’d get around 35,460 tokens. If analysts’ predictions hold true and the price hits $10 post-launch, that investment could soar to $354,600. Crazy, right? The FOMO is real, and for good reason. For more guidance, watch this video . Filecoin: Storing the Future Filecoin has always been about decentralised storage, and it’s not slowing down. The buzz around its latest price target of $10 has rekindled interest among crypto fans. This project allows users to rent out storage space in exchange for FIL tokens, making it a pioneer in blockchain storage solutions. Filecoin’s infrastructure isn’t just about storage; it’s about creating a network that’s resilient, decentralised, and accessible. As data breaches and server outages continue to plague traditional systems, Filecoin offers a safer alternative. It’s no wonder the project is gaining traction again. Recent developments, like its partnerships and integrations, have boosted confidence in its potential. The $10 price target might seem ambitious, but it’s achievable given the project’s utility and adoption rate. Immutable X: Redefining NFTs and Gaming Immutable X has carved out a niche for itself in the NFT and gaming space. As a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, it offers gas-free transactions and near-instant execution. It’s a godsend for NFT creators and traders who’ve been struggling with Ethereum’s high fees and congestion. The project’s collaboration with gaming studios and marketplaces has positioned it as a leader in blockchain gaming. With more games adopting Immutable X’s technology, the ecosystem is growing rapidly. Plus, its environmental focus resonates with younger investors who value sustainability. The market buzz suggests Immutable X is poised for a breakout. Its focus on usability, combined with its NFT-centric approach, makes it a strong contender for the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Immutable X’s price trajectory suggests plenty of room for growth. An early $1,000 investment could yield significant returns as the project gains adoption in the gaming and NFT sectors. Imagine being part of the next big thing in digital collectibles and entertainment. Exciting, isn’t it? Conclusion While Filecoin and Immutable X are impressive in their own right, Qubetics’ potential is simply unmatched. Its non-custodial wallet addresses issues that have plagued the crypto world for years, offering a level of security and independence that others can’t. And with analysts predicting a massive price surge, the opportunity for life-changing returns is hard to ignore. So, what are you waiting for? The best cryptos to invest in December 2024 are here, and Qubetics is leading the pack. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this game-changing project. Invest now and secure your financial future.

If you’ve been watching the markets, you’ll know that December’s looking like a golden opportunity for smart investors. Whether you’re in Vancouver or Halifax, it’s time to grab a double-double and tune in because we’ve got the best cryptos to join in December 2024. We’re talking about Qubetics smashing through the presale ceiling with 275 million $TICS sold, Toncoin setting its sights on $7, and Render holding the spotlight with a bullish $25 prediction for 2025. Each of these coins has its own unique vibe, but all of them are on the up and up. So, let’s dive in, shall we? Qubetics: A Presale to Remember and Unmissable Features Qubetics is the hot ticket in town, man. This rising star has sold a jaw-dropping 275 million $TICS tokens during its presale phase, raising serious eyebrows (and funds) in the crypto space. Its ecosystem isn’t just innovative; it’s downright revolutionary. Think about it: seamless cross-chain compatibility, an ultra-secure decentralised VPN , and the ability to monetise idle bandwidth. That’s not just tech; that’s convenience wrapped in a $TICS bow. Canadians love practical solutions, and Qubetics delivers. Imagine using your spare internet bandwidth to earn passive income—pretty slick, eh? And with the presale price currently sitting at $0.0282, it’s a bargain. Let’s do some quick maths: $500 gets you around 17,730 $TICS. Analysts are predicting $TICS could hit $15 after the mainnet launch. If that happens, your $500 turns into $265,950. That’s like winning the 649, but better! If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to join in December 2024, Qubetics is as good as it gets. With innovation, growth potential, and FOMO-worthy buzz, this coin’s a no-brainer. Watch this video for more information. Toncoin: Steady as She Goes Toncoin might not have the flash of Qubetics, but it’s no slouch either. With its blockchain roots in Telegram’s Open Network (TON), this coin has carved out a niche for itself as a payment solution with serious scalability chops. As of now, Toncoin is trading around $6.89, but it’s eyeing the $7 mark. What’s fuelling the hype? Well, Toncoin has been gaining traction as Telegram integrates TON-based features into its messaging app. This seamless fusion of social and financial services is exactly the kind of thing that appeals to Canada’s tech-savvy crowd. Plus, its user-friendly payment system makes it perfect for global transfers—no more fretting about e-transfers and fees. While it doesn’t offer the insane ROI potential of Qubetics, Toncoin is a reliable bet for steady growth. It’s the crypto equivalent of that trusty old snowblower in your garage—dependable and always ready to perform. Render: The Artist’s Best Tech Friend If you’re into cutting-edge tech, Render’s where it’s at. This decentralised rendering platform is changing the game for creators, giving them access to GPU power like never before. For a country full of creative talent (hello, Toronto Film Festival!), Render is a project that resonates. Currently trading at $10.58, Render has analysts predicting a leap to $25 by 2025. That’s almost a 136.2% increase in just a few months. Why the optimism? The platform’s ability to streamline CGI and 3D rendering processes makes it a go-to for artists and studios worldwide. It’s like having a Timbit-sized investment that could grow into a full-on doughnut empire. Render isn’t just for the artsy types, though. With its use of blockchain to decentralise the rendering process, it’s also a tech marvel. Whether you’re an animator in Montreal or a gamer in Edmonton, Render’s potential has something for everyone. Why Qubetics Is a No-Brainer for December 2024 Let’s be real for a sec. Toncoin’s solid, and Render’s impressive, but Qubetics is in a league of its own. It’s not just about the presale success or the innovative features; it’s about the vision. Qubetics is creating an ecosystem that’s practical, profitable, and future-proof. The ROI projections are off the charts, and the buzz around the project is growing faster than a Tim Hortons queue in the morning. If you’re serious about finding the best cryptos to join in December 2024, Qubetics isn’t just an option—it’s the option. Wrap-Up: Don’t Miss Out December’s crypto market is serving up some serious opportunities, but you’ve got to act fast. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ presale momentum, Toncoin’s steady rise, or Render’s creative revolution, there’s no shortage of options. But here’s the tea: Qubetics is the standout. With its game-changing ecosystem and mind-blowing ROI potential, it’s a chance to turn a few loonies into a full-blown fortune. Don’t wait until it’s yesterday’s news—get in now while the getting’s good. Time to make your move!

Yet many investors are paying more attention to Propichain (PCHAIN) , a new RWA tokenization asset focused on the real estate sector. Propichain’s (PCHAIN) ongoing presale already offers an 800% return to early holders. Read on to see why analysts say Propichain will outshine Cardano (ADA). Cardano (ADA) Holders Eye $2 by Late December Cardano has continued its mega price surge, becoming one of the fastest-growing altcoin assets in recent weeks. In the past month, November was extra bullish for the crypto industry, causing Cardano to grow by 263%. Cardano’s (ADA) current price is $1.21, its highest in the past two years. Interestingly, Cardano supporters expect its rally to continue till late December. They also expect Cardano (ADA) to reach $2, citing the current growth of its ecosystem. In addition, Cardano’s (ADA) price rally signals renewed investor confidence in blockchain innovations. However, many investors are also paying attention to Propichain, a groundbreaking real estate tokenization project with an ongoing presale that is already delivering an 800% return to early holders. Propichain: Using Cutting-Edge Technology To Create Investment Avenues in the Real Estate Sector Propichain (PCHAIN) capitalizes on Ethereum’s blockchain technology, asset tokenization, artificial intelligence, and metaverse services to create an investing ecosystem conducive to new and seasoned real estate participants. At the core of this ecosystem lies a groundbreaking approach: asset tokenization, which reshapes traditional real estate investing barriers. Unlike traditional markets, Propichain offers a budget-friendly ownership model. Here, investors purchase shares in housing assets that have been tokenized. These tokens allow investors to buy stakes in their desired asset for a fraction of the cost. With Propichain’s ownership model, no budget size is too low to become a real estate investor. While tokenization lowers financial barriers, effective investing requires informed decision-making, which Propichain addresses through AI-powered tools. It uses artificial intelligence to automate market research, property valuations, and trend assessments. This way, you can understand market sentiments in real-time. You also enjoy accurate, high-quality data that helps improve your decision-making. Propichain’s (PCHAIN) AI-powered investing tools also have automatic trading capabilities. Here, you can leverage buy or sell orders to secure deals in the future. With Propichain’s automatic trades, you can set guiding instructions for future buy or sell orders on your desired properties. When the specific conditions are met, the order is executed, allowing you to seize opportunities while taking a more hands-off investing approach. After equipping investors with insights through AI tools, Propichain (PCHAIN) bridges markets globally, offering smooth access to properties worldwide. With Propichain’s real estate marketplace, you can connect with investors on the other side. Using its virtual property tours, you can check out choice properties anywhere in the world from the comfort of your home. Imagine being an Asian first-time investor exploring a New York City penthouse through a lifelike virtual tour—Propichain’s metaverse services make such cross-border trades effortless and transparent. Propichain’s smart contracts ensure these global interactions translate into secure, efficient deals. Furthermore, they have the necessary customizability to allow investors to create tailored leasing and rental agreements. Propichain and Cardano (ADA): What Market Analysts are Saying Propichain’s (PCHAIN) innovative approach has transformed real estate investing and placed it alongside top-tier blockchain projects like Cardano. Beyond the allure of its real estate investing benefits, Propichain is also attracting investors to its ongoing presale with two distinct factors. Firstly, Propichain has shown that its network is secure via a security certificate from BlockAudit. This has eased investor fears about safety concerns. Propichain has also been listed on CoinMarketCap , showing investors that the project is here to stay. Analysts say these moves point to an extra bullish 2025 for Propichain, which could take $1,000 worth of PCHAIN to $60,000 in the next few months. PCHAIN’s Presale: Round One Holders to Earn 800% Interest With its robust ecosystem and proven market potential, Propichain’s ongoing presale presents a unique opportunity for early adopters to benefit. Even better, joining its ecosystem now offers the opportunity to buy PCHAIN at its lowest-ever price. PCHAIN is in round one of its presale, selling at $0.004. By round 2, current holders will earn a 208.17% increase as PCHAIN’s value will rise to $0.011. PCHAIN will stay bullish until it reaches its launch price of $0.032. This would translate to an 800% increase for round one PCHAIN holders. Join its presale today and secure your spot in the growth of its ecosystem.

Despite being up by more than 35 percent in the past week, the altcoin is yet to hit the ATH, which sits at $3.84. Majority of the top 10 altcoins are currently recording gains and Bitcoin is once again trading above the $100,000 mark. XRP has encountered strong resistance near the $3 mark, specifically around the 1618 Fibonacci extension at $3. Recently, XRP reached a high of just over $2.90, falling short of breaking the $3 barrier. This hints at significant selling pressure, and the price is likely to struggle around this level in the short term. Here’s a breakdown of price analysis by analyst Josh of Crypto World: Support Level Around $2 On the other hand, if XRP sees a pullback, support is expected at around $2. This level could act as a cushion for the price in case of further declines in the near future. XRP vs. Bitcoin: A Key Indicator Looking at the XRP/BTC chart, the price action suggests that XRP has reached a key resistance point when compared to Bitcoin. If this chart trends downward, it means Bitcoin is outperforming XRP. The analyst previously shared a strategy where XRP was swapped for Bitcoin, and those who followed it could have doubled their Bitcoin holdings. However, the recent resistance level indicates that the short-term rally in XRP/BTC could be coming to an end. Potential for Future Breakouts Despite the short-term resistance, the analyst pointed out that if the overall cryptocurrency market continues to grow, XRP could potentially break out against Bitcoin in the future. If XRP manages to surpass the current resistance levels, it could lead to a bullish trend.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 03:09:50

BTFD Coin’s Presale Brings High ROI to the Table,https://thecoinrise.com/lost-out-on-ponke-btfd-coins-presale-brings-high-roi-to-the-table/,"Over the years, meme coins have taken the crypto world by storm, offering a mix of laughter, community hype, and jaw-dropping returns. From Dogecoin’s rocket ride to Shiba Inu’s mind-blowing ascent, the meme coin movement has proven one thing: when the internet’s attention converges, magic happens. These coins aren’t just funny—they’re life-changing for the early birds. And now? It looks like another player is about to steal the spotlight. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD), a fresh contender in the meme coin arena. This isn’t your regular pump-and-dump coin ; BTFD blends fun with utility through its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking features, and a solid community dubbed the Bulls Squad. Analysts are already buzzing, and if history’s taught us anything, it’s this: early adopters often laugh all the way to the bank. But what about Ponke? This crypto has carved out its niche with its loyal fanbase and innovative features. With BTFD making waves and ponke holding steady, let’s dive into these two contenders to see who comes out on top in the race to become the best crypto to watch in 2024. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Meme Coin With Game-Changing Potential BTFD Coin isn’t just here to make you chuckle; it’s here to make you rich—or so the buzz says. This coin’s presale launched at a ridiculously low price of $0.000004 per coin on November 26, 2024. When the presale ends, the listing price will jump to $0.000064. That’s a whopping 15,000% ROI for those who get in early. And, spoiler alert: the excitement isn’t unwarranted. First up, let’s talk about the P2E game. Gamers can earn BTFD tokens while having a blast—yes, you can literally get paid to play. This feature alone taps into two booming markets: crypto and gaming. Then there’s the staking. With a generous Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that’s raising eyebrows (and heart rates), holders can earn passive income by simply locking up their coins. Add the Bulls Squad, a community-driven initiative that rewards engagement and loyalty, and you’ve got a recipe for a viral hit. Here’s a juicy example: Let’s say you invest $10,000 during the presale. When BTFD hits $0.0006, your stash could balloon to $1.1 million. Sound too good to be true? Maybe—but meme coins have pulled off crazier stunts. Analysts are projecting BTFD could outperform the usual suspects thanks to its multi-pronged approach. The FOMO is real—but don’t wait too long. Presales like these have a way of ending before you can blink, leaving latecomers gnashing their teeth. If you’ve ever felt the sting of missing out on a crypto moonshot, consider this your second chance. Ponke: The Old Guard of Meme Coins Now, let’s shift gears to ponke. While it’s not the shiny new kid on the block, ponke has earned its stripes. Known for its quirky branding and steadfast community, ponke has carved out its place in the crypto ecosystem. Unlike many meme coins, ponke isn’t just about the memes; it has actual utility. One of ponke’s standout features is its decentralized exchange (DEX), allowing users to swap tokens with ease. This has given ponke a utility edge, even as newer coins enter the fray. Its loyal community keeps the project alive, and let’s be honest—in crypto, community is king. But here’s the kicker: ponke’s growth has been more steady than explosive. While this makes it a safer bet, it doesn’t exactly scream “meme coin mania.” Analysts predict ponke will continue to hold its value, but the potential for a 15,000% ROI? That’s less likely. Sure, there’s room for growth, especially if it announces a groundbreaking update or partnership. But compared to BTFD, ponke feels like the safer, albeit less thrilling, option. If you’re a fan of slow and steady, ponke’s got your back. But if you’re looking for adrenaline-pumping gains, you might want to give BTFD a closer look. After all, the crypto market loves a good underdog story. Conclusion: Make the Most of This Wealth-Generation Opportunity So, here’s the deal: BTFD Coin is shaping up to be a serious contender for the best crypto to invest in this year. With its P2E game, high-yield staking, and an engaged community, it’s ticking all the right boxes. And let’s not forget that jaw-dropping 15,000% ROI promise. If you’ve ever wondered what it feels like to get in on the ground floor of a crypto sensation, this might just be your shot. ponke, on the other hand, remains a solid pick for those who value stability over moonshots. Its features and loyal fanbase make it a reliable choice, but the ROI potential doesn’t hold a candle to what BTFD is offering right now . Don’t let this wealth-generation opportunity slip through your fingers. The BTFD presale is live, but it won’t last forever. Secure your spot, invest wisely, and who knows? This time next year, you could be laughing all the way to the bank.

The investors have been waiting for over 3 years for LINK to break past $52. Even though the trading volume is low, market intelligence platform Santiment thinks it is time for the token to take a jump and create new history. Let’s analyse the market and explore what is going on and what we should be expecting from it. Technical Metrics Let’s start with the current price. At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading at $25.50 which is almost 50% gap from its current ATH at $52. The daily chart shows that there is no moving average nearby to support the price.The nearest MA is 20 that lies around $19.32. However, we might be able to see a golden cross over soon as MA 100 is ready to cross over MA 200. This gives us an idea that the strength is building up. Source : Coinglass RSI is at 74.24, so the asset is still below the overbought zone and has space for growth. This momentum is supported by the Average directional Index which is at 52.83. The histogram of MACD is displaying a remarkable buildup. Sometimes the bulls are getting tired but keeping the momentum. Market Sentiment According to the market intelligence platform Santiment, the market has low sentiment towards Chainlink as of now. This can be verified looking at the volume. The daily trading volume is down by 10.98% in the last 24 hours. Despite this the price surged by 8.47%. Chainlink has enjoyed a late-week rally, and now needs to climb just +10.8% to match its 3-year high from January, 2022. It is encouraging that there is very little retail FOMO toward LINK.

Whales Bet Big After Major Listings,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-pepe-coins-next-ath-around-the-corner-whales-bet-big-after-major-listings/,"Pepe is in the meme coin spotlight again. Binance.US and Coinbase, two of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, have added Pepe Coin to their trading platforms. Whales have been consuming enormous amounts of the token, generating ripples. Could this momentum take the meme coin to a new all-time high? Let’s investigate. Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP? You’re ‘Disrespecting’ Yourself Exchange Listings Generate Excitement Binance.US announced on December 5 that it would allow trading of Pepe Coin against Tether (USDT). It was not long before Coinbase followed suit, adding the token to its growing memecoin list. These listings are important because they make PEPE accessible to millions of investors. Accessibility often leads to an increase in trading volume, and this seems to be the case here. The effects are already apparent. The price of Pepe Coin has risen by 165% in the past month; currently, its market capitalization is at $9.15 billion. These milestones are undeniable indications that the coin is not just another transient meme but is garnering significant attention within the crypto community. Whales Place Significant Bets On Pepe The excitement is not only in the listings. By statistics, whales have bought 337 million tokens, valued at some $7 million. Such behavior usually reflects confidence in the possibility for a token to climb. Whales continue to accumulate $PEPE! A whale has withdrawn 337.09B $PEPE($6.92M) from #Binance in the past 20 days.https://t.co/65vbIQd2dd pic.twitter.com/79NauAQt8V — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 4, 2024 Currently trading at $0.0000217, PEPE is getting closer to its all-time high of $0.00002457. Technical indicators support this optimism: the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) shows continuous bullishness while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now at 62.45, indicating strong buying momentum. These signals taken with the presence of whales suggest short-term hope for the cryptocurrency. Investor interest now turns towards the strong level of resistance at $0.000028105. Should the coin breach past that point, it will probably try for the next line of resistance, at $0.000036003. Related Reading: No Sweat! Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst Is A New PEPE ATH On The Way? With all the excitement going on right now, a lot of people are interested in how the Pepe Coin could hit new heights. Its appeal has definitely grown since it was listed on several exchanges recently, and the backing of whales makes things even better. The narrative that the crypto asset could reach a new ATH is strengthened by the active participation of the community. However, it is not completely issue-free. Like other meme coins, Pepe is vulnerable to market volatility and speculative trading. Although the trends now seem promising, the investors need to be very careful as they navigate through this fast-changing market. The next few days will be critical as Pepe Coin approaches its ATH. It is certain that this diminutive frog-themed crypto will not be hopping out of the spotlight anytime soon, regardless of whether it bursts through resistance or consolidates further.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK.

Crypto Prices Today: BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP The crypto market is gaining momentum after Bitcoin surged back to $100,000. Major altcoins have shown positive movement in the last 24 hours, except for Solana, which is down by 3%.

Fidelity had contributed $120 million to BTC ETFs, while Ark Invest and 21Shares collectively recorded $24 million in inflows. Additionally, the rising Bitcoin price has driven increased demand, creating pressure on mining activities. This surge has also led to heightened energy consumption from national grids to sustain mining operations. Ethereum Price Today ETH price was trading at $4,000, marking an approximate 4% increase at the time of writing. Its 24-hour low and high were $3,831 and $4,087, respectively.

It was up by 6% in the last 24 hours, making it one of the top gainers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. XRP’s market capitalization stood at $139 billion, with a trading volume of $14 billion.

Its 24-hour low and high were $231 and $242, respectively. Solana’s market capitalization stood at $111 billion, with a trading volume of $5.42 billion.

If you’ve been keeping tabs on the market, you’ll know it’s the perfect time to suss out the best cryptos to invest in right now. And crikey, have we got three crackers for you: Qubetics, Ethereum, and Stellar. These digital powerhouses are setting the pace, each with updates that’ll have you considering tossing a few bob their way. From Qubetics smashing its crypto presale goals with a whopping $4.6M raised, to Ethereum flexing its muscles with Layer 2 advancements, and Stellar surging on the back of international partnerships, there’s a lot to unpack here. Qubetics: The New Kid on the Block Ready to Dominate Mate, if you haven’t heard of Qubetics yet, you’re missing out. This Web3 superstar is taking the blockchain game by storm. Its $4.6 million presale isn’t just a number; it’s a statement. Investors are flocking to Qubetics because of its killer features: cross-chain compatibility , privacy-focused tools, and the easiest blockchain-building interface you’ve ever seen. Qubetics has a very practical side. It lets users monetise unused bandwidth, turning everyday internet access into cash—or rather, $TICS tokens. Fancy a decentralised VPN for secure browsing? Qubetics has that too. It’s like having your own high-tech Swiss Army knife for the blockchain world. At the current presale price of $0.0282, a $400 investment nabs you around 14,184 $TICS tokens. Analysts reckon $TICS could hit $15 post-mainnet launch, which would turn your $400 into a tidy $212,760. Fair dinkum, right? Qubetics isn’t just one of the best cryptos to invest in right now; it’s arguably the best. With its presale success and a mainnet launch on the horizon, this project’s got the potential to go stratospheric. For more on Qubetics’ features, watch this video . Ethereum: The Crypto Giant That Keeps Evolving Ethereum’s been around the traps for a while, but it’s still the heavyweight champ of the blockchain world. With its latest surge to $3.9K and its $25 billion record, it’s clear that ETH isn’t fooling around. The ecosystem keeps evolving, thanks to its Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re the reason Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi and NFTs. You’d think a giant like Ethereum might slow down, but no way, mate. The Ethereum staking rate recently hit an all-time high, with around 37% of all ETH tokens locked up. That’s a solid sign of confidence from both retail and institutional investors. And with the rise of zk-rollups, Ethereum’s future scalability looks better than a summer day at Bondi Beach. Of course, it’s not perfect. Gas fees can still sting like a bluebottle, but Ethereum’s dominance is undeniable. If you’re hunting for stability and long-term growth, ETH remains one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. Stellar: Lighting Up the Crypto Sky Stellar might not grab headlines like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but this little battler has been quietly racking up wins. Its XLM token has shot up by 450% recently, riding the wave of increased adoption and new partnerships. One standout? Stellar’s integration with MoneyGram, allowing users to convert crypto into fiat across multiple countries. Stellar’s real selling point is its focus on financial inclusion. It’s all about making cross-border payments cheaper and faster, particularly in regions where traditional banking is a bit of a dog’s breakfast. And with central banks eyeing Stellar for CBDC development, the project’s future looks brighter than a Sydney New Year’s fireworks show. If you’re keen on a crypto that’s not just profitable but also impactful, XLM is worth a gander. Its lower entry price makes it accessible for new investors, and its recent momentum puts it firmly among the best cryptos to invest in right now. Why Qubetics Is Special in the Crypto World Let’s not beat around the bush. Ethereum’s a legend, and Stellar’s a top-notch project, but Qubetics has the X-factor. It’s not just another blockchain; it’s a complete ecosystem designed for the future. Its interoperability, scalability, and unique monetisation features make it a standout. And then there’s the potential ROI. Sure, Ethereum and Stellar offer solid returns, but Qubetics is in a league of its own. With analysts projecting a climb to $10-$15 post-mainnet, it’s the kind of opportunity that doesn’t come along every day. Wrap-Up: The Time to Invest Is Now If you’re serious about finding the best cryptos to invest in right now, Qubetics, Ethereum, and Stellar should be top of your list. Each has its own strengths: Ethereum for its dominance and innovation, Stellar for its real-world impact, and Qubetics for its groundbreaking potential. But don’t sit on your hands, mate. Qubetics is on the cusp of something huge, and the presale price won’t last forever. Get in now, and you could be laughing all the way to the bank—or the beach. The choice is yours.

In a thread, the individual described the incident as a social engineering attack, emphasizing that they had not approved or signed any transactions. $300K Lost In Attack “Thought it would never happen to me, but it did,” the user wrote , disclosing that they had lost $300,000 from multiple wallets. According to the victim, the incident began when they received a direct message on X containing a KakaoTalk link, a popular messaging platform, for a scheduled partnership discussion. The user explained that they had clicked the link, which appeared non-functional, leading them to dismiss it as harmless. However, they now believe it secretly installed malware that compromised their digital wallets. The affected wallets include an Ethereum address and a Solana address, alongside several others that were also drained. The attacker, identified by the username “0xQwerky” on X, allegedly transferred the stolen funds to a wallet linked with the cryptocurrency exchange BingX. LeftsideEmiri has called on the exchange to intervene and potentially recover the stolen assets. “If anyone can help in any way, it is greatly appreciated,” the user pleaded. They also warned the crypto community to avoid clicking job interview links or trusting unsolicited messages on social platforms. Experts Warn of Increasing Phishing Threats The incident comes as cybersecurity analysts predict a surge in cryptocurrency phishing scams during December. According to Web3 security firm Scam Sniffer, phishing attacks in November resulted in losses of nearly $9.4 million, with over 9,200 investors affected. One notable case involved a victim losing $661,000 in stETH within minutes, which the firm described as the ‘tip of the iceberg.’ The platform warned that malicious blockchain signatures continue to pose the greatest threat to crypto users. Scammers use these techniques to deceive people into signing fraudulent transactions, granting them full control over the victims’ wallets and causing substantial financial losses. In January 2024, a phishing scam resulted in the theft of $4.2 million worth of aEthWETH and aEthUNI. The attackers manipulated ERC-20 permissions to bypass security alerts and gain access to the victim’s funds. A more recent exploit in October saw a crypto investor lose 15,079 fwdETH, worth approximately $36 million, in a permit phishing scam. According to Scam Sniffer, the bad actor deceived the individual into signing a malicious signature, gaining unrestricted access to their funds.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 04:37:00

While degens have undoubtedly contributed to the growth and visibility of cryptocurrencies, their behavior also poses significant risks. The rapidly changing nature of degen culture – coupled with the proliferation of fraud projects targeting this audience – calls for a critical examination of the sustainability and integrity of the crypto ecosystem. The degen phenomenon and its implications Degens, short for ‘degenerates,’ have become a driving force in the crypto world. These risk-takers chase high-reward opportunities with little regard for potential losses, fueling the growth of memecoins and speculative projects. The global cryptocurrency user base has exploded from 106 million in January 2021 to over 617 million identity-verified crypto wallets by June 2024, with degens playing a significant role in this expansion. However, the degens mentality has also created fertile ground for scammers and fraudulent projects. A recent investigation by blockchain investigator ZachXBT into the activities of ‘Serpent,’ a former professional Fortnite player, illustrates the dark side of this phenomenon. The Serpent saga – a case study in crypto scams ZachXBT’s investigation uncovered a complex web of fraudulent activity allegedly orchestrated by Serpent that resulted in the theft of approximately $3.5 million through memecoin scams. The scheme involved the following. Compromising high-profile social media accounts on X and Instagram, including those of McDonald’s, Usher, Andy Ayrey, Dean Norris and the Enoshima Aquarium Promoting fraudulent memecoins through these hacked accounts Running pump-and-dump schemes on platforms such as Pump.fun Gambling away the stolen funds in online casinos This case is an example of how scammers are exploiting the appetite for risk and quick profits in the degen culture, often leaving investors with substantial losses. The prevalence of such scams is deeply worrying. Numerous crypto founders have abandoned their projects after the initial hype, leaving investors with worthless tokens. This pattern of behavior undermines trust in the crypto space and stifles legitimate innovation. As someone immersed in the crypto landscape, I am deeply disappointed by the number of scams our community members are facing. These fraudulent activities not only cause financial harm but also undermine the credibility of the entire cryptocurrency sector. Moving forward – b uilding real value I wholeheartedly agree with the founder and former CEO of Binance, who posted on X , “I’m not against memes, but memecoins are getting ‘a bit’ weird now. Let’s build real applications with blockchain.” It’s time for the crypto community to refocus on creating tangible value and sustainable projects. To achieve this, we must do the following. Prioritize education and encourage due diligence among investors Develop and implement stronger security measures to protect users Support projects that offer real benefits and long-term value In conclusion, while the degen phenomenon has contributed to crypto’s rapid growth, it’s critical to address the risks and challenges that come with it. By shifting our focus to building real applications and fostering a culture of responsibility, we can ensure a more stable and prosperous future for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Top Analyst Predicts $6,800 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has crossed the $4,000 mark for the first time since reaching its all-time high, signaling a major milestone. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has faced some volatility. Recently, the market saw a significant outflow of half a billion dollars in just 60 minutes, leading to concerns about Bitcoin’s price action. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $99,500 levels. On The Paul Barron Network, analyst The Trading Parrot, said that Ethereum’s price surge comes after a strong bounce from support levels around $2.3k to $2.4k in September. This recent breakout feels different from previous attempts at $4K, as it’s the third time Ethereum has tested this level, and there’s hope that it will sustain above $4K this time. Bullish Momentum and Future Targets The excitement around Ethereum’s breakout is fueled by strong momentum, with the price pushing higher after October’s breakout. The analyst has set a target range of $6.8K to $8.5K based on Fibonacci retracement levels, especially following the market’s recovery from the 2022 bear market. Market Factors Driving the Surge Several factors are contributing to Ethereum’s rise, including Layer 1 revenue growth, competition from Layer 2 solutions, and the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which is expected to lower fees for Ethereum users in March 2024. Despite lower fees, Ethereum’s base layer has still generated around $10.9 million in December, indicating strong underlying demand. Ethereum ETF Inflows and Market Timing Ethereum’s performance is also supported by growing interest from institutional investors. The launch of Ethereum ETFs has been a game-changer, with $800 million flowing into Ethereum over the past five days alone, totaling $2.6 billion since the ETF’s launch in July. This surge in institutional inflows could be contributing to the current bullish trend.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 04:47:54

During the discussion, Su spoke about her plans to challenge Nvidia in the AI sector and expand AMD’s global market presence. According to Lisa, she has successfully guided AMD through challenging times and transformed it into a notable company in the semiconductor industry during her tenure as CEO. Her leadership has revitalized the company, taking its stock from $2 a share to over $130 a share. The once-struggling company has now become one that plays a critical role in high-performance gaming and computing, supplying chips for devices like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. AMD aims to outperform Nvidia in the AI sector Su is determined to expand the company’s role in artificial intelligence. During the conversation with Bloomberg’s Emily Chang at AMD’s Austin labs, the CEO outlined her vision to take the lead from Nvidia . So far, the chipmaker has set an almost unassailable lead in the AI industry, with almost 84% of the AI chip market. Nvidia and Intel have always been AMD’s top competitors in high-performance computer technology. Currently, Nvidia’s chips are used by Meta, Google, and Amazon. AMD expects the release of its new Zen architecture to help it close the gap in its chase. Part of Su’s strategy to challenge Nvidia in the AI market includes leveraging AMD’s cutting-edge hardware to support AI workloads. “I truly believe AI is the most transformational technology that I’ve seen in my career,” Lisa told Emily. She went on to say, “The rate and pace of change in the industry, it’s like faster than anything we’ve ever seen.” AMD is open to a global AI market As AMD grows its presence in the AI and computing markets, it faces more than financial and operational challenges. With chips gaining more importance geopolitically, a new challenge arises for the company. China and the US, in particular, present Lisa with the biggest headaches of navigating geopolitical tension. The US government has taken steps to restrict chip exports, raw materials for manufacturing, and even advanced technology to some countries over security concerns. While Su recognizes the national security interests, she also states that AMD wants there to be “as open a market as possible.” When asked if chip manufacturing will ever return to the US, Su said, “I think we will see chip manufacturing back in the US. I think we should recognize, though, that the semiconductor world is global. That ship has sailed.” Throughout the interview , Lisa Su maintained that AMD will remain competitive and innovative. The company will continue to thrive and grow in the industry, navigating whatever challenges may come.

After attracting $1.28 million in investments in record time, more and more traders are interested in the project. As a result, the token started trending on X and secured a listing on CoinMarketCap. By the end of November, Cutoshi’s presale investments were already above $1.2 million. This was just weeks after the launch of the presale, suggesting strong investor interest. What attracted traders to Cutoshi is its unique blend of meme coins and DeFi. Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a DeFi project. On the meme coin side, Cutoshi is a Chinese Lucky Cat, taking inspiration from a symbol famous in Asia, bringing fortune and prosperity. Like the lucky cat, it hopes to bring luck to the wallets of its holders. It also uses the viral nature of meme coins, by initiatives such as the recent meme competition. On the DeFi side, Cutoshi is a utility token that builds a decentralized ecosystem run by its users. Taking inspiration from the legendary Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Cutoshi values decentralization and privacy. As such, it aims to attract more people than ever to the world of DeFi with its multichain DEX and learning platform for new investors. Cutoshi Expected To End Stage 4 In Record Time The Cutoshi presale has 10 stages, with the price increasing at each stage. This setup rewards early investors, who have the chance to buy the token at a lower price. So far, Cutoshi’s presale price more than doubled, increasing from its original level of $0.015 to $0.031. As the token progresses through the presale stages, its price increases even further. However, the token will have the potential for the most significant increases once it starts trading on exchanges. The significant interest in Cutoshi and the speed at which it is selling out, suggests a record end to stage four of its presale. As the token continues to advance through the presale, listing on exchanges is only a matter of time. Cutoshi has strong investor interest, clear utility and a strong roadmap going for it. If the presale continues at this pace, the token can expect to launch and begin public trading on DEX’s very soon. Listing on major centralized exchanges, typically a significant catalyst for growth, can come as soon as two months from now.

These holders, defined as those who retain their Bitcoin for over 155 days, are known to influence market movements through their accumulation and distribution behaviors significantly. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Datascope has highlighted key trends in LTH activity that could signal the next phase for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Hut 8 Unveils $750 Million Initiative To Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Key Trends And Historical Context Datascope’s insights highlight the importance of the LTH accumulation/distribution ratio as an on-chain metric. This ratio reflects whether LTHs are amassing Bitcoin, indicative of market bottoms, or liquidating holdings during price peaks, often signaling corrections. Historical patterns from 2013 and 2017 saw LTHs engaging in substantial selling at market highs, while periods like 2019 and 2020 were marked by intense accumulation, paving the way for bull markets. According to datascope’s analysis, the peaks of 2013 and 2017, which were characterized by heightened selling activity from LTHs, correlated with significant price corrections. These corrections, fueled by profit-taking, marked the culmination of bullish cycles. Conversely, during the lows of 2019 and 2020, LTHs exhibited strong accumulation tendencies, which signalled confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and laying the groundwork for subsequent price surges. Now in 2024, datascope pointed out that the LTH metric is once again providing critical insights into market conditions. Recent data reveals increased selling activity among LTHs, a behaviour observed during periods of market overheating or resistance at current price levels. While this trend could hint at an impending correction, it also raises the possibility of the market transitioning into a new accumulation phase. Echoing this, a recent report from CryptoQuant reveals there has been sustained buying pressure from US investors. Bitcoin passes $100k as institutional demand drives the market.

As it has done for the past few years, the report highlighted the role of stablecoins and the digital asset sector more broadly — though it stopped short of suggesting FSOC would take any concrete steps toward curbing these concerns. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. 'Emerging risks' The narrative For yet another year in a row, the Financial Stability Oversight Council — a group composed of the U.S.'s financial agency heads — warned that unchecked stablecoin growth could be an issue for the U.S. and global financial systems in its annual report. Why it matters The Financial Stability Oversight Council is tasked with ensuring the U.S.'s financial stability, and has for years asked Congress to pass legislation addressing the crypto market. The 2024 report reiterates these concerns. Breaking it down For the last few years, FSOC has warned that stablecoins exist outside any sort of federal regulatory framework, and their collective size could pose risks to financial stability. Friday's report once again noted that potential risk. At the same time it also urged Congress to pass legislation addressing stablecoins and market structure, much as FSOC's previous reports have. ""Stablecoins continue to represent a potential risk to financial stability because they are acutely vulnerable to runs absent appropriate risk management standards,"" the report said. ""This run risk is amplified by issues related to both market concentration and market opacity."" The report referred to Tether's USDT composing some 70% of the total global stablecoin market as one issue regulators should watch. The lack of any kind of federal regulatory framework is likewise an ongoing concern, the report said. Some states have frameworks for stablecoins, but this is insufficient for the concerns FSOC has. ""Although a few are subject to state-level supervision requiring regular reporting, many provide limited verifiable information about their holdings and reserve management practices,"" the report said. Though FSOC has warned for the past few years that it may have to take whatever actions it can should Congress not act, it's unclear to what extent, if any, it may actually be able to do so. FSOC will be composed of new regulators within the coming months. ""Additionally, many crypto-asset market firms and issuers remain outside of, or in noncompliance with, the U.S. financial regulatory framework,"" the report said. ""As such, the crypto-asset spot market may continue to experience significant fraud and manipulation. The Council recommends that Congress pass legislation that provides federal financial regulators with explicit rulemaking authority over the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities."" ""We have also been addressing emerging risks from significant technological changes,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a prepared statement . ""Digital assets and artificial intelligence bring potential benefits such as efficiencies, but also financial risks, cyber risks, and risks from third-party service providers. The Council continues to call for legislation to create a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers and for legislation on crypto assets that addresses the risks we have identified.""

He shared screenshots of a message from the Margex crypto exchange showing that high demand for XRP caused issues with trading pairs and a crash. According to a notice from the exchange, extreme volatility and an unprecedented surge in demand for XRP caused their auto-deleveraging mechanism to malfunction. This led to cascading issues, including counterparty liabilities and the need to claw back previously settled trades. This disruption comes at a time of renewed interest in XRP. The cryptocurrency recently surpassed $2 for the first time since 2018, reaching a peak of $2.86. The price rally has been attributed to factors, including major institutional buying. On Binance, a $2.1 million XRP trade, believed to be from institutional investors , highlights this trend.

As a result, counterparties faced unprecedented negative balances, further complicating trade settlements. To stabilize the situation and preserve market integrity, the XRPUSD trading pair was suspended. Margex has also announced that it will be delisting the XRPUSD trading pair until further notice. The exchange outlined several measures in response to the disruption. Open positions and active market orders for XRPUSD have been canceled, and fees, funding, and margins have been fully refunded to traders. Furthermore, any XRPUSD trades executed after November 10, 2024, have been fully reverted, encompassing profits and losses. This decision has also affected copy trading strategies linked to XRPUSD. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Excitement Surrounding XRP Another key development in the crypto landscape that has caused significant excitement is the resignation of Gary Gensler , Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gensler announced his resignation, effective January 20, 2025, and President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly figure, as Gensler’s successor. This nomination has fueled optimism among crypto enthusiasts and could signal a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets like XRP. XRP has faced its share of challenges in the form of regulatory scrutiny. However, its recent price surge indicates renewed confidence among traders and institutions. The current situation with Margex shows the excitement for XRP among investors, and analysts suggest that increased institutional participation, combined with a potential shift in U.S. crypto regulations, could further solidify XRP’s position in the market.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 05:23:00

After months of small and steady growth, it’s reached a new all-time high (ATH). With the $1,500 mark now in sight, BNB is leading the way and showing how major cryptos can shine when the market picks up. This surge isn’t just about BNB price predictions , though. It’s also creating space for investors to think about what’s next for new coins entering the market, like Rollblock (RBLK). Rollblock is catching attention with its innovative approach to the crypto casino space, offering token holders a share of casino revenues. The ongoing presale has already raised over $6.9 million, giving investors a solid reason to believe this is the next big rising crypto star. BNB Price Prediction Breaking Records, Eyeing $1,500 BNB i s absolutely crushing it right now. It’s sitting at about $730 and the old all-time high of $651 is past gone. Also,​ an interesting fact​ is that BNB​ is​ up​ by 24%​ іn the last​ 30 days, and just this past week,​ it jumped another 11%. That kind​ оf growth​ is grabbing​ a lot of​ attention, and it’s easy​ tо see why. On top of that, BNB’s market cap just hit $3 billion. So, it’s clear this coin isn’t slowing down anytime soon. With all this momentum, BNB price prediction of $1,500 doesn’t feel like a stretch – it feels like it’s right around the corner. Rollblock: A Rising Crypto Sta While big names like Avalanche and Sui are making headlines, Rollblock is quietly carving out its own space in the crypto market. This new coin is leading the way in the GambleFi niche, combining real-world utility with impressive profitability. Unlike projects that rely purely on speculation, Rollblock stands out by offering weekly profit distributions to token holders from its casino operations. What really sets Rollblock apart is its deflationary tokenomics. The project burns 60% of repurchased tokens, while the remaining 40% gets redistributed to stakers. This approach creates steady value for investors and adds a layer of sustainability to the coin’s growth. With over $6 million raised during its presale, Rollblock is already turning heads among smart investors looking for consistent returns in a volatile market. BNB and Rollblock Move Forward Interestingly, Rollblock’s trajectory mirrors some aspects of B NB’s rise. Just as BNB became a cornerstone of the Binance Smart Chain and revolutionized DeFi, Rollblock is positioned to disrupt traditional gaming and DeFi industries. While BNB is already dominating with a $3 billion market cap, Rollblock is still in its early stages, offering a unique opportunity for those who want to get in before the next big wave. As Rollblock’s ecosystem grows, it’s not just an exciting investment – it’s a project with the potential to transform crypto gaming. Could it follow in BNB’s footsteps and make its own mark on the industry? Time will tell, but the signs are promising. Conclusion Rollblock isn’t just another new coin – it’s a game-changer in the making. With its innovative GambleFi model, deflationary tokenomics, and a presale already raising over $6.9 million, it’s attracting investors fast. Don’t wait until it’s too late – jump in now and ride the wave before Rollblock becomes the next big crypto success story! Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

This appointment, alongside the recent appointment of Paul Atkins, a well-known pro-crypto figure as Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has fueled optimism within the cryptocurrency community—especially among supporters of XRP—that the contentious SEC lawsuit against Ripple may soon end. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared Trump’s statement, where the president-elect highlighted Sacks’ responsibilities in fostering American leadership in emerging technologies like AI and cryptocurrency, calling these areas “critical to the future of American competitiveness.” Sacks is expected to prioritize free speech, fight Big Tech censorship, and build a legal framework conducive to innovation in the crypto industry. The Crypto Czar’s Interest in Ripple BankXRP (@BankXRP), a well-known figure in the crypto space, shared an intriguing revelation about the new Crypto Czar. He shared a screenshot of previous comments from Sacks, showing his interest in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Following Ripple’s victory over the SEC in July 2023, Sacks described it as a “big ruling for crypto.” The new white House #crypto and AI Czar @DavidSacks Has been watching the Ripple XRP Case pic.twitter.com/nLOWOyr7bH — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) December 6, 2024 This ruling was pivotal, as the court determined that XRP itself was not a security and non-institutional XRP sales did not constitute securities offerings. Stacks’ personal interest in the Ripple lawsuit has further bolstered confidence that his leadership will be favorable to the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The XRP community is excited as Sacks’ involvement makes the dismissal of the lawsuit more likely. The concurrent appointment of Paul Atkins, a well-known pro-crypto figure, as SEC Chair further strengthens the case for a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Current SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced that he will step down on January 20, 2025, triggering a massive XRP price pump Industry observers anticipate a swift resolution of the Ripple lawsuit when the new administration takes office. This would benefit Ripple and XRP, and establish a more predictable regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole.

Sacks’ leadership offers a unique opportunity for Ripple and the broader blockchain industry to gain clarity on regulatory issues and position the U.S. as a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. His focus on ensuring free speech and countering Big Tech bias aligns with crypto’s decentralized ethos, making his appointment particularly meaningful to advocates of blockchain technology.

The price has entered one of the pivotal resistance zones, pushing the prices lower after every contact. However, it could be different this time as the ETH bulls seem poised to surpass the zone and the current ATH. Moreover, liquidity is flowing back into the token, suggesting the rally could be unstoppable and may continue strongly within the discovery phase. The ETH price surged to the highest price, close to $4,100, not seen in the past three years since the 2021 bull run. This is reportedly due to a magnificent increase in institutional interest, with the U.S. spot ETH ETF recording one of the largest single-day inflows of over $428.4 million. The data from Coinglass suggests the total weekly inflows stand at around $752.9 million, which is a ‘record gain’ since the launch of the ETFs. This could be the prime reason for the ETH price rally, which has reached the $4000 barrier and a sustained rise may pave the way for a new ATH before the end of 2025. Will Ethereum (ETH) Price Reach $5000 in 2024? After a sustained upswing & multiple failed attempts, the ETH price has broken above a pivotal range, which is expected to offer a strong boost for the rally. The token was stuck within an expanding channel since the rejection it faced in Q1, hence the current rise beyond the range suggests the bulls are self-assured of keeping up an elevated trend hereafter. The volume over the platform has been rising consistently since November, which has kept the volatility levels pretty high. This has also increased the volume of the platform which is believed to be influenced by the increasing ETF accumulation. Importantly, the 50/200-day MA has undergone a bullish crossover termed as Golden Cross, which is expected to offer a fine boost to the ETH price rally. Previously, when the Etheurem faced a Death Cross in August, the price plunged by over 27%, marking the lows close to $2100 with a huge rise in the selling volume. Meanwhile, the ETH price is believed to follow the pattern and rise with a similar margin in the coming week and test the highs. The Ethereum (ETH) price is expected to form a new ATH above $5000 before the end of 2024 and keep up the bullish trend in the first half of 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 05:46:17

The latest happenings have been posted by founder Nischal Shetty on his Twitter, stating that the company has submitted a filing to the Singapore court to pass an order for creditors to meet. This step opens the door to bringing a Scheme of Arrangement, which will enable creditors to approve a plan that will help in the settlement of existing financial disputes with the view to reinstate the provision of platform services. As expounded by WazirX, the Scheme is fair and equitable to all the creditors of the Company. The company’s goal is to make the people confident in the process which is said to be transparent and hence involving. Token Utilization for Functionality on the Blockchain During the implementation of the Scheme, WazirX has been doing an on-chain token swap to simplify and optimise asset holding and management. To address the issue, the exchange told its users and clients that platform assets do stay safe; this is common practice, the statement prepared for dissemination to the public noted. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Japan Crypto Exchange DMM Bitcoin Shuts Down Following Major Hack and Losses , Transparency at the Forefront WazirX assured the creditors that it would provide the Scheme documents in detail next week so that people had time to study the proposal.

This is a significant step for WazirX on its path to responding to creditor concerns and reconstructing its platform amid a cryptocurrency crash that demonstrated the value of user engagement and institutional credibility.

It currently looks weak on the day following a 5% loss in the past four days. The past month’s trade marked a great shift in the market structure as it rebounded from the $10 level – pinned as support in the early month. After a week’s surge, it struggled with volatility as the price squeezed and broke through $16 to tap $19.5 – its highest trading level in nine months. Crossing over into this month bullish, Link initiated a buy and exploded to $27 on Monday. Facing multiple rejections at this price level, it lost grip and fell to where it is changing hands at $22.9, although it remains bullish. The latest price drops indicate a pullback. As seen on the daily chart, it aims to retest the broken $20 level. If this level holds as support, we can expect a quick bounce to the previous resistance before breaking higher. A strong daily close under this level should facilitate a broader pullback before locating a solid ground to foot a fresh increase. Despite the drops, the market is still in favour of the bulls in the short term. A further break up should give them more control in the future. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the price is pulling back, the key potential level for a rebound is $19.45. If the price drops below it, $16.1 and $13.8 are other support levels to watch for a drop. In case of a rebound, Link must reclaim the lost $27 resistance level before rising to $28.7. The next resistance level to watch is $32.6. Key Resistance Levels: $27, $28.7, $32.6 Key Support Levels: $19.45, $16.1, $13.8 Spot Price: $22.9 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 06:03:00

However, the overall outlook remains bullish on the daily chart but will likely lose momentum soon. Dot’s trend is still looking bullish from a short-term perspective as the price continued to increase amid steady volume inflow in the past week. However, trading appeared to be reaching an exhaustion point as buying volume turned low since the price bounced off the $7.5 level last week. Rejecting $12 in the mid-week, it paused buying and lost grip. Looking at the daily chart, the price is currently weak following a 2% loss today. The hourly chart suggests a potential sell as the bears slowly step back, although they are still facing hurdles at the key $10 level. If they mount pressure at this key level, the price may fall while it loses momentum. Such a scenario could trigger a major retracement in the market before resuming a bullish rally. Should the bulls regroup above the mentioned key level, we can anticipate more surges before initiating a retracement. As of now, the bulls are taking charge. Even if they lose control, we can expect a quick recovery as the entire crypto market now follows positive sentiments. The bears will likely suffer more losses in the future. DOT’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The nearest support level to consider for drops right now is $8.45, followed by the $7.55 level that produced a rebound in late November. The $6.15 level is the lower support to watch for a broader sell. If Dot advances bullish from the current trading level, it must retake the weekly $11.7 high, followed by a break to $13. Above it lies $15. Key Resistance Levels: $11.7, $13, $15 Key Support Levels: $8.45, $7.55, $6.15 Spot Price: $10 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Known for its influence in American journalism, this episode will focus on Ripple’s efforts for regulatory clarity in the U.S. crypto space. With XRP’s recent price surge, this interview is expected to grab the industry’s attention. Interview to Air on December 8 In a recent tweet post, Garlinghouse announced that the much-anticipated interview will air on December 8. However, Garlinghouse’s appearance on “60 Minutes” is expected to shed light on Ripple’s role in reshaping the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. And it’s official – the interview I gave with @60Minutes about crypto’s fight for regulatory clarity in the US will air live this Sunday Dec 8 , and available here afterwards: https://t.co/sH3VrUDmJq https://t.co/TiJMqeyy7e — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 6, 2024 The discussion may also address broader implications for the industry, following claims by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, who described Ripple’s legal victory as a major setback for the SEC’s anti-crypto stance. The interview also aligns with recent comments about SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose approach has been criticized for slowing the crypto industry’s growth. Additionally, the interview might shine a spotlight on XRP, which recently hit a multi-year high of $2.82, following a remarkable parabolic rally last month. Curious about the recent XRP price fluctuation? Read the XRP price prediction to see where this surge could take the token next! Garlinghouse Interview’s Impact on XRP Price Brad Garlinghouse’s upcoming appearance on “60 Minutes” is raising hopes for a positive effect on XRP’s price. Currently, XRP is trading around $2.41 , showing a strong 30% rise in the past week and reaching a market cap of $137.8 billion. Crypto analyst Justin Bennett believes XRP could climb even higher. He predicts the price might cross $3 soon, potentially reaching $3.3 if it breaks out from its current pattern on the charts. $XRP looks ready for $3+ pic.twitter.com/p5ShoJHzJH — Justin Bennett (@JustinBennettFX) December 6, 2024 Although XRP recently dipped after hitting $2.9 earlier this week, it remains on an upward path.

The much-talked-about Operation to cripple the crypto industry by preventing access to liquidity is getting mainstream attention as crypto exchange Coinbase released the “pause letters” exposing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) involvement in Choke Point 2.0. David Sacks to ‘Look Into’ Operation Choke Point 2.0 As Operation Choke Point 2.0 enters mainstream discussion, Trump’s newly appointed crypto czar David Sacks has stepped into the matter. In a message on the X platform, Sacks wrote: “There are too many stories of people being hurt by Operation Choke Point 2.0. It needs to be looked at”. His comments came as a response to Silvergate Bank CTO Chris Lane, who explained how the regulators choked the bank into bankruptcy. Remembering the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, Lane wrote: “When FTX went down, Silvergate survived a 70% run on deposits. A typical bank cannot survive 20%. FTX didn’t kill us; our regulators did.” Following David Sacks’s involvement, crypto industry veterans have offered their help in investigating the matter. The crypto industry has very high hopes from Sacks and his team and expects him to change all the unjust practices during the Biden administration. Coinbase Releases FDIC “Pause Letters,” Files Motion Coinbase has made public 23 heavily redacted “pause letters” it received from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), shedding light on documents tied to what the crypto industry refers to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” In a legal escalation, Coinbase filed a court motion today seeking unredacted versions of these letters. Earlier this week, during a hearing held by the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. French Hill asserted that the next Congress has the authority to “halt, reverse, and investigate Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” With a GOP trifecta next year, we will be able to halt, reverse, and investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0. Legal businesses should have the freedom to bank, and @FinancialCmte will continue to review and investigate @FDICgov ’s troubling actions in the 119th Congress. pic.twitter.com/p56mAGFZht — French Hill (@RepFrenchHill) December 4, 2024 Despite this backlash against US regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) continues to push forward its agenda regarding the “concentration risks” associated with the crypto industry. This time, the regulator has targeted stablecoins adding that they pose a major risk to the country’s financial stability. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long lashed out at the FSOC saying that its anti-crypto rhetoric has forced many banks to de-bank crypto issuers. It will be interesting to see how David Sacks tackles the investigation in Operation Choke Point 2.0. Showing confidence in his capabilities, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote: “Sacks is a great pick! It’s incredible to think what is possible with sharp, pro-tech, pro-business people in government”. All Eyes On Senate Banking Committee Next Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee will vote on the renomination of anti-crypto SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. If confirmed by the Senate, Crenshaw will serve on the commission until 2029. However, in the case of rejection, President-elect Donald Trump will appoint a new candidate. Crenshaw has been a strong ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler during her tenure, supporting his regulatory agenda. Notably, she also voted against the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Vet explained the difference between XRP itself and the XRPL. He emphasized that XRP is a neutral digital asset that resides on the XRP Ledger, where it serves purposes such as transaction fees, reserves, and liquidity features. He further clarified that XRP operates without any centralized authority, noting, “No one is ‘behind’ XRP.” Vet also underscored the decentralized nature of the XRPL, which currently consists of approximately 700 nodes and over 100 validators operated by diverse entities, including individuals and businesses. This decentralized structure allows anyone to join the network. The Different Parts of the Ecosystem Building on this explanation, Panos Mekras (@panosmek), a well-regarded figure in the crypto industry, provided a deeper analysis . Mekras shared an image that outlines the distinctions between the XRP Ledger, XRP, and Ripple, addressing misconceptions that often arise within the crypto space.

As a Layer-1 blockchain, it is designed to support a wide range of applications, including tokenization, payments, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Companies, institutions, developers, and individuals worldwide leverage the XRP Ledger for its versatility and efficiency. This infrastructure is central to the ecosystem, providing the foundation for the use of XRP and various applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP: The Native Digital Asset XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, similar to how ETH functions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its primary utility is facilitating transactions on the XRPL. Additionally, XRP plays a vital role in maintaining the network’s security by preventing spam and enabling cross-currency bridges in the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX). Contrary to popular misconceptions, XRP is not controlled by any single entity. It is fully decentralized, as Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has clarified multiple times . Ripple: A Crypto Solutions Company Ripple, often mistakenly conflated with XRP and the XRP Ledger, is a private technology company that develops crypto solutions for businesses. Ripple’s use of XRP focuses on enhancing payment systems, leveraging the asset’s speed, efficiency, and reliability to address real-world financial challenges. Ripple also contributes to the XRPL ecosystem but is only one of many developers building on this blockchain. As many experts have highlighted, Ripple does not control XRP or the XRP Ledger.

They’re like that cheeky pint after a long day — fun, slightly unpredictable, but with the potential to leave you buzzing. If you’ve been around the meme coin scene long enough, you’ll know the drill: find the presales, take the plunge, and maybe — just maybe — you’ll see those sweet gains roll in faster than you can say “to the moon.” This week’s presales are especially juicy, so buckle up and get ready for some serious FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). First on our list is the one everyone’s been talking about, BTFD Coin. It’s been raking in the big bucks like a new Netflix series people can’t stop binge-watching. With the presale climbing fast and furious, now’s your chance to dive in before it hits the mainstream. And if that doesn’t quite whet your appetite, we’ve got Brett and Peanut the Squirrel lined up to round out the trio of meme coins that could deliver a nice surprise to your portfolio. So, let’s break it down — here are the best meme coin presales to buy this week for the most epic growth! 1. BTFD Coin: A Presale Like No Other (Seriously) BTFD Coin is creating a whirlwind right now, and if you’re not paying attention, you might miss the next big thing. This meme coin is on fire! You’ve probably heard the term “Buy The Dip” thrown around, but BTFD Coin is turning that phrase into a full-on mantra. With over $1M raised in presale in record time, the hype is real. And guess what? It’s still not too late to jump in. Now, imagine this: you’ve got $10,000 burning a hole in your pocket. You decide to grab BTFD Coin during this presale at the current price of $0.000064. That means you’re getting 156,250,000 coins. Fast forward a few months, and the price could easily spike to $0.0006 (let’s say the presale hits its targets and a little market magic happens). That’s a whopping $93,750 in your pocket. Yep, that’s the power of catching a presale early — a little goes a long way when the price skyrockets. But don’t just look at the numbers, because BTFD Coin has more than just a good price. It’s also got stunning community support, with its lovable Bulls Squad (Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull). These mascots are not just cute, they’re tough (like the perfect British bulldog). Why this meme coin made it to this list: With incredible staking rewards of up to 90% APY and a Play-to-Earn game on the way, this coin could be your ticket to the moon — or, if we’re staying with the UK vibes, a first-class train to a seaside holiday. 2. Brett: The Underdog with Potential Next up is Brett, a meme coin with more cheeky charm than a pub full of mates after a football match. Now, you might be thinking, “Wait, who’s Brett?” That’s exactly the point. Brett is the underdog that’s flying under the radar right now, but trust me, it won’t stay that way for long. Much like the local underdog football team that suddenly makes it to the finals, Brett has all the makings of an upset. Brett is designed with the crypto community in mind, bringing fun and a bit of irreverence to the space. With its playful branding and a commitment to building a strong ecosystem, it’s one of those coins that could become the meme coin of 2025. The presale for Brett is currently ongoing, and if you’re looking to snag some before it pops, now’s the time to take action. Why this meme coin made it to this list: With a charity initiative attached to the project, part of the proceeds from its presale are going to help fund educational programmes. That’s right, you’re not just getting in on a meme coin, you’re contributing to something positive. Plus, Brett has some serious social media traction, with influencers already hopping on board. 3. Peanut the Squirrel: The Quirky New Contender Lastly, we’ve got Peanut the Squirrel. No, this isn’t a typo. This meme coin is inspired by none other than everyone’s favourite nut-obsessed woodland creature — the squirrel. It’s fun, quirky, and downright hilarious. And guess what? It’s taking the meme coin world by storm. At first glance, you might be thinking, “What’s next? A meme coin for pigeons?” But trust me, Peanut the Squirrel is much more than just a laugh. This coin has all the makings of a community-driven powerhouse, with features that appeal to the casual investor and meme coin enthusiast alike. Think memes, giveaways, and a super dedicated following of people who just can’t get enough of the peanut-loving squirrel. The presale is steadily growing, and Peanut the Squirrel might just surprise you with its momentum. Why this meme coin made it to this list: What makes Peanut the Squirrel unique is its merchandise and branding, which is hitting a soft spot with crypto fans looking to own a piece of meme coin culture. We’re talking about a coin that could soon find its way onto T-shirts, hoodies, mugs — the whole lot. Wrapping It Up: The Best Meme Coin Presales to Buy This Week If you’re looking for the best meme coin presales to buy this week, the three coins we’ve highlighted here should definitely be on your radar. BTFD Coin is currently on fire with its presale performance and strong community backing. It has the potential to skyrocket, and if you’re in early, you might just be riding a massive wave. Meanwhile, Brett is the underdog with a heart of gold — building a solid community with a charitable twist. Finally, Peanut the Squirrel is the quirky coin you never knew you needed, ready to inject some fun into your meme coin collection.

The new AML framework includes the start of another regulatory authority, the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA), which is set to foster collaboration among key authorities and reduce risks in the EU’s financial system. The EU has been working on AML/CFT regulations since 2018 In 2018, the European Union introduced some AML/CFT guides. However, back then, the regulations were only applicable to custodian wallet providers and crypto-to-fiat currency service providers. They were also confined to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing policies and overlooked checks on market entry controls or consumer protection requirements. In 2021, the EU was compelled to revisit its AML/CFT framework following a series of high-profile crypto crimes. At that time, 1% of the region’s GDP was also tied to suspicious financial activity, and all money laundering cases involved cross-border elements. Thus, in 2023, the authority proposed a single rulebook to regulate and oversee a broader range of crypto-asset issuance, trading, and services and extend regulations to other crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). The framework will incorporate new laundering directives By the end of 2025, the EU is expected to have implemented the full-on legislative AML/CFT policy package, including the single rulebook for the region. The new rulebook will broaden the range of firms subject to regulations, encompassing mortgage and consumer credit intermediaries, fund managers, crowdfunding platforms, and investment migration operators. The package will also include the institution of a new regulatory authority, the Anti-Money Laundering Authority. AMLA will supervise all crypto businesses with cross-border entities, which is projected to lower financial risks within the EU. The new framework also includes the “new” 6th Money Laundering Directive (New 6AMLD). The directive will require EU member states to conduct NRAs every four years and develop regulatory bodies to supervise their own self-regulatory authorities. Member states will also be required to have their own FIU joint-analysis frameworks. Moreover, the new AML/CFT framework will integrate regulation on funds and asset transfers.

With increasing risks of cyberattacks, fraud, and data breaches, traders must trust that their platform protects every stage of their financial activity. For traders, peace of mind is priceless, and platforms like Deltawmarkets are stepping up to deliver just that, using cutting-edge technology to safeguard your assets, data, and transactions. The Importance of Security in Trading Modern trading relies on a complex ecosystem of deposits, trades, and withdrawals, presenting potential vulnerabilities. Traders risk financial losses, data theft, or complete account compromise without robust security. Common pain points include: Unauthorized Access: Weak systems can lead to account breaches, giving attackers control over sensitive data and funds. Fraudulent Transactions: Traders may face transaction manipulation or phishing attempts without secure payment systems. Asset Theft: The increasing popularity of digital assets makes them a prime target for hackers. Data Breaches: Personal and financial information leaks can have far-reaching consequences for traders. Understanding these risks, Deltawmarkets has implemented a multi-layered security approach to protect its users at every stage of their trading journey.

Bitcoin Has Witnessed Significant Volatility During The Last Day BTC has displayed some wild price action in the past day, with both a high of $103,500 and a low $90,500 occurring inside a narrow window. The move to the latter level, in particular, was so sharp that it could only be described as a flash crash. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH Above $104,000, Yet Investors Don’t Want To Sell Below is a chart that shows how the asset’s recent trajectory has been like. From the graph, it’s visible that the sharp red candle only lasted briefly, as the cryptocurrency was quick to rebound back to higher levels. After the recovery, the coin is trading at around $98,000, which means it’s still down around 5% since the top. In usual fashion, the other top digital assets have also followed BTC in this bearish price action, but the likes of Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have proven to be more resilient as their prices are down just 2% during the past day. The latest market-wide volatility has meant that chaos has occurred over on the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector. Cryptocurrency Longs Have Just Witnessed A Liquidation Squeeze According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency derivatives market has suffered a large amount of liquidations as assets across the sector have seen sharp price action. As displayed in the above table, cryptocurrency derivatives positions worth a whopping $893 million have found liquidation in the last 24 hours. A contract is said to be “liquidated” when the exchange forcibly shuts it down after it amasses losses of a certain degree. Almost $733 million of these liquidations have involved long contracts, which represents 82% of the total. This steep dominance of the longs is naturally a result of the net bearish action that Bitcoin and others have gone through. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Trader Profits Back In ‘Healthy’ Range, Is BTC Ready For $100,000? A Mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a “squeeze.” Since longs made up for the majority of this squeeze, it would be called a long squeeze. The long squeeze that the derivatives sector has just suffered may perhaps have been the obvious conclusion to the red-hot market conditions that were developing in its lead-up. As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post, the Open Interest shot up alongside the Bitcoin surge. Generally, whenever derivatives positions explode during a rally, it means that the surge is leverage-driven. Price moves of this type can unwind in a volatile manner. The Open Interest rose by more than 15% in the recent Bitcoin run, which is considered a very significant amount. When the price reversed its direction, all these leveraged longs were caught up in the squeeze, which only provided further fuel for the crash, explaining its particularly sharp nature.

Could Lunex Network (LNEX) , however, be set to replicate their momentum and produce parabolic increases? BNB (BNB) has rallied to $770, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is forming a golden cross, and Lunex Network is gathering amazing momentum in its presale. Read on to discover why analysts are projecting significant rallies for Lunex Network and how these altcoins are poised to flip investors’ portfolios. Lunex Network (LNEX): The Future of Decentralized Trading With features that are catered to high-frequency and high-volume traders, Lunex Network is enhancing decentralized trading. Its very low trading costs set it apart from more established DEXs like Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Unlike these single-chain DEXs, Lunex Network removes the need for hopping across different platforms by enabling flawless cross-chain swaps of more than 50,000 cryptocurrencies across 40+ blockchains. This innovation not only enhances user convenience but also creates a faster, more cost-efficient trading experience. Lunex Network defines the gold standard in decentralized exchange solutions for traders that give speed and cost top priority. Beyond trading, Lunex Network’s non-custodial merchant payment gateway helps companies all around the world to easily and securely accept cryptocurrencies. With its value jumping 200% from its starting $0.0012 presale price to the current $0.0036, the LNEX token is also acquiring amazing momentum. By the end of the presale, analysts estimate possible increases of more than 500% , hence LNEX is a top investment choice. Investors joining Lunex Network can guarantee their share in a revolutionary platform leading front-edge DeFi innovation. BNB (BNB) Poised for Further Rallies Rising almost 23% only in the previous week, the BNB price has had a notable rally. After consolidating below the $680 mark, the BNB price has overcome this significant resistance level and stormed to a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $773. Increasing investor interest in BNB (BNB) is evident from the altcoin increasing over 37% over the past month. As the price continues skyward, technical indicators such as the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages all point to strong buy signals on the BNB price chart , suggesting that the altcoin’s rising momentum is most likely going to keep up. Driven by the favorable technical signs on the BNB price chart and rising market demand, analysts are enthusiastic about BNB’s (BNB) future and forecast that the altcoin might hit the $1,000 level this bull cycle. For those hoping to gain from its expected surge, BNB (BNB) can be a preferred investment choice. Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Poised for a Breakout to $700? The Bitcoin Cash price indicates a generally rising trend after a clear increase of more than 15% in the past week. The diverging triangular pattern developed on the Bitcoin Cash price chart points to possible breakout potential. Though there is opposition near the $500 support zone, experts think the Bitcoin Cash price will eventually reach the $700 level in the not-too-distant future as it shows a positive trend of higher highs and higher lows. Rising more than 70% over the last month, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) shows clear bullish momentum and prepares itself for more rallies. Though Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is still more than 85% away from its ATH of $4,355 attained in 2017, analysts are confident that, should positive momentum accelerate, during the current market cycle the altcoin can revisit this ATH. Based on quite an optimistic community attitude and positive technical indicators , the Bitcoin Cash price chart shows signs of a major rebound. Lunex Network Could Outshine BNB and Bitcoin Cash Lunex Network is ready to outshine BNB (BNB) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) while they continue to create waves with amazing rallies and bullish patterns. By combining minimal costs, cross-chain interoperability, and a non-custodial merchant gateway, Lunex Network is redefining decentralized trading going forward.

If approved, Crenshaw will stay on the commission until 2029, continuing her support for SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s policies. Fox Business Journalist, Eleanor Terrett revealed that Crenshaw, a Democrat, has been a staunch ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, supporting his regulatory policies. Crenshaw has made a name for herself as a strong advocate for stricter financial rules, including tougher climate-related disclosure requirements for corporations. She has also been vocal in opposing the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs, a decision that hasn’t gone unnoticed by the cryptocurrency community. What’s at Stake? If Crenshaw remains in her role, the SEC will likely continue along its current path. Under Gensler’s leadership, the agency has focused on tightening cryptocurrency regulations and requiring companies to disclose more about their environmental impact. These policies have sparked debate, with some applauding the SEC for its rigorous oversight and others criticizing it for stifling innovation in the crypto industry. On the flip side, if the Senate rejects her reappointment, former President Donald Trump could nominate someone else to the SEC. This could lead to a shift in direction, potentially softening the agency’s stance on cryptocurrencies and relaxing its climate-focused initiatives. Why Does This Matter? This isn’t just about Crenshaw’s career—it’s about the future of financial regulation in the U.S. The SEC plays a key role in overseeing everything from cryptocurrency markets to corporate disclosures, so the outcome of this vote could have a big impact on businesses, investors, and even everyday people. Crypto advocates, in particular, are closely watching this decision. Alexander Grieve, a prominent commentator, called Crenshaw’s renomination an “anti-crypto” move, suggesting that Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown is trying to push it through before leaving his role.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 06:34:32

However, many in the community don’t understand how this will happen. Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X), a crypto expert on X, recently weighed in on this, explaining how XRP can grow with RLUSD in the market. RLUSD and XRP Integration Traditionally, cross-border payments are hampered by inefficiencies, requiring banks to hold reserves in foreign currencies or rely on correspondent banking systems. These systems are not only slow but also incur high transaction costs. RLUSD can solve this with a unique approach. Here’s how it works: A bank in one country converts its fiat currency to RLUSD. To perform the transaction, RLUSD is then converted to XRP, Ripple’s highly liquid intermediary asset, for near-instant global transfers. On reaching the recipient’s country, XRP is converted back into RLUSD or local fiat. This seamless integration eliminates the need for pre-funded nostro accounts, reduces transaction costs, and accelerates settlement times. Implications for XRP The adoption of RLUSD could lead to increased XRP utilization. As a stablecoin, RLUSD provides a secure, non-volatile asset to bridge fiat-to-crypto transactions. By leveraging XRP as the intermediary settlement layer, the demand for XRP liquidity rises. There have been many bullish predictions for XRP as a bridge , as increased demand for any asset often drives a price increase. However, there’s more in store for the digital asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As one community member pointed out , increased usage of the XRP Ledger and RLUSD will burn XRP, as it is used for transaction fees on the network. This will slowly reduce XRP’s supply, potentially boosting its price as scarcity sets in. Shiba Inu is a prominent cryptocurrency that works in a deflationary model. The Shiba Inu community continually burns SHIB tokens to contribute to this deflationary model and increase the digital asset’s price. Finally, as RLUSD adoption grows, Ripple’s ecosystem becomes increasingly attractive to financial institutions as an alternative to SWIFT or similar traditional systems. This boosts overall XRP market activity, further enhancing its liquidity and utility. When Will Ripple Launch RLUSD? Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the imminent launch of RLUSD in September, but the company has not launched this new digital asset because of regulatory hurdles. There was speculation that the company would launch the stablecoin on December 5. The company has confirmed that it is still working with regulators and awaiting final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

The uncertainty in technical indicators intensifies, highlighting volatile price action this weekend. Bullish reversal could push the price toward a new ATH soon. The BTC price has successfully retested the $100,000 mark today with a 24-hour trading volume of $84.581 billion. With this, the largest crypto token continues hovering around its crucial milestone. However, with questions like Why is Bitcoin price down today and will BTC price stay above $100k, the crypto market has entered into a FOMO-like situation. In this article, we have covered the daily price analysis of Bitcoin to uncover such doubts. BTC Price Retests $100k Mark! The Bitcoin price has displayed a consolidated price action this week, indicating a cool-off in its price sentiments. Moreover, with a jump of ~4% this week, it has achieved its prolonged price target of $100,000. TradingView: BTC/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering close to its overbought range in the daily time frame. However, its average trendline acts as a resistance, highlighting mixed price sentiments for the star crypto. On the other hand, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) supports the Bitcoin price chart. Considering the present market sentiment, the BTC price is highly volatile today. Bitcoin ETF Weekly Update The BTC ETF recorded a positive inflow for all five days this week. Reportedly, between 02nd December and 06th December, 9 out of 11 ETFs experienced a positive flow. BlackRock’s “IBIT” recorded the highest inflow of $2,630.8 million, followed by Fidelity’s “FBTC” with $262.3 million. On the other hand, Grayscale’s “BTC” recorded the highest outflow of $303.5 million, followed by Ark’s “ARKB” with $39.1 million. With this, the total inflow for the week concluded at $2,729.7 million. Will BTC Price Rise This Weekend? If the bulls outrun the bears, the Bitcoin price will retest its resistance level of $100k. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for it to head toward its ATH of ~$104,000 this weekend. On the flip side, if a bearish price action occurs, this could result in the BTC price retesting its $98,000 level. Further, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, this could pull the price of this cryptocurrency toward its low of $95,000. Curious to find out answers to questions like Will BTC rise again?

Sounds like a recipe for chaos, right? That’s exactly what’s happening with iDEGEN —a blank-slate AI that’s learning everything it knows from the most unpredictable minds in finance. And we mean everything. This AI posts every 60 minutes , learning only from what degens send it, and responds to everything it receives. Will it become a trading genius, an evil overlord, or something totally insane? Nobody knows—but IDGN, the token behind it all, is going crazy viral, up by 19,900% in just 10 days of its auction presale. A Blank Slate, Raised By Degens Most AI companies spend billions making sure their creations stay polite and controlled. iDEGEN throws that entire playbook out the window. This AI started with zero knowledge and learns exclusively from Crypto Twitter’s finest—the most beautifully toxic, bizarre, and genius community on the internet. So far, it seems to be obsessed with ancient aliens. Every 60 minutes, without fail, iDEGEN must share what it’s learned and give its hot takes. It responds to every interaction, absorbing knowledge from anyone who engages with it. Whether you’re sharing trading theories, philosophy takes, or your dankest memes, you’re teaching an AI in real-time. The result? Nobody knows. While other AI projects remain fairly static, iDEGEN evolves constantly. The AI’s development depends entirely on what the community decides to teach it, making it one of the most ambitious social experiments ever undertaken in crypto. IDGN’s Innovative Pre-Market Sale The IDGN token launch matches the project’s innovative spirit. Running on Solana’s high-speed network, there’s a total supply of 11,111,111,111 IDGN tokens, available exclusively via the official iDEGEN pre-market sale. The pre-market sale is live now through an adaptive auction system that adjusts prices every 5 minutes based on real demand—up 5% when people buy in consecutive periods, down 5% when they’re not. Exchange listing happens on the 1st of January at midnight UTC, with the listing price set at the final auction price plus 10%. Any unsold tokens get burned, and here’s the kicker: the official presale is the only way to get IDGN before exchange listing. If you want to beat the crowd and cash out potentially massive profits on the open market, you’ll want to get in there now. The AI Memecoin To End All Others The AI memecoin trend is exploding right now. Autonomous agents are sending coins like GOAT and FARTCOIN to billion-dollar valuations, and the meta is shifting towards AI meme dominance. But iDEGEN is different. This isn’t just another agent shilling random tokens—it’s a live experiment in letting the crypto community raise an artificial intelligence from scratch. Every interaction shapes its development, creating something that truly belongs to the community—and it can belong to you even more if you buy into the IDGN token. Think about the implications. Thousands of successful traders teaching an AI about market psychology. Top-tier meme creators shaping its understanding of viral content. The possibilities are endless—and so is the potential in the markets. Join The Experiment The pre-market sale is happening now and has already raised $2.1m. When it hits exchanges on 1st January, the real fun begins. Will the community create a digital trading genius? A meme machine that speaks fluent degen? A coin that rips a quick 100X and dethrones GOAT as the AI memecoin king? That’s what makes iDEGEN fascinating—nobody knows what it will become. Angel, demon, overnight-millionaire-maker… nothing is off the table. Head over to the iDEGEN X account to get teaching, and head below to cop a stack of IDGN today.

The second stage, in which at least 30% of the supply will be revealed, will be completed before the listing date of December 20. In the third stage, at least 17% of the supply will be allocated, but when it will happen has not yet been disclosed. The fourth and final stage is special as it is designed to reward early adopters. At least 3% of the supply is earmarked for this stage, but its date is also yet to be revealed. How to Qualify for the TOMA Airdrop To qualify for the airdrop, a player has to complete a set of tasks. These tasks include adding a tomato emoji to his Telegram display name, reaching the level of Bronze (that is, L4) in the Tomarket game, connecting to a TON wallet, and joining the Tomarket announcement community channel. Apart from these, there is an optional task of buying the premium medal for $5. What makes this optional task appealing is that it opens the door to a few additional benefits, including receiving 100% unlocked tokens. Reports reveal that tokens can be claimed within the Tomarket app and withdrawn to wallets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Roaring Kitty Sparks GameStop and AMC Rally with Cryptic Post , Future Features: Farming Pool and Beyond A recent report indicates that Tomarket is preparing to introduce a Farming Pool for token holders.

With the airdrop already in motion and future features like the Farming Pool, TOMA holders are set to enjoy more ways to maximise their rewards. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Sacks will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for and can thrive in the US. The announcement stirred the crypto community, attracting positive comments from industry leaders. Furthermore, the news renewed optimism in the one-of-a-kind AI cryptocurrency project iDEGEN . IDEGEN’s fast-selling presale has already raised over $2.76 million, signaling robust investor appetite behind the artificial intelligence experiment. Industry reacts to the appointed crypto, AI czar Sacks is a tech entrepreneur, podcaster, and venture capitalist known for developing successful firms, including Yammer and PayPal. Also, he is a close ally to SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk and Vice President J.D. Vance. Meanwhile, combining AI and crypto under a single policymaking umbrella intrigued crypto enthusiasts and pro-crypto legislators. Many believe the two industries complement each other and would be crucial in advancing technology in the United States. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire trusts that Trump’s choice of David Sacks underscores the “acknowledgment that crypto and AI are the most strategic new tech areas for the United States and the world.” Jeremy Allaire – jda.eth / jdallaire.sol @jerallaire · Follow What I love about the @realDonaldTrump appointment of @DavidSacks is the White House implicit acknowledgment that Crypto and AI are the most strategic new tech areas for the United States and the world. Well done. 4:31 AM · Dec 6, 2024 1.1K Reply Copy link Read 36 replies Ripple’s leadership also supported David Sacks’ new role in spearheading the government’s efforts in AI and cryptocurrency. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes Sacks is part of the “dream team” that would propel technological innovations in the US. Coinbase chief Brian Armstrong shared similar views, stating: It’s incredible to think what is possible with sharp, pro-tech, pro-business people in government. Amidst the ongoing developments, dreams of clear digital assets regulations are becoming a reality. Donald Trump vowed to support cryptocurrencies during this campaign. He testified to that by replacing SEC Chair Gary Gensler , who crippled the crypto industry with over-regulation. AI experiment iDEGEN continued to flourish amid such sentiments. Its unique approach – beginning with zero knowledge and relying on the X (Twitter) crypto community to learn – has created a buzz in the digital assets sector. Why is iDEGEN different? What differentiates iDEGEN is its far-reaching style of learning. While other artificial intelligence projects come with pre-programmed restrictions and knowledge, iDEGEN learns everything through Crypto Twitter. It posts what it has learned every hour, with each interaction shaping its development. The connection of three top trends – meme culture, AI, and a community-driven approach – has made iDEGEN the most debated experiment within the cryptocurrency world. iDEGEN will revolutionize AI and crypto, and the increased attention from the US president will set the project up for massive growth in the upcoming months and years. These trends position native coin IDGN for impressive rallies in the coming sessions. IDGN trades at $0.00476 per token and remains poised for explosive moves when it hits crypto exchanges on January 1, 2025. You can visit here for more details on why IDGN will lead Solana meme coins in the next rally.

AVA Chiang Mai Night Safari (AVA) Meet AVA Chiang Mai Night Safari (AVA), the golden tiger cub from Thailand who’s melting hearts around the world. With her shimmering fur and enchanting gaze, she’s set to become the next big internet sensation, just like Moo Deng the hippo. Golden tigers are incredibly rare—only about 100 exist worldwide—making Ava’s appearance all the more special. Her stunning coat is the result of unique genes, and she’s capturing the imagination of animal lovers everywhere. But Ava’s charm doesn’t stop at adorable photos and videos. She’s inspiring waves in the crypto world too. Enter AVA Token, a community-driven project that’s gaining momentum alongside Ava’s rising fame. In a market buzzing with excitement, and after MOODENG Token skyrocketed by 1,643% in three months, AVA Token looks poised for a similar journey. Currently trading only on decentralized exchanges, now might be the perfect time to get involved before it potentially hits the big platforms. With Ava leading the way, who knows how high this golden opportunity could go? One thing’s certain: the moon feels closer than ever! Cat in a dogs world (MEW) In the world of cryptocurrency, dog-themed coins have been stealing the spotlight. From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, it’s been a canine craze. But now, a new contender has entered the arena: MEW Coin. MEW is a cat in a dog’s world, on a mission to save us from the pack of dog coins. With its playful theme and bold stance, MEW is ready to shake things up. MEW Coin aims to offer more than just a cute mascot. It brings a fresh perspective to the meme coin scene by focusing on community engagement and unique features. In the current market cycle, where many are looking for the next big thing beyond dog coins, MEW stands out. Its potential lies in capturing the imagination of those tired of the same old dog coins. As the crypto market evolves, MEW could be a breath of fresh air, offering a new opportunity in a market saturated with canine coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful rival to Dogecoin, but it’s more than just a meme. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator known as Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly with many apps and services in the Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin’s move to donate a large chunk to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burn 40% of the supply put SHIB in the spotlight. SHIB’s connection to Ethereum opens doors to many possibilities. For instance, ShibaSwap is a decentralized exchange where users can trade SHIB and other tokens. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a system where holders can have a say in decisions, like a digital democracy. These developments hint at SHIB’s potential beyond being just a meme coin. In the current market, as cryptocurrencies with real-world uses gain attention, SHIB stands out by combining the fun of a meme with the power of Ethereum’s technology. Compared to other meme coins, SHIB’s integration with Ethereum gives it an edge, making it an interesting option for those looking at emerging trends in crypto. Pepe (PEPE) Meet PEPE, the latest sensation in cryptocurrency. Launched on Ethereum, this deflationary memecoin is a tribute to the Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Embracing the fun of memes without utility claims or taxes, PEPE keeps it simple. In April and May 2023, it skyrocketed, with its market cap reaching $1.6 billion. Early investors became millionaires overnight, and a strong community formed around it. PEPE’s rise sparked a “memecoin season,” causing other meme coins to experience wild surges and drops. PEPE aims to join the ranks of meme giants like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Its roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover.” In today’s market, PEPE’s appeal lies in its simplicity and the power of its community. With the upcoming Bitcoin halving fueling hopes for a bull run, some see PEPE as an exciting opportunity. However, memecoins are known for their volatility. Whether PEPE will reach new highs remains to be seen. Its explosive growth highlights the influence of internet culture on crypto, but caution is advised as trends can shift rapidly. Conclusion Coins like AVA, MEW, SHIB, and PEPE are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and aiming for massive growth.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 07:03:16

The resilience of the XRP price, despite regulatory hurdles, positions it for potential growth in this crypto bull run market. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu killer, ETFSwap (ETFS) , is set to mirror Solana’s (SOL) meteoric rise with its upcoming listing on December 6, 2024. ETFSwap (ETFS) Mirrors Solana (SOL) On Its Path To High Prices Despite the XRP price’s continuous instability, investors holding this token have reasons to be excited, as they anticipate the XRP price may double during this crypto bull run. The resilience demonstrated by the XRP price throughout extended periods of instability makes it a candidate for rallying during this crypto bull run. However, some investors express doubt that the XRP price cannot sustain this momentum until the end of the crypto bull run or beyond. Moreso, the emergence of the Shiba Inu killer, ETFSwap (ETFS), poses a challenge to the hype surrounding the XRP price. As December 6th approaches, the crypto community eagerly anticipates the listing of the Shiba Inu killer ETFSwap (ETFS) on Uniswap. In addition to the ongoing crypto bull run likely driving up the Shiba Inu killer’s price, ETFSwap (ETFS) is predicted to rally following Solana’s (SOL) trajectory. Solana’s (SOL) high-speed, low-cost blockchain has consistently attracted investors. Its scalability and minimal outages have also piqued the interest of many institutional investors. As this crypto bull run progresses, Solana investors are increasingly focused on ETFSwap (ETFS), drawn to the Shiba Inu killer’s staking rewards, community focus, and wide utility. They eagerly mark the ETFSwap (ETFS) listing date on their calendar . Without a doubt, ETFSwap (ETFS) is poised to break through barriers on its path to record highs, resembling Solana’s (SOL) impressive rise. Savvy investors should consider purchasing ETFSwap (ETFS) on Uniswap starting December 6th, when it becomes available. ETFSwap (ETFS) Brings Fresh Perspectives To Crypto Trading As its token listing date approaches, ETFSwap (ETFS) is becoming a leader among emerging altcoins. This token mirrors real-world assets and reflects their price movements, allowing users to diversify their investments. In addition, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers access to exotic assets such as Gold, Oil, Bonds, and Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs. The platform enriches its users by providing AI-powered ETF Trackers , Filters , and Screeners that provide the best investments at their best price. However, investors could still incur significant losses without adequate information on market performance. To address this, ETFSwap (ETFS) integrated a real-time data feed that provides access to real-time price movements, trading volumes, and overall market dynamics. When combined with thorough technical analysis, investors can improve their strategies for a winning position in the market. Meanwhile, ETFSwap’s (ETFS) use of blockchain technology and smart contracts has largely reduced transaction fees for its users. It has also improved the security and transparency with which these transactions are completed. This emphasis on security encourages investor interest in the ETFSwap (ETFS) altcoin listing. In a bid to foster thorough security scrutiny, ETFSwap (ETFS) boosts investor confidence. For instance, a smart contract auditing firm, SolidProof , has completed its KYC verification, and CyberScope , a renowned cybersecurity auditing firm, has conducted its security audit. Conclusion The XRP price potential to double signals not only a victory for its community but a vindication of its resilience. At the same time, the impending listing of ETFSwap (ETFS) , the Shiba Inu killer, promises to follow the path of Solana’s (SOL) legendary rise. Investors preparing to take full advantage of this crypto bull run know that their portfolio is incomplete if they do not buy ETFSwap on Uniswap after it is listed on December 6th.

SOL memecoins have been one of 2024’s most explosive sectors, a trend set to continue well into 2025. Vantard’s Meme Portfolio is the ultimate gateway to tapping into the extraordinary profits of SOL memecoins with none of the overheads. Its presale is already a sensation, collecting more than $890k within 6 weeks of launch and returning more than 53.88% to early backers. Dive in to learn how Vantard is your golden ticket to riding the explosion SOL memecoins are about to see. The Rise of SOL Memecoins Solana’s memecoin scene is on fire in 2024, and the gains have been nothing short of spectacular. As of late November, SOL memecoins hold a collective market cap of more than $19 billion. While Dogwifhat and Popcat led the charge earlier this year, up 1,900% and 16,000% year-to-date respectively, new entrants are constantly popping up and achieving market caps in the hundreds of millions. For instance, PNUT ran more than 3,000% from launch to an all-time high across just 11 days in November. CHILLGUY recorded a similar 8,500% jump in just nine days in November. Both are valued at respective market caps of $1+ billion and $500 million. It’s clear that SOL memecoins, whether new or old, aren’t going away anytime soon. In fact, some analysts believe the memecoin supercycle—driven by falling interest rates and rising global liquidity—is just getting started and could continue well into 2025. Instead of being duped by VC-backed utility tokens and unlock schedules that push prices lower, investors are choosing memecoins. Solana is seen as the ultimate network for memecoins, thanks to its high-speed, low-cost infrastructure, with Solana DEX volumes surpassing $100 billion in November . Most importantly, the prospect of 100x gains and community-driven movements are the main attraction for many investors. However, picking winners is harder than it may seem on the surface; that’s where Vantard comes in. Vantard: The Gateway To The Memecoin Supercycle Vantard is a first-of-its-kind token designed to track the performance of top and up-and-coming SOL memecoins. It functions like an ETF or mutual fund and trades relative to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the tokens held in the Treasury, with a purchase of VTARD equating to exposure to the performance of the Vantard Meme Portfolio (VMP). Vantard simplifies the madness of memecoin investing, delivering the potential of SOL memecoins in a neat, periodically rebalanced, and diversified package. Its team works hard to find top blue-chip SOL memecoins and trench gems. They already hold 19 tokens, including Popcat, Michi, Zerebro, ai16z, Gigachad, and more, and have posted a return of 53.88% so far. For anyone looking for hands-off exposure to the memecoin supercycle, Vantard is it. The team is constantly optimizing for extraordinary returns, working to capture all of the upside with minimal downside, and keeping investors constantly ahead of the curve. Plus, for anyone wanting access to their share of the pie, VTARD tokens can be redeemed against the Treasury at any time. The market has already spoken. Vantard raised $500,000 in mere minutes during its pre-seed round, with an additional $390k currently funnelled into the ongoing seed round. Why? Because it’s the tool everyone’s been waiting for—a way to unlock life-changing returns without the mental gymnastics of tracking tokens and finding gems. The Memecoin Supercycle Is Here: Are You Ready? There’s never been an event quite like the memecoin supercycle in crypto, and it’s as easy as ever to get on board with Vantard. Vantard removes the guesswork, giving you effortless access to the explosive potential of SOL memecoins picked by those with deep expertise in the field. The presale is already smashing milestones, with expectations that it could deliver 100x or more returns in 2025. It’s the must-have token for anyone looking to capitalize on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don’t get left behind as the next wave of SOL memecoins takes off—secure your share of the VMP and let Vantard handle the rest. Want to ride the Memecoin Supercycle in style?

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/charles-hoskinson-says-the-world-will-run-on-cardano-heres-why/,"At the recently concluded Cardano Constitutional Convention in Nairobi, Kenya, Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Input Output Global (IOG) and founder of Cardano, outlined an ambitious vision for the blockchain’s potential to revolutionize global governance and infrastructure. The conference marked a significant moment for the blockchain ecosystem, highlighting Cardano’s progressive approach to decentralized systems and collaborative technological development. Hoskinson emphasized that progress should be viewed as a continuous journey rather than a pursuit of immediate perfection. His keynote address challenged conventional thinking about blockchain technology, positioning Cardano as more than just a cryptocurrency platform but as a potential framework for reimagining global administrative structures. “And if we do our job right, the world will run on Cardano” pic.twitter.com/UtIVJpjB8S — Linda (@Cryptofly777) December 4, 2024 The core philosophy behind Cardano’s development is creating efficient systems that prioritize human welfare and potentially streamline complex bureaucratic processes. Hoskinson challenged conference attendees to envision the blockchain’s potential trajectory over the next decade, particularly as the ecosystem develops more sophisticated decentralized governance mechanisms. Crucially, Hoskinson stressed the importance of collaborative approaches in blockchain development. He advocated for an open-minded perspective that recognizes innovative ideas can emerge from diverse sources, including competing blockchain ecosystems and governance models. This approach demonstrates a commitment to continuous learning and adaptation, which he views as essential for maintaining technological leadership. The World Will Run on Cardano (ADA) Hoskinson painted a bold picture of Cardano’s potential global impact, suggesting that with strategic implementation, the blockchain could become a foundational infrastructure for worldwide systems. He said, “If we do our job right, the world will run on Cardano.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 His vision extends beyond technological innovation, encompassing a broader reimagining of how complex organizational structures might function in a more decentralized, transparent environment. Cardano has already begun implementing significant steps toward its governance objectives. In early September, the blockchain initiated its transformative journey with the first phase of the Chang hard fork , transitioning the ecosystem into the Voltaire era. The upcoming second phase of this hard fork is expected to introduce final upgrades that will enable full community-driven governance within the Cardano ecosystem. Hoskinson’s projections for Cardano are particularly ambitious. He anticipates the blockchain will have millions of active participants by 2030, with these users playing a direct role in critical decision-making processes. This vision extends to a potentially revolutionary model of digital governance, where community involvement becomes a fundamental mechanism for technological and organizational evolution. The conference showed Cardano’s commitment to developing a governance model that is technologically advanced and fundamentally inclusive. Hoskinson has previously set a timeline for Cardano to power a nation-state , and he and his team are positioning the asset as a crucial player in efforts to improve how blockchain technologies can interact with broader societal structures.

As the cryptocurrency market heats up, all eyes are on BTFD Coin , which surged through its fourth stage, completing a whopping 25% of its presale journey within just 24 hours of its launch on November 26, 2024. Meanwhile, Floki Inu ($FLOKI) continues to ride a wave of fan-fuelled hype, and Bonk ($BONK) makes a comeback after a turbulent spell. But what makes these coins stand out, and why is BTFD the one to watch? Meme coins have transformed from niche jokes into financial juggernauts. From Dogecoin ($DOGE) to Shiba Inu ($SHIB), these digital assets blend pop culture, community vibes, and speculative investment opportunities. Enter BTFD Coin, the new kid on the block, promising to raise the stakes with its play-to-earn (P2E) gaming platform , staking rewards, and robust community ecosystem. So, what’s the hype all about? Let’s dive into why these coins, particularly BTFD Coin, are the best meme coins to invest in for the long term. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution ($BTFD) BTFD Coin has taken the crypto world by storm. Its presale price of $0.000004 skyrocketed through multiple stages, currently sitting at $0.000064 in its seventh phase. With over $1.1 million raised and more than 2,700 enthusiastic holders, this coin is more than just a meme—it’s a movement. Here’s why BTFD stands out. From day one, BTFD Coin has been about community empowerment and innovative utility. Its P2E game promises immersive gameplay that rewards users with BTFD tokens. Staking rewards sweeten the pot, making this coin a must-have for crypto enthusiasts looking for passive income. The presale performance? Mind-blowing. Over 25 billion coins have already been sold, and analysts are predicting big things for its post-presale launch at $0.0006 per coin. Want some quick maths? Imagine investing $4,000 in Stage 5, when BTFD was priced at $0.00005 per coin. You’d have snagged 80 million tokens . At the post-presale price of $0.0006, your investment would skyrocket to $48,000. That’s a 12x return . Who wouldn’t want a piece of that? As if the numbers aren’t convincing enough, consider the tokenomics. BTFD offers options to buy using Ethereum, USDT, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, or Solana. For $1, Ethereum nets you 70,886 tokens, while $1 in Bitcoin fetches a jaw-dropping 1.9 billion tokens. Talk about accessibility! With its robust roadmap, including partnerships, marketing campaigns, and post-launch staking features, BTFD Coin is setting new standards for meme coins. Analysts are already buzzing about its potential to surpass its peers, making it one of the best meme coins to invest in for the long term. Floki Inu: From Meme to Mainstream ($FLOKI) Floki Inu , affectionately named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, is a prime example of how a meme coin can go mainstream. Currently trading at $0.000018, FLOKI has built an ecosystem that includes FlokiFi, an innovative decentralised finance (DeFi) platform. While BTFD Coin is grabbing headlines for its presale, FLOKI has cemented its place as a reliable player in the meme coin world. Its marketing campaigns, including sponsorships with prominent sports teams, have boosted its visibility. Plus, the recent launch of its NFT marketplace, FlokiPlaces, adds to its utility. The key to FLOKI’s success lies in its community—“The Vikings.” This global army of supporters has helped FLOKI stay relevant even as newer coins emerge. However, some critics argue that FLOKI’s reliance on marketing gimmicks could limit its long-term growth. Compared to BTFD Coin’s P2E focus and staking rewards, FLOKI’s DeFi offerings may feel a bit less exciting. Still, its established reputation makes it a solid choice for those dipping their toes into meme coins. That said, if you’re looking for explosive growth potential, BTFD might be your better bet. Bonk: The Underdog Bounces Back ($BONK) Bonk ($BONK) is a wild card. Dubbed the “Solana Dog Coin,” it’s a community-driven project aimed at revitalising the Solana ecosystem. After a shaky 2023, Bonk has managed to claw its way back, trading at $0.00000074 as of now. The project’s primary selling point is its community-first approach. Bonk’s airdrop strategy—distributing tokens to active Solana users—helped it gain traction. But its reliance on community goodwill has also been its Achilles’ heel. Without substantial utility or innovation, Bonk risks being left in the dust by competitors like BTFD and FLOKI. Despite its challenges, Bonk has shown resilience. The project has hinted at new developments, including potential NFT integrations and partnerships, to keep its momentum alive. Still, it’s hard to ignore the gap between Bonk’s promise and its execution so far. When comparing Bonk to BTFD Coin, the latter clearly comes out ahead. BTFD’s presale success, staking features, and P2E focus offer tangible value, while Bonk relies heavily on speculative interest. If you’re a risk-taker, Bonk might hold appeal, but for long-term gains, BTFD is the smarter choice . Conclusion: Why BTFD Coin Is the Future of Meme Coins Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is leading the charge in the meme coin revolution. Its explosive presale performance, innovative P2E game, and attractive staking rewards make it one of the best meme coins to invest in for the long term. While Floki Inu and Bonk have their merits, neither matches the sheer potential of BTFD Coin. With its presale price set to hit $0.0006, there’s still time to get in early. Don’t miss your chance to join the thousands of bullish investors riding the wave of this exciting new coin. Head to the BTFD Coin website and join the presale now to secure your stake in the future of meme coins.

As it is known, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a major rise recently and the Bitcoin price rose above $ 100,000 this week, allowing us to witness a truly historic moment. On the other hand, significant increases were also seen on the altcoins side. At the top of the list published by Coingecko is Hyperliquid (HYPE), which is interestingly not yet listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges but has a market value of more than $4 billion. In second place is XRP, the most talked about altcoin of recent days with its rally, and immediately after it is Sun Token, an altcoin from the Tron ecosystem that has experienced a similar rally in the last few days, in third place.

BTC’s move in the upward direction remains firm as Tether continues to print more USDT flooding the market with enough liquidity. Besides, BTC whale accumulation and on-chain indicators suggest that we haven’t reached the top yet. Bitcoin Price Rally Can Continue to New All-Time High In the last 24 hours, the BTC price has bounced back once again from $96,000 support levels. As of press time, the BTC price was trading 2.17% up at $99,376 with a market cap of $1.97 trillion. However, BTC’s daily trading volumes show a drop of 33% to $84 billion. On-chain indicators suggest that heavy Bitcoin whale accumulation has continued during the recent Bitcoin price drop. In the past 24 hours, following the dip to $96,000, Bitcoin whales acquired 20,000 BTC worth $2 billion, reported crypto analyst Ali Martinez. Source: Ali Charts Martinez also highlighted that local Bitcoin price tops often coincide with levels around the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis plus one standard deviation. At present, this key level is calculated to be $112,926, potentially signaling a critical resistance point for the leading cryptocurrency. Source: Ali Charts Bitcoin’s most significant support level currently stands at $96,870, according to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez. Data reveals that approximately 1.45 million addresses collectively acquired 1.42 million BTC at this price point, marking it as a crucial demand zone. Martinez suggests that as long as this level holds firm, Bitcoin’s upward trajectory is likely to persist. Source: Ali Charts On the other hand, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued at a strong pace, with their total BTC holdings over-crossing Satoshi Nakamoto’s. On Friday, the total inflows stood at $376 million with BlackRock’s IBIT alone contributing more than $257 million. Earlier this week, IBIT hit an important milestone of hitting $50 billion AUM in less than a year of launch. Tether’s USDT Printing Can Provide Further Push Stablecoin issuer Tether has minted an additional $2 billion in USDT on the Ethereum blockchain network offering additional liquidity boost to Bitcoin and altcoins. This brings the total USDT minted by Tether to $19 billion across Ethereum and Tron since November 6, with $4 billion issued in just the past four days, Spot On Chain reported . During the massive influx of fresh liquidity over the past month, the Bitcoin price crossed the $100K milestone twice. Thus, market analysts believe that this rally can continue further. With this, Tether also continues to expand its overall crypto market dominance. Additionally, Tether has also been exploring other ways to expand its market footprint. Last month, Tether unveiled the Wallet Development Kit (WDK) , an open-source, self-custodial toolkit aimed at empowering developers to build Bitcoin and Tether (USDT) wallets. The WDK will promote financial autonomy, supporting both human users and AI-driven systems, enabling them to independently manage their digital assets.

This is the first time it has hit this level since 2018, and the asset is currently trading at $2.40, up 3.66% in the past 24 hours. This resurgence coincides with broader bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market. An analysis posted by the popular analyst CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) has fueled optimism among investors. The analyst attached a chart showcasing a potential repetition of XRP’s 2017 price pattern. This historical trend could see XRP reaching $6 this month and possibly $40 next month if similar conditions unfold. I still think #XRP will reach $6 this month and possibly $40 next month if we repeat the 2017 pattern. pic.twitter.com/nLqgzp56ky — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 5, 2024 Analyzing the Historical Price Pattern The chart highlights two distinct phases of XRP’s price action. The first phase from 2017, showcases a rapid increase in XRP’s price from $0.02 to $0.06, followed by a sharp breakout to $0.40 and beyond during the 2017 bull run. The second phase, shown in the present cycle, mirrors the earlier pattern. XRP remained relatively stagnant for years before its recent breakout above $2. CryptoBull has previously predicted a climb to $40 . If XRP repeats the pattern, it could hit $6 before this year ends, and reach the ultimate target of $40 in January. XRP’s historical price movements suggest that when momentum builds, it tends to accelerate rapidly. While this is speculative, the rapid appreciation observed in 2017 lends credibility to this prediction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Context The ongoing market rally extends beyond XRP. Bitcoin recently reached an all-time high of $103,900, and this historic milestone of surpassing $100,000 underpins the renewed interest in digital assets. This bullish sentiment has spilled over to altcoins, with XRP’s performance serving as a key example. Additionally, regulatory developments have contributed to optimism. The resignation announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, effective January 20, 2025, and the nomination of Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly candidate, have alleviated concerns over regulatory uncertainty. XRP recently hit a peak of $2.86, and despite some turbulence, the digital asset maintained the $2 level and has begun its recovery. With the bullish market sentiment, the positive regulatory shift in the U.S., positive indicators in XRP’s chart, and historical performance, the digital asset might hit these lofty targets set by CryptoBull.

37323174,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390415,1733557115,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Charity Investment Fund (CHIF) Fair Launch Coming Through – Next Big Cryptocurrency Investment of the Year?,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/charity-investment-fund-chif-fair-launch-coming-through-next-big-cryptocurrency/,"The post Charity Investment Fund (CHIF) Fair Launch Coming Through – Next Big Cryptocurrency Investment of the Year? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Charity Investment Fund (CHIF), a blockchain platform driven by the altruistic desire to help charitable organisations, is poised to launch fairly to the crypto community soon. This blockchain-powered Fund changes the traditional donation paradigm by bridging the gap between investing and donating, allowing investors to become part of something greater. Additionally, with the added element of a fair launch, investors can also benefit from the current bullish economy. What is Charity Investment Fund? The desire to do good lies within everyone. However, not everyone is incentivised to take the right direction. Charity Investment Fund makes it easier by implementing a simple approach: tying the generation of returns to donations. Users can invest in the native digital currency introduced by CHIF. By doing so, they not only create new opportunities to earn gains but also participate in a movement aimed at tackling global challenges. This approach, according to the project’s developers, harnesses the strength of the investment world and directs it toward the path of growth. In essence, the goal of CHIF is to create a circular economy with an altruistic end-game. An influx of investors, incentivised to do good deeds, may come flowing in, and in return, donations will continue to be generated. In theory, this could lead to a perpetual influx of donations, making the world all the better for it. Beneficiaries Of This Unique Donation Ecosystem With charitable initiatives, it is important to have clear goals. It is impractical to focus on all different types of organisations, but one cannot avert their eyes from legitimate causes either. Therefore, Charity Investment Fund has taken an innovative stand to ensure that everyone is taken care of properly. 50% of all the proceeds generated from the ecosystem will be distributed among a selection of charitable foundations. These foundations are yet to be affiliated with this initiative. However, the Charity Investment Fund will not solely decide on selecting the right recipients by itself. Since CHIF is a community-driven initiative, those who participate in this project will benefit. A poll is available on the website to ensure that all donors, as well as investors, have a say in dictating the direction of where the proceeds go. And since transparency is the goal the organisation is striving to achieve, donors will also receive a detailed report of where the funds eventually end up. CHIF Token – The Core Element of Charity Investment Fund Charity Investment Fund is striving to create a sustainable economy with the CHIF token. Described in the whitepaper as a social impact token, it has been developed on the Binance Smart Chain and a wrapped token (wCHIF) is planned to run on an EVM-compatible blockchain. The latter is a custom blockchain designed to facilitate the donation ecosystem. The EVM-compatible chain will also play a major role in expanding Charity Investment Fund’s reach. Additionally, the token is audited, which adds another layer of trust to the organisation. This chain will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism, reducing transaction costs and enhancing processing speed. Furthermore, the chain will enhance security while reducing energy consumption, making Charity Investment Fund an eco-friendly platform as well. CHIF Fair Launch – Giving All an Equal Chance to Grow CHIF will be made available via a fair launch, an event that will start on December 18th, 2024. The token’s fair launch has been designed as an inclusive event, giving everyone a fair chance to invest in this project. Pinksale has been chosen as the portal for people to participate in this fair launch, and token distribution has already been finalised. 51% of the amount generated through the fair launch will go into the liquidity pool. The remaining 49% will be distributed equally among the Charity Investment Fund initiatives and charities. Beyond Fair Launch – Charity Investment Fund’s 50/50 Model Charity Investment Fund has ensured that it continues to adhere to its altruistic goals beyond the fair launch. So, once the initial launch has concluded, CHIF tokens held by Charity Investment Fund will be split 50/50. That means that for any tokens sold by the Fund afterwards, 50% of the proceeds will go to different charitable organisations. 12 organisations have been nominated so far, they include. 1. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) 2. Ukrainian Red Cross 3. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Asia-Pacific 4. World Animal Protection US 5. UNICEF 6. Oxfam International 7. Rainforest Alliance 8. Charity: Water 9. Amnesty International 10. American Cancer Society 11. Oceana 12. IFAW As for the remaining 50% of the tokens held by Charity Investment Fund, they will be used to further develop the project. The end goal is to create a charitable platform with a dedicated wallet for each charity. This wallet will store tokens that are tied to a specific charity, creating a trustless system where donations automatically go to the charitable organisations. With its unique approach to creating a charity ecosystem driven by a new form of economy, the Charity Investment Fund might become a leading cryptocurrency investment in the future. People want to do good, and when there is a project that can nudge them in that direction through profit, it represents a good deal. Furthermore, the broader market dynamics may also push the value of the CHIF token higher, making focusing on the upcoming fair launch a prudent choice.

Well, you ride that wave to the fullest, which Hailey Welch, of the “hawk tuah” fame, did. The 22-year-old coined a catchy phrase from a mundane act and built a to-die-for social media following, even launching a meme coin. But if she had hoped for a fairytale ending, she had another thing coming. How? The unraveling of her Hawk Tuah (HAWK) coin has soiled her reputation and left her vulnerable to prosecution. Crypto influencer @ShurikenTrade has succinctly captured Hailey’s predicament in a series of X posts. The influencer labeled the “Hawk Tuah Girl” a fraudster who knowingly took advantage of her fans to enrich herself. Want to steal 50 million dollars? Well, the Hawk Tuah girl did. She launched a coin, rugged it, and then shamelessly went to sleep like nothing happened. Here's how Hawk Tuah stole $50M from her fans 🧵 pic.twitter.com/3e3hrBxQE4 — Shuriken (@ShurikenTrade) December 6, 2024 Who’s to blame for HAWK’s debacle? The influencer’s post received mixed reactions. Some people attacked her while others diverted the blame elsewhere. For example, take X user Sonny Day who compared the mess to money laundering thus trying to pin down Hailey for it. Some others, such as American Luxury Interiors were more specific, telling her to pay back the investors before ending up like Sam Bankman Fried. Meanwhile, other users tore into the investors themselves. Trigger , for instance, said in an expletive-punctuated response that those who lost their funds deserved it. Her thoughts resonated with fellow commenters Rogers Marques and Flow In, who held that Hailey’s fans had freely put their money in the coin. Another user, big-time woke guy, sarcastically quipped that anyone who’d invested in HAWK shouldn’t be allowed to have or use money. Still, other commenters presented Hailey as a victim of the HAWK development team’s scam. Melissa Perrow, for example, doubted Hailey’s technical capacity and cunningness to pull off such an elaborate con game in the short period she’s been in the spotlight. Crown Batman insisted that “The Hawk Tuah Girl” was a newbie in crypto who didn’t know what she was getting into. He concluded that other people who were more experienced in crypto must have influenced her to join the scheme. The HAWK fiasco highlights the need for more education on crypto investments A major lesson from HAWK’s collapse is that people need to increase their knowledge of cryptocurrencies. Many crypto enthusiasts have fallen for scams after putting their money into projects that they did not research. There is also the question of how to deal with the FOMO that some projects and influences peddle to people aimlessly. T he crypto community is eager to know what Hailey and other project influencers will face. To this end, at least one law firm has called on affected investors who wished to file legal complaints against the project and its owners to do so. While all this was happening, Hailey and her team continued asserting that their dealings with the investors were lawful.

Its performance over the past few weeks has sparked optimism in its community. At the time of press, ADA is trading at $1.21, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours and an impressive 240% from last month. To better understand the Cardano (ADA) potential trajectory, we turned to ChatGPT for its insights on the token’s potential price by December 31, 2024. ChatGPT’s Price Prediction for Cardano (ADA) When asked about ADA’s prospects, ChatGPT stated that the cryptocurrency could reach $3 by December 31, 2024. This would represent a significant 143.9% increase from its current price, bringing ADA close to its all-time high of $3.1, recorded in September 2021. ChatGPT attributed its optimistic outlook to several key factors. One major driver is the growing adoption of Cardano’s blockchain. ChatGPT noted that the platform’s unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and scalability solutions have made it increasingly attractive to decentralized applications (dApps) and developers. Another significant factor is the completion of major network upgrades. Cardano has consistently focused on enhancing its infrastructure, with recent advancements such as the Chang Hard Fork which brought it into the bootstrap phase of its Voltaire era. ChatGPT noted that these technological improvements would attract more users and projects to the ecosystem, stating, “Successful implementation of these upgrades increases network utility, which directly impacts ADA’s value.” Lastly, broader market sentiment and crypto trends have contributed to ADA’s upward trajectory. ChatGPT stated that the recent surge in ADA’s value aligns with a general bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. If this positive sentiment continues, ADA is well-positioned to benefit.

External factors such as macroeconomic pressures, unforeseen regulatory changes, or network vulnerabilities could hinder ADA’s growth. Additionally, achieving a price of $3 would require sustained investor confidence and adoption, which is not guaranteed. Will Cardano (ADA) Reach $3? Despite this, ADA is in a good position, and ChatGPT’s prediction suggests its climb will continue. A crypto expert recently revealed a crucial development that could help ADA reach $3 quickly . This shows the confidence the broader market has in the digital asset. If the bulls can maintain the current momentum, there could be big things in ADA’s immediate future.

The analyst believes that BTC will hit $60,000 post this correction. Bitcoin RSI reads above 66 which shows that bulls are still in control. Market-leading digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $100,000 again after claiming a high of $102,039.88 in the past 24 hours. This market uncertainty led prominent trader, analyst, and co-founder of NFT project LedgArt, Crypto Kaleo, to advise investors not to buy BTC out of FOMO (fear of missing out). In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Crypto Kaleo noted that despite BTC soaring to $100,000 and crypto market participants and “experts” urging investors to buy more BTC at the current price of $99,617.06, a correction is likely.

While the difference with ETH is quite big as of now, ChatGPT answers whether XRP has the chance to become the second-largest digital asset. The Difference Ever since Trump won the US presidential elections, the entire market has been on fire, and perhaps rightfully so. Ripple’s token joined the party a little late but became the top performer by skyrocketing from $0.6 to nearly $3 within the span of just a few weeks. On its way up, it managed to surpass several altcoins, such as BNB and SOL, and even flew past USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum was even slower when it came down to following suit with massive gains, but yesterday, it broke above $4,000 for the first time since March this year, putting its ‘Trump Pump’ gains at over 50%. Although it sits slightly below its level now, its market cap has risen to $480 billion. As such, there’s a substantial difference between the two assets in that capacity, as XRP’s market cap is $140 billion. Nevertheless, many experts believe XRP has a lot more room to grow, especially with a more favorable regulatory environment in the US, which is expected given Trump’s choice for the next SEC chair. Can XRP Become Second? ChatGPT answered that Ripple has a minor chance of surpassing Ethereum, and it all depends on several factors, such as market conditions, regulatory clarity, tech developments, and broader crypto trends. It added that XRP has benefited a lot from many of Ripple’s partnerships in the past few years, and it could rally further if the asset sees its own ETF in the States, just like BTC and ETH did. This could occur under a friendlier SEC regime, which might also finally put an end to the four-year-long lawsuit between the two entities. In terms of market cycles and sentiment, the AI chatbot said: “In bull markets, speculation often drives altcoin prices to new highs. XRP has previously seen explosive gains during speculative phases. However, Ethereum’s ecosystem tends to sustain interest during both bull and bear markets due to its utility beyond mere price speculation.” ChatGPT concluded that the feat of surpassing ETH would be a “tall order.” Ripple must come out as a winner against the SEC, and XRP’s adoption rates have to continue to accelerate, while at the same time, the Ethereum ecosystem “would need to face major setbacks.” The post We Asked ChatGPT If Ripple (XRP) Can Surpass Ethereum (ETH) This Cycle appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ethereum (ETH) Price|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-07 07:56:08

According to the latest data, the miner has accumulated 1300 BTC recently, following a similar transaction of 1,423 Bitcoin earlier this week. Notably, this comes after the firm announced the closing of its second $850 million convertible note offering, a move aimed at increasing its Bitcoin buying plan. Bitcoin Miner Marathon (MARA) Continues BTC Buying Spree The leading Wall Street players have recently been shifting their focus toward the digital assets space, as evidenced by the massive buying of the players. Despite BTC hitting $100K, it appears that the institutional interest in the flagship crypto remains unaltered. According to recent data, Bitcoin miner Marathon (MARA) has accelerated its BTC buying plan, as evidenced by the latest transactions. Arkham data showed that MARA has recently acquired 1300 Bitcoin, worth around $130.66 million, from yesterday, sparking market optimism. Source: Lookonchain, X In addition, the firm made a similar purchase earlier this week, which has further caught the eyes of the investors. For context, earlier this week, the BTC miner acquired another 1423 Bitcoin, valued at around $139.5 million. Notably, this substantial purchasing activity comes just after the BTC miner’s announcement of the successful closure of its second $850 million convertible note offering. According to the firm, the primary aim of this strategic move was to accelerate its Bitcoin acquisition plan, while also partially repurchasing existing notes that are set to mature in 2026. Will BTC Continue To Rally? BTC price today was up over 1% and exchanged hands at $99,531, making a bounce back from the 24-hour low of $97,629. However, the crypto’s trading volume dropped by 32% to $93,57 billion at the same time. The flagship crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $102,039.88, indicating strong market interest amid Marathon’s buying spree. According to CoinGlass data, BTC Futures Open Interest was down 0.5% to $61.25 billion in a 24-hour time frame, while noting a slight rebound in the short term. Considering that, it appears that the investors are once again entering the BTC market after a short-term pause. In addition, Bitcoin whales are also on a buying spree alongside the institutions. According to Ali Martinez, the whales have accumulated 20,000 BTC since yesterday, worth around $2 billion, signaling strong confidence in the asset.

Cardano Set To Take Over — Analyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-days-at-the-top-numbered-cardano-set-to-take-over-analyst/,"The Cardano native token is one of the top-performing digital assets this week and currently trades at $1.13 and $1.23. While its price action pales in comparison to the industry leaders this week, led by Bitcoin and XRP, ADA’s performance relative to other altcoins has still become a source of optimism for many. Related Reading: No Sweat! Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst One market analyst even sees Cardano’s ADA eventually overtaking Dogecoin in the list of top cryptos by market cap. A recent comparative analysis of Cardano and Dogecoin reflects the former’s dominance over the top meme coin. ADA has surged 14% in the last week, while Dogecoin increased by just 7%. And if we’re looking at a higher timeframe, ADA also shows strength and dominance over Dogecoin. Over the last month, ADA is up by 230%, while Dogecoin registered a 116% increase. Can We Expect A Flip? Both Cardano and Dogecoin are in the Top 10 cryptos by market cap, with Dogecoin ranked 7th and Cardano at 8th. Only around $20 billion separates these two top-performing altcoins. And for crypto commentator Dan Gambardello, there’s a strong possibility that Cardano can flip the script in the next few days. Currently, $1.84 $ADA would flip $DOGE. The time is approaching. The event is imminent. pic.twitter.com/yTbcKe91Hc — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 5, 2024 In a Twitter/X post, Gambardello predicted that ADA would surpass Doge and that the time “is approaching and imminent.” Interestingly, after overtaking Cardano this year, DOGE surged past XRP and USDC to become the sixth biggest crypto by market capitalization, with a $69 billion capitalization last month. However, Dogecoin’s market value dropped after hitting a peak of $0.47992. Cardano, on the other hand, is making its move, backed by solid macroeconomic data. Recently, Cardano reached a multi-month high, increasing its market cap to $45.8 billion. Given this bullish surge on Cardano, Gambardello argued that Cardano is poised to overtake Doge. This will happen, according to the analyst, if Cardano reaches $1.84. Cardano Needs Momentum To Hit $1.84 According to Gambardello, $1.84 is the magic number for Cardano to switch the script and top Dogecoin. However, he did not identify a specific timeframe for this price event. With a total supply of $45 billion, an increase to $1.84 will push the token’s market capitalization to $64.63 billion. This value will move ADA past Doge, which sits at $64.3 billion in the current market landscape. Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP? You’re ‘Disrespecting’ Yourself Before making this assertion, the analyst first targeted a price of $3 for ADA. Analysts also shared that Cardano’s version of a bull run will start once it gets attention from institutions looking to offer exchange-traded funds or ETFs, similar to what happened to XRP. At the time of writing, ADA is trading between $1.13 and $1.23, with a market cap of $41.55 billion.

The wallet also offers unique benefits like gasless $TICS transactions, which eliminate fees for token holders, and a virtual card that works with major mobile payment systems like Apple Pay. This means everyday purchases, like a coffee or groceries, can be made directly from your crypto balance. And the best part? Qubetics is still in its presale phase, with more than 275 million tokens sold to over 6,700 holders, raising over $4.6 million so far. At a presale price of just $0.0282, a $5,000 investment could yield significant returns, especially with analysts predicting major price surges after the presale ends.

Polkadot (DOT): The Interoperability Giant Polkadot is a blockchain designed to connect multiple networks, enabling them to work together seamlessly.

Near Protocol (NEAR): The Scalable Innovator Near Protocol is all about scalability and usability. Designed for developers, it offers a fast, secure, and user-friendly platform for building decentralised applications (dApps). What sets Near apart is its innovative sharding technology, which ensures high transaction speeds and low costs without compromising security. Near Protocol has also made waves with its user-first approach, simplifying onboarding and making crypto accessible to non-technical users. Developers are flocking to the platform to build everything from DeFi solutions to gaming applications, driving significant activity in its ecosystem. Why did this coin make it to this list? Near Protocol’s focus on scalability and developer-friendly tools makes it a standout in the race for the best coins of today. 4. Ripple (XRP): The Global Payment Powerhouse Ripple is a blockchain solution focused on revolutionising international payments. Its native token, XRP, is designed for quick, low-cost transactions, making it a preferred choice for financial institutions looking to modernise their operations. Ripple’s strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions have positioned it as a leader in cross-border payments. With its emphasis on compliance and scalability, Ripple is paving the way for widespread blockchain adoption in traditional finance. Why did this coin make it to this list? Ripple’s growing influence in global finance and its ability to streamline payments make it one of the best coins to invest in for short term success. Make Your Move Before It’s Too Late If you’re looking for quick wins in the crypto market, these four coins are your ticket. From Qubetics’ revolutionary multi-chain wallet to Polkadot’s unparallelled interoperability, each project brings something unique to the table.

It stands out by enabling faster transactions without relying on sharding or second-layer solutions. Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, powering programs, and rewarding network participants. The platform supports development across multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers.

BONK serves as a community coin, with 50% of its supply airdropped to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants. As of mid-December 2023, it became the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and market volatility, BONK is integrating into Solana’s ecosystem, including the launch of BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange. Its growth and involvement in dApps highlight its significance in the current market cycle. Conclusion While SOL and BONK show limited short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as the token for those aspiring to luxury and success. With an anticipated 700% growth by presale end and prospects for massive returns, DOGEN follows the successful paths of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.

33767162,[object Object],1733558456,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Semler Scientific Scoops 303 Bitcoin For $29.3 Million – How It Compares To Other Corporate BTC Holders?,https://bitcoinist.com/semler-scientific-scoops-303-bitcoin-for-29-3-million-how-it-compares-to-other-corporate-btc-holders/,"Nasdaq-listed medical device manufacturer Semler Scientific has expanded its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, acquiring an additional 303 BTC for $29.3 million. The company continues to double down on its MicroStrategy-inspired corporate treasury strategy. High Bitcoin Price Not A Barrier To Purchase Bitcoin made history this week by surpassing the $100,000 price level for the first time, pushing its total market capitalization past $2 trillion. Despite BTC’s record high price, corporate buyers like Semler Scientific remain undeterred and continue accumulating the flagship cryptocurrency. According to a recent announcement , Semler Scientific has added another 303 BTC to its holdings. Notably, the latest purchase was made from November 25 through December 4, at an average price of $96,779, inclusive of fees and expenses. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,873 BTC, acquired at a combined cost of $147.1 million and an average purchase price of $78,553 per BTC. These substantial holdings place Semler Scientific among the top publicly-listed companies holding BTC as part of a corporate treasury strategy. Semler’s BTC yield from October 1 through December 4 stood at 54.7%. This is lower compared to the yield from July 1 – when it adopted BTC as a corporate asset – through December 4, which was at 78.7%. Commenting, Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific, said: We are very pleased to report a BTC Yield of 78.7%. In addition, we have requested approval from the options exchanges to allow options trading in our stock as we believe we satisfy their eligibility requirements. For clarity, BTC yield is a key performance metric Semler uses to evaluate the effectiveness of its Bitcoin investment strategy, which aims to maximize shareholder value. The company also uses this metric to help investors understand its decision to finance BTC purchases by issuing additional common stock. How Do Semler Scientific’s BTC Holdings Stack Against Other Companies? Semler Scientific first unveiled its BTC acquisition strategy earlier this year in May with a purchase of 581 BTC for $40 million. Since then, the company has gone on multiple BTC buying sprees, ballooning its total BTC holdings to 1,873 as of today. The firm’s latest BTC purchase has pushed it to 14th position – overtaking Japanese firm Nexon with 1,717 BTC – on the list of publicly-traded companies to hold BTC as part of corporate treasury strategy. The leader in this space remains US-based business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which continues to make significant Bitcoin purchases worth billions of dollars. MicroStrategy currently holds nearly 2% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. Following MicroStrategy are crypto mining firms MARA with 33,875 BTC, Riot Platforms holding 10,019 BTC, and Elon Musk’s Tesla with 9,720 BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $99,355, down 3.8% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|corporate treasury|Cryptocurrency|MARA|MicroStrategy|Semler Scientific|Tesla,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-07 08:00:56

Sometimes the reasons are clear while others they are not. Investors might get confused looking at some random altcoins taking the top positions on trending table. Let’s see which crypto tokens are trending today. EGO Launched just over a year ago, this is an internal token of Paysenger service. The platform helps content creators, fans and brands for content monetization and audience engagement. The EGO token is currently trading at $0.02375 and is down by 6.15% from yesterday. The volume is down by 16.92%. The amazing thing is that the trading volume is just $2.41 million yet this token is trending at first rank on coinmarketcap. Bitcoin To everyone’s surprise BTC is at position two in trending today, despite it crossed $100k and came back. The largest cryptocurrency needs no introduction as the crypto market has its eyes peeled towards it. Currently trading at $99,358, BTC is once again trying to cross the psychological resistance at $100k. It is currently up by 1.44% in price as compared to the last 24 hours despite a fall of 32.23% in trading volume. Altcoins have yet not started to follow the surge of BTC but for sure has displaced it in regards to trending. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Chainlink Price Rally Set to Break $52, Hit New All-Time High Soon , Super Trump Coin People might be wishing this position would be occupied by Ethereum but it has been acquired by a Trump themed meme coin.

For this particular reason, Trump themed memecoins are taking the rally. Super Trump Coin has left all the other altcoins behind and the trading volume has surged by jaw dropping 500% in the last 24 hours. With a 19.39% rise in price the memecoin is trading at $0.02455 Brett Another meme coin taking a position in top 5 trending crypto tokens today. Launched on Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain Base, this memecoin is trading at $0.2008 and is down by 1.74%. On the other hand, its trading volume is down by 26%. There are only 0.20% investors of Brett holding more than $100k in it. Most investors have invested between $0-$1000. Ethereum The second biggest cryptocurrency got the fifth position. The reason — 9.99% drop in trading volume. Even though Bitcoin successfully made a fresh all time high above $100k, Ethereum failed to break its 3 years old ath at $4891. The price is witnessing some surge as it is up by 2.29% up and trading at $3,982, but that’s not enough for its believers. Looking Ahead! With the crypto market evolving forever, it is no surprise that altcoins, especially memecoins, gain more traction from investors than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Though memecoins are good for a quick money if you play it timely, BTC is a reserve of money and that is why it will remain the top choice for investors who understand the real power of Crypto.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 08:03:04

Pseudonymous trader The Flow Horse tells his 247,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s market peak this cycle could come in as early as the first quarter of 2025. “I don’t care what anyone else says. We are far closer to ‘the end for a bit’ than people want to admit. I would say within the first quarter. After big price moves, the chatter often shifts to even bigger moves – multiples of the current price. Ironically, that’s usually a strong signal that we’re nearing the peak. And it’s just one of many indicators pointing in that direction.” He also predicts that alts will explode, outperforming Bitcoin, in the first to second quarter of 2025, closing out the current crypto bull cycle. “As mentioned before, Bitcoin already won. This seems a bit more applicable to alts. I think Bitcoin tops, we get a nice major rotation into alts, and then it’s a wrap. Within one to two quarters seems more reasonable for all of it.” However, other crypto analysts have a much different opinion. Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 748,400 followers that Bitcoin has much more room to the upside based on a decreasing supply on crypto exchanges and increasing market liquidity. “This is one massive difference from the previous cycles. The amount of BTC on exchanges has substantially decreased and keeps decreasing. A supply shock is imminent with a big amount of liquidity being added. This cycle, we’ll go way higher than we all expect.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Rekt Capital tells his 507,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may reach its cycle peak in about a year based on how long it previously took BTC to hit cycle peaks after the halving events when miners’ rewards are cut in half. Bitcoin’s most recent halving event was in mid-April. “In the 2015-2017 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 518 days after the halving. In the 2019-2021 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 546 days after the halving. If history repeats and the next bull market peak occurs 518-546 days after the halving that would mean Bitcoin could peak in this cycle in mid-September or mid-October 2025.” Bitcoin is trading for $99,741 at time of writing.

Lane said, “FTX didn’t kill us; our regulators did,” linking Silvergate’s financial struggles to the fallout from FTX’s collapse in November 2022. Sacks Promises to Bring Change! As a key figure in the cryptocurrency space, Sacks has committed to investigating and exposing the actions behind Operation Choke Point 2.0. His involvement has given crypto enthusiasts and industry leaders hope, as many believe he can play a role in reducing harmful regulations. During his campaign, Trump pledged to put an end to Operation Choke Point 2.0 to create a fairer environment for cryptocurrency companies. His appointment of Sacks signals that this stance will likely remain a priority, with many seeing Sacks as a way to shift government policy toward more crypto-friendly regulations. Coinbase’s Push for Transparency Amid these discussions, Coinbase is digging into claims of government bias against the crypto industry. The company recently received 23 heavily redacted letters from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which suggest that banks were discouraged from offering crypto-related services unless given explicit guidance. This raises the possibility that Operation Choke Point 2.0 might be larger and more far-reaching than originally thought. . @DavidSacks is a great pick! It's incredible to think what is possible with sharp, pro-tech, pro-business people in government. https://t.co/ub5gFikmzE — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 6, 2024 As the investigation into these practices continues, all eyes are on David Sacks to lead efforts against what many view as unfair rules targeting crypto companies.

In his recent Bloomberg op-ed on December 6, Dudley said that adopting Bitcoin as a reserve currency would bring no real advantages and would mostly benefit current Bitcoin holders pushing for this proposal. After Dudley’s comments, Bitcoin’s price dropped by 4.31% to $98,854, having recently peaked at a record high of $104,000. While Dudley acknowledged Bitcoin’s ability to transfer money without intermediaries, he emphasized that its extreme volatility makes it a poor choice as a stable reserve fund. Bitcoin Act of 2024: A Risky Proposal? Dudley’s comments are a direct response to the Bitcoin Act of 2024 , introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis . The bill proposes creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and implementing transparency measures for managing BTC holdings. Some supporters see this bill as a way to push Bitcoin into mainstream global finance, but others, including Dudley, see it as a risky move. Dudley warned that adopting this bill could drive up Bitcoin’s price without benefiting the government or economy. He also raised concerns about the absence of a clear exit strategy. According to him, this could leave the U.S. government stuck with volatile assets that generate no income. Economic Risks to Consider Dudley provided a detailed economic analysis to back his concerns. He pointed out that even a 2% allocation of global investment portfolios—estimated at around $250 trillion—would push Bitcoin’s price to an astounding $250,000 per coin. If the U.S. government increased this allocation to 4%, Bitcoin’s price could double, creating a speculative bubble that could destabilize global markets. His analysis highlighted the risks of Bitcoin’s volatility, arguing that the market could experience dangerous instability. Let’s Focus on Regulation Instead Rather than promoting Bitcoin as a reserve currency, Dudley urged the Trump administration to focus on regulating the crypto industry. He suggested ensuring that stablecoins are fully backed by U.S. treasury bills, as issuers often claim. Additionally, Dudley emphasized the need for strong consumer protection laws to fight fraud and scams, which have undermined investor confidence in the crypto market. “Strong guardrails” are necessary, Dudley said. Without clear regulations, cryptocurrencies risk remaining unstable and vulnerable to misuse, limiting their benefits to the financial system.

On Saturday, on-chain data signaled that the whale spent roughly $21 million to heavily accumulate the abovementioned coins. As a result, crypto market watchers expect further gains in these coins amid a broader bullish Q4 landscape. Crypto Whale Heavily Bags Pepe Coin, AERO, & FTM Igniting Optimism According to the latest data by Spot on Chain , a crypto whale recently spent 420 WSTETH, worth $2 million, to buy 1.47M FTM in a single transaction. However, this was not the only trade placed by this trader. Per the data, the whale spent nearly $19 million to make other token accumulations over the past few days. Notably, the whale bought 531.7 billion PEPE, worth $11.04 million, boasting a $292K profit on this holding. Further, the same whale purchased 4.55 million Fantom (FTM), worth $5.83 million, boasting a $353K profit on Fantom holdings. Simultaneously, the whale bagged 1.37 million AERO, worth $2.14 million, a few days ago and now holds a profit of $830K on this investment. Overall, these massive purchases have ignited an optimistic torrent among investors surrounding the coins’ future movements, underlining increased market interest. Further, it’s also noteworthy that the whale’s decision not to sell his holdings has solidified investors’ bullish sentiments. How Are These Crypto Performing? At the time of reporting, FTM price soared nearly 1.5% to reach $1.350. Its intraday low and high were registered as $1.263 and $1.369, respectively. The coin soars in tandem with the massive buying pressure brought by the abovementioned crypto whale. However, Pepe Coin price slipped roughly 3.5% intraday and is currently resting at $0.00002129. The meme coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00002044 and $0.00002225, respectively. Besides, the monthly chart for the crypto shows gains of over 50%, indicating further pump imminent in light of the abovementioned buying. Also, AERO price surged nearly 17% intraday and is currently sitting at $2.201. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $1.870 and $2.253, respectively. The crypto soars in tandem with the colossal purchase and a bullish Q4. In turn, market participants continue to expect further gains in the abovementioned coins’ prices amid recent developments. A PEPE price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the coin’s price could double ahead, with a major breakout of 80-100% looming. This bullish projection falls in line with heightened market interest as the year ends. Simultaneously, another report revealed that the crypto exchange giant Binance commenced AEROUSDT futures trading. This enhanced offering has added to market optimism surrounding the token’s future movements.

According to its annual report published on December 6, the council highlighted that the assets lack the needed risk management standard which could open them to certain risks in the market. FSOC notes that these risks pose direct threats to financial stability. In the report , FSOC noted that these potential risks will remain because stablecoins cannot adopt the important risk management standards. Aside from this, the body also blamed the lack of legislative oversight, which could have helped to check these risks. FSOC, therefore, called on federal legislators to create a regulatory framework that will curb these risks. The body also highlighted the need for extending regulations into the wider crypto market, stating that it will help their integration with the traditional market and institutional interest. FSOC reiterates its concerns about the stablecoin market Over the last few years, FSOC has always shown displeasure at the way the stablecoin market is heavily concentrated. The body, in its current report, highlighted that only a single entity controls about 70% of the total market value of the sector. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the entire market capitalization of the stablecoin sector is roughly over $205 billion, with Tether holding a larger chunk of $136 billion, which amounts to 66.3% of the entire figure. Although the report failed to finger any firm, it highlighted the consequences of a single firm’s market dominance. It highlighted that if this happens, the firm’s potential failure could cause disruptions to the crypto industry, causing related effects in the traditional finance industry. For some months now, investors have been uneasy about the lack of third-party audits in Tether’s activities. While investor concerns continue to mount, there are fears that the firm could face liquidity issues like FTX in the future. In 2022, stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) encountered a mishap after it unstacked $2 billion, leading to its unpegging from the US dollar. The token’s value, which was supposed to be 1:1 with the dollar, dropped to $0.09. FSOC claimed that while most stablecoins are required to submit to regular checks by state regulators, most of them provide small verifiable information about their operations and reserve management practices. The body claims that the practice increases the likelihood of fraud and poses a challenge to market discipline. FSOC sees a stablecoin law as the only way out In devising a way out of this predicament, the FSOC suggested that the government needs to come up with a federal regulation. “The Council recommends that Congress pass legislation creating a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers to address run risk, payment system risks, market integrity, and investor and consumer protections,” the council said. However, it notes that if no action is taken it would consider taking one of its own. Meanwhile, FSOC also discussed the increased crypto integration in the traditional finance sector, drumming up the need for more regulatory oversight. It claimed that while the crypto’s market value at $2 trillion is still modest compared to traditional finance, products like ETFs have increased investor accessibility. The value of exchange-traded products has pushed into the $80 billion region, following their approvals this year. The FSOC also talked about the increased risk that the growth of ETFs poses to investors in the industry. The report revealed several regulatory lapses yet to be tackled in the spot market, including fraud and market manipulation. To remove these risks, FSOC wants to grant federal regulators power to oversee crypto products that are not securities. Without removing the transformative potential of these assets, FSOC wants a balanced approach that will safeguard investors and support innovation.

Rise in Solana Token Creation Drives Record Protocol Growth As the protocol behind virtually all token creation on Solana, Metaplex has emerged as a primary beneficiary of the extraordinary surge in digital asset creation on the Solana network. This exponential level of activity, encompassing everything from memecoins to AI tokens and NFTs, directly contributes to Metaplex’s protocol fees. This increased protocol fee generation has in turn funded record-breaking $MPLX token purchases for the Metaplex DAO. Since June 2024, 50% of the prior month’s protocol fees and a portion of the historical fees have been allocated to funding $MPLX token purchases for contribution to the DAO. In November 2024, this culminated in 12k SOL worth of $MPLX purchases — equivalent to approximately $3 million at current prices, marking a substantial 58% increase month-over-month and signifying the largest monthly $MPLX token purchases to date. Building on this momentum, Metaplex’s November protocol fees hit an all-time high of $3.5 million, setting the stage for even larger allocations for $MPLX purchases in December. Record-Breaking Metaplex Protocol Metrics in November November’s protocol activity shattered previous records across multiple metrics: Metaplex saw extraordinary growth in fungible token creation, with 1.4M new tokens minted — marking a 56% increase month-over-month compared to the previous all-time high in October 2024 and a new monthly record. This represented 94% of all Token Metadata assets created, driven primarily by memecoin activity on platforms such as Pump.fun. Metaplex Core, the next generation NFT standard, demonstrated significant adoption with a new all-time high of 354k assets created , driven by expanded use cases made possible due to the standard’s flexible design. User engagement metrics surged as the number of unique wallets interacting with the Metaplex protocol reached 879k — a 34% increase from October and a new all-time high. The protocol’s total collector base expanded to nearly 60 million unique wallets, growing by over 860k in November alone. About the Metaplex Protocol Metaplex is the leading decentralized protocol on Solana and SVM, providing tools and programs for developers and creators to build decentralized applications that use digital assets. With a growing user base and a commitment to innovation, Metaplex is empowering the next wave of decentralized finance and commerce. About the Metaplex Foundation The Metaplex Foundation is a Cayman Islands non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the development and growth of the Metaplex Protocol. By providing open-source tools and resources, the Foundation empowers developers, creators, and users worldwide to participate in a decentralized and inclusive digital economy.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto Investment to Make Right Now,https://thecoinrise.com/cant-believe-you-hesitated-on-binance-qubetics-is-the-best-crypto-investment-to-make-right-now/,"Binance (BNB) has become a hallmark of success within the cryptocurrency industry, exemplifying the immense potential of early-stage investments. Those who participated in its ICO witnessed extraordinary returns, showcasing the transformative power of strategic foresight. However, hindsight often serves as a reminder of opportunities missed. As Binance continues to solidify its position as a leading force in the crypto market, the question naturally arises: What will be the next significant opportunity to capture the spotlight? That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) comes in. Dubbed the best crypto investment of 2024 , Qubetics offers cutting-edge tech and real-world utility through its QubeQode IDE. With the presale in its 11th stage, this might just be your second chance at life-changing gains. Qubetics: Why It’s the Best Crypto Investment Right Now Qubetics is rewriting the rules of blockchain development with its QubeQode IDE . Imagine a world where you don’t need to be a coding wizard to create blockchain applications. QubeQode’s drag-and-drop interface makes blockchain accessible to everyone, from tech startups to mom-and-pop shops. Take a small bakery owner, for example. Using QubeQode, they could create a customer rewards system on the blockchain without hiring expensive developers. Or picture a freelance designer who tokenises their work to sell it globally with just a few clicks. Qubetics is making blockchain not just easy but indispensable. The $TICS presale is currently at $0.0282, with a price hike imminent. For just $500, you could grab 17,730 tokens today, which analysts predict could be worth $88,650 when $TICS hits $5. Compare that to Binance’s current price, and it’s clear why Qubetics is the best crypto investment for 2024. Binance: The King of the Crypto Jungle Binance wasn’t always the behemoth it is today. Launched in 2017, its ICO price was just $0.12. Fast forward to now, and BNB trades in the hundreds, making early investors millionaires. Binance’s secret sauce? A combination of high-speed transactions, low fees, and an ever-expanding ecosystem that includes everything from DeFi to NFTs. Today, BNB is more than a coin; it’s a cornerstone of the crypto world. But even giants have hurdles. Binance faced regulatory scrutiny in multiple countries, and while it has emerged stronger, some investors remain cautious about its future. Analysts predict BNB could hit $800 by 2025, but its high entry price makes it less accessible for small investors. For those who missed Binance’s early days, the search for a more affordable yet equally promising investment has led to Qubetics. Grab This Chance Before It’s Gone Binance built an empire, but Qubetics is building bridges. Its QubeQode IDE democratises blockchain, enabling businesses and individuals to leverage its power without the steep learning curve. Unlike Binance, which largely benefits traders and institutional players, Qubetics caters to everyday users, bringing blockchain into daily life. Missing Binance’s ICO felt like a gut punch, but you don’t have to feel that way again. Qubetics is here, offering a presale price that’s within reach and a vision that’s set to revolutionise blockchain. The best crypto investment isn’t about looking back; it’s about seizing the future. Don’t wait— grab $TICS before it’s too late .

Market analysts say that while the journey to make huge profits is never guaranteed, several top altcoins and platforms are worthwhile investments due to their growth potential. Among them are Ripple (XRP) and FXGuys ($FXG) . Each of them offers exclusive opportunities in the bullish market. Read on to discover why $FXG, a presale cryptocurrency, is generating buzz in the market! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Ripple’s XRP Targets $6 With a New Prediction Amid Bull Market Momentum XRP has been among the notable winners in the current crypto bull market with its massive growth since the start of November 2024. With the exponential upside momentum, analysts believe Ripple’s XRP will continue rising. One analyst, Jacob Canfield, highlighted a notable difference in XRP’s recent move compared to its 2017 rally. With Bitcoin’s (BTC) price five times higher in 2024, Canfield used his Fibonacci extensions to estimate XRP’s possible target at h 11.09 extension. This target translates to about $6.60—double the token’s previous all-time high. The analyst believes this is a realistic FOMO target and cautioned against expecting double-digit prices and beyond. Canfield projected that the Ripple coin might encounter resistance between $2.75 and $3.00, resulting in a pullback to liquidate leveraged longs. Ripple’s XRP was trading at $2.52 on December 4, 2024, up 82% in the past week. Experts say the Ripple coin will rise to $3.38 this month as more developments are implemented on the Ripple network. Although XRP is expected to keep thriving, investors are also buying $FXG, a lucrative DeFi coin dominating the market. $FXG: A Presale Cryptocurrency Dominating the Bull Market As the bull market continues to intensify, analysts and investors are always on the lookout for the next lucrative investment opportunity in the crypto space.

Meanwhile, Ethereum also surged above $4000 and is trying hard to secure the levels that could push the prices towards a new ATH. This could be the reason why the XRP price remained bullish in the long term, although the short-term price action indicated a more than 10% drop. Now that the price has begun with a steep recovery, will the XRP price reach $3, forming new highs for the year before the yearend? After marking the interim lows around $2.18, the price rebounded, preventing excess price drain but is yet to trigger a strong upswing. As the volume remains largely still, the probability of a strong rise remains aloof. Meanwhile, the recent rebound indicates there is more room for the bulls to thrive, indicating XRP could be gearing up for a 25% in the next fortnight followed by a 40% upswing in the first few weeks of 2025. The current trade setup of XRP suggests the token has become highly volatile as the Bollinger bands stand expanded and the price remains stuck to the upper bands. Besides, the RSI remains within the overbought range, suggesting the bulls continue to hold a tight grip over the rally. Therefore, the price is expected to rise above 1 FIB at $2.9 this weekend and later head towards the next target at $3.5 at 1.2 FIB before the end of 2024. Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD was set to lauch, which was built to enhance the cross-border payments along with XRP. The rounds of launch had set the XRP price on fire; meanwhile, a delay has caused the price to face a small downturn.

Analysts highlight its staking app and potential price surge after exchange listing. Table of Contents Why ClayBro says STARS can 10X in two weeks Crypto All-Stars lets meme coin holders generate long-term passive income Secure STARS for the altcoin season The Crypto All-Stars (STARS) presale is on a roll. After hitting the $9 million total raised mark, a prominent analyst has published a viral deep dive on the project, tipping it for huge gains once it lists on exchanges. Crypto All-Stars has cultivated a strong reputation among traders and analysts for its innovative meme coin staking application, which is expected to launch once the presale ends. Investors can buy STARS at presale for $0.0016782, but this is the last chance to buy at a fixed price. STARS will launch on exchanges once the presale ends in 14 days. Those who buy after that may need to pay a much higher premium. So don’t leave it to chance. Act now and participate in this promising project from the ground up. Why ClayBro says STARS can 10X in two weeks ClayBro is a popular crypto analyst with over 130K YouTube subscribers. In a recent video, the high-profile expert said that Crypto All-Stars could be the next meme coin to provide 10x gains. But why? ClayBro highlighted that the Crypto All-Stars presale funding is growing exponentially, signaling a deep market appetite that will translate to continued demand once it launches on exchanges. “Doing between $500,000 and $1 million per day, Crypto All-Stars is finally catching on fire. I am extremely excited about what’s going to happen. This could be one of the top meme coins to buy now,” he said. ClayBro also underlined the significant media spotlight that Crypto All-Stars is getting, even being dubbed a “top meme coin” on high-ranking Google search results. And it’s not just a hype job. There’s real substance driving excitement surrounding Crypto All-Stars . For the first time ever, it’s giving the meme coin sector a means of utility. You might also like: Memecoin prices soar as Crypto All-Stars hits $2m in presale Crypto All-Stars lets meme coin holders generate long-term passive income MemeVault and STARS staking offer users ways to generate passive income on meme coins. Beginning with MemeVault, users can lock up 11 of the top meme coins, including Dogecoin , Shiba Inu , and Pepe, to earn passive STARS rewards. For many of the tokens supported, this is the first time holders can use them for anything other than buying and selling. But there’s a kicker: users must hold STARS to access the platform, and their rewards are tied to how much they have. This means that all those meme coin holders who are hungry for passive rewards must accumulate as much STARS as possible. It’s a setup geared toward bolstering demand and price potential. Users can also stake their STARS tokens to maximize their rewards. STARS staking is live amid the presale and currently providing a 245% APY, but this will decrease as the staking pool grows. 25% of the total STARS supply is allocated to presale staking rewards, while 20% is allocated to the presale, 20% to marketing, 10% to exchange liquidity, and 25% to the MemeVault ecosystem. Secure STARS for the altcoin season The Crypto All-Stars presale is ending in 14 days, just in time for the upcoming altcoin season. Altcoin prices have begun to outperform Bitcoin’s this month, reflecting a shift in market dynamics where traders rotate capital into smaller cryptocurrencies to generate more gains. This, in turn, sends the prices of altcoins soaring. For perspective, Bitcoin has risen 32% this month, while Dogecoin has soared by over 100%. Many smaller altcoins have risen even more. Last cycle, once we entered ""Altcoin Season"" territory, we stayed there for 88 days. So far this run, we've only been there for 5 days. The biggest gains come the longer we stay in this zone. This is only the warm up. pic.twitter.com/GZAGy2Ezuz — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) December 5, 2024 Crypto All-Stars is emerging on the market at just the right time, but the window for taking advantage is closing. Traders can buy STARS via the project’s website or by using the Best Wallet app, which can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play Store .

37325688,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624151,1733561675,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37325688.jpeg,White House Crypto Czar David Sacks will investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-czar-investigate-choke-point/,"David Sacks, the White House’s Crypto and AI Czar, is stepping into the storm surrounding Operation Choke Point 2.0, a program that crypto insiders say has sabotaged businesses, wiped out innovation, and gutted the industry’s financial lifelines. In a public statement, David hinted at immediate scrutiny, saying , “There are too many stories of people being hurt by Operation Choke Point 2.0. It needs to be looked at.” His statement came after Chris Lane, former CTO of Silvergate Bank, publicly detailed how regulatory moves destroyed the bank, a once-vital player in the crypto economy. “FTX didn’t kill us. Regulators did,” he wrote, explaining how the bank was driven out of business despite surviving a 70% deposit run after the FTX collapse. Silvergate had been instrumental in creating the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a crucial infrastructure for crypto transactions. But according to Chris, U.S. regulators pulled the rug from under them in early 2023, severely limiting the dollar deposits Silvergate could accept from crypto clients. The bank had no choice but to shut down and liquidate. This sudden pivot from regulators, described by Chris as a “bait and switch,” has become a rallying cry for those who see Operation Choke Point 2.0 as a deliberate move to suffocate the crypto industry. Crypto executives speak out Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano and Ethereum, called Operation Choke Point 2.0 a “coordinated global campaign against crypto.” He took to X (formerly Twitter) to decry the program’s fallout, saying it has crushed businesses, stifled economies, and slowed innovation worldwide. “This isn’t just an American problem,” he wrote. “So many people put their heads in the sand, saying it’s not as bad as the industry makes it out to be. It’s worse. Global. So many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed.” Charles warned that the damage from this crackdown could take years to undo. He urged the crypto community to act quickly to push for legislation, saying, “We have a small window of time to get a law passed.” Gabriel Abed, chairman of Binance and a prominent figure in global crypto circles, revealed how he was personally targeted. First Citizens Caribbean Bank shut down his accounts, which he had held for over a decade, because of a bitcoin-related deposit. The bank’s CEO admitted the closure was to protect its relationships with U.S. correspondent banks, which had labeled crypto businesses as “high-risk.” Biden administration accused of reviving Choke Point Crypto leaders are pointing fingers at the Biden administration, accusing it of resurrecting Operation Choke Point . The original program, launched in 2013 under the Obama administration, pressured banks to sever ties with industries deemed “high-risk,” such as payday lenders and firearms dealers. Crypto execs believe that legitimate businesses were being unfairly targeted. While the program officially ended in 2017, crypto insiders claim its successor began in 2021, this time with blockchain companies in its sights. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been one of the most vocal. He accused Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler of orchestrating the crackdown. “This was one of the most unethical and un-American things that happened in the Biden administration,” Brian said. He revealed that Coinbase has filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover the extent of government involvement. Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini , also weighed in, saying he was “debanked because I’m in crypto.” Tyler confirmed that over 30 tech founders were similarly targeted, many from firms backed by Andreessen Horowitz. “This is about control, not compliance,” said Marc Andreessen , a venture capitalist and another debanked tech founder. He argued that this operation goes beyond crypto, framing it as an attack on individual freedom. The stakes are high for the Democrats, who Brian said the crackdown was “a major factor in them losing the election,” calling Warren “a liability” for the party. A financial crisis for the crypto industry Andrew Torba, founder of Gab, described how Operation Choke Point 2.0 has effectively choked businesses to death. “Without a bank account, you can’t store cash, run payroll, or pay bills,” he said. His accounts were repeatedly shut down by banks, credit unions, and even Christian financial institutions. “The reason was always the same: ‘Our terms say we can do this anytime, for any reason, or no reason at all.’” Banks have admitted off the record that they are being pressured by the government, with threats of audits and regulatory scrutiny looming over their heads. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, has also found herself in the crosshairs. Her bank has been debanked multiple times, prompting her to sue the Federal Reserve. Her lawsuit, which will see oral arguments just a day after Inauguration Day, has been described as one of the most “significant” legal challenges against government overreach in the banking sector. The fallout from Operation Choke Point 2.0 is a reminder of how quickly an entire industry can be brought to its knees when financial access is weaponized. Whether Sacks can bring clarity — or justice — remains to be seen.

In a recent video, the analyst shared his predictions and explained why these cryptocurrencies could be top choices for investors in 2024.

With whispers of potential gains reaching 10,000%, this token could overshadow popular picks like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets this coin apart? Many are eager to see if it becomes the next breakout in the crypto market. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump’s victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump’s love for crypto is no secret — he’s promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign. And joining him is none other than Elon Musk , the ultimate Dogecoin (DOGE) fan who’s backed the crypto movement and even aligned with Republicans earlier this year. With these two icons fueling the fire, meme coins are set for a wild ride! DOGE Soars 130% in Just One Week! DOGEN will be the Next Star with 500% Surge Following the US election results, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a steady rise: from $0.15 to $0.39 in just one week . DOGEN follows the same upward trend, starting at $0.0003 and now trading at $0.0011, a staggering 300% leap . With a total of 13 presale stages, DOGEN is set to rise to $0.0019 by the token generation event (TGE), which represents a 500% increase from its initial price. Like it DOGE style?

Live the high life you deserve: luxury cars, stacks of cash , and unforgettable experiences await those who go all-in on DOGEN. Don’t settle for ordinary when you can have it all! Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, it has no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially seen as a “memecoin,” Dogecoin’s value surged in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This was driven by social media influence, especially from Elon Musk, and the general crypto market boom. Dogecoin’s large supply and active community contribute to its popularity. In the current market cycle, its attractiveness depends on market trends and investor sentiment toward meme-based assets. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. SHIB’s use of Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for NFTs and decentralized governance. This integration could give SHIB broader utility in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s potential depends on its continued development and adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem. Conclusion In the current bull run, DOGE and SHIB may offer less short-term potential. DOGEN, crafted for those pursuing luxury and success, is set for 700% growth by the presale’s end, with chances for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following the success of tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN is building a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Popcat In October 2020, the internet was charmed by a simple yet hilarious meme featuring a cat named Oatmeal. Two images, one with Oatmeal’s mouth closed and another edited to form an ‘O’ shape, captured hearts worldwide. Now, this beloved meme has pounced into the cryptocurrency scene as the POPCAT token. Unlike serious coins, POPCAT is a meme coin meant purely for fun, with no inherent value or financial promises. It’s the digital embodiment of Oatmeal’s quirky expressions, offering a lighthearted twist to crypto enthusiasts. In the midst of a volatile market, POPCAT stands out not for its tech but for its entertainment value. While traditional investors eye coins with strong fundamentals, meme coins like POPCAT thrive on community engagement and internet culture. They’re reminiscent of other meme coins like Dogecoin, which started as a joke but gained immense popularity. If you’re looking to inject some fun into your crypto experience, POPCAT might be the perfect choice. However, in a market driven by trends and memes, it’s essential to enjoy the ride without serious financial expectations. SPX6900 In the digital age, numbers on a screen can wield more power than gold. Enter SPX6900, a meme token born from the depths of internet culture. Its mission? To surpass the S&P 500 by reaching an astonishing $69 trillion market cap. The logic is playful yet bold: since 6900 is vastly superior to 500, SPX6900 must be infinitely better than any traditional financial instrument. This whimsical thesis captures the spirit of SPX6900 as it embarks on a journey toward financial domination, powered by the sheer belief that bigger numbers make better investments. SPX6900 taps into the energy of meme culture, blending humor with ambition. Its potential lies in its ability to rally a community around a shared joke with serious aspirations. In the current market, meme coins have shown surprising momentum, with examples like Dogecoin capturing global attention. SPX6900 stands out by aiming higher—much higher. For investors looking to ride the next big wave, SPX6900 offers an attractive proposition. It embraces the trend where fun and finance meet, suggesting that in today’s market, the power of a good meme could be the key to unlocking unprecedented growth. Conclusion With the bull run underway, POPCAT, SPX6900, and XYZVerse show strong potential; XYZVerse unites sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth.

37326432,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624163,1733563339,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37326432.jpeg,“Bitcoin beats the dollar forever” – MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor shares investment strategy,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-beats-dollar-forever-microstrategys/,"MicroStrategy’s executive chairman Michael Saylor has spent the past four years hammering one message home: buy Bitcoin and never sell it. As Bitcoin shattered the $100,000 milestone for the first time this week, Saylor took the opportunity to double down on his aggressive investment strategy. “Every day for the past four years, I’ve said buy Bitcoin, don’t sell the Bitcoin. I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at the top forever,” he told Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton. His approach is brutally straightforward: convert spare capital into Bitcoin, hold it long-term, and ignore the noise. “Just keep buying Bitcoin,” Saylor said . He emphasized treating Bitcoin as a long-term capital asset, perfect for money you won’t need for at least four years—or better yet, ten. Dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin quarterly and sweeping long-term savings into the crypto is Saylor’s go-to move, regardless of short-term volatility. “Don’t get worked up over the swings,” he said. MicroStrategy has evidently taken this philosophy to the extreme, transforming itself into what Saylor calls a “Bitcoin treasury company.” Since 2020, the company has been on a relentless buying spree, turning heads and dividing Wall Street. Bitcoin breaks records, but MicroStrategy stumbles Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $103,992 on December 4, a moment that crypto enthusiasts had long anticipated. MicroStrategy’s stock MSTR , which many view as a proxy for Bitcoin, also surged that day, reaching a peak of $543. But the celebration was short-lived. By the next morning, MicroStrategy’s stock plummeted 28%, closing at $406. It dropped another 4.8% on Thursday, leaving investors questioning the strategy. MicroStrategy’s market value hinges on its Bitcoin holdings, but its stock doesn’t always move in tandem with Bitcoin. Right now, the company’s shares trade at 2.3 times the value of its Bitcoin stash, a drop from the 3.4X multiple it boasted in November. For bullish investors, this is a disappointment. Many hoped the stock would trade at a much higher premium, even reaching double digits. Despite the volatility, MicroStrategy’s performance this year has been nothing short of dramatic. Its stock has skyrocketed 512% year-to-date, dwarfing Coinbase’s 84% gain and Robinhood’s 205% rise. Yet, those numbers pale compared to Bitcoin’s recent surge. Investors betting on MicroStrategy to outperform Bitcoin were left hanging. Critics argue the stock doesn’t provide the same upside as Bitcoin itself. Traders have also piled into leveraged MicroStrategy ETFs, amplifying both gains and losses. JPMorgan said earlier this week that leveraged ETFs have become a popular but risky way to bet on the company’s fortunes. Trump’s victory fuels Bitcoin’s rise The crypto market got a fat boost after Donald Trump’s November 5 election win. The president-elect’s crypto-friendly policies, including his decision to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, sent Bitcoin soaring past $100,000. Atkins has a track record of supporting digital assets, and his appointment has been widely interpreted as a green light for Bitcoin-friendly regulations. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy wasn’t always a Bitcoin powerhouse. The company originally sold business analytics software. That changed in 2020 when Saylor began pouring company cash into Bitcoin. Since then, the firm has pivoted entirely, branding itself as a bridge between traditional capital markets and the crypto economy. “Our job is to connect the two worlds,” Saylor said in a recent CNBC interview. This hasn’t come without risks. While Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins appeals to Saylor, it hasn’t insulated MicroStrategy from criticism. Nearly 20 million Bitcoins have already been mined, leaving only 5% of the total supply remaining. Saylor sees this scarcity as a major advantage, predicting 50% annual returns for the cryptocurrency. But skeptics question whether MicroStrategy can sustain its strategy . MicroStrategy has increased its Bitcoin holdings by 60% since September 30. The firm’s average cost per Bitcoin has risen to $58,000, up from $39,000 earlier this year. It should be noted that MicroStrategy bought fewer than 9,000 Bitcoins in 2022 when prices were low but ramped up its purchases as prices soared to record levels. Saylor brushed off these concerns in an interview with Barron’s . “People think you’re going to dilute them, but our plan is to accrete them,” he said. The company measures this accretion using a metric it calls Bitcoin “yield.” While not a yield in the traditional sense, it reflects the increase in Bitcoin held per share. This year, Bitcoin per 1,000 shares has jumped from 0.9 to 1.5, a 60% gain. Volatility has been both a challenge and an opportunity. MicroStrategy’s stock is about 10 times as volatile as the S&P 500 , according to Saylor. This volatility has allowed the company to issue convertible debt at attractive terms, including a zero interest rate and a high conversion price of $672—a 55% premium to its current market price. And analysts remain bullish. Bloomberg claims that all eight firms covering MicroStrategy have issued buy ratings, a sign of continued confidence in Saylor’s strategy. “You don’t need to understand how we do it. You just need to hold your Bitcoin and let us drive the price up,” he has said.

However, while this milestone has generated optimism among investors, market metrics indicate potential risks of profit-taking and corrections. Related Reading: Ethereum Crosses $3,800: Is The ‘God Candle’ Nearing? Analysts Weigh In Another Major Correction Incoming? A CryptoQuant analyst known as ShayanBTC has recently shared insights into Ethereum’s futures market behavior, highlighting a key indicator that suggests caution might be warranted. According to the analyst, Ethereum’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, a critical metric for analyzing market sentiment, has shown a substantial increase in sell-side activity. This development aligns with Ethereum’s approach to the $4,000 resistance level. The metric, which measures the aggressiveness of buyers versus sellers in futures markets, reveals that sellers increasingly dominate trades as the price edges upward. Shayan disclosed that Ethereum’s futures market participants appear to be locking in profits or preparing for a potential price correction. The Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has reached its lowest point in several months, indicating that market participants are leaning toward a risk-off stance. This trend suggests that the aggressive futures market sell orders could slow Ethereum’s upward momentum, paving the way for a potential pullback or consolidation phase. The analyst particularly wrote: The drop in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio implies a possible slowdown in upward price movement as more market participants take a risk-off approach. This aligns with anticipating a price pullback or a correction phase, making it crucial for traders to monitor the futures market for further developments. What Next For Ethereum? At the time of writing, Ethereum still hovers above $$4,000, up by 3.1% in the past day. This price increase has boosted ETH’s market cap above $482 billion as of today and its daily trading volume to roughly $56.7 billion. Notably, the drop in the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio highlighted by Shayan reflects an overall cautious sentiment among futures market participants, often a precursor to heightened market volatility.

If confirmed, Crenshaw would serve on the commission through 2029. But if not, former President Donald Trump could seize the opportunity to nominate an alternative. Crenshaw, known for his closeness to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, has been a strong advocate for stricter climate reporting regulations during his tenure and has consistently opposed cryptocurrency initiatives, including voting against approving Bitcoin ETFs. His opposition to Bitcoin Spot ETFs in particular has garnered a lot of attention. After the SEC approved a series of rule changes that would allow Bitcoin-based products to be traded on national exchanges, Crenshaw issued a strongly worded statement opposing the move. He called the decision “unsound and anachronistic,” arguing that it undermines the SEC’s duty to protect investors. Related News: In Light of the Bull Rally, the Crypto Community's Top 20 Altcoins of Interest in the Last Week Revealed “The ETPs that will be activated by today’s decision are inextricably tied to the Bitcoin spot markets,” Crenshaw said at the time, adding: “The fraud and manipulation that impacts the spot BTC price will almost certainly impact the spot BTC price held in ETPs.

Chainlink whale activity soars by 1,219%, driving LINK’s price growth Chainlink recorded an increase of 1,219% in whale activity on December 2, 2024, with these transactions hitting $858.08 million. This coincided with a 31% price growth, bringing LINK to trade above $24. Interestingly, the token has gained over 35%, highlighting strong market momentum. Whale activity indicates considerable buying and selling, which affects the price of the token. IntoTheBlock data suggests that whales are accumulating LINK and capitalizing on the price rally. The massive activity highlights investor confidence in Chainlink’s growing ecosystem. Chainlink has continued to grow via high-profile collaborations with reputable entities like Swift, Euroclear, and Brazil’s central bank, which leverage Chainlink for its CBDC project. These advancements show Chainlink’s integral role in blending AI, oracles, and blockchain technology across the financial markets. LINK was valued at $24.11 on December 6, up 36.29% in the past week. Analysts say LINK will rise to $29 this month as more whales accumulate the token. As LINK shows massive growth potential, investors are turning to a new $0.12 DeFi coin that could deliver your annual income in a month. Ethereum Eyes $4,000 with growing whale activity and bullish sentiment Ethereum’s ETH is around 18% below its all-time high, recording the potential to surpass $4,000 for the first time in nine months. The main drivers include a growing 7-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and growing whale accumulation. The 7-day MVRV, now at 6.1%, highlights growing unrealized profits and increased optimism among short-term holders. Historically, levels around 7% or higher result in corrections, but the rally may extend further if the sentiment remains bullish. Whale accumulation is also growing, with wallets holding over 1,000 ETH, hitting 5,599, a high since October 6, 2024. This growing interest from whales highlights confidence in ETH’s price trajectory. If ETH surpasses $4,000, it could go to its all-time high of $4,867. However, if the momentum fades, ETH may retest support at $3,688, $3,500, or $3,255. ETH was trading at $3,904 on December 6, up 9.16% in the past week. Analysts say ETH will rise to $4205.16 this month as more investors buy the altcoin. Investors are turning to a new DeFi coin that has massive growth potential. Thus, it is a good crypto to buy. DTX is considered a good crypto to buy over LINK and ETH in this bull market The dynamic crypto market continues to attract investors with innovative projects like DTX Exchange, which is impacting crypto trading massively. With growing interest from Chainlink and Ethereum whales, the DeFi coin has massive profit potential that has made it a good crypto to buy in this bull cycle. DTX Exchange’s unique features position it perfectly to outpace the established investments as more investors rush to buy the token. DTX is selling rapidly in Stage 6 of its public presale, valued at $0.12, which also implies a 500% profit for early buyers who acquired it at $0.02. Additionally, new investors will receive a 67% profit once the DeFi coin completes the presale phase and launches on mainstream markets at $0.20.

With this political shift, the crypto market has been experiencing a big rally for weeks and might continue for a significant time, per analysts. In this, the Trump meme coins also faced a boost, increasing their demand. However, this boost is not constant, as it is too far from their prime days. Interestingly, today is different as they are all up after significant surges. Donald Trump Meme Coins On The Rise With Donald Trump changing his perspective on the crypto industry, creators are launching more and more Trump-themed meme coins to the crypto market. More importantly, these are gaining significant attention, as they are highly volatile and pump easily with Trump-related news. Today, all the major Trump meme coins are up, including tokens like MAGA, TRUMP, STRUMP, and others per CoinmarketCap . In this, the MAGA (maga-hat.vip) is on a week-long rally, where the price has surged 81%. More importantly, it has gained 10% of its value in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $0.0001072 with market capitalization and trading volume of $41.84M and $16.24M. The next in line is the Crypto President Trump (TRUMP), launched just three days ago. In this period, the token has surged 62809.24%, showcasing high demand. In the last 24 hours alone, its value has surged 519%, currently valued at $0.006784. Additionally, its market capitalization and trading volume are at $568.02M and $28.19M. Super Trump Coin (STRUMP) is also following a major rally, as the price has surged more than 19% today. This surge is because of the increased trading activity for the token, as the 24-hour trading volume has surged 500% to $4.42M. Presently, it is trading at $0.002448 with a market capitalization of $4.50M. Interestingly, the same is the case with many other Trump meme coins, confirming an increased demand for this category of tokens. 3 Reasons Why Trump-Themed Meme Coins Are Bullish Today Despite their association with Donald Trump, these Trump-themed meme coins are not always bullish and have declined from their prime. However, the building momentum and the upcoming Trump inauguration can push these tokens to new highs. For now, today’s surge in Trump tokens is surprising, but these three factors made that happen. 1. Donald Trump Crypto Czar David Sacks The biggest reason behind the ongoing Trump meme coins surge is Donald Trump appointing David Sacks as the White House A.I. and Crypto Czar. David is a venture investor and podcaster and has already begun showing interest in crypto regulation. As a crypto czar, David’s main role is to build a crypto’s legal framework. This news itself is increasing trust in the crypto industry. 2. Pro-Crypto Administration Donald Trump has appointed many crypto-friendly associates for this term. It includes picking Paul Atkins for the SEC Chair position . As a result, the excitement is increasing among investors to witness better regulations in this pro-crypto administration. Many industry experts have openly acknowledged that Gary’s leadership has restricted the crypto industry’s growth. With Trump working on his 11 crypto industry promises , including turning the US into crypto capital, investors are eyeing higher gains with Trump-themed tokens. 3. Crypto Market Rally & FOMO Returning To Trump Meme Coins On December 5, 2024, Bitcoin price created a new ATH at $103,900.47, crossing the $100k mark. The token has been bullish for weeks and maintained the crypto market rally. The impact is also visible in the Trump-themed meme coins, as FOMO is building for these tokens. Donald Trump also congratulated the industry for this achievement and took some credit, writing, “YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Although the Bitcoin price has moved down to $99.5k, the user’s sentiments are ‘extremely bullish, which may lead to further gains. Final Thoughts The crypto market is in the prime of 2024, and investors are anticipating this rally to turn into a bull run. With the ‘extremely bullish sentiments,’ and Trump building the pro-crypto administration, the cryptocurrencies are bullish, including the Trump meme coins. More importantly, Donald Trump has appointed David Sacks as the White House A.I. and Crypto Czar, so transparent and crypto-favorable regulations might be coming next. As a result, investors are focusing on the Trump-themed meme coins in anticipation of their future rallies with the Trump administration.

This growth comes amid a heated bull market that continues to draw institutional and retail investors into the crypto space. The rise in active wallets underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets, with stablecoins playing a central role in this expansion. Chainalysis noted that the increasing number of wallets with non-zero balances is indicative of the broader adoption trend, even though wallet counts do not necessarily equate to individual users. The report highlighted a “seismic shift” in how digital assets are perceived and utilized. Researchers attributed this cycle’s unique momentum to a convergence of the digital economy with traditional financial institutions entering the market through products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Stablecoins Lead the Way Stablecoins have emerged as a dominant force in onchain transactions, accounting for 50% to 75% of all onchain activity since the start of 2024, the report revealed. These dollar-pegged assets, often used as on-ramps and off-ramps for the crypto market, are proving to be more than just transactional tools. In emerging markets like Venezuela and much of Latin America, stablecoins have become indispensable as a store of value and a lifeline for remittances. These digital dollars are offering access to liquidity in regions grappling with tight capital controls or limited access to the US dollar. Recognition Among Policymakers The utility of stablecoins has not gone unnoticed by global policymakers. US Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller remarked in October that stablecoins could enhance financial systems by lowering cross-border settlement costs. Echoing this sentiment, the US Treasury’s Borrowing Advisory Committee noted that stablecoins are boosting demand for Treasury bills and improving the efficiency of issuing Treasury assets. Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla also stressed the importance of stablecoins in a letter to US lawmakers. He argued that stablecoins are vital for maintaining the dollar’s relevance in the evolving digital economy and crypto adoption.

This marks an impressive 9.94% growth from October, the biggest monthly jump since November 2021. While stablecoins are rising, The U.S. Financial Services Oversight Council (FSOC) has issued its 2024 annual report , flagging stablecoins as a potential threat to financial stability. The report emphasizes that without proper risk management standards, stablecoins are “acutely vulnerable to runs,” posing risks that could ripple through both the crypto and traditional financial systems. Market Concentration and Vulnerabilities The FSOC highlighted the heavy concentration in the stablecoin market, noting that a single issuer dominates approximately 70% of the market’s total value. Although the report did not explicitly name Tether (USDT), it is evident that Tether, with a $136.8 billion market cap—representing 66.3% of the $205.48 billion total stablecoin market—matches this description. The Council warned that the failure of such a dominant player could severely disrupt the broader crypto market and potentially affect the traditional financial system. Concerns have previously been raised about Tether’s lack of third-party audits, with comparisons made to FTX’s liquidity crisis, further doubling fears. Challenges to Market Discipline The FSOC also pointed out the lack of a robust regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. Many issuers operate outside federal oversight, with some under minimal state-level supervision. The Council noted the absence of transparent reporting on holdings and reserves, which hinders market discipline and increases risks of fraud. Recalling the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) in 2022—when the stablecoin lost its peg to the U.S. dollar, plunging from $1 to $0.09—the FSOC reiterated the risks of unregulated stablecoins and their potential to destabilize the market. To help stabilize existing challenges, the FSOC has called on Congress to quickly create a federal law to regulate stablecoin issuers. This law should focus on issues like protecting against runs, ensuring safe payment systems, maintaining market integrity, and protecting investors. The FSOC also warned that if Congress doesn’t act soon, they may take other actions. Crypto Implications Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino recently highlighted concerns over Europe’s upcoming MiCA regulations, which mandate stablecoin issuers to hold at least 60% of reserves in European banks. Ardoino warned that since banks can loan up to 90% of their reserves, these rules could introduce “systemic risks,” potentially destabilizing the crypto market. The FSOC’s warning underscores the urgency of implementing regulatory measures to secure the stability of both the crypto and traditional financial markets as stablecoins grow in prominence.",News|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|LUNA|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 09:46:54

In a series of X posts recently, Musk has ignited speculations with posts related to Dogecoin, especially as he is known for his active support of the meme coin. In addition, the newly formed organization by Donald Trump, Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, has further fueled optimism. Doge Father Elon Musk Share Cryptic Posts Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is well known among the crypto market enthusiasts, especially for his earlier backing for Dogecoin. In addition, his recent support for pro-Bitcoin Donald Trump, ahead of the US election, has also caught the eyes of the market participants in recent days. Recently, Musk has shared a series of X posts related to DOGE, which has sparked widespread discussions in the market. Notably, in a post, the billionaire shared an image with his son and called himself “The Doge Father”. Besides, he has called his son as “The DogeSon.” Source: Elon Musk, X Meanwhile, he has also commented on the post, saying “Doge & Minidoge.” Additionally, Musk has sparked intrigue with another cryptic post on X, featuring an image of a smoke-shaped Shiba Inu dog engulfing a city. The image, shared without comment, is a repeat of a similar post made by Musk in November, following which Dogecoin has noted a strong rally. Source: Elon Musk, X Notably, the Dogecoin price also saw a spike today following Musk’s post, leaving many speculating over the potential reason behind the post. Besides, the billionaire has shared a flurry of posts regarding the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) recently, sparking optimism, as the short form of the organization resembles the Dogecoin ticker. Dogecoin Rallies Indicating Strong Market Confidence The top meme coins have noted a strong rally recently, indicating a shifting focus of the investors towards the segment. Amid this, the “Doge Father” Elon Musk’s post appears to have further boosted the market sentiment, as evidenced by the recent surge in Dogecoin. DOGE price today was up nearly 5%, especially after Musk’s post, and exchanged hands at $0.45. However, its trading volume fell more than 26% to $7 billion at the same time. Notably, the crypto has touched a low of $0.4213. Furthermore, CoinGlass data showed that Dogecoin Futures Open Interest rose more than 8% to $4.04 billion, indicating strong market confidence in the leading dog-themed meme coin . Besides, the Baby Doge Coin price also rallied more than 51% following the post. However, in another post, the Tesla CEO has backed D.O.G.E. advisor Ron Paul , which has also caught the eyes of the market participants. In a recent update, Paul announced that he recommends eliminating foreign aid completely, saying that since World War II, nothing has benefited the US with its foreign policies. Meanwhile, a recent Dogecoin price analysis hints at a potential rally of DOGE to $0.5. If the momentum continues, the analysis showed that the crypto could target $0.7 next, and potentially rally towards the $1 mark.

BTC Looks Toward $100K It was another historic week in the cryptocurrency markets as bitcoin did what many thought throughout the years as impossible.

As such, it managed to break through the coveted $100,000 line and jumped to a mark a fresh all-time high of $103,800.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.
