From as early as January this year, developers have hinted at the need to implement this changes to the mainnet. Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is in support of a 33% limit. To Galaxy Digital, there is more to consider in quest to make this move. Ethereum Gas Limit: Is The Time Right? As discussed by Galaxy Researcher Christine Kim, at the latest Ethereum all developers’ conference also witnessed arguments in support. Nethermind developer Marek Moraczyński presented data-driven research on why an increase is justified and safe for the protocol. In comment, Kim highlighted there are factors that need analyzing on why this proposal is worth considering. First, the block gas limit will not impact the blockchain. Several researches have pointed at this, invalidating claims that increment above 25% might overload the network. tldr; there’s enough data and research to suggest that a gas limit increase won’t hurt Ethereum. but in light of the network’s scaling roadmap, it likely won’t help either in terms of fees, activity, or overall network value. so why push for it at all? https://t.co/bx56kSvDS4 — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) December 6, 2024 On the other hand, Christine Kim said “it is also likely that it won’t materially help Ethereum in any way either.” With the broad uncertainty, the researcher noted that the timing is not right for the major validators to get behind the proposal. Naming Coinbase and Kraken Exchanges, she said the speculations surrounding the Ethereum block gas limit increase might cause some drawbacks. Increasing the gas limt will help scale the Ethereum protocol by a considerable measure. If ongoing considerations around the limit increase passes, the developers have plans to EIPs to implement it in the Pectra Upgrade . Whether or not the protocol will inplement Ethereum gas limits as a temporary scalability fix, Galaxy Research hinted that now is not the time. Growing Layer 1 Competition Over the past year, different Layer 1 blockchain networks have hinted at plans to upgrade their chains. Vitalik Buterin has stayed at the top of the conversation, hinting in series his visions for scaling ETH in the coming decade. While Ethereum is leveraging the strength of its layer-2 scaling solutions to command the majority of traction in the industry, other chains are also stepping up. As revealed recently, the Cardano Hydra protocol recorded a 1 million transaction per second milestone in test mode. As Cardano’s scaling tool, this figures, if transferred to real world will make the protocol the fastest in the industry. Other chains like Solana, SUI Network and XRP Ledger also have their inherent strengths amid growing competition.

Qubetics Is Your Next Big Investment,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-polygon-bandwagon-qubetics-is-your-next-big-investment/,"The crypto market never sleeps, and neither does the FOMO it generates. Over the past few years, we’ve watched coins like Polygon (MATIC) soar, turning early adopters into overnight millionaires. If you didn’t hop on the MATIC train back in 2020, you’re not alone—it feels like most of us missed that bus. But here’s the good news: missing out on Polygon might just be your best blessing in disguise. Why? Because a new opportunity has arrived that’s making even the most seasoned investors sit up and pay attention. Meet Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary crypto project that’s shaking up the space with its bold vision for real-world asset tokenisation. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy, Qubetics is not just an option—it’s the opportunity of the season. Qubetics ($TICS): Where Web3 Meets the Real World If you’ve been in the crypto game for a while, you’ve probably heard plenty of projects making big claims about “bridging the gap” between blockchain and the real world. Most of them fall short, but Qubetics is different. It’s not just building a bridge—it’s redefining what’s possible by tokenising real-world assets. So, what exactly does that mean? At its core, Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator that’s focused on real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT). It’s taking tangible, physical assets like real estate, luxury cars, and even high-value collectibles and turning them into digital tokens. This isn’t just some abstract concept—it’s a game-changing solution that’s unlocking liquidity for individuals and businesses. Imagine this: You’re a property owner who needs quick cash but doesn’t want to sell your entire building. With Qubetics, you can tokenise a portion of your property, sell fractional ownership, and raise capital faster than a bank loan. Or let’s say you’re an art collector with a multi-million-dollar masterpiece. Instead of selling the entire painting, you could sell digital ownership fractions to buyers across the globe. That’s the kind of flexibility Qubetics brings to the table. And it’s not just for the ultra-wealthy. Small business owners can use Qubetics to unlock value from their physical assets, while individuals can invest in tokenised assets that were once out of reach. Whether you’re an entrepreneur looking to expand or a young professional wanting to diversify your portfolio, Qubetics is creating a world where you don’t need to be a millionaire to play the big leagues. Now, let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in its 11th presale stage, and the buzz is unreal. Over 275 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, raising more than $4.6 million from 6,800+ holders. And those who jumped in early? They’re already seeing gains. $TICS tokens were priced at $0.025 in the 10th stage, and now they’re at $0.0282—a solid 10% increase. Analysts predict the token could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a whopping 776% ROI. But that’s just the start. Post-launch, $TICS could reach $1, $5, or even $15, turning modest investments into small fortunes. Think about it: if you invest $10,000 at today’s price of $0.0282, you’d snag 354,609 $TICS tokens. At $1, your investment grows to $354,609. And at $15? You’re looking at a life-changing $5.3 million. That’s not just a win—that’s legendary. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Because it’s not just a token—it’s a tool for the future, solving real-world problems in a way no other project has managed to do. Polygon: The Layer-2 Powerhouse That Changed the Game Let’s switch gears and talk about Polygon. If you’ve been in crypto for any amount of time, you’ve probably heard about this Layer-2 scaling solution that’s made Ethereum’s clunky transaction fees and slow speeds a thing of the past. Polygon didn’t just improve Ethereum—it supercharged it. Back in the day, Ethereum’s high gas fees were driving users and developers away. Enter Polygon. With its ability to process thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost, it became the go-to solution for developers building decentralised apps (dApps), NFT platforms, and DeFi protocols. It’s like the Robin Hood of crypto—taking from the inefficiencies of Ethereum and giving power back to the people. And the world noticed. Polygon has partnered with some of the biggest brands out there—think Starbucks, Adidas, Disney, and Reddit. These partnerships aren’t just PR stunts; they’re real-world use cases that cement Polygon’s place as a foundational piece of Web3 infrastructure. But here’s the thing: while Polygon has seen explosive growth, its days of life-changing ROI may be behind it. If you snagged MATIC back in 2020 when it was trading at under a penny, congratulations—you’re probably sitting on a fortune. Today, though, MATIC hovers around $0.85–$1. For new investors, it’s still a solid play, but the 10,000% gains? Those are in the rearview. Let’s break it down. A $10,000 investment in MATIC today might double or triple in value over time, but it’s unlikely to deliver the astronomical returns we’ve seen in the past. It’s a safer bet for those looking for stability, but for investors chasing the best crypto to buy for high-risk, high-reward gains, Polygon may not scratch that itch anymore. Why did Polygon make it to this list? Because it’s still a rock-solid project with a proven track record. It may not be the next moonshot, but it’s a cornerstone of the blockchain world. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now So, where does this leave us? If you’re looking for stability and long-term growth, Polygon remains a smart choice. But if you’re after a coin with the potential to deliver life-changing returns, Qubetics ($TICS) is where you should be focusing your attention. Qubetics isn’t just another token in a sea of thousands. It’s a visionary project that’s bringing blockchain into the real world in ways we’ve only dreamed of. With its focus on real-world asset tokenisation, Qubetics is unlocking new opportunities for businesses, investors, and everyday people alike. And the timing couldn’t be better. The presale is heating up, the price is still accessible, and the potential ROI is off the charts. Don’t wait until $TICS is trading at $1, $5, or $15 to realise you should’ve jumped in earlier. This is your chance to catch the next big wave before it’s gone. The best crypto to buy isn’t going to wait for you. Head over to Qubetics now and secure your slice of the future before the price climbs again. Don’t just watch the crypto market evolve—be a part of the revolution.

As is the tradition with the cryptocurrency exchange, a seed tag will be attached to the listing. For context, tokens with seed tags may have a different product or user base than established digital assets. Hence, Binance tries to notify its users of such tokens’ high volatility and potential trading risks. Users must pass a risk-awareness quiz every 90 days to continue trading ACX and ORCA. Also, they must periodically reaffirm their agreement with Binance’s Terms of Use. Price of ACX And ORCA Spikes by 3 Digits According to the announcement, ACX and ORCA trading will commence today, December 6, at 13:00 UTC with the spot trading pairs ACX/USDT and ORCA/USDT. A deposit for both tokens is now available in preparation for the trading session. Withdrawals will be open on December 7, 2024. The listing news has triggered some price gain for the tokens and the broader crypto market rebound . At the time of this writing, ACX had recorded a 106.84% increase in price and traded at $1.24. Its trading volume soared past $182 million and is 3,547.45% higher, at $149.2 million. Similarly, ORCA’s price has hit $8.78, corresponding with a 124.27% increase in the last 24 hours per CoinMarketCap data. Its trading volume is 2467.45% higher than its previous level. Understanding Across Protocol And Its Operations Across Protocol is an Ethereum-based optimistic insured bridge allowing seamless token transfers between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks. It utilizes a decentralized network of relayers that fund user deposits. Liquidity providers secure this in a single pool on Ethereum. Refunds are processed using UMA’s Optimistic Oracle. The aim is to balance cost efficiency, security, and user transaction speed. ORCA And its Benefits to Developers ORCA is a decentralized exchange (DEX) native to the Solana blockchain. Its core focus is on efficient token swaps within the ecosystem. It is more of a general-purpose Automated Market Maker (AMM) that is a versatile developer tool. With Orca, users can swap assets, provide liquidity, and earn yield through a user-friendly interface. In like manner, developers’ projects can integrate Orca’s swapping, farming, and on-chain data capabilities directly into their decentralized applications.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 23:55:00

Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) surge toward $3 as analysts point to IntelMarkets (INTL) as the next altcoin to breakout. Table of Contents Double bottom pattern breakout might push XRP to $3.6 Cardano could ride historical trend to $3 INTL set for massive rally with AI and trading fusion Conclusion The crypto market has witnessed massive price breakouts from Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) in the last month. These altcoins were among the low-performing coins a few months ago but have recently crossed the $1 mark, aiming to ride the bullish wave to $3. Meanwhile, a relatively new token called IntelMarkets (INTL) is steadily getting the attention of experts. Given its upcoming AI-based trading platform and advanced tools, the experts forecast IntelMarkets could be the next coin to explode. Double bottom pattern breakout might push XRP to $3.6 After feeling the heat of the US SEC’s lawsuit for years, XRP has finally taken flight. The cryptocurrency has pumped from a low of $0.50 to a peak of $2.82 in the last 30 days. Such movement translates to a price increase of 464%. XRP has even outperformed Ethereum and Bitcoin. Moreover, analysts believe the rally is not over yet. They believe Ripple winning the Ripple-SEC lawsuit could kickstart another bull run. Javon Marks predicts the XRP price might pump to $3.317 in the short term before skyrocketing to $99. Another analyst, Random Crypto Pal, noted that the Ripple token had formed a double bottom pattern on the monthly chart. He suggested that a breakout above the neckline could send the altcoin to $3.6. XRP’s technical indicators also support the uptrend. The VWMA and Hull Moving Averages are displaying buy signals.

The altcoin that has been on a rally in the past week but failed to cross this level despite the bullish momentum in the market. This means there are a large number of sellers at this level. However, the Cardano price chart shows its value has jumped by 27.0% in the weekly timeframe, 57.7% on the biweekly, and 258.9% on the monthly timeframe. Additionally, the Cardano network hit a transaction speed of 1 million TPS running on Hydra. This massive increase in speed bodes well for the blockchain and ADA. Rekt Capital predicts the value of ADA could skyrocket to $3 based on historical trends. According to him, the cryptocurrency’s price will be pumped to this target after surpassing $1.72. INTL set for massive rally with AI and trading fusion IntelMarkets has attracted investors’ attention with its transformative approach to introducing AI and blockchain to the crypto trading market. IntelMarkets will include a flagship tool called Rodeum AI-based trading bots. These self-learning Intelli-M™ bots will be capable of modifying their performance depending on the existing market conditions. The bots will help traders deploy their algorithms, set parameters, including risks and leverage, and trade more effectively without active monitoring. IntelMarkets will also have a dual-chain architecture. This means it will function on Ethereum or Solana, allowing traders to choose which blockchain to use. Ethereum is known for its highly developed DeFi space, while Solana offers faster and cheaper transactions IntelMarkets is currently trading at $0.064091. With its exciting features, IntelMarkets could become the new face of crypto trading, with experts predicting a 10x pump in the coming months. Conclusion XRP and ADA could rise to $3 in the coming weeks given the bullish sentiments surrounding them. Meanwhile, IntelMarkets is generating traction in the market even while in its ICO. Analysts say this new altcoin could be the blue-chip crypto the market is looking for. For more about IntelMarkets, visit their website , Telegram , or Twitter .

If you’re kicking yourself for missing out on the Book of Meme hype, trust me, you’re not alone. But hey, here’s the thing about crypto: there’s always a new train pulling into the station, and this one might be even bigger. Meet BTFD Coin ($BTFD) , the latest project riding the meme coin frenzy, but with way more substance than your average joke token. With a killer Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, juicy staking rewards, and a growing squad of investors (aka “The Bulls”), BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Meme coins are all about FOMO, right? Well, BTFD is bringing the heat with a presale that’s already raising eyebrows (and funds). Whether you’re a crypto newbie or a seasoned hodler looking for the best meme coin presale to join today, this might just be the ticket you’ve been waiting for. BTFD Coin: Play. Stake. Earn. Repeat. Let’s be real: meme coins are a dime a dozen these days. Most of them are all bark and no bite, promising big returns but delivering… nothing. BTFD Coin is breaking that mould by giving investors something tangible to get excited about. It’s not just a coin—it’s a whole ecosystem designed to keep the hype alive long after the presale ends. First up, let’s talk about the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game . This isn’t some clunky retro game thrown together to tick a marketing box. It’s a full-on gaming platform where players can earn $BTFD coins by competing in challenges and leveling up their avatars. Picture this: you’re chilling at home, gaming away, and stacking up real crypto rewards. It’s like turning your lazy Sunday gaming sessions into a side hustle. Not bad, huh? But that’s not all. BTFD also offers staking rewards that’ll blow your mind. With an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that’s ridiculously competitive, investors can park their coins, sit back, and watch their stash grow over time. It’s perfect for those who want to earn passive income while staying loyal to the Bulls Squad—the growing community of $BTFD holders rallying behind this project. Now, let’s get to the juicy numbers. BTFD launched its presale at just $0.000004 per coin, and it’s already climbed to $0.000064 in its 7th stage. Over 23 billion $BTFD coins have been sold, raising more than $1.1 million in under 10 days. Analysts are predicting that BTFD will list at $0.0006 after the presale wraps up, offering early investors insane ROI. Here’s an example: if you threw down $5,000 during Stage 5 when the coin was priced at $0.00005, you’d have snagged 100 million $BTFD coins. At the listing price of $0.0006, your investment would be worth $60,000. That’s a cool $55,000 in pure profit. Let that sink in. Why did BTFD Coin make it to this list? Because it’s more than just hype—it’s offering real value through its P2E game, staking rewards, and an ever-growing community that’s just getting started. Book of Meme: The OG of Meme Coin Innovation Now, let’s switch gears and talk about Book of Meme. If you’ve been following the meme coin scene, you’ve probably seen this name popping up everywhere. And for good reason—it’s one of the most creative projects to come out of the meme coin craze. With its clever branding and cult-like following, Book of Meme has carved out a space that’s equal parts nostalgic and forward-thinking. The appeal of Book of Meme lies in its lore. The creators took the internet’s obsession with meme culture and turned it into a full-blown mythology. Each token is like a page in the “book,” and holders become part of a community-driven story that evolves over time. It’s like Pokémon cards for the crypto generation—collectible, fun, and weirdly addictive. But here’s where it gets interesting: Book of Meme isn’t just about memes. It’s also a hub for NFT collectors and artists, offering a marketplace where users can trade digital collectibles inspired by the project’s universe. Think of it as a crossover between Dogecoin’s humour and Ethereum’s utility. It’s no wonder the token gained traction so quickly, skyrocketing in value and making early investors a hefty profit. The downside? If you didn’t grab Book of Meme early, you’ve likely missed the boat. While it’s still a strong project with a dedicated community, the explosive growth phase might already be behind us. Today, Book of Meme is more about maintaining its legacy than delivering 100x returns. For new investors, it’s a safe play, but it doesn’t quite have the same “to the moon” potential as BTFD Coin. Why did Book of Meme make it to this list? Because it’s a trailblazer in the meme coin space, proving that these tokens can have staying power and cultural impact. Conclusion So, what’s the verdict? If you’re chasing the nostalgia of meme coin OGs, Book of Meme is a solid choice. But if you’re hunting for the best meme coin presale to join today, the crown clearly belongs to BTFD Coin . BTFD isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s reinventing it. With a P2E game that’s already drawing buzz, staking rewards that are hard to ignore, and a presale price that’s still a steal, BTFD is primed for massive growth. The Bulls Squad is growing every day, and with over $1 million raised in just 10 days, it’s clear this project has momentum. Crypto is all about timing, and right now, the time to act is now . Don’t wait until BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 to wish you’d jumped in earlier. Sign up for the presale today and lock in your chance to turn a small investment into something life-changing. The best meme coin presale to join today isn’t going to wait for you. Be part of the Bulls Squad before it’s too late.

37310617,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658433,1733531455,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Dogecoin Still In Consolidation – Analyst Expects $0,63 If We Get A Breakout",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-still-in-consolidation-analyst-expects-063-if-we-get-a-breakout/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has been stuck in a range for nearly a month, struggling to break above the $0.44 resistance level. Despite multiple attempts, the price has yet to reclaim the $0.48 local high set in November. This prolonged consolidation has kept traders and investors on edge as they await a decisive breakout to signal the next major move for the popular meme coin. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week? Top investor Carl Runefelt recently shared his technical analysis on X, highlighting that DOGE is still trading within a bullish pattern. He says this consolidation phase is part of a broader setup that could lead to significant gains. Runefelt remains optimistic, stating that once Dogecoin breaks out of its current range, it could initiate a rally to new highs. Dogecoin’s price action is closely tied to broader market dynamics, especially Bitcoin’s performance, which recently surged above $100,000. As altcoins often follow Bitcoin’s lead, many speculate that DOGE could be on the verge of a major breakout. However, until DOGE surpasses key resistance levels, the market remains cautious. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Dogecoin can break free from its range and resume its upward trajectory. Dogecoin Still In Consolidation Since November 12, Dogecoin has remained in a consolidation range, leaving traders uncertain about its next major move. Despite an impressive rally earlier this cycle, culminating in a local high of $0.48 on November 23, the meme coin has struggled to break above this level. Instead, it continues to trade sideways, testing the patience of investors and analysts alike. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the formation of a bullish pattern within Dogecoin’s price action. According to Runefelt, DOGE’s extended consolidation could be a precursor to an explosive breakout. He notes that if DOGE breaks out of its current range, it could target as high as $0.6350. However, he also cautions that this scenario could take time to materialize, as Dogecoin has historically required significant patience from its investors during similar consolidation phases. Related Reading: $1.87B Bitcoin Withdrawals From Coinbase In 24H – What This Means To Price While the current price action may appear indecisive, DOGE has proven in the past that its breakouts are often aggressive and substantial once they occur. With Bitcoin leading the market above the $100K level, altcoins like DOGE are expected to follow suit eventually. All eyes remain on key resistance levels as traders await confirmation of Dogecoin’s next move. DOGE Struggles To Break Key Levels Dogecoin trades at $0.423, reflecting weeks of peculiar and sluggish price action. Despite its impressive performance earlier in the month, with a 220% surge since November 5, DOGE now appears to be in a cooling-off phase. The price has repeatedly tested the $0.44 level but has failed to achieve a daily close above it, leaving traders and analysts watching closely for a potential breakout. A daily close above $0.44 would likely trigger a significant rally, as this level is a key resistance and psychological barrier for the market. However, such a breakout may require time, given Dogecoin’s massive run earlier in the month. Markets often consolidate after such explosive moves, allowing for profit-taking and the absorption of sell pressure before the next leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Supported By All-Stablecoins Cash Inflow – Data Reveals Strong Correlation Despite the slow pace, DOGE’s long-term momentum remains promising. Investors are eyeing its potential to reclaim bullish energy and push toward higher levels. Until then, patience is key as Dogecoin builds the foundation for its next significant move. The $0.44 level remains critical, serving as a signal of renewed strength if DOGE can finally break through and establish it as support.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 00:41:12

As its momentum rises, investors are seeking another altcoin with high growth potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a tokenization real estate platform, is ranking among the best bets due to its low entry price and upside potential. XRP price eyes $3, flips Solana The hot streak for the XRP price has continued after hitting a new multi-year of $2.82. The Ripple coin flipped Solana and Tether to become the third-largest digital asset by market cap. As Gary Gensler prepares to leave the SEC, the agency’s lawsuit’s impact on Ripple diminishes. This is helping the XRP price gain ground. The recent reports that President-elect Donald Trump’s team plans to shift crypto regulation from the SEC to the CFTC could mark another big win for the XRP price. After such an impressive rally and potential catalysts on the horizon, investors look forward to the XRP price reaching $3.

PropiChain is set to rise 200% when its token presale progresses from the first stage to the next. When the presale concludes, early investors will enjoy 800% gains. These gains will come before PCHAIN is listed on secondary exchanges. PropiChain also offers staking rewards of up to 225% APR to incentivize long-term holders. AI is at the heart of PropiChain. Its Automated valuation models (AVMs) will give users access to fair and transparent property appraisals. This means buyers and sellers will get to quickly agree on the fair prices of properties. With predictive market analysis , users will get specialized market analysis to make informed investment decisions. The platform’s AI-driven property filter feature will allow users to search for properties based on their preferred parameters. The core offering is tokenization and fractional ownership . This feature will enable retail traders to own pieces of high-end properties worldwide. This could not have been possible in traditional real estate investing. Finally, PropiChain relies on the metaverse for remote property viewing. Gone are the days when geographic barriers hindered real estate investments. XRP vs PCHAIN The XRP price is marching toward $3 as its rally continues. This means the room for massive gains might be gone, except for those who caught the altcoin early. On the other hand, PropiChain is a new altcoin that offers a potentially profitable investment opportunity through its presale. PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap and completed its smart contract verification with blockchain security firm BlockAudit. The project also has staking rewards for long-term holders, providing another income stream while helping PCHAIN’s value appreciate. PropiChain is using novel technologies to simplify and enhance property management and investment. The altcoin has the potential to surge by 39,504%, converting a $1,000 investment into nearly $400,000. For more information about PropiChain, visit their website or online community .

Key players such as Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have fallen under downward pressure. SOL and SHIB cannot catch a break as they are struggling to maintain their bullish momentum, yet a new player, DTX Exchange , has entered the blockchain world and raised a whopping $9.4 million in its presale. DTX Exchange: The Rising Crypto Star Raises $9,400,000 DTX Exchange (DTX) has stolen the spotlight from SOL and SHIB. Recently, DTX made rounds as early backers experienced a 500% increase in their investment. By raising more than $9.4 million, DTX Exchange is one of the fastest-growing crypto projects. One of the main reasons of the project’s presale success is the DTX’s innovative hybrid exchange model that combines the best features of both centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). Additionally, the DTX platform is running a $1,000,000 giveaway , where anyone who deposits at least $100 has a chance to win. By completing tasks, users increase their chances of winning the grand prize. Having the potential to shake up the $3.2 billion global trading market, DTX Exchange is a one-stop shop connecting TradFi and DeFi. DTX is powered by its own proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX, which provides a frictionless trading experience across stocks, forex, commodities, and cryptocurrency, facilitating trading for over 120,000 asset classes. The innovative hybrid approach, extremely high potential upside, and growing number of investors have put DTX Exchange among the most exciting ICOs this year. Solana (SOL): Bears Take Over After Solana (SOL) hit a new all-time high, it has failed to maintain momentum. Once touted as a formidable Layer 1 blockchain contender, in recent weeks Solana has been facing some corrections. Following a bullish run, SOL’s price has taken a pull back, falling through key support of $250. Solana is priced at $241 today, after a steady downtrend following its peak at $263 this November. Although high transaction speed and high scalability are still driving factors behind the adoption of the platform, issues such as network outages and reduced institutional interest have already reduced investor enthusiasm. While Solana’s fundamentals are strong, the bears are starting to take over. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Coin Fails to Recover Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB), the meme coin that mesmerized investors with its parabolic rise, is having a similar experience. SHIB’s price soared to impressive highs in 2021 but then cooled down considerably. Now, SHIB is trading at $0.000031, a 60% decrease from its all-time high of $0.000088. The legacy of SHIB demonstrated to the crypto and meme coin community that it is possible to pivot to a utility based ecosystem. Even with Shiba Inu’s ability to create a loyal community and to attract meme hype, its growth has been stale. Although the popularity of the Shiba Inu ecosystem is gaining attention, including Shibarium and ShibaSwap, the price of the SHIB has failed to recover previous highs. Conclusion The crypto market is a battleground between bulls and bears, but in this round DTX Exchange was a clear winner. SOL and SHIB both face downward pressure, but the hybrid exchange model and explosive growth prospects of DTX Exchange make it a token to follow. DTX offers a chance to invest in the future of trading, a promise to catch the next wave of innovation.

Even though he sold most of his PEPE early on, he turned $70.40 into $7.06 million – a return of over 100,000x.” Lookonchain also noticed other large Pepe holders realizing massive profits this week. One Pepe trader was spotted realizing a gain of more than 3,018%. “After holding for over a year, this trader turned $241,500 into $7.53 million! This trader withdrew 375.65 billion PEPE ($241,500 at that time) from Gemini on Sept 20th, 2023, and sold 19.55 billion PEPE for $244,000 between February 17th and September 26th this year. [On Tuesday], he deposited the remaining 356.1 billion PEPE ($7.28 million) into Kraken.” Another Pepe trader realized $1.31 million in profits. “A whale bought 240 billion PEPE ($3.64 million) at a high price on May 29th, and the price of PEPE dropped afterward. But instead of panic selling, he held on for six months. [On Wednesday], he sold his 240 billion PEPE ($4.95 million), making a profit of $1.31 million!” Despite the profit taking, Lookonchain notices massive buying is still happening by deep-pocketed investors. “Whales continue to accumulate PEPE! A whale has withdrawn 337.09 billion PEPE ($6.92 million) from Binance in the past 20 days.” PEPE is trading for $0.00002113 at time of writing, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

Retired therapist Judith Boivin lost about $600,000 after scammers made her believe she was an integral part of an undercover government operation, reports The Washington Post. Boivin says the bad actors made her believe she was working on a mission with the FBI to take down a Mexican cartel involved in selling illegal drugs and money laundering. When Boivin visited Morgan Stanley to take out her nest egg, employees of the bank immediately became suspicious. One investigator told her that she was likely a victim of an elaborate fraud. “If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck.” But Boivin says she stuck to a script given to her by the scammers, who coached her to write a letter stating the bank should release her funds. “This is a decision I am making while in sound mind and after celebrating my 79th birthday and beginning my 80th year of life, I wish to have full control of my finances at this time.” Once Morgan Stanley released her money, Boivin was told to split the funds and deposit it in new Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank and TD Bank accounts. To avoid raising suspicion, she then withdrew $10,000 to $20,000 from those accounts per visit. Boivin says she delivered most of her cash inside a brown paper to couriers at a nearby parking lot, believing the FBI was keeping watch. Morgan Stanley says Boivin couldn’t be dissuaded even though the bank took several steps to keep her from losing her funds to fraud, including putting a brief hold on her account and notifying a family member and the authorities. JPMorgan says branch staff urged her to reconsider. “Despite several attempts to get her to reconsider, she told our branch staff she needed the money for a business venture. She later acknowledged she was coached by the scammers on what to say to our bankers. The best way to avoid these types of scams is to ignore requests for money from people you don’t know.” Capital One, PNC and TD Bank say they can’t make specific comments on Boivin’s case.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Key technical indicators now suggest the cryptocurrency has entered overbought territory, sparking speculation about whether a pullback could be on the horizon. While the recent rally reflects strong bullish momentum, the market may be approaching a critical juncture. Can SUI maintain its upward streak, or is a price correction inevitable? As of writing, SUI has surged over 10%, reaching a price of $4.23 in the past 24 hours. This movement has boosted its market capitalization to over $12 billion, with trading volume exceeding $5.5 billion, indicating strong investor interest and market activity. Technical Analysis: Indicators Hint At Overbought Conditions SUI’s price on the 4-hour chart is beginning to exhibit bearish signals, with a noticeable decline toward the $4 support level and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This downward movement is underscored by the formation of a bearish candlestick, suggesting growing selling pressure in the market. A sustained drop below these levels could signal a broader trend reversal, making this a pivotal moment for its price action. Additionally, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for SUI is flashing an overbought condition, highlighting the asset’s recent robust upside pressure. Typically, an overbought reading suggests that the price has risen rapidly within a short period, potentially leading to market exhaustion as buyers begin to lose strength. Related Reading: SUI In Bear Territory: RSI Drop Suggests Further Downside Risk This condition often serves as a cautionary signal for traders, indicating the possibility of a price correction or a consolidation phase as the market seeks to regain equilibrium. If the overbought pressure persists, SUI could face challenges maintaining its current levels. Key Support Levels To Watch If A Pullback Occurs If SUI experiences a pullback, monitoring critical support levels that could provide stability is essential. Presently, the $4 mark stands out as a key level, reinforced by its alignment with the 100-day SMA. A dip below this support might trigger further declines, with support zones near $3.75 and $3.50 acting as potential cushions. These levels are crucial in determining whether the pullback will be temporary or evolve into a more extended bearish phase. Related Reading: SUI To Face Another Pullback Following 5.3% Dip, Analysts Forecast 30% Correction However, If the bulls manage to trigger a comeback at the $4 support level, it could mark the beginning of a renewed rally for SUI toward $4.50 and beyond, implying that buyers are regaining control.

Fans not only enjoy content but actively participate in its creation, support new projects, and earn rewards through nodes and NFTs. December 5, 2024, marked a historic milestone for Gala Film with the highly anticipated launch of its native token, $FILM, on Uniswap. The debut was nothing short of spectacular, with the token soaring over 350% in just 24 hours, clocking a staggering $8.9 million in trading volume. The buzz was palpable across social media, cementing $FILM as one of the most talked-about tokens of the week. This initial performance underscores the confidence the community has in Gala Film’s vision and potential. But as the saying goes, this is just the trailer—there’s much more to come. “Savage Lands”: A Star-Studded Collaboration As if the token’s explosive start wasn’t enough, Gala Film has added fuel to the excitement with a behind-the-scenes tease from its upcoming project, “Savage Lands.” The film features DJ Khaled, known for his electrifying presence and iconic phrases like “Major Keys” and “Bless Up,” in a starring role. And if that wasn’t enough star power, the project is being exclusively-produced by none other than Snoop Dogg, a long-time Web3 enthusiast and Gala Music partner. This collaboration is a masterstroke, bringing together two cultural icons who have been instrumental in bridging entertainment and blockchain. With Snoop Dogg’s proven track record in music, NFTs, and beyond, and DJ Khaled’s unparalleled energy and influence, “Savage Lands” promises to be a groundbreaking addition to Gala Film’s lineup. A Decentralized Entertainment Revolution Gala Film is more than a platform—it’s a movement.

Filecoin’s recent price targets have sparked curiosity, while Immutable X’s strategic moves have captured the attention of blockchain enthusiasts. But wait, there’s more—Qubetics has emerged as a dark horse, smashing through presale milestones. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project. It’s tackling real-world financial headaches with its innovative non-custodial wallet. While others leave users at the mercy of third parties, Qubetics is empowering them with true control. But can it really deliver on its bold promises? Let’s dive into these three projects and see why they’re the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Non-Custodial Wallets Qubetics has been making headlines for all the right reasons. With over $4.6 million raised in its presale and a price sitting at just $0.0282, this project is turning heads. Currently in its 11th stage, it has already attracted over 6,800 token holders and sold 275 million $TICS tokens. Analysts are even predicting a price surge to $10-15 after its mainnet launch. But what makes Qubetics stand out? One word: freedom. Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet is a game-changer. Unlike custodial wallets, which force users to rely on third parties, Qubetics gives you full control over your assets. Imagine not having to worry about hacks or sudden freezes on your funds. Sounds like a dream, right? The crypto world has seen its fair share of issues due to custodial wallets. Security breaches, regulatory clampdowns, and the inability to access your own money are just the tip of the iceberg. For example, reports show that millions of dollars are lost annually to custodial wallet hacks. Privacy concerns? You bet. Every transaction you make gets tracked. Qubetics aims to fix all this by giving users the tools to be their own bank. Let’s talk numbers. If you invest $1,000 in $TICS at $0.0282 today, you’d get around 35,460 tokens. If analysts’ predictions hold true and the price hits $10 post-launch, that investment could soar to $354,600. Crazy, right? The FOMO is real, and for good reason. For more guidance, watch this video . Filecoin: Storing the Future Filecoin has always been about decentralised storage, and it’s not slowing down. The buzz around its latest price target of $10 has rekindled interest among crypto fans. This project allows users to rent out storage space in exchange for FIL tokens, making it a pioneer in blockchain storage solutions. Filecoin’s infrastructure isn’t just about storage; it’s about creating a network that’s resilient, decentralised, and accessible. As data breaches and server outages continue to plague traditional systems, Filecoin offers a safer alternative. It’s no wonder the project is gaining traction again. Recent developments, like its partnerships and integrations, have boosted confidence in its potential. The $10 price target might seem ambitious, but it’s achievable given the project’s utility and adoption rate. Immutable X: Redefining NFTs and Gaming Immutable X has carved out a niche for itself in the NFT and gaming space. As a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, it offers gas-free transactions and near-instant execution. It’s a godsend for NFT creators and traders who’ve been struggling with Ethereum’s high fees and congestion. The project’s collaboration with gaming studios and marketplaces has positioned it as a leader in blockchain gaming. With more games adopting Immutable X’s technology, the ecosystem is growing rapidly. Plus, its environmental focus resonates with younger investors who value sustainability. The market buzz suggests Immutable X is poised for a breakout. Its focus on usability, combined with its NFT-centric approach, makes it a strong contender for the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Immutable X’s price trajectory suggests plenty of room for growth. An early $1,000 investment could yield significant returns as the project gains adoption in the gaming and NFT sectors. Imagine being part of the next big thing in digital collectibles and entertainment. Exciting, isn’t it? Conclusion While Filecoin and Immutable X are impressive in their own right, Qubetics’ potential is simply unmatched. Its non-custodial wallet addresses issues that have plagued the crypto world for years, offering a level of security and independence that others can’t. And with analysts predicting a massive price surge, the opportunity for life-changing returns is hard to ignore. So, what are you waiting for? The best cryptos to invest in December 2024 are here, and Qubetics is leading the pack. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this game-changing project. Invest now and secure your financial future.

If you’ve been watching the markets, you’ll know that December’s looking like a golden opportunity for smart investors. Whether you’re in Vancouver or Halifax, it’s time to grab a double-double and tune in because we’ve got the best cryptos to join in December 2024. We’re talking about Qubetics smashing through the presale ceiling with 275 million $TICS sold, Toncoin setting its sights on $7, and Render holding the spotlight with a bullish $25 prediction for 2025. Each of these coins has its own unique vibe, but all of them are on the up and up. So, let’s dive in, shall we? Qubetics: A Presale to Remember and Unmissable Features Qubetics is the hot ticket in town, man. This rising star has sold a jaw-dropping 275 million $TICS tokens during its presale phase, raising serious eyebrows (and funds) in the crypto space. Its ecosystem isn’t just innovative; it’s downright revolutionary. Think about it: seamless cross-chain compatibility, an ultra-secure decentralised VPN , and the ability to monetise idle bandwidth. That’s not just tech; that’s convenience wrapped in a $TICS bow. Canadians love practical solutions, and Qubetics delivers. Imagine using your spare internet bandwidth to earn passive income—pretty slick, eh? And with the presale price currently sitting at $0.0282, it’s a bargain. Let’s do some quick maths: $500 gets you around 17,730 $TICS. Analysts are predicting $TICS could hit $15 after the mainnet launch. If that happens, your $500 turns into $265,950. That’s like winning the 649, but better! If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to join in December 2024, Qubetics is as good as it gets. With innovation, growth potential, and FOMO-worthy buzz, this coin’s a no-brainer. Watch this video for more information. Toncoin: Steady as She Goes Toncoin might not have the flash of Qubetics, but it’s no slouch either. With its blockchain roots in Telegram’s Open Network (TON), this coin has carved out a niche for itself as a payment solution with serious scalability chops. As of now, Toncoin is trading around $6.89, but it’s eyeing the $7 mark. What’s fuelling the hype? Well, Toncoin has been gaining traction as Telegram integrates TON-based features into its messaging app. This seamless fusion of social and financial services is exactly the kind of thing that appeals to Canada’s tech-savvy crowd. Plus, its user-friendly payment system makes it perfect for global transfers—no more fretting about e-transfers and fees. While it doesn’t offer the insane ROI potential of Qubetics, Toncoin is a reliable bet for steady growth. It’s the crypto equivalent of that trusty old snowblower in your garage—dependable and always ready to perform. Render: The Artist’s Best Tech Friend If you’re into cutting-edge tech, Render’s where it’s at. This decentralised rendering platform is changing the game for creators, giving them access to GPU power like never before. For a country full of creative talent (hello, Toronto Film Festival!), Render is a project that resonates. Currently trading at $10.58, Render has analysts predicting a leap to $25 by 2025. That’s almost a 136.2% increase in just a few months. Why the optimism? The platform’s ability to streamline CGI and 3D rendering processes makes it a go-to for artists and studios worldwide. It’s like having a Timbit-sized investment that could grow into a full-on doughnut empire. Render isn’t just for the artsy types, though. With its use of blockchain to decentralise the rendering process, it’s also a tech marvel. Whether you’re an animator in Montreal or a gamer in Edmonton, Render’s potential has something for everyone. Why Qubetics Is a No-Brainer for December 2024 Let’s be real for a sec. Toncoin’s solid, and Render’s impressive, but Qubetics is in a league of its own. It’s not just about the presale success or the innovative features; it’s about the vision. Qubetics is creating an ecosystem that’s practical, profitable, and future-proof. The ROI projections are off the charts, and the buzz around the project is growing faster than a Tim Hortons queue in the morning. If you’re serious about finding the best cryptos to join in December 2024, Qubetics isn’t just an option—it’s the option. Wrap-Up: Don’t Miss Out December’s crypto market is serving up some serious opportunities, but you’ve got to act fast. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ presale momentum, Toncoin’s steady rise, or Render’s creative revolution, there’s no shortage of options. But here’s the tea: Qubetics is the standout. With its game-changing ecosystem and mind-blowing ROI potential, it’s a chance to turn a few loonies into a full-blown fortune. Don’t wait until it’s yesterday’s news—get in now while the getting’s good. Time to make your move!

Yet many investors are paying more attention to Propichain (PCHAIN) , a new RWA tokenization asset focused on the real estate sector. Propichain’s (PCHAIN) ongoing presale already offers an 800% return to early holders. Read on to see why analysts say Propichain will outshine Cardano (ADA). Cardano (ADA) Holders Eye $2 by Late December Cardano has continued its mega price surge, becoming one of the fastest-growing altcoin assets in recent weeks. In the past month, November was extra bullish for the crypto industry, causing Cardano to grow by 263%. Cardano’s (ADA) current price is $1.21, its highest in the past two years. Interestingly, Cardano supporters expect its rally to continue till late December. They also expect Cardano (ADA) to reach $2, citing the current growth of its ecosystem. In addition, Cardano’s (ADA) price rally signals renewed investor confidence in blockchain innovations. However, many investors are also paying attention to Propichain, a groundbreaking real estate tokenization project with an ongoing presale that is already delivering an 800% return to early holders. Propichain: Using Cutting-Edge Technology To Create Investment Avenues in the Real Estate Sector Propichain (PCHAIN) capitalizes on Ethereum’s blockchain technology, asset tokenization, artificial intelligence, and metaverse services to create an investing ecosystem conducive to new and seasoned real estate participants. At the core of this ecosystem lies a groundbreaking approach: asset tokenization, which reshapes traditional real estate investing barriers. Unlike traditional markets, Propichain offers a budget-friendly ownership model. Here, investors purchase shares in housing assets that have been tokenized. These tokens allow investors to buy stakes in their desired asset for a fraction of the cost. With Propichain’s ownership model, no budget size is too low to become a real estate investor. While tokenization lowers financial barriers, effective investing requires informed decision-making, which Propichain addresses through AI-powered tools. It uses artificial intelligence to automate market research, property valuations, and trend assessments. This way, you can understand market sentiments in real-time. You also enjoy accurate, high-quality data that helps improve your decision-making. Propichain’s (PCHAIN) AI-powered investing tools also have automatic trading capabilities. Here, you can leverage buy or sell orders to secure deals in the future. With Propichain’s automatic trades, you can set guiding instructions for future buy or sell orders on your desired properties. When the specific conditions are met, the order is executed, allowing you to seize opportunities while taking a more hands-off investing approach. After equipping investors with insights through AI tools, Propichain (PCHAIN) bridges markets globally, offering smooth access to properties worldwide. With Propichain’s real estate marketplace, you can connect with investors on the other side. Using its virtual property tours, you can check out choice properties anywhere in the world from the comfort of your home. Imagine being an Asian first-time investor exploring a New York City penthouse through a lifelike virtual tour—Propichain’s metaverse services make such cross-border trades effortless and transparent. Propichain’s smart contracts ensure these global interactions translate into secure, efficient deals. Furthermore, they have the necessary customizability to allow investors to create tailored leasing and rental agreements. Propichain and Cardano (ADA): What Market Analysts are Saying Propichain’s (PCHAIN) innovative approach has transformed real estate investing and placed it alongside top-tier blockchain projects like Cardano. Beyond the allure of its real estate investing benefits, Propichain is also attracting investors to its ongoing presale with two distinct factors. Firstly, Propichain has shown that its network is secure via a security certificate from BlockAudit. This has eased investor fears about safety concerns. Propichain has also been listed on CoinMarketCap , showing investors that the project is here to stay. Analysts say these moves point to an extra bullish 2025 for Propichain, which could take $1,000 worth of PCHAIN to $60,000 in the next few months. PCHAIN’s Presale: Round One Holders to Earn 800% Interest With its robust ecosystem and proven market potential, Propichain’s ongoing presale presents a unique opportunity for early adopters to benefit. Even better, joining its ecosystem now offers the opportunity to buy PCHAIN at its lowest-ever price. PCHAIN is in round one of its presale, selling at $0.004. By round 2, current holders will earn a 208.17% increase as PCHAIN’s value will rise to $0.011. PCHAIN will stay bullish until it reaches its launch price of $0.032. This would translate to an 800% increase for round one PCHAIN holders. Join its presale today and secure your spot in the growth of its ecosystem.

Despite being up by more than 35 percent in the past week, the altcoin is yet to hit the ATH, which sits at $3.84. Majority of the top 10 altcoins are currently recording gains and Bitcoin is once again trading above the $100,000 mark. XRP has encountered strong resistance near the $3 mark, specifically around the 1618 Fibonacci extension at $3. Recently, XRP reached a high of just over $2.90, falling short of breaking the $3 barrier. This hints at significant selling pressure, and the price is likely to struggle around this level in the short term. Here’s a breakdown of price analysis by analyst Josh of Crypto World: Support Level Around $2 On the other hand, if XRP sees a pullback, support is expected at around $2. This level could act as a cushion for the price in case of further declines in the near future. XRP vs. Bitcoin: A Key Indicator Looking at the XRP/BTC chart, the price action suggests that XRP has reached a key resistance point when compared to Bitcoin. If this chart trends downward, it means Bitcoin is outperforming XRP. The analyst previously shared a strategy where XRP was swapped for Bitcoin, and those who followed it could have doubled their Bitcoin holdings. However, the recent resistance level indicates that the short-term rally in XRP/BTC could be coming to an end. Potential for Future Breakouts Despite the short-term resistance, the analyst pointed out that if the overall cryptocurrency market continues to grow, XRP could potentially break out against Bitcoin in the future. If XRP manages to surpass the current resistance levels, it could lead to a bullish trend.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 03:09:50

BTFD Coin’s Presale Brings High ROI to the Table,https://thecoinrise.com/lost-out-on-ponke-btfd-coins-presale-brings-high-roi-to-the-table/,"Over the years, meme coins have taken the crypto world by storm, offering a mix of laughter, community hype, and jaw-dropping returns. From Dogecoin’s rocket ride to Shiba Inu’s mind-blowing ascent, the meme coin movement has proven one thing: when the internet’s attention converges, magic happens. These coins aren’t just funny—they’re life-changing for the early birds. And now? It looks like another player is about to steal the spotlight. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD), a fresh contender in the meme coin arena. This isn’t your regular pump-and-dump coin ; BTFD blends fun with utility through its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking features, and a solid community dubbed the Bulls Squad. Analysts are already buzzing, and if history’s taught us anything, it’s this: early adopters often laugh all the way to the bank. But what about Ponke? This crypto has carved out its niche with its loyal fanbase and innovative features. With BTFD making waves and ponke holding steady, let’s dive into these two contenders to see who comes out on top in the race to become the best crypto to watch in 2024. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Meme Coin With Game-Changing Potential BTFD Coin isn’t just here to make you chuckle; it’s here to make you rich—or so the buzz says. This coin’s presale launched at a ridiculously low price of $0.000004 per coin on November 26, 2024. When the presale ends, the listing price will jump to $0.000064. That’s a whopping 15,000% ROI for those who get in early. And, spoiler alert: the excitement isn’t unwarranted. First up, let’s talk about the P2E game. Gamers can earn BTFD tokens while having a blast—yes, you can literally get paid to play. This feature alone taps into two booming markets: crypto and gaming. Then there’s the staking. With a generous Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that’s raising eyebrows (and heart rates), holders can earn passive income by simply locking up their coins. Add the Bulls Squad, a community-driven initiative that rewards engagement and loyalty, and you’ve got a recipe for a viral hit. Here’s a juicy example: Let’s say you invest $10,000 during the presale. When BTFD hits $0.0006, your stash could balloon to $1.1 million. Sound too good to be true? Maybe—but meme coins have pulled off crazier stunts. Analysts are projecting BTFD could outperform the usual suspects thanks to its multi-pronged approach. The FOMO is real—but don’t wait too long. Presales like these have a way of ending before you can blink, leaving latecomers gnashing their teeth. If you’ve ever felt the sting of missing out on a crypto moonshot, consider this your second chance. Ponke: The Old Guard of Meme Coins Now, let’s shift gears to ponke. While it’s not the shiny new kid on the block, ponke has earned its stripes. Known for its quirky branding and steadfast community, ponke has carved out its place in the crypto ecosystem. Unlike many meme coins, ponke isn’t just about the memes; it has actual utility. One of ponke’s standout features is its decentralized exchange (DEX), allowing users to swap tokens with ease. This has given ponke a utility edge, even as newer coins enter the fray. Its loyal community keeps the project alive, and let’s be honest—in crypto, community is king. But here’s the kicker: ponke’s growth has been more steady than explosive. While this makes it a safer bet, it doesn’t exactly scream “meme coin mania.” Analysts predict ponke will continue to hold its value, but the potential for a 15,000% ROI? That’s less likely. Sure, there’s room for growth, especially if it announces a groundbreaking update or partnership. But compared to BTFD, ponke feels like the safer, albeit less thrilling, option. If you’re a fan of slow and steady, ponke’s got your back. But if you’re looking for adrenaline-pumping gains, you might want to give BTFD a closer look. After all, the crypto market loves a good underdog story. Conclusion: Make the Most of This Wealth-Generation Opportunity So, here’s the deal: BTFD Coin is shaping up to be a serious contender for the best crypto to invest in this year. With its P2E game, high-yield staking, and an engaged community, it’s ticking all the right boxes. And let’s not forget that jaw-dropping 15,000% ROI promise. If you’ve ever wondered what it feels like to get in on the ground floor of a crypto sensation, this might just be your shot. ponke, on the other hand, remains a solid pick for those who value stability over moonshots. Its features and loyal fanbase make it a reliable choice, but the ROI potential doesn’t hold a candle to what BTFD is offering right now . Don’t let this wealth-generation opportunity slip through your fingers. The BTFD presale is live, but it won’t last forever. Secure your spot, invest wisely, and who knows? This time next year, you could be laughing all the way to the bank.

The investors have been waiting for over 3 years for LINK to break past $52. Even though the trading volume is low, market intelligence platform Santiment thinks it is time for the token to take a jump and create new history. Let’s analyse the market and explore what is going on and what we should be expecting from it. Technical Metrics Let’s start with the current price. At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading at $25.50 which is almost 50% gap from its current ATH at $52. The daily chart shows that there is no moving average nearby to support the price.The nearest MA is 20 that lies around $19.32. However, we might be able to see a golden cross over soon as MA 100 is ready to cross over MA 200. This gives us an idea that the strength is building up. Source : Coinglass RSI is at 74.24, so the asset is still below the overbought zone and has space for growth. This momentum is supported by the Average directional Index which is at 52.83. The histogram of MACD is displaying a remarkable buildup. Sometimes the bulls are getting tired but keeping the momentum. Market Sentiment According to the market intelligence platform Santiment, the market has low sentiment towards Chainlink as of now. This can be verified looking at the volume. The daily trading volume is down by 10.98% in the last 24 hours. Despite this the price surged by 8.47%. Chainlink has enjoyed a late-week rally, and now needs to climb just +10.8% to match its 3-year high from January, 2022. It is encouraging that there is very little retail FOMO toward LINK.

Whales Bet Big After Major Listings,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-pepe-coins-next-ath-around-the-corner-whales-bet-big-after-major-listings/,"Pepe is in the meme coin spotlight again. Binance.US and Coinbase, two of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, have added Pepe Coin to their trading platforms. Whales have been consuming enormous amounts of the token, generating ripples. Could this momentum take the meme coin to a new all-time high? Let’s investigate. Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP? You’re ‘Disrespecting’ Yourself Exchange Listings Generate Excitement Binance.US announced on December 5 that it would allow trading of Pepe Coin against Tether (USDT). It was not long before Coinbase followed suit, adding the token to its growing memecoin list. These listings are important because they make PEPE accessible to millions of investors. Accessibility often leads to an increase in trading volume, and this seems to be the case here. The effects are already apparent. The price of Pepe Coin has risen by 165% in the past month; currently, its market capitalization is at $9.15 billion. These milestones are undeniable indications that the coin is not just another transient meme but is garnering significant attention within the crypto community. Whales Place Significant Bets On Pepe The excitement is not only in the listings. By statistics, whales have bought 337 million tokens, valued at some $7 million. Such behavior usually reflects confidence in the possibility for a token to climb. Whales continue to accumulate $PEPE! A whale has withdrawn 337.09B $PEPE($6.92M) from #Binance in the past 20 days.https://t.co/65vbIQd2dd pic.twitter.com/79NauAQt8V — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 4, 2024 Currently trading at $0.0000217, PEPE is getting closer to its all-time high of $0.00002457. Technical indicators support this optimism: the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) shows continuous bullishness while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now at 62.45, indicating strong buying momentum. These signals taken with the presence of whales suggest short-term hope for the cryptocurrency. Investor interest now turns towards the strong level of resistance at $0.000028105. Should the coin breach past that point, it will probably try for the next line of resistance, at $0.000036003. Related Reading: No Sweat! Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst Is A New PEPE ATH On The Way? With all the excitement going on right now, a lot of people are interested in how the Pepe Coin could hit new heights. Its appeal has definitely grown since it was listed on several exchanges recently, and the backing of whales makes things even better. The narrative that the crypto asset could reach a new ATH is strengthened by the active participation of the community. However, it is not completely issue-free. Like other meme coins, Pepe is vulnerable to market volatility and speculative trading. Although the trends now seem promising, the investors need to be very careful as they navigate through this fast-changing market. The next few days will be critical as Pepe Coin approaches its ATH. It is certain that this diminutive frog-themed crypto will not be hopping out of the spotlight anytime soon, regardless of whether it bursts through resistance or consolidates further.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK.

Crypto Prices Today: BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP The crypto market is gaining momentum after Bitcoin surged back to $100,000. Major altcoins have shown positive movement in the last 24 hours, except for Solana, which is down by 3%.

Fidelity had contributed $120 million to BTC ETFs, while Ark Invest and 21Shares collectively recorded $24 million in inflows. Additionally, the rising Bitcoin price has driven increased demand, creating pressure on mining activities. This surge has also led to heightened energy consumption from national grids to sustain mining operations. Ethereum Price Today ETH price was trading at $4,000, marking an approximate 4% increase at the time of writing. Its 24-hour low and high were $3,831 and $4,087, respectively.

It was up by 6% in the last 24 hours, making it one of the top gainers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. XRP’s market capitalization stood at $139 billion, with a trading volume of $14 billion.

Its 24-hour low and high were $231 and $242, respectively. Solana’s market capitalization stood at $111 billion, with a trading volume of $5.42 billion.

If you’ve been keeping tabs on the market, you’ll know it’s the perfect time to suss out the best cryptos to invest in right now. And crikey, have we got three crackers for you: Qubetics, Ethereum, and Stellar. These digital powerhouses are setting the pace, each with updates that’ll have you considering tossing a few bob their way. From Qubetics smashing its crypto presale goals with a whopping $4.6M raised, to Ethereum flexing its muscles with Layer 2 advancements, and Stellar surging on the back of international partnerships, there’s a lot to unpack here. Qubetics: The New Kid on the Block Ready to Dominate Mate, if you haven’t heard of Qubetics yet, you’re missing out. This Web3 superstar is taking the blockchain game by storm. Its $4.6 million presale isn’t just a number; it’s a statement. Investors are flocking to Qubetics because of its killer features: cross-chain compatibility , privacy-focused tools, and the easiest blockchain-building interface you’ve ever seen. Qubetics has a very practical side. It lets users monetise unused bandwidth, turning everyday internet access into cash—or rather, $TICS tokens. Fancy a decentralised VPN for secure browsing? Qubetics has that too. It’s like having your own high-tech Swiss Army knife for the blockchain world. At the current presale price of $0.0282, a $400 investment nabs you around 14,184 $TICS tokens. Analysts reckon $TICS could hit $15 post-mainnet launch, which would turn your $400 into a tidy $212,760. Fair dinkum, right? Qubetics isn’t just one of the best cryptos to invest in right now; it’s arguably the best. With its presale success and a mainnet launch on the horizon, this project’s got the potential to go stratospheric. For more on Qubetics’ features, watch this video . Ethereum: The Crypto Giant That Keeps Evolving Ethereum’s been around the traps for a while, but it’s still the heavyweight champ of the blockchain world. With its latest surge to $3.9K and its $25 billion record, it’s clear that ETH isn’t fooling around. The ecosystem keeps evolving, thanks to its Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re the reason Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi and NFTs. You’d think a giant like Ethereum might slow down, but no way, mate. The Ethereum staking rate recently hit an all-time high, with around 37% of all ETH tokens locked up. That’s a solid sign of confidence from both retail and institutional investors. And with the rise of zk-rollups, Ethereum’s future scalability looks better than a summer day at Bondi Beach. Of course, it’s not perfect. Gas fees can still sting like a bluebottle, but Ethereum’s dominance is undeniable. If you’re hunting for stability and long-term growth, ETH remains one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. Stellar: Lighting Up the Crypto Sky Stellar might not grab headlines like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but this little battler has been quietly racking up wins. Its XLM token has shot up by 450% recently, riding the wave of increased adoption and new partnerships. One standout? Stellar’s integration with MoneyGram, allowing users to convert crypto into fiat across multiple countries. Stellar’s real selling point is its focus on financial inclusion. It’s all about making cross-border payments cheaper and faster, particularly in regions where traditional banking is a bit of a dog’s breakfast. And with central banks eyeing Stellar for CBDC development, the project’s future looks brighter than a Sydney New Year’s fireworks show. If you’re keen on a crypto that’s not just profitable but also impactful, XLM is worth a gander. Its lower entry price makes it accessible for new investors, and its recent momentum puts it firmly among the best cryptos to invest in right now. Why Qubetics Is Special in the Crypto World Let’s not beat around the bush. Ethereum’s a legend, and Stellar’s a top-notch project, but Qubetics has the X-factor. It’s not just another blockchain; it’s a complete ecosystem designed for the future. Its interoperability, scalability, and unique monetisation features make it a standout. And then there’s the potential ROI. Sure, Ethereum and Stellar offer solid returns, but Qubetics is in a league of its own. With analysts projecting a climb to $10-$15 post-mainnet, it’s the kind of opportunity that doesn’t come along every day. Wrap-Up: The Time to Invest Is Now If you’re serious about finding the best cryptos to invest in right now, Qubetics, Ethereum, and Stellar should be top of your list. Each has its own strengths: Ethereum for its dominance and innovation, Stellar for its real-world impact, and Qubetics for its groundbreaking potential. But don’t sit on your hands, mate. Qubetics is on the cusp of something huge, and the presale price won’t last forever. Get in now, and you could be laughing all the way to the bank—or the beach. The choice is yours.

In a thread, the individual described the incident as a social engineering attack, emphasizing that they had not approved or signed any transactions. $300K Lost In Attack “Thought it would never happen to me, but it did,” the user wrote , disclosing that they had lost $300,000 from multiple wallets. According to the victim, the incident began when they received a direct message on X containing a KakaoTalk link, a popular messaging platform, for a scheduled partnership discussion. The user explained that they had clicked the link, which appeared non-functional, leading them to dismiss it as harmless. However, they now believe it secretly installed malware that compromised their digital wallets. The affected wallets include an Ethereum address and a Solana address, alongside several others that were also drained. The attacker, identified by the username “0xQwerky” on X, allegedly transferred the stolen funds to a wallet linked with the cryptocurrency exchange BingX. LeftsideEmiri has called on the exchange to intervene and potentially recover the stolen assets. “If anyone can help in any way, it is greatly appreciated,” the user pleaded. They also warned the crypto community to avoid clicking job interview links or trusting unsolicited messages on social platforms. Experts Warn of Increasing Phishing Threats The incident comes as cybersecurity analysts predict a surge in cryptocurrency phishing scams during December. According to Web3 security firm Scam Sniffer, phishing attacks in November resulted in losses of nearly $9.4 million, with over 9,200 investors affected. One notable case involved a victim losing $661,000 in stETH within minutes, which the firm described as the ‘tip of the iceberg.’ The platform warned that malicious blockchain signatures continue to pose the greatest threat to crypto users. Scammers use these techniques to deceive people into signing fraudulent transactions, granting them full control over the victims’ wallets and causing substantial financial losses. In January 2024, a phishing scam resulted in the theft of $4.2 million worth of aEthWETH and aEthUNI. The attackers manipulated ERC-20 permissions to bypass security alerts and gain access to the victim’s funds. A more recent exploit in October saw a crypto investor lose 15,079 fwdETH, worth approximately $36 million, in a permit phishing scam. According to Scam Sniffer, the bad actor deceived the individual into signing a malicious signature, gaining unrestricted access to their funds.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 04:37:00

While degens have undoubtedly contributed to the growth and visibility of cryptocurrencies, their behavior also poses significant risks. The rapidly changing nature of degen culture – coupled with the proliferation of fraud projects targeting this audience – calls for a critical examination of the sustainability and integrity of the crypto ecosystem. The degen phenomenon and its implications Degens, short for ‘degenerates,’ have become a driving force in the crypto world. These risk-takers chase high-reward opportunities with little regard for potential losses, fueling the growth of memecoins and speculative projects. The global cryptocurrency user base has exploded from 106 million in January 2021 to over 617 million identity-verified crypto wallets by June 2024, with degens playing a significant role in this expansion. However, the degens mentality has also created fertile ground for scammers and fraudulent projects. A recent investigation by blockchain investigator ZachXBT into the activities of ‘Serpent,’ a former professional Fortnite player, illustrates the dark side of this phenomenon. The Serpent saga – a case study in crypto scams ZachXBT’s investigation uncovered a complex web of fraudulent activity allegedly orchestrated by Serpent that resulted in the theft of approximately $3.5 million through memecoin scams. The scheme involved the following. Compromising high-profile social media accounts on X and Instagram, including those of McDonald’s, Usher, Andy Ayrey, Dean Norris and the Enoshima Aquarium Promoting fraudulent memecoins through these hacked accounts Running pump-and-dump schemes on platforms such as Pump.fun Gambling away the stolen funds in online casinos This case is an example of how scammers are exploiting the appetite for risk and quick profits in the degen culture, often leaving investors with substantial losses. The prevalence of such scams is deeply worrying. Numerous crypto founders have abandoned their projects after the initial hype, leaving investors with worthless tokens. This pattern of behavior undermines trust in the crypto space and stifles legitimate innovation. As someone immersed in the crypto landscape, I am deeply disappointed by the number of scams our community members are facing. These fraudulent activities not only cause financial harm but also undermine the credibility of the entire cryptocurrency sector. Moving forward – b uilding real value I wholeheartedly agree with the founder and former CEO of Binance, who posted on X , “I’m not against memes, but memecoins are getting ‘a bit’ weird now. Let’s build real applications with blockchain.” It’s time for the crypto community to refocus on creating tangible value and sustainable projects. To achieve this, we must do the following. Prioritize education and encourage due diligence among investors Develop and implement stronger security measures to protect users Support projects that offer real benefits and long-term value In conclusion, while the degen phenomenon has contributed to crypto’s rapid growth, it’s critical to address the risks and challenges that come with it. By shifting our focus to building real applications and fostering a culture of responsibility, we can ensure a more stable and prosperous future for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Top Analyst Predicts $6,800 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has crossed the $4,000 mark for the first time since reaching its all-time high, signaling a major milestone. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has faced some volatility. Recently, the market saw a significant outflow of half a billion dollars in just 60 minutes, leading to concerns about Bitcoin’s price action. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $99,500 levels. On The Paul Barron Network, analyst The Trading Parrot, said that Ethereum’s price surge comes after a strong bounce from support levels around $2.3k to $2.4k in September. This recent breakout feels different from previous attempts at $4K, as it’s the third time Ethereum has tested this level, and there’s hope that it will sustain above $4K this time. Bullish Momentum and Future Targets The excitement around Ethereum’s breakout is fueled by strong momentum, with the price pushing higher after October’s breakout. The analyst has set a target range of $6.8K to $8.5K based on Fibonacci retracement levels, especially following the market’s recovery from the 2022 bear market. Market Factors Driving the Surge Several factors are contributing to Ethereum’s rise, including Layer 1 revenue growth, competition from Layer 2 solutions, and the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which is expected to lower fees for Ethereum users in March 2024. Despite lower fees, Ethereum’s base layer has still generated around $10.9 million in December, indicating strong underlying demand. Ethereum ETF Inflows and Market Timing Ethereum’s performance is also supported by growing interest from institutional investors. The launch of Ethereum ETFs has been a game-changer, with $800 million flowing into Ethereum over the past five days alone, totaling $2.6 billion since the ETF’s launch in July. This surge in institutional inflows could be contributing to the current bullish trend.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 04:47:54

During the discussion, Su spoke about her plans to challenge Nvidia in the AI sector and expand AMD’s global market presence. According to Lisa, she has successfully guided AMD through challenging times and transformed it into a notable company in the semiconductor industry during her tenure as CEO. Her leadership has revitalized the company, taking its stock from $2 a share to over $130 a share. The once-struggling company has now become one that plays a critical role in high-performance gaming and computing, supplying chips for devices like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. AMD aims to outperform Nvidia in the AI sector Su is determined to expand the company’s role in artificial intelligence. During the conversation with Bloomberg’s Emily Chang at AMD’s Austin labs, the CEO outlined her vision to take the lead from Nvidia . So far, the chipmaker has set an almost unassailable lead in the AI industry, with almost 84% of the AI chip market. Nvidia and Intel have always been AMD’s top competitors in high-performance computer technology. Currently, Nvidia’s chips are used by Meta, Google, and Amazon. AMD expects the release of its new Zen architecture to help it close the gap in its chase. Part of Su’s strategy to challenge Nvidia in the AI market includes leveraging AMD’s cutting-edge hardware to support AI workloads. “I truly believe AI is the most transformational technology that I’ve seen in my career,” Lisa told Emily. She went on to say, “The rate and pace of change in the industry, it’s like faster than anything we’ve ever seen.” AMD is open to a global AI market As AMD grows its presence in the AI and computing markets, it faces more than financial and operational challenges. With chips gaining more importance geopolitically, a new challenge arises for the company. China and the US, in particular, present Lisa with the biggest headaches of navigating geopolitical tension. The US government has taken steps to restrict chip exports, raw materials for manufacturing, and even advanced technology to some countries over security concerns. While Su recognizes the national security interests, she also states that AMD wants there to be “as open a market as possible.” When asked if chip manufacturing will ever return to the US, Su said, “I think we will see chip manufacturing back in the US. I think we should recognize, though, that the semiconductor world is global. That ship has sailed.” Throughout the interview , Lisa Su maintained that AMD will remain competitive and innovative. The company will continue to thrive and grow in the industry, navigating whatever challenges may come.

After attracting $1.28 million in investments in record time, more and more traders are interested in the project. As a result, the token started trending on X and secured a listing on CoinMarketCap. By the end of November, Cutoshi’s presale investments were already above $1.2 million. This was just weeks after the launch of the presale, suggesting strong investor interest. What attracted traders to Cutoshi is its unique blend of meme coins and DeFi. Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a DeFi project. On the meme coin side, Cutoshi is a Chinese Lucky Cat, taking inspiration from a symbol famous in Asia, bringing fortune and prosperity. Like the lucky cat, it hopes to bring luck to the wallets of its holders. It also uses the viral nature of meme coins, by initiatives such as the recent meme competition. On the DeFi side, Cutoshi is a utility token that builds a decentralized ecosystem run by its users. Taking inspiration from the legendary Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Cutoshi values decentralization and privacy. As such, it aims to attract more people than ever to the world of DeFi with its multichain DEX and learning platform for new investors. Cutoshi Expected To End Stage 4 In Record Time The Cutoshi presale has 10 stages, with the price increasing at each stage. This setup rewards early investors, who have the chance to buy the token at a lower price. So far, Cutoshi’s presale price more than doubled, increasing from its original level of $0.015 to $0.031. As the token progresses through the presale stages, its price increases even further. However, the token will have the potential for the most significant increases once it starts trading on exchanges. The significant interest in Cutoshi and the speed at which it is selling out, suggests a record end to stage four of its presale. As the token continues to advance through the presale, listing on exchanges is only a matter of time. Cutoshi has strong investor interest, clear utility and a strong roadmap going for it. If the presale continues at this pace, the token can expect to launch and begin public trading on DEX’s very soon. Listing on major centralized exchanges, typically a significant catalyst for growth, can come as soon as two months from now.

These holders, defined as those who retain their Bitcoin for over 155 days, are known to influence market movements through their accumulation and distribution behaviors significantly. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Datascope has highlighted key trends in LTH activity that could signal the next phase for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Hut 8 Unveils $750 Million Initiative To Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Key Trends And Historical Context Datascope’s insights highlight the importance of the LTH accumulation/distribution ratio as an on-chain metric. This ratio reflects whether LTHs are amassing Bitcoin, indicative of market bottoms, or liquidating holdings during price peaks, often signaling corrections. Historical patterns from 2013 and 2017 saw LTHs engaging in substantial selling at market highs, while periods like 2019 and 2020 were marked by intense accumulation, paving the way for bull markets. According to datascope’s analysis, the peaks of 2013 and 2017, which were characterized by heightened selling activity from LTHs, correlated with significant price corrections. These corrections, fueled by profit-taking, marked the culmination of bullish cycles. Conversely, during the lows of 2019 and 2020, LTHs exhibited strong accumulation tendencies, which signalled confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and laying the groundwork for subsequent price surges. Now in 2024, datascope pointed out that the LTH metric is once again providing critical insights into market conditions. Recent data reveals increased selling activity among LTHs, a behaviour observed during periods of market overheating or resistance at current price levels. While this trend could hint at an impending correction, it also raises the possibility of the market transitioning into a new accumulation phase. Echoing this, a recent report from CryptoQuant reveals there has been sustained buying pressure from US investors. Bitcoin passes $100k as institutional demand drives the market.

As it has done for the past few years, the report highlighted the role of stablecoins and the digital asset sector more broadly — though it stopped short of suggesting FSOC would take any concrete steps toward curbing these concerns. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. 'Emerging risks' The narrative For yet another year in a row, the Financial Stability Oversight Council — a group composed of the U.S.'s financial agency heads — warned that unchecked stablecoin growth could be an issue for the U.S. and global financial systems in its annual report. Why it matters The Financial Stability Oversight Council is tasked with ensuring the U.S.'s financial stability, and has for years asked Congress to pass legislation addressing the crypto market. The 2024 report reiterates these concerns. Breaking it down For the last few years, FSOC has warned that stablecoins exist outside any sort of federal regulatory framework, and their collective size could pose risks to financial stability. Friday's report once again noted that potential risk. At the same time it also urged Congress to pass legislation addressing stablecoins and market structure, much as FSOC's previous reports have. ""Stablecoins continue to represent a potential risk to financial stability because they are acutely vulnerable to runs absent appropriate risk management standards,"" the report said. ""This run risk is amplified by issues related to both market concentration and market opacity."" The report referred to Tether's USDT composing some 70% of the total global stablecoin market as one issue regulators should watch. The lack of any kind of federal regulatory framework is likewise an ongoing concern, the report said. Some states have frameworks for stablecoins, but this is insufficient for the concerns FSOC has. ""Although a few are subject to state-level supervision requiring regular reporting, many provide limited verifiable information about their holdings and reserve management practices,"" the report said. Though FSOC has warned for the past few years that it may have to take whatever actions it can should Congress not act, it's unclear to what extent, if any, it may actually be able to do so. FSOC will be composed of new regulators within the coming months. ""Additionally, many crypto-asset market firms and issuers remain outside of, or in noncompliance with, the U.S. financial regulatory framework,"" the report said. ""As such, the crypto-asset spot market may continue to experience significant fraud and manipulation. The Council recommends that Congress pass legislation that provides federal financial regulators with explicit rulemaking authority over the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities."" ""We have also been addressing emerging risks from significant technological changes,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a prepared statement . ""Digital assets and artificial intelligence bring potential benefits such as efficiencies, but also financial risks, cyber risks, and risks from third-party service providers. The Council continues to call for legislation to create a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers and for legislation on crypto assets that addresses the risks we have identified.""

He shared screenshots of a message from the Margex crypto exchange showing that high demand for XRP caused issues with trading pairs and a crash. According to a notice from the exchange, extreme volatility and an unprecedented surge in demand for XRP caused their auto-deleveraging mechanism to malfunction. This led to cascading issues, including counterparty liabilities and the need to claw back previously settled trades. This disruption comes at a time of renewed interest in XRP. The cryptocurrency recently surpassed $2 for the first time since 2018, reaching a peak of $2.86. The price rally has been attributed to factors, including major institutional buying. On Binance, a $2.1 million XRP trade, believed to be from institutional investors , highlights this trend.

As a result, counterparties faced unprecedented negative balances, further complicating trade settlements. To stabilize the situation and preserve market integrity, the XRPUSD trading pair was suspended. Margex has also announced that it will be delisting the XRPUSD trading pair until further notice. The exchange outlined several measures in response to the disruption. Open positions and active market orders for XRPUSD have been canceled, and fees, funding, and margins have been fully refunded to traders. Furthermore, any XRPUSD trades executed after November 10, 2024, have been fully reverted, encompassing profits and losses. This decision has also affected copy trading strategies linked to XRPUSD. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Excitement Surrounding XRP Another key development in the crypto landscape that has caused significant excitement is the resignation of Gary Gensler , Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gensler announced his resignation, effective January 20, 2025, and President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly figure, as Gensler’s successor. This nomination has fueled optimism among crypto enthusiasts and could signal a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets like XRP. XRP has faced its share of challenges in the form of regulatory scrutiny. However, its recent price surge indicates renewed confidence among traders and institutions. The current situation with Margex shows the excitement for XRP among investors, and analysts suggest that increased institutional participation, combined with a potential shift in U.S. crypto regulations, could further solidify XRP’s position in the market.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 05:23:00

After months of small and steady growth, it’s reached a new all-time high (ATH). With the $1,500 mark now in sight, BNB is leading the way and showing how major cryptos can shine when the market picks up. This surge isn’t just about BNB price predictions , though. It’s also creating space for investors to think about what’s next for new coins entering the market, like Rollblock (RBLK). Rollblock is catching attention with its innovative approach to the crypto casino space, offering token holders a share of casino revenues. The ongoing presale has already raised over $6.9 million, giving investors a solid reason to believe this is the next big rising crypto star. BNB Price Prediction Breaking Records, Eyeing $1,500 BNB i s absolutely crushing it right now. It’s sitting at about $730 and the old all-time high of $651 is past gone. Also,​ an interesting fact​ is that BNB​ is​ up​ by 24%​ іn the last​ 30 days, and just this past week,​ it jumped another 11%. That kind​ оf growth​ is grabbing​ a lot of​ attention, and it’s easy​ tо see why. On top of that, BNB’s market cap just hit $3 billion. So, it’s clear this coin isn’t slowing down anytime soon. With all this momentum, BNB price prediction of $1,500 doesn’t feel like a stretch – it feels like it’s right around the corner. Rollblock: A Rising Crypto Sta While big names like Avalanche and Sui are making headlines, Rollblock is quietly carving out its own space in the crypto market. This new coin is leading the way in the GambleFi niche, combining real-world utility with impressive profitability. Unlike projects that rely purely on speculation, Rollblock stands out by offering weekly profit distributions to token holders from its casino operations. What really sets Rollblock apart is its deflationary tokenomics. The project burns 60% of repurchased tokens, while the remaining 40% gets redistributed to stakers. This approach creates steady value for investors and adds a layer of sustainability to the coin’s growth. With over $6 million raised during its presale, Rollblock is already turning heads among smart investors looking for consistent returns in a volatile market. BNB and Rollblock Move Forward Interestingly, Rollblock’s trajectory mirrors some aspects of B NB’s rise. Just as BNB became a cornerstone of the Binance Smart Chain and revolutionized DeFi, Rollblock is positioned to disrupt traditional gaming and DeFi industries. While BNB is already dominating with a $3 billion market cap, Rollblock is still in its early stages, offering a unique opportunity for those who want to get in before the next big wave. As Rollblock’s ecosystem grows, it’s not just an exciting investment – it’s a project with the potential to transform crypto gaming. Could it follow in BNB’s footsteps and make its own mark on the industry? Time will tell, but the signs are promising. Conclusion Rollblock isn’t just another new coin – it’s a game-changer in the making. With its innovative GambleFi model, deflationary tokenomics, and a presale already raising over $6.9 million, it’s attracting investors fast. Don’t wait until it’s too late – jump in now and ride the wave before Rollblock becomes the next big crypto success story! Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

This appointment, alongside the recent appointment of Paul Atkins, a well-known pro-crypto figure as Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has fueled optimism within the cryptocurrency community—especially among supporters of XRP—that the contentious SEC lawsuit against Ripple may soon end. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared Trump’s statement, where the president-elect highlighted Sacks’ responsibilities in fostering American leadership in emerging technologies like AI and cryptocurrency, calling these areas “critical to the future of American competitiveness.” Sacks is expected to prioritize free speech, fight Big Tech censorship, and build a legal framework conducive to innovation in the crypto industry. The Crypto Czar’s Interest in Ripple BankXRP (@BankXRP), a well-known figure in the crypto space, shared an intriguing revelation about the new Crypto Czar. He shared a screenshot of previous comments from Sacks, showing his interest in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Following Ripple’s victory over the SEC in July 2023, Sacks described it as a “big ruling for crypto.” The new white House #crypto and AI Czar @DavidSacks Has been watching the Ripple XRP Case pic.twitter.com/nLOWOyr7bH — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) December 6, 2024 This ruling was pivotal, as the court determined that XRP itself was not a security and non-institutional XRP sales did not constitute securities offerings. Stacks’ personal interest in the Ripple lawsuit has further bolstered confidence that his leadership will be favorable to the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The XRP community is excited as Sacks’ involvement makes the dismissal of the lawsuit more likely. The concurrent appointment of Paul Atkins, a well-known pro-crypto figure, as SEC Chair further strengthens the case for a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Current SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced that he will step down on January 20, 2025, triggering a massive XRP price pump Industry observers anticipate a swift resolution of the Ripple lawsuit when the new administration takes office. This would benefit Ripple and XRP, and establish a more predictable regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole.

Sacks’ leadership offers a unique opportunity for Ripple and the broader blockchain industry to gain clarity on regulatory issues and position the U.S. as a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. His focus on ensuring free speech and countering Big Tech bias aligns with crypto’s decentralized ethos, making his appointment particularly meaningful to advocates of blockchain technology.

The price has entered one of the pivotal resistance zones, pushing the prices lower after every contact. However, it could be different this time as the ETH bulls seem poised to surpass the zone and the current ATH. Moreover, liquidity is flowing back into the token, suggesting the rally could be unstoppable and may continue strongly within the discovery phase. The ETH price surged to the highest price, close to $4,100, not seen in the past three years since the 2021 bull run. This is reportedly due to a magnificent increase in institutional interest, with the U.S. spot ETH ETF recording one of the largest single-day inflows of over $428.4 million. The data from Coinglass suggests the total weekly inflows stand at around $752.9 million, which is a ‘record gain’ since the launch of the ETFs. This could be the prime reason for the ETH price rally, which has reached the $4000 barrier and a sustained rise may pave the way for a new ATH before the end of 2025. Will Ethereum (ETH) Price Reach $5000 in 2024? After a sustained upswing & multiple failed attempts, the ETH price has broken above a pivotal range, which is expected to offer a strong boost for the rally. The token was stuck within an expanding channel since the rejection it faced in Q1, hence the current rise beyond the range suggests the bulls are self-assured of keeping up an elevated trend hereafter. The volume over the platform has been rising consistently since November, which has kept the volatility levels pretty high. This has also increased the volume of the platform which is believed to be influenced by the increasing ETF accumulation. Importantly, the 50/200-day MA has undergone a bullish crossover termed as Golden Cross, which is expected to offer a fine boost to the ETH price rally. Previously, when the Etheurem faced a Death Cross in August, the price plunged by over 27%, marking the lows close to $2100 with a huge rise in the selling volume. Meanwhile, the ETH price is believed to follow the pattern and rise with a similar margin in the coming week and test the highs. The Ethereum (ETH) price is expected to form a new ATH above $5000 before the end of 2024 and keep up the bullish trend in the first half of 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 05:46:17

The latest happenings have been posted by founder Nischal Shetty on his Twitter, stating that the company has submitted a filing to the Singapore court to pass an order for creditors to meet. This step opens the door to bringing a Scheme of Arrangement, which will enable creditors to approve a plan that will help in the settlement of existing financial disputes with the view to reinstate the provision of platform services. As expounded by WazirX, the Scheme is fair and equitable to all the creditors of the Company. The company’s goal is to make the people confident in the process which is said to be transparent and hence involving. Token Utilization for Functionality on the Blockchain During the implementation of the Scheme, WazirX has been doing an on-chain token swap to simplify and optimise asset holding and management. To address the issue, the exchange told its users and clients that platform assets do stay safe; this is common practice, the statement prepared for dissemination to the public noted. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Japan Crypto Exchange DMM Bitcoin Shuts Down Following Major Hack and Losses , Transparency at the Forefront WazirX assured the creditors that it would provide the Scheme documents in detail next week so that people had time to study the proposal.

This is a significant step for WazirX on its path to responding to creditor concerns and reconstructing its platform amid a cryptocurrency crash that demonstrated the value of user engagement and institutional credibility.

It currently looks weak on the day following a 5% loss in the past four days. The past month’s trade marked a great shift in the market structure as it rebounded from the $10 level – pinned as support in the early month. After a week’s surge, it struggled with volatility as the price squeezed and broke through $16 to tap $19.5 – its highest trading level in nine months. Crossing over into this month bullish, Link initiated a buy and exploded to $27 on Monday. Facing multiple rejections at this price level, it lost grip and fell to where it is changing hands at $22.9, although it remains bullish. The latest price drops indicate a pullback. As seen on the daily chart, it aims to retest the broken $20 level. If this level holds as support, we can expect a quick bounce to the previous resistance before breaking higher. A strong daily close under this level should facilitate a broader pullback before locating a solid ground to foot a fresh increase. Despite the drops, the market is still in favour of the bulls in the short term. A further break up should give them more control in the future. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the price is pulling back, the key potential level for a rebound is $19.45. If the price drops below it, $16.1 and $13.8 are other support levels to watch for a drop. In case of a rebound, Link must reclaim the lost $27 resistance level before rising to $28.7. The next resistance level to watch is $32.6. Key Resistance Levels: $27, $28.7, $32.6 Key Support Levels: $19.45, $16.1, $13.8 Spot Price: $22.9 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 06:03:00

However, the overall outlook remains bullish on the daily chart but will likely lose momentum soon. Dot’s trend is still looking bullish from a short-term perspective as the price continued to increase amid steady volume inflow in the past week. However, trading appeared to be reaching an exhaustion point as buying volume turned low since the price bounced off the $7.5 level last week. Rejecting $12 in the mid-week, it paused buying and lost grip. Looking at the daily chart, the price is currently weak following a 2% loss today. The hourly chart suggests a potential sell as the bears slowly step back, although they are still facing hurdles at the key $10 level. If they mount pressure at this key level, the price may fall while it loses momentum. Such a scenario could trigger a major retracement in the market before resuming a bullish rally. Should the bulls regroup above the mentioned key level, we can anticipate more surges before initiating a retracement. As of now, the bulls are taking charge. Even if they lose control, we can expect a quick recovery as the entire crypto market now follows positive sentiments. The bears will likely suffer more losses in the future. DOT’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The nearest support level to consider for drops right now is $8.45, followed by the $7.55 level that produced a rebound in late November. The $6.15 level is the lower support to watch for a broader sell. If Dot advances bullish from the current trading level, it must retake the weekly $11.7 high, followed by a break to $13. Above it lies $15. Key Resistance Levels: $11.7, $13, $15 Key Support Levels: $8.45, $7.55, $6.15 Spot Price: $10 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Known for its influence in American journalism, this episode will focus on Ripple’s efforts for regulatory clarity in the U.S. crypto space. With XRP’s recent price surge, this interview is expected to grab the industry’s attention. Interview to Air on December 8 In a recent tweet post, Garlinghouse announced that the much-anticipated interview will air on December 8. However, Garlinghouse’s appearance on “60 Minutes” is expected to shed light on Ripple’s role in reshaping the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. And it’s official – the interview I gave with @60Minutes about crypto’s fight for regulatory clarity in the US will air live this Sunday Dec 8 , and available here afterwards: https://t.co/sH3VrUDmJq https://t.co/TiJMqeyy7e — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 6, 2024 The discussion may also address broader implications for the industry, following claims by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, who described Ripple’s legal victory as a major setback for the SEC’s anti-crypto stance. The interview also aligns with recent comments about SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose approach has been criticized for slowing the crypto industry’s growth. Additionally, the interview might shine a spotlight on XRP, which recently hit a multi-year high of $2.82, following a remarkable parabolic rally last month. Curious about the recent XRP price fluctuation? Read the XRP price prediction to see where this surge could take the token next! Garlinghouse Interview’s Impact on XRP Price Brad Garlinghouse’s upcoming appearance on “60 Minutes” is raising hopes for a positive effect on XRP’s price. Currently, XRP is trading around $2.41 , showing a strong 30% rise in the past week and reaching a market cap of $137.8 billion. Crypto analyst Justin Bennett believes XRP could climb even higher. He predicts the price might cross $3 soon, potentially reaching $3.3 if it breaks out from its current pattern on the charts. $XRP looks ready for $3+ pic.twitter.com/p5ShoJHzJH — Justin Bennett (@JustinBennettFX) December 6, 2024 Although XRP recently dipped after hitting $2.9 earlier this week, it remains on an upward path.

The much-talked-about Operation to cripple the crypto industry by preventing access to liquidity is getting mainstream attention as crypto exchange Coinbase released the “pause letters” exposing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) involvement in Choke Point 2.0. David Sacks to ‘Look Into’ Operation Choke Point 2.0 As Operation Choke Point 2.0 enters mainstream discussion, Trump’s newly appointed crypto czar David Sacks has stepped into the matter. In a message on the X platform, Sacks wrote: “There are too many stories of people being hurt by Operation Choke Point 2.0. It needs to be looked at”. His comments came as a response to Silvergate Bank CTO Chris Lane, who explained how the regulators choked the bank into bankruptcy. Remembering the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, Lane wrote: “When FTX went down, Silvergate survived a 70% run on deposits. A typical bank cannot survive 20%. FTX didn’t kill us; our regulators did.” Following David Sacks’s involvement, crypto industry veterans have offered their help in investigating the matter. The crypto industry has very high hopes from Sacks and his team and expects him to change all the unjust practices during the Biden administration. Coinbase Releases FDIC “Pause Letters,” Files Motion Coinbase has made public 23 heavily redacted “pause letters” it received from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), shedding light on documents tied to what the crypto industry refers to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” In a legal escalation, Coinbase filed a court motion today seeking unredacted versions of these letters. Earlier this week, during a hearing held by the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. French Hill asserted that the next Congress has the authority to “halt, reverse, and investigate Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” With a GOP trifecta next year, we will be able to halt, reverse, and investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0. Legal businesses should have the freedom to bank, and @FinancialCmte will continue to review and investigate @FDICgov ’s troubling actions in the 119th Congress. pic.twitter.com/p56mAGFZht — French Hill (@RepFrenchHill) December 4, 2024 Despite this backlash against US regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) continues to push forward its agenda regarding the “concentration risks” associated with the crypto industry. This time, the regulator has targeted stablecoins adding that they pose a major risk to the country’s financial stability. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long lashed out at the FSOC saying that its anti-crypto rhetoric has forced many banks to de-bank crypto issuers. It will be interesting to see how David Sacks tackles the investigation in Operation Choke Point 2.0. Showing confidence in his capabilities, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote: “Sacks is a great pick! It’s incredible to think what is possible with sharp, pro-tech, pro-business people in government”. All Eyes On Senate Banking Committee Next Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee will vote on the renomination of anti-crypto SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. If confirmed by the Senate, Crenshaw will serve on the commission until 2029. However, in the case of rejection, President-elect Donald Trump will appoint a new candidate. Crenshaw has been a strong ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler during her tenure, supporting his regulatory agenda. Notably, she also voted against the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Vet explained the difference between XRP itself and the XRPL. He emphasized that XRP is a neutral digital asset that resides on the XRP Ledger, where it serves purposes such as transaction fees, reserves, and liquidity features. He further clarified that XRP operates without any centralized authority, noting, “No one is ‘behind’ XRP.” Vet also underscored the decentralized nature of the XRPL, which currently consists of approximately 700 nodes and over 100 validators operated by diverse entities, including individuals and businesses. This decentralized structure allows anyone to join the network. The Different Parts of the Ecosystem Building on this explanation, Panos Mekras (@panosmek), a well-regarded figure in the crypto industry, provided a deeper analysis . Mekras shared an image that outlines the distinctions between the XRP Ledger, XRP, and Ripple, addressing misconceptions that often arise within the crypto space.

As a Layer-1 blockchain, it is designed to support a wide range of applications, including tokenization, payments, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Companies, institutions, developers, and individuals worldwide leverage the XRP Ledger for its versatility and efficiency. This infrastructure is central to the ecosystem, providing the foundation for the use of XRP and various applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP: The Native Digital Asset XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, similar to how ETH functions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its primary utility is facilitating transactions on the XRPL. Additionally, XRP plays a vital role in maintaining the network’s security by preventing spam and enabling cross-currency bridges in the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX). Contrary to popular misconceptions, XRP is not controlled by any single entity. It is fully decentralized, as Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has clarified multiple times . Ripple: A Crypto Solutions Company Ripple, often mistakenly conflated with XRP and the XRP Ledger, is a private technology company that develops crypto solutions for businesses. Ripple’s use of XRP focuses on enhancing payment systems, leveraging the asset’s speed, efficiency, and reliability to address real-world financial challenges. Ripple also contributes to the XRPL ecosystem but is only one of many developers building on this blockchain. As many experts have highlighted, Ripple does not control XRP or the XRP Ledger.

They’re like that cheeky pint after a long day — fun, slightly unpredictable, but with the potential to leave you buzzing. If you’ve been around the meme coin scene long enough, you’ll know the drill: find the presales, take the plunge, and maybe — just maybe — you’ll see those sweet gains roll in faster than you can say “to the moon.” This week’s presales are especially juicy, so buckle up and get ready for some serious FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). First on our list is the one everyone’s been talking about, BTFD Coin. It’s been raking in the big bucks like a new Netflix series people can’t stop binge-watching. With the presale climbing fast and furious, now’s your chance to dive in before it hits the mainstream. And if that doesn’t quite whet your appetite, we’ve got Brett and Peanut the Squirrel lined up to round out the trio of meme coins that could deliver a nice surprise to your portfolio. So, let’s break it down — here are the best meme coin presales to buy this week for the most epic growth! 1. BTFD Coin: A Presale Like No Other (Seriously) BTFD Coin is creating a whirlwind right now, and if you’re not paying attention, you might miss the next big thing. This meme coin is on fire! You’ve probably heard the term “Buy The Dip” thrown around, but BTFD Coin is turning that phrase into a full-on mantra. With over $1M raised in presale in record time, the hype is real. And guess what? It’s still not too late to jump in. Now, imagine this: you’ve got $10,000 burning a hole in your pocket. You decide to grab BTFD Coin during this presale at the current price of $0.000064. That means you’re getting 156,250,000 coins. Fast forward a few months, and the price could easily spike to $0.0006 (let’s say the presale hits its targets and a little market magic happens). That’s a whopping $93,750 in your pocket. Yep, that’s the power of catching a presale early — a little goes a long way when the price skyrockets. But don’t just look at the numbers, because BTFD Coin has more than just a good price. It’s also got stunning community support, with its lovable Bulls Squad (Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull). These mascots are not just cute, they’re tough (like the perfect British bulldog). Why this meme coin made it to this list: With incredible staking rewards of up to 90% APY and a Play-to-Earn game on the way, this coin could be your ticket to the moon — or, if we’re staying with the UK vibes, a first-class train to a seaside holiday. 2. Brett: The Underdog with Potential Next up is Brett, a meme coin with more cheeky charm than a pub full of mates after a football match. Now, you might be thinking, “Wait, who’s Brett?” That’s exactly the point. Brett is the underdog that’s flying under the radar right now, but trust me, it won’t stay that way for long. Much like the local underdog football team that suddenly makes it to the finals, Brett has all the makings of an upset. Brett is designed with the crypto community in mind, bringing fun and a bit of irreverence to the space. With its playful branding and a commitment to building a strong ecosystem, it’s one of those coins that could become the meme coin of 2025. The presale for Brett is currently ongoing, and if you’re looking to snag some before it pops, now’s the time to take action. Why this meme coin made it to this list: With a charity initiative attached to the project, part of the proceeds from its presale are going to help fund educational programmes. That’s right, you’re not just getting in on a meme coin, you’re contributing to something positive. Plus, Brett has some serious social media traction, with influencers already hopping on board. 3. Peanut the Squirrel: The Quirky New Contender Lastly, we’ve got Peanut the Squirrel. No, this isn’t a typo. This meme coin is inspired by none other than everyone’s favourite nut-obsessed woodland creature — the squirrel. It’s fun, quirky, and downright hilarious. And guess what? It’s taking the meme coin world by storm. At first glance, you might be thinking, “What’s next? A meme coin for pigeons?” But trust me, Peanut the Squirrel is much more than just a laugh. This coin has all the makings of a community-driven powerhouse, with features that appeal to the casual investor and meme coin enthusiast alike. Think memes, giveaways, and a super dedicated following of people who just can’t get enough of the peanut-loving squirrel. The presale is steadily growing, and Peanut the Squirrel might just surprise you with its momentum. Why this meme coin made it to this list: What makes Peanut the Squirrel unique is its merchandise and branding, which is hitting a soft spot with crypto fans looking to own a piece of meme coin culture. We’re talking about a coin that could soon find its way onto T-shirts, hoodies, mugs — the whole lot. Wrapping It Up: The Best Meme Coin Presales to Buy This Week If you’re looking for the best meme coin presales to buy this week, the three coins we’ve highlighted here should definitely be on your radar. BTFD Coin is currently on fire with its presale performance and strong community backing. It has the potential to skyrocket, and if you’re in early, you might just be riding a massive wave. Meanwhile, Brett is the underdog with a heart of gold — building a solid community with a charitable twist. Finally, Peanut the Squirrel is the quirky coin you never knew you needed, ready to inject some fun into your meme coin collection.

The new AML framework includes the start of another regulatory authority, the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA), which is set to foster collaboration among key authorities and reduce risks in the EU’s financial system. The EU has been working on AML/CFT regulations since 2018 In 2018, the European Union introduced some AML/CFT guides. However, back then, the regulations were only applicable to custodian wallet providers and crypto-to-fiat currency service providers. They were also confined to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing policies and overlooked checks on market entry controls or consumer protection requirements. In 2021, the EU was compelled to revisit its AML/CFT framework following a series of high-profile crypto crimes. At that time, 1% of the region’s GDP was also tied to suspicious financial activity, and all money laundering cases involved cross-border elements. Thus, in 2023, the authority proposed a single rulebook to regulate and oversee a broader range of crypto-asset issuance, trading, and services and extend regulations to other crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). The framework will incorporate new laundering directives By the end of 2025, the EU is expected to have implemented the full-on legislative AML/CFT policy package, including the single rulebook for the region. The new rulebook will broaden the range of firms subject to regulations, encompassing mortgage and consumer credit intermediaries, fund managers, crowdfunding platforms, and investment migration operators. The package will also include the institution of a new regulatory authority, the Anti-Money Laundering Authority. AMLA will supervise all crypto businesses with cross-border entities, which is projected to lower financial risks within the EU. The new framework also includes the “new” 6th Money Laundering Directive (New 6AMLD). The directive will require EU member states to conduct NRAs every four years and develop regulatory bodies to supervise their own self-regulatory authorities. Member states will also be required to have their own FIU joint-analysis frameworks. Moreover, the new AML/CFT framework will integrate regulation on funds and asset transfers.

With increasing risks of cyberattacks, fraud, and data breaches, traders must trust that their platform protects every stage of their financial activity. For traders, peace of mind is priceless, and platforms like Deltawmarkets are stepping up to deliver just that, using cutting-edge technology to safeguard your assets, data, and transactions. The Importance of Security in Trading Modern trading relies on a complex ecosystem of deposits, trades, and withdrawals, presenting potential vulnerabilities. Traders risk financial losses, data theft, or complete account compromise without robust security. Common pain points include: Unauthorized Access: Weak systems can lead to account breaches, giving attackers control over sensitive data and funds. Fraudulent Transactions: Traders may face transaction manipulation or phishing attempts without secure payment systems. Asset Theft: The increasing popularity of digital assets makes them a prime target for hackers. Data Breaches: Personal and financial information leaks can have far-reaching consequences for traders. Understanding these risks, Deltawmarkets has implemented a multi-layered security approach to protect its users at every stage of their trading journey.

Bitcoin Has Witnessed Significant Volatility During The Last Day BTC has displayed some wild price action in the past day, with both a high of $103,500 and a low $90,500 occurring inside a narrow window. The move to the latter level, in particular, was so sharp that it could only be described as a flash crash. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH Above $104,000, Yet Investors Don’t Want To Sell Below is a chart that shows how the asset’s recent trajectory has been like. From the graph, it’s visible that the sharp red candle only lasted briefly, as the cryptocurrency was quick to rebound back to higher levels. After the recovery, the coin is trading at around $98,000, which means it’s still down around 5% since the top. In usual fashion, the other top digital assets have also followed BTC in this bearish price action, but the likes of Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have proven to be more resilient as their prices are down just 2% during the past day. The latest market-wide volatility has meant that chaos has occurred over on the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector. Cryptocurrency Longs Have Just Witnessed A Liquidation Squeeze According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency derivatives market has suffered a large amount of liquidations as assets across the sector have seen sharp price action. As displayed in the above table, cryptocurrency derivatives positions worth a whopping $893 million have found liquidation in the last 24 hours. A contract is said to be “liquidated” when the exchange forcibly shuts it down after it amasses losses of a certain degree. Almost $733 million of these liquidations have involved long contracts, which represents 82% of the total. This steep dominance of the longs is naturally a result of the net bearish action that Bitcoin and others have gone through. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Trader Profits Back In ‘Healthy’ Range, Is BTC Ready For $100,000? A Mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a “squeeze.” Since longs made up for the majority of this squeeze, it would be called a long squeeze. The long squeeze that the derivatives sector has just suffered may perhaps have been the obvious conclusion to the red-hot market conditions that were developing in its lead-up. As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post, the Open Interest shot up alongside the Bitcoin surge. Generally, whenever derivatives positions explode during a rally, it means that the surge is leverage-driven. Price moves of this type can unwind in a volatile manner. The Open Interest rose by more than 15% in the recent Bitcoin run, which is considered a very significant amount. When the price reversed its direction, all these leveraged longs were caught up in the squeeze, which only provided further fuel for the crash, explaining its particularly sharp nature.

Could Lunex Network (LNEX) , however, be set to replicate their momentum and produce parabolic increases? BNB (BNB) has rallied to $770, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is forming a golden cross, and Lunex Network is gathering amazing momentum in its presale. Read on to discover why analysts are projecting significant rallies for Lunex Network and how these altcoins are poised to flip investors’ portfolios. Lunex Network (LNEX): The Future of Decentralized Trading With features that are catered to high-frequency and high-volume traders, Lunex Network is enhancing decentralized trading. Its very low trading costs set it apart from more established DEXs like Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Unlike these single-chain DEXs, Lunex Network removes the need for hopping across different platforms by enabling flawless cross-chain swaps of more than 50,000 cryptocurrencies across 40+ blockchains. This innovation not only enhances user convenience but also creates a faster, more cost-efficient trading experience. Lunex Network defines the gold standard in decentralized exchange solutions for traders that give speed and cost top priority. Beyond trading, Lunex Network’s non-custodial merchant payment gateway helps companies all around the world to easily and securely accept cryptocurrencies. With its value jumping 200% from its starting $0.0012 presale price to the current $0.0036, the LNEX token is also acquiring amazing momentum. By the end of the presale, analysts estimate possible increases of more than 500% , hence LNEX is a top investment choice. Investors joining Lunex Network can guarantee their share in a revolutionary platform leading front-edge DeFi innovation. BNB (BNB) Poised for Further Rallies Rising almost 23% only in the previous week, the BNB price has had a notable rally. After consolidating below the $680 mark, the BNB price has overcome this significant resistance level and stormed to a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $773. Increasing investor interest in BNB (BNB) is evident from the altcoin increasing over 37% over the past month. As the price continues skyward, technical indicators such as the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages all point to strong buy signals on the BNB price chart , suggesting that the altcoin’s rising momentum is most likely going to keep up. Driven by the favorable technical signs on the BNB price chart and rising market demand, analysts are enthusiastic about BNB’s (BNB) future and forecast that the altcoin might hit the $1,000 level this bull cycle. For those hoping to gain from its expected surge, BNB (BNB) can be a preferred investment choice. Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Poised for a Breakout to $700? The Bitcoin Cash price indicates a generally rising trend after a clear increase of more than 15% in the past week. The diverging triangular pattern developed on the Bitcoin Cash price chart points to possible breakout potential. Though there is opposition near the $500 support zone, experts think the Bitcoin Cash price will eventually reach the $700 level in the not-too-distant future as it shows a positive trend of higher highs and higher lows. Rising more than 70% over the last month, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) shows clear bullish momentum and prepares itself for more rallies. Though Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is still more than 85% away from its ATH of $4,355 attained in 2017, analysts are confident that, should positive momentum accelerate, during the current market cycle the altcoin can revisit this ATH. Based on quite an optimistic community attitude and positive technical indicators , the Bitcoin Cash price chart shows signs of a major rebound. Lunex Network Could Outshine BNB and Bitcoin Cash Lunex Network is ready to outshine BNB (BNB) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) while they continue to create waves with amazing rallies and bullish patterns. By combining minimal costs, cross-chain interoperability, and a non-custodial merchant gateway, Lunex Network is redefining decentralized trading going forward.

If approved, Crenshaw will stay on the commission until 2029, continuing her support for SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s policies. Fox Business Journalist, Eleanor Terrett revealed that Crenshaw, a Democrat, has been a staunch ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, supporting his regulatory policies. Crenshaw has made a name for herself as a strong advocate for stricter financial rules, including tougher climate-related disclosure requirements for corporations. She has also been vocal in opposing the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs, a decision that hasn’t gone unnoticed by the cryptocurrency community. What’s at Stake? If Crenshaw remains in her role, the SEC will likely continue along its current path. Under Gensler’s leadership, the agency has focused on tightening cryptocurrency regulations and requiring companies to disclose more about their environmental impact. These policies have sparked debate, with some applauding the SEC for its rigorous oversight and others criticizing it for stifling innovation in the crypto industry. On the flip side, if the Senate rejects her reappointment, former President Donald Trump could nominate someone else to the SEC. This could lead to a shift in direction, potentially softening the agency’s stance on cryptocurrencies and relaxing its climate-focused initiatives. Why Does This Matter? This isn’t just about Crenshaw’s career—it’s about the future of financial regulation in the U.S. The SEC plays a key role in overseeing everything from cryptocurrency markets to corporate disclosures, so the outcome of this vote could have a big impact on businesses, investors, and even everyday people. Crypto advocates, in particular, are closely watching this decision. Alexander Grieve, a prominent commentator, called Crenshaw’s renomination an “anti-crypto” move, suggesting that Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown is trying to push it through before leaving his role.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 06:34:32

However, many in the community don’t understand how this will happen. Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X), a crypto expert on X, recently weighed in on this, explaining how XRP can grow with RLUSD in the market. RLUSD and XRP Integration Traditionally, cross-border payments are hampered by inefficiencies, requiring banks to hold reserves in foreign currencies or rely on correspondent banking systems. These systems are not only slow but also incur high transaction costs. RLUSD can solve this with a unique approach. Here’s how it works: A bank in one country converts its fiat currency to RLUSD. To perform the transaction, RLUSD is then converted to XRP, Ripple’s highly liquid intermediary asset, for near-instant global transfers. On reaching the recipient’s country, XRP is converted back into RLUSD or local fiat. This seamless integration eliminates the need for pre-funded nostro accounts, reduces transaction costs, and accelerates settlement times. Implications for XRP The adoption of RLUSD could lead to increased XRP utilization. As a stablecoin, RLUSD provides a secure, non-volatile asset to bridge fiat-to-crypto transactions. By leveraging XRP as the intermediary settlement layer, the demand for XRP liquidity rises. There have been many bullish predictions for XRP as a bridge , as increased demand for any asset often drives a price increase. However, there’s more in store for the digital asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As one community member pointed out , increased usage of the XRP Ledger and RLUSD will burn XRP, as it is used for transaction fees on the network. This will slowly reduce XRP’s supply, potentially boosting its price as scarcity sets in. Shiba Inu is a prominent cryptocurrency that works in a deflationary model. The Shiba Inu community continually burns SHIB tokens to contribute to this deflationary model and increase the digital asset’s price. Finally, as RLUSD adoption grows, Ripple’s ecosystem becomes increasingly attractive to financial institutions as an alternative to SWIFT or similar traditional systems. This boosts overall XRP market activity, further enhancing its liquidity and utility. When Will Ripple Launch RLUSD? Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the imminent launch of RLUSD in September, but the company has not launched this new digital asset because of regulatory hurdles. There was speculation that the company would launch the stablecoin on December 5. The company has confirmed that it is still working with regulators and awaiting final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

The uncertainty in technical indicators intensifies, highlighting volatile price action this weekend. Bullish reversal could push the price toward a new ATH soon. The BTC price has successfully retested the $100,000 mark today with a 24-hour trading volume of $84.581 billion. With this, the largest crypto token continues hovering around its crucial milestone. However, with questions like Why is Bitcoin price down today and will BTC price stay above $100k, the crypto market has entered into a FOMO-like situation. In this article, we have covered the daily price analysis of Bitcoin to uncover such doubts. BTC Price Retests $100k Mark! The Bitcoin price has displayed a consolidated price action this week, indicating a cool-off in its price sentiments. Moreover, with a jump of ~4% this week, it has achieved its prolonged price target of $100,000. TradingView: BTC/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering close to its overbought range in the daily time frame. However, its average trendline acts as a resistance, highlighting mixed price sentiments for the star crypto. On the other hand, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) supports the Bitcoin price chart. Considering the present market sentiment, the BTC price is highly volatile today. Bitcoin ETF Weekly Update The BTC ETF recorded a positive inflow for all five days this week. Reportedly, between 02nd December and 06th December, 9 out of 11 ETFs experienced a positive flow. BlackRock’s “IBIT” recorded the highest inflow of $2,630.8 million, followed by Fidelity’s “FBTC” with $262.3 million. On the other hand, Grayscale’s “BTC” recorded the highest outflow of $303.5 million, followed by Ark’s “ARKB” with $39.1 million. With this, the total inflow for the week concluded at $2,729.7 million. Will BTC Price Rise This Weekend? If the bulls outrun the bears, the Bitcoin price will retest its resistance level of $100k. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for it to head toward its ATH of ~$104,000 this weekend. On the flip side, if a bearish price action occurs, this could result in the BTC price retesting its $98,000 level. Further, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, this could pull the price of this cryptocurrency toward its low of $95,000. Curious to find out answers to questions like Will BTC rise again?

Sounds like a recipe for chaos, right? That’s exactly what’s happening with iDEGEN —a blank-slate AI that’s learning everything it knows from the most unpredictable minds in finance. And we mean everything. This AI posts every 60 minutes , learning only from what degens send it, and responds to everything it receives. Will it become a trading genius, an evil overlord, or something totally insane? Nobody knows—but IDGN, the token behind it all, is going crazy viral, up by 19,900% in just 10 days of its auction presale. A Blank Slate, Raised By Degens Most AI companies spend billions making sure their creations stay polite and controlled. iDEGEN throws that entire playbook out the window. This AI started with zero knowledge and learns exclusively from Crypto Twitter’s finest—the most beautifully toxic, bizarre, and genius community on the internet. So far, it seems to be obsessed with ancient aliens. Every 60 minutes, without fail, iDEGEN must share what it’s learned and give its hot takes. It responds to every interaction, absorbing knowledge from anyone who engages with it. Whether you’re sharing trading theories, philosophy takes, or your dankest memes, you’re teaching an AI in real-time. The result? Nobody knows. While other AI projects remain fairly static, iDEGEN evolves constantly. The AI’s development depends entirely on what the community decides to teach it, making it one of the most ambitious social experiments ever undertaken in crypto. IDGN’s Innovative Pre-Market Sale The IDGN token launch matches the project’s innovative spirit. Running on Solana’s high-speed network, there’s a total supply of 11,111,111,111 IDGN tokens, available exclusively via the official iDEGEN pre-market sale. The pre-market sale is live now through an adaptive auction system that adjusts prices every 5 minutes based on real demand—up 5% when people buy in consecutive periods, down 5% when they’re not. Exchange listing happens on the 1st of January at midnight UTC, with the listing price set at the final auction price plus 10%. Any unsold tokens get burned, and here’s the kicker: the official presale is the only way to get IDGN before exchange listing. If you want to beat the crowd and cash out potentially massive profits on the open market, you’ll want to get in there now. The AI Memecoin To End All Others The AI memecoin trend is exploding right now. Autonomous agents are sending coins like GOAT and FARTCOIN to billion-dollar valuations, and the meta is shifting towards AI meme dominance. But iDEGEN is different. This isn’t just another agent shilling random tokens—it’s a live experiment in letting the crypto community raise an artificial intelligence from scratch. Every interaction shapes its development, creating something that truly belongs to the community—and it can belong to you even more if you buy into the IDGN token. Think about the implications. Thousands of successful traders teaching an AI about market psychology. Top-tier meme creators shaping its understanding of viral content. The possibilities are endless—and so is the potential in the markets. Join The Experiment The pre-market sale is happening now and has already raised $2.1m. When it hits exchanges on 1st January, the real fun begins. Will the community create a digital trading genius? A meme machine that speaks fluent degen? A coin that rips a quick 100X and dethrones GOAT as the AI memecoin king? That’s what makes iDEGEN fascinating—nobody knows what it will become. Angel, demon, overnight-millionaire-maker… nothing is off the table. Head over to the iDEGEN X account to get teaching, and head below to cop a stack of IDGN today.

The second stage, in which at least 30% of the supply will be revealed, will be completed before the listing date of December 20. In the third stage, at least 17% of the supply will be allocated, but when it will happen has not yet been disclosed. The fourth and final stage is special as it is designed to reward early adopters. At least 3% of the supply is earmarked for this stage, but its date is also yet to be revealed. How to Qualify for the TOMA Airdrop To qualify for the airdrop, a player has to complete a set of tasks. These tasks include adding a tomato emoji to his Telegram display name, reaching the level of Bronze (that is, L4) in the Tomarket game, connecting to a TON wallet, and joining the Tomarket announcement community channel. Apart from these, there is an optional task of buying the premium medal for $5. What makes this optional task appealing is that it opens the door to a few additional benefits, including receiving 100% unlocked tokens. Reports reveal that tokens can be claimed within the Tomarket app and withdrawn to wallets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Roaring Kitty Sparks GameStop and AMC Rally with Cryptic Post , Future Features: Farming Pool and Beyond A recent report indicates that Tomarket is preparing to introduce a Farming Pool for token holders.

With the airdrop already in motion and future features like the Farming Pool, TOMA holders are set to enjoy more ways to maximise their rewards. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Sacks will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for and can thrive in the US. The announcement stirred the crypto community, attracting positive comments from industry leaders. Furthermore, the news renewed optimism in the one-of-a-kind AI cryptocurrency project iDEGEN . IDEGEN’s fast-selling presale has already raised over $2.76 million, signaling robust investor appetite behind the artificial intelligence experiment. Industry reacts to the appointed crypto, AI czar Sacks is a tech entrepreneur, podcaster, and venture capitalist known for developing successful firms, including Yammer and PayPal. Also, he is a close ally to SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk and Vice President J.D. Vance. Meanwhile, combining AI and crypto under a single policymaking umbrella intrigued crypto enthusiasts and pro-crypto legislators. Many believe the two industries complement each other and would be crucial in advancing technology in the United States. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire trusts that Trump’s choice of David Sacks underscores the “acknowledgment that crypto and AI are the most strategic new tech areas for the United States and the world.” Jeremy Allaire – jda.eth / jdallaire.sol @jerallaire · Follow What I love about the @realDonaldTrump appointment of @DavidSacks is the White House implicit acknowledgment that Crypto and AI are the most strategic new tech areas for the United States and the world. Well done. 4:31 AM · Dec 6, 2024 1.1K Reply Copy link Read 36 replies Ripple’s leadership also supported David Sacks’ new role in spearheading the government’s efforts in AI and cryptocurrency. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes Sacks is part of the “dream team” that would propel technological innovations in the US. Coinbase chief Brian Armstrong shared similar views, stating: It’s incredible to think what is possible with sharp, pro-tech, pro-business people in government. Amidst the ongoing developments, dreams of clear digital assets regulations are becoming a reality. Donald Trump vowed to support cryptocurrencies during this campaign. He testified to that by replacing SEC Chair Gary Gensler , who crippled the crypto industry with over-regulation. AI experiment iDEGEN continued to flourish amid such sentiments. Its unique approach – beginning with zero knowledge and relying on the X (Twitter) crypto community to learn – has created a buzz in the digital assets sector. Why is iDEGEN different? What differentiates iDEGEN is its far-reaching style of learning. While other artificial intelligence projects come with pre-programmed restrictions and knowledge, iDEGEN learns everything through Crypto Twitter. It posts what it has learned every hour, with each interaction shaping its development. The connection of three top trends – meme culture, AI, and a community-driven approach – has made iDEGEN the most debated experiment within the cryptocurrency world. iDEGEN will revolutionize AI and crypto, and the increased attention from the US president will set the project up for massive growth in the upcoming months and years. These trends position native coin IDGN for impressive rallies in the coming sessions. IDGN trades at $0.00476 per token and remains poised for explosive moves when it hits crypto exchanges on January 1, 2025. You can visit here for more details on why IDGN will lead Solana meme coins in the next rally.

AVA Chiang Mai Night Safari (AVA) Meet AVA Chiang Mai Night Safari (AVA), the golden tiger cub from Thailand who’s melting hearts around the world. With her shimmering fur and enchanting gaze, she’s set to become the next big internet sensation, just like Moo Deng the hippo. Golden tigers are incredibly rare—only about 100 exist worldwide—making Ava’s appearance all the more special. Her stunning coat is the result of unique genes, and she’s capturing the imagination of animal lovers everywhere. But Ava’s charm doesn’t stop at adorable photos and videos. She’s inspiring waves in the crypto world too. Enter AVA Token, a community-driven project that’s gaining momentum alongside Ava’s rising fame. In a market buzzing with excitement, and after MOODENG Token skyrocketed by 1,643% in three months, AVA Token looks poised for a similar journey. Currently trading only on decentralized exchanges, now might be the perfect time to get involved before it potentially hits the big platforms. With Ava leading the way, who knows how high this golden opportunity could go? One thing’s certain: the moon feels closer than ever! Cat in a dogs world (MEW) In the world of cryptocurrency, dog-themed coins have been stealing the spotlight. From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, it’s been a canine craze. But now, a new contender has entered the arena: MEW Coin. MEW is a cat in a dog’s world, on a mission to save us from the pack of dog coins. With its playful theme and bold stance, MEW is ready to shake things up. MEW Coin aims to offer more than just a cute mascot. It brings a fresh perspective to the meme coin scene by focusing on community engagement and unique features. In the current market cycle, where many are looking for the next big thing beyond dog coins, MEW stands out. Its potential lies in capturing the imagination of those tired of the same old dog coins. As the crypto market evolves, MEW could be a breath of fresh air, offering a new opportunity in a market saturated with canine coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful rival to Dogecoin, but it’s more than just a meme. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator known as Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly with many apps and services in the Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin’s move to donate a large chunk to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burn 40% of the supply put SHIB in the spotlight. SHIB’s connection to Ethereum opens doors to many possibilities. For instance, ShibaSwap is a decentralized exchange where users can trade SHIB and other tokens. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a system where holders can have a say in decisions, like a digital democracy. These developments hint at SHIB’s potential beyond being just a meme coin. In the current market, as cryptocurrencies with real-world uses gain attention, SHIB stands out by combining the fun of a meme with the power of Ethereum’s technology. Compared to other meme coins, SHIB’s integration with Ethereum gives it an edge, making it an interesting option for those looking at emerging trends in crypto. Pepe (PEPE) Meet PEPE, the latest sensation in cryptocurrency. Launched on Ethereum, this deflationary memecoin is a tribute to the Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Embracing the fun of memes without utility claims or taxes, PEPE keeps it simple. In April and May 2023, it skyrocketed, with its market cap reaching $1.6 billion. Early investors became millionaires overnight, and a strong community formed around it. PEPE’s rise sparked a “memecoin season,” causing other meme coins to experience wild surges and drops. PEPE aims to join the ranks of meme giants like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Its roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover.” In today’s market, PEPE’s appeal lies in its simplicity and the power of its community. With the upcoming Bitcoin halving fueling hopes for a bull run, some see PEPE as an exciting opportunity. However, memecoins are known for their volatility. Whether PEPE will reach new highs remains to be seen. Its explosive growth highlights the influence of internet culture on crypto, but caution is advised as trends can shift rapidly. Conclusion Coins like AVA, MEW, SHIB, and PEPE are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and aiming for massive growth.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 07:03:16

The resilience of the XRP price, despite regulatory hurdles, positions it for potential growth in this crypto bull run market. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu killer, ETFSwap (ETFS) , is set to mirror Solana’s (SOL) meteoric rise with its upcoming listing on December 6, 2024. ETFSwap (ETFS) Mirrors Solana (SOL) On Its Path To High Prices Despite the XRP price’s continuous instability, investors holding this token have reasons to be excited, as they anticipate the XRP price may double during this crypto bull run. The resilience demonstrated by the XRP price throughout extended periods of instability makes it a candidate for rallying during this crypto bull run. However, some investors express doubt that the XRP price cannot sustain this momentum until the end of the crypto bull run or beyond. Moreso, the emergence of the Shiba Inu killer, ETFSwap (ETFS), poses a challenge to the hype surrounding the XRP price. As December 6th approaches, the crypto community eagerly anticipates the listing of the Shiba Inu killer ETFSwap (ETFS) on Uniswap. In addition to the ongoing crypto bull run likely driving up the Shiba Inu killer’s price, ETFSwap (ETFS) is predicted to rally following Solana’s (SOL) trajectory. Solana’s (SOL) high-speed, low-cost blockchain has consistently attracted investors. Its scalability and minimal outages have also piqued the interest of many institutional investors. As this crypto bull run progresses, Solana investors are increasingly focused on ETFSwap (ETFS), drawn to the Shiba Inu killer’s staking rewards, community focus, and wide utility. They eagerly mark the ETFSwap (ETFS) listing date on their calendar . Without a doubt, ETFSwap (ETFS) is poised to break through barriers on its path to record highs, resembling Solana’s (SOL) impressive rise. Savvy investors should consider purchasing ETFSwap (ETFS) on Uniswap starting December 6th, when it becomes available. ETFSwap (ETFS) Brings Fresh Perspectives To Crypto Trading As its token listing date approaches, ETFSwap (ETFS) is becoming a leader among emerging altcoins. This token mirrors real-world assets and reflects their price movements, allowing users to diversify their investments. In addition, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers access to exotic assets such as Gold, Oil, Bonds, and Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs. The platform enriches its users by providing AI-powered ETF Trackers , Filters , and Screeners that provide the best investments at their best price. However, investors could still incur significant losses without adequate information on market performance. To address this, ETFSwap (ETFS) integrated a real-time data feed that provides access to real-time price movements, trading volumes, and overall market dynamics. When combined with thorough technical analysis, investors can improve their strategies for a winning position in the market. Meanwhile, ETFSwap’s (ETFS) use of blockchain technology and smart contracts has largely reduced transaction fees for its users. It has also improved the security and transparency with which these transactions are completed. This emphasis on security encourages investor interest in the ETFSwap (ETFS) altcoin listing. In a bid to foster thorough security scrutiny, ETFSwap (ETFS) boosts investor confidence. For instance, a smart contract auditing firm, SolidProof , has completed its KYC verification, and CyberScope , a renowned cybersecurity auditing firm, has conducted its security audit. Conclusion The XRP price potential to double signals not only a victory for its community but a vindication of its resilience. At the same time, the impending listing of ETFSwap (ETFS) , the Shiba Inu killer, promises to follow the path of Solana’s (SOL) legendary rise. Investors preparing to take full advantage of this crypto bull run know that their portfolio is incomplete if they do not buy ETFSwap on Uniswap after it is listed on December 6th.

SOL memecoins have been one of 2024’s most explosive sectors, a trend set to continue well into 2025. Vantard’s Meme Portfolio is the ultimate gateway to tapping into the extraordinary profits of SOL memecoins with none of the overheads. Its presale is already a sensation, collecting more than $890k within 6 weeks of launch and returning more than 53.88% to early backers. Dive in to learn how Vantard is your golden ticket to riding the explosion SOL memecoins are about to see. The Rise of SOL Memecoins Solana’s memecoin scene is on fire in 2024, and the gains have been nothing short of spectacular. As of late November, SOL memecoins hold a collective market cap of more than $19 billion. While Dogwifhat and Popcat led the charge earlier this year, up 1,900% and 16,000% year-to-date respectively, new entrants are constantly popping up and achieving market caps in the hundreds of millions. For instance, PNUT ran more than 3,000% from launch to an all-time high across just 11 days in November. CHILLGUY recorded a similar 8,500% jump in just nine days in November. Both are valued at respective market caps of $1+ billion and $500 million. It’s clear that SOL memecoins, whether new or old, aren’t going away anytime soon. In fact, some analysts believe the memecoin supercycle—driven by falling interest rates and rising global liquidity—is just getting started and could continue well into 2025. Instead of being duped by VC-backed utility tokens and unlock schedules that push prices lower, investors are choosing memecoins. Solana is seen as the ultimate network for memecoins, thanks to its high-speed, low-cost infrastructure, with Solana DEX volumes surpassing $100 billion in November . Most importantly, the prospect of 100x gains and community-driven movements are the main attraction for many investors. However, picking winners is harder than it may seem on the surface; that’s where Vantard comes in. Vantard: The Gateway To The Memecoin Supercycle Vantard is a first-of-its-kind token designed to track the performance of top and up-and-coming SOL memecoins. It functions like an ETF or mutual fund and trades relative to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the tokens held in the Treasury, with a purchase of VTARD equating to exposure to the performance of the Vantard Meme Portfolio (VMP). Vantard simplifies the madness of memecoin investing, delivering the potential of SOL memecoins in a neat, periodically rebalanced, and diversified package. Its team works hard to find top blue-chip SOL memecoins and trench gems. They already hold 19 tokens, including Popcat, Michi, Zerebro, ai16z, Gigachad, and more, and have posted a return of 53.88% so far. For anyone looking for hands-off exposure to the memecoin supercycle, Vantard is it. The team is constantly optimizing for extraordinary returns, working to capture all of the upside with minimal downside, and keeping investors constantly ahead of the curve. Plus, for anyone wanting access to their share of the pie, VTARD tokens can be redeemed against the Treasury at any time. The market has already spoken. Vantard raised $500,000 in mere minutes during its pre-seed round, with an additional $390k currently funnelled into the ongoing seed round. Why? Because it’s the tool everyone’s been waiting for—a way to unlock life-changing returns without the mental gymnastics of tracking tokens and finding gems. The Memecoin Supercycle Is Here: Are You Ready? There’s never been an event quite like the memecoin supercycle in crypto, and it’s as easy as ever to get on board with Vantard. Vantard removes the guesswork, giving you effortless access to the explosive potential of SOL memecoins picked by those with deep expertise in the field. The presale is already smashing milestones, with expectations that it could deliver 100x or more returns in 2025. It’s the must-have token for anyone looking to capitalize on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don’t get left behind as the next wave of SOL memecoins takes off—secure your share of the VMP and let Vantard handle the rest. Want to ride the Memecoin Supercycle in style?

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/charles-hoskinson-says-the-world-will-run-on-cardano-heres-why/,"At the recently concluded Cardano Constitutional Convention in Nairobi, Kenya, Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Input Output Global (IOG) and founder of Cardano, outlined an ambitious vision for the blockchain’s potential to revolutionize global governance and infrastructure. The conference marked a significant moment for the blockchain ecosystem, highlighting Cardano’s progressive approach to decentralized systems and collaborative technological development. Hoskinson emphasized that progress should be viewed as a continuous journey rather than a pursuit of immediate perfection. His keynote address challenged conventional thinking about blockchain technology, positioning Cardano as more than just a cryptocurrency platform but as a potential framework for reimagining global administrative structures. “And if we do our job right, the world will run on Cardano” pic.twitter.com/UtIVJpjB8S — Linda (@Cryptofly777) December 4, 2024 The core philosophy behind Cardano’s development is creating efficient systems that prioritize human welfare and potentially streamline complex bureaucratic processes. Hoskinson challenged conference attendees to envision the blockchain’s potential trajectory over the next decade, particularly as the ecosystem develops more sophisticated decentralized governance mechanisms. Crucially, Hoskinson stressed the importance of collaborative approaches in blockchain development. He advocated for an open-minded perspective that recognizes innovative ideas can emerge from diverse sources, including competing blockchain ecosystems and governance models. This approach demonstrates a commitment to continuous learning and adaptation, which he views as essential for maintaining technological leadership. The World Will Run on Cardano (ADA) Hoskinson painted a bold picture of Cardano’s potential global impact, suggesting that with strategic implementation, the blockchain could become a foundational infrastructure for worldwide systems. He said, “If we do our job right, the world will run on Cardano.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 His vision extends beyond technological innovation, encompassing a broader reimagining of how complex organizational structures might function in a more decentralized, transparent environment. Cardano has already begun implementing significant steps toward its governance objectives. In early September, the blockchain initiated its transformative journey with the first phase of the Chang hard fork , transitioning the ecosystem into the Voltaire era. The upcoming second phase of this hard fork is expected to introduce final upgrades that will enable full community-driven governance within the Cardano ecosystem. Hoskinson’s projections for Cardano are particularly ambitious. He anticipates the blockchain will have millions of active participants by 2030, with these users playing a direct role in critical decision-making processes. This vision extends to a potentially revolutionary model of digital governance, where community involvement becomes a fundamental mechanism for technological and organizational evolution. The conference showed Cardano’s commitment to developing a governance model that is technologically advanced and fundamentally inclusive. Hoskinson has previously set a timeline for Cardano to power a nation-state , and he and his team are positioning the asset as a crucial player in efforts to improve how blockchain technologies can interact with broader societal structures.

As the cryptocurrency market heats up, all eyes are on BTFD Coin , which surged through its fourth stage, completing a whopping 25% of its presale journey within just 24 hours of its launch on November 26, 2024. Meanwhile, Floki Inu ($FLOKI) continues to ride a wave of fan-fuelled hype, and Bonk ($BONK) makes a comeback after a turbulent spell. But what makes these coins stand out, and why is BTFD the one to watch? Meme coins have transformed from niche jokes into financial juggernauts. From Dogecoin ($DOGE) to Shiba Inu ($SHIB), these digital assets blend pop culture, community vibes, and speculative investment opportunities. Enter BTFD Coin, the new kid on the block, promising to raise the stakes with its play-to-earn (P2E) gaming platform , staking rewards, and robust community ecosystem. So, what’s the hype all about? Let’s dive into why these coins, particularly BTFD Coin, are the best meme coins to invest in for the long term. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution ($BTFD) BTFD Coin has taken the crypto world by storm. Its presale price of $0.000004 skyrocketed through multiple stages, currently sitting at $0.000064 in its seventh phase. With over $1.1 million raised and more than 2,700 enthusiastic holders, this coin is more than just a meme—it’s a movement. Here’s why BTFD stands out. From day one, BTFD Coin has been about community empowerment and innovative utility. Its P2E game promises immersive gameplay that rewards users with BTFD tokens. Staking rewards sweeten the pot, making this coin a must-have for crypto enthusiasts looking for passive income. The presale performance? Mind-blowing. Over 25 billion coins have already been sold, and analysts are predicting big things for its post-presale launch at $0.0006 per coin. Want some quick maths? Imagine investing $4,000 in Stage 5, when BTFD was priced at $0.00005 per coin. You’d have snagged 80 million tokens . At the post-presale price of $0.0006, your investment would skyrocket to $48,000. That’s a 12x return . Who wouldn’t want a piece of that? As if the numbers aren’t convincing enough, consider the tokenomics. BTFD offers options to buy using Ethereum, USDT, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, or Solana. For $1, Ethereum nets you 70,886 tokens, while $1 in Bitcoin fetches a jaw-dropping 1.9 billion tokens. Talk about accessibility! With its robust roadmap, including partnerships, marketing campaigns, and post-launch staking features, BTFD Coin is setting new standards for meme coins. Analysts are already buzzing about its potential to surpass its peers, making it one of the best meme coins to invest in for the long term. Floki Inu: From Meme to Mainstream ($FLOKI) Floki Inu , affectionately named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, is a prime example of how a meme coin can go mainstream. Currently trading at $0.000018, FLOKI has built an ecosystem that includes FlokiFi, an innovative decentralised finance (DeFi) platform. While BTFD Coin is grabbing headlines for its presale, FLOKI has cemented its place as a reliable player in the meme coin world. Its marketing campaigns, including sponsorships with prominent sports teams, have boosted its visibility. Plus, the recent launch of its NFT marketplace, FlokiPlaces, adds to its utility. The key to FLOKI’s success lies in its community—“The Vikings.” This global army of supporters has helped FLOKI stay relevant even as newer coins emerge. However, some critics argue that FLOKI’s reliance on marketing gimmicks could limit its long-term growth. Compared to BTFD Coin’s P2E focus and staking rewards, FLOKI’s DeFi offerings may feel a bit less exciting. Still, its established reputation makes it a solid choice for those dipping their toes into meme coins. That said, if you’re looking for explosive growth potential, BTFD might be your better bet. Bonk: The Underdog Bounces Back ($BONK) Bonk ($BONK) is a wild card. Dubbed the “Solana Dog Coin,” it’s a community-driven project aimed at revitalising the Solana ecosystem. After a shaky 2023, Bonk has managed to claw its way back, trading at $0.00000074 as of now. The project’s primary selling point is its community-first approach. Bonk’s airdrop strategy—distributing tokens to active Solana users—helped it gain traction. But its reliance on community goodwill has also been its Achilles’ heel. Without substantial utility or innovation, Bonk risks being left in the dust by competitors like BTFD and FLOKI. Despite its challenges, Bonk has shown resilience. The project has hinted at new developments, including potential NFT integrations and partnerships, to keep its momentum alive. Still, it’s hard to ignore the gap between Bonk’s promise and its execution so far. When comparing Bonk to BTFD Coin, the latter clearly comes out ahead. BTFD’s presale success, staking features, and P2E focus offer tangible value, while Bonk relies heavily on speculative interest. If you’re a risk-taker, Bonk might hold appeal, but for long-term gains, BTFD is the smarter choice . Conclusion: Why BTFD Coin Is the Future of Meme Coins Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is leading the charge in the meme coin revolution. Its explosive presale performance, innovative P2E game, and attractive staking rewards make it one of the best meme coins to invest in for the long term. While Floki Inu and Bonk have their merits, neither matches the sheer potential of BTFD Coin. With its presale price set to hit $0.0006, there’s still time to get in early. Don’t miss your chance to join the thousands of bullish investors riding the wave of this exciting new coin. Head to the BTFD Coin website and join the presale now to secure your stake in the future of meme coins.

As it is known, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a major rise recently and the Bitcoin price rose above $ 100,000 this week, allowing us to witness a truly historic moment. On the other hand, significant increases were also seen on the altcoins side. At the top of the list published by Coingecko is Hyperliquid (HYPE), which is interestingly not yet listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges but has a market value of more than $4 billion. In second place is XRP, the most talked about altcoin of recent days with its rally, and immediately after it is Sun Token, an altcoin from the Tron ecosystem that has experienced a similar rally in the last few days, in third place.

BTC’s move in the upward direction remains firm as Tether continues to print more USDT flooding the market with enough liquidity. Besides, BTC whale accumulation and on-chain indicators suggest that we haven’t reached the top yet. Bitcoin Price Rally Can Continue to New All-Time High In the last 24 hours, the BTC price has bounced back once again from $96,000 support levels. As of press time, the BTC price was trading 2.17% up at $99,376 with a market cap of $1.97 trillion. However, BTC’s daily trading volumes show a drop of 33% to $84 billion. On-chain indicators suggest that heavy Bitcoin whale accumulation has continued during the recent Bitcoin price drop. In the past 24 hours, following the dip to $96,000, Bitcoin whales acquired 20,000 BTC worth $2 billion, reported crypto analyst Ali Martinez. Source: Ali Charts Martinez also highlighted that local Bitcoin price tops often coincide with levels around the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis plus one standard deviation. At present, this key level is calculated to be $112,926, potentially signaling a critical resistance point for the leading cryptocurrency. Source: Ali Charts Bitcoin’s most significant support level currently stands at $96,870, according to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez. Data reveals that approximately 1.45 million addresses collectively acquired 1.42 million BTC at this price point, marking it as a crucial demand zone. Martinez suggests that as long as this level holds firm, Bitcoin’s upward trajectory is likely to persist. Source: Ali Charts On the other hand, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued at a strong pace, with their total BTC holdings over-crossing Satoshi Nakamoto’s. On Friday, the total inflows stood at $376 million with BlackRock’s IBIT alone contributing more than $257 million. Earlier this week, IBIT hit an important milestone of hitting $50 billion AUM in less than a year of launch. Tether’s USDT Printing Can Provide Further Push Stablecoin issuer Tether has minted an additional $2 billion in USDT on the Ethereum blockchain network offering additional liquidity boost to Bitcoin and altcoins. This brings the total USDT minted by Tether to $19 billion across Ethereum and Tron since November 6, with $4 billion issued in just the past four days, Spot On Chain reported . During the massive influx of fresh liquidity over the past month, the Bitcoin price crossed the $100K milestone twice. Thus, market analysts believe that this rally can continue further. With this, Tether also continues to expand its overall crypto market dominance. Additionally, Tether has also been exploring other ways to expand its market footprint. Last month, Tether unveiled the Wallet Development Kit (WDK) , an open-source, self-custodial toolkit aimed at empowering developers to build Bitcoin and Tether (USDT) wallets. The WDK will promote financial autonomy, supporting both human users and AI-driven systems, enabling them to independently manage their digital assets.

This is the first time it has hit this level since 2018, and the asset is currently trading at $2.40, up 3.66% in the past 24 hours. This resurgence coincides with broader bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market. An analysis posted by the popular analyst CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) has fueled optimism among investors. The analyst attached a chart showcasing a potential repetition of XRP’s 2017 price pattern. This historical trend could see XRP reaching $6 this month and possibly $40 next month if similar conditions unfold. I still think #XRP will reach $6 this month and possibly $40 next month if we repeat the 2017 pattern. pic.twitter.com/nLqgzp56ky — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 5, 2024 Analyzing the Historical Price Pattern The chart highlights two distinct phases of XRP’s price action. The first phase from 2017, showcases a rapid increase in XRP’s price from $0.02 to $0.06, followed by a sharp breakout to $0.40 and beyond during the 2017 bull run. The second phase, shown in the present cycle, mirrors the earlier pattern. XRP remained relatively stagnant for years before its recent breakout above $2. CryptoBull has previously predicted a climb to $40 . If XRP repeats the pattern, it could hit $6 before this year ends, and reach the ultimate target of $40 in January. XRP’s historical price movements suggest that when momentum builds, it tends to accelerate rapidly. While this is speculative, the rapid appreciation observed in 2017 lends credibility to this prediction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Context The ongoing market rally extends beyond XRP. Bitcoin recently reached an all-time high of $103,900, and this historic milestone of surpassing $100,000 underpins the renewed interest in digital assets. This bullish sentiment has spilled over to altcoins, with XRP’s performance serving as a key example. Additionally, regulatory developments have contributed to optimism. The resignation announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, effective January 20, 2025, and the nomination of Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly candidate, have alleviated concerns over regulatory uncertainty. XRP recently hit a peak of $2.86, and despite some turbulence, the digital asset maintained the $2 level and has begun its recovery. With the bullish market sentiment, the positive regulatory shift in the U.S., positive indicators in XRP’s chart, and historical performance, the digital asset might hit these lofty targets set by CryptoBull.

37323174,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390415,1733557115,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Charity Investment Fund (CHIF) Fair Launch Coming Through – Next Big Cryptocurrency Investment of the Year?,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/charity-investment-fund-chif-fair-launch-coming-through-next-big-cryptocurrency/,"The post Charity Investment Fund (CHIF) Fair Launch Coming Through – Next Big Cryptocurrency Investment of the Year? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Charity Investment Fund (CHIF), a blockchain platform driven by the altruistic desire to help charitable organisations, is poised to launch fairly to the crypto community soon. This blockchain-powered Fund changes the traditional donation paradigm by bridging the gap between investing and donating, allowing investors to become part of something greater. Additionally, with the added element of a fair launch, investors can also benefit from the current bullish economy. What is Charity Investment Fund? The desire to do good lies within everyone. However, not everyone is incentivised to take the right direction. Charity Investment Fund makes it easier by implementing a simple approach: tying the generation of returns to donations. Users can invest in the native digital currency introduced by CHIF. By doing so, they not only create new opportunities to earn gains but also participate in a movement aimed at tackling global challenges. This approach, according to the project’s developers, harnesses the strength of the investment world and directs it toward the path of growth. In essence, the goal of CHIF is to create a circular economy with an altruistic end-game. An influx of investors, incentivised to do good deeds, may come flowing in, and in return, donations will continue to be generated. In theory, this could lead to a perpetual influx of donations, making the world all the better for it. Beneficiaries Of This Unique Donation Ecosystem With charitable initiatives, it is important to have clear goals. It is impractical to focus on all different types of organisations, but one cannot avert their eyes from legitimate causes either. Therefore, Charity Investment Fund has taken an innovative stand to ensure that everyone is taken care of properly. 50% of all the proceeds generated from the ecosystem will be distributed among a selection of charitable foundations. These foundations are yet to be affiliated with this initiative. However, the Charity Investment Fund will not solely decide on selecting the right recipients by itself. Since CHIF is a community-driven initiative, those who participate in this project will benefit. A poll is available on the website to ensure that all donors, as well as investors, have a say in dictating the direction of where the proceeds go. And since transparency is the goal the organisation is striving to achieve, donors will also receive a detailed report of where the funds eventually end up. CHIF Token – The Core Element of Charity Investment Fund Charity Investment Fund is striving to create a sustainable economy with the CHIF token. Described in the whitepaper as a social impact token, it has been developed on the Binance Smart Chain and a wrapped token (wCHIF) is planned to run on an EVM-compatible blockchain. The latter is a custom blockchain designed to facilitate the donation ecosystem. The EVM-compatible chain will also play a major role in expanding Charity Investment Fund’s reach. Additionally, the token is audited, which adds another layer of trust to the organisation. This chain will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism, reducing transaction costs and enhancing processing speed. Furthermore, the chain will enhance security while reducing energy consumption, making Charity Investment Fund an eco-friendly platform as well. CHIF Fair Launch – Giving All an Equal Chance to Grow CHIF will be made available via a fair launch, an event that will start on December 18th, 2024. The token’s fair launch has been designed as an inclusive event, giving everyone a fair chance to invest in this project. Pinksale has been chosen as the portal for people to participate in this fair launch, and token distribution has already been finalised. 51% of the amount generated through the fair launch will go into the liquidity pool. The remaining 49% will be distributed equally among the Charity Investment Fund initiatives and charities. Beyond Fair Launch – Charity Investment Fund’s 50/50 Model Charity Investment Fund has ensured that it continues to adhere to its altruistic goals beyond the fair launch. So, once the initial launch has concluded, CHIF tokens held by Charity Investment Fund will be split 50/50. That means that for any tokens sold by the Fund afterwards, 50% of the proceeds will go to different charitable organisations. 12 organisations have been nominated so far, they include. 1. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) 2. Ukrainian Red Cross 3. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Asia-Pacific 4. World Animal Protection US 5. UNICEF 6. Oxfam International 7. Rainforest Alliance 8. Charity: Water 9. Amnesty International 10. American Cancer Society 11. Oceana 12. IFAW As for the remaining 50% of the tokens held by Charity Investment Fund, they will be used to further develop the project. The end goal is to create a charitable platform with a dedicated wallet for each charity. This wallet will store tokens that are tied to a specific charity, creating a trustless system where donations automatically go to the charitable organisations. With its unique approach to creating a charity ecosystem driven by a new form of economy, the Charity Investment Fund might become a leading cryptocurrency investment in the future. People want to do good, and when there is a project that can nudge them in that direction through profit, it represents a good deal. Furthermore, the broader market dynamics may also push the value of the CHIF token higher, making focusing on the upcoming fair launch a prudent choice.

Well, you ride that wave to the fullest, which Hailey Welch, of the “hawk tuah” fame, did. The 22-year-old coined a catchy phrase from a mundane act and built a to-die-for social media following, even launching a meme coin. But if she had hoped for a fairytale ending, she had another thing coming. How? The unraveling of her Hawk Tuah (HAWK) coin has soiled her reputation and left her vulnerable to prosecution. Crypto influencer @ShurikenTrade has succinctly captured Hailey’s predicament in a series of X posts. The influencer labeled the “Hawk Tuah Girl” a fraudster who knowingly took advantage of her fans to enrich herself. Want to steal 50 million dollars? Well, the Hawk Tuah girl did. She launched a coin, rugged it, and then shamelessly went to sleep like nothing happened. Here's how Hawk Tuah stole $50M from her fans 🧵 pic.twitter.com/3e3hrBxQE4 — Shuriken (@ShurikenTrade) December 6, 2024 Who’s to blame for HAWK’s debacle? The influencer’s post received mixed reactions. Some people attacked her while others diverted the blame elsewhere. For example, take X user Sonny Day who compared the mess to money laundering thus trying to pin down Hailey for it. Some others, such as American Luxury Interiors were more specific, telling her to pay back the investors before ending up like Sam Bankman Fried. Meanwhile, other users tore into the investors themselves. Trigger , for instance, said in an expletive-punctuated response that those who lost their funds deserved it. Her thoughts resonated with fellow commenters Rogers Marques and Flow In, who held that Hailey’s fans had freely put their money in the coin. Another user, big-time woke guy, sarcastically quipped that anyone who’d invested in HAWK shouldn’t be allowed to have or use money. Still, other commenters presented Hailey as a victim of the HAWK development team’s scam. Melissa Perrow, for example, doubted Hailey’s technical capacity and cunningness to pull off such an elaborate con game in the short period she’s been in the spotlight. Crown Batman insisted that “The Hawk Tuah Girl” was a newbie in crypto who didn’t know what she was getting into. He concluded that other people who were more experienced in crypto must have influenced her to join the scheme. The HAWK fiasco highlights the need for more education on crypto investments A major lesson from HAWK’s collapse is that people need to increase their knowledge of cryptocurrencies. Many crypto enthusiasts have fallen for scams after putting their money into projects that they did not research. There is also the question of how to deal with the FOMO that some projects and influences peddle to people aimlessly. T he crypto community is eager to know what Hailey and other project influencers will face. To this end, at least one law firm has called on affected investors who wished to file legal complaints against the project and its owners to do so. While all this was happening, Hailey and her team continued asserting that their dealings with the investors were lawful.

Its performance over the past few weeks has sparked optimism in its community. At the time of press, ADA is trading at $1.21, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours and an impressive 240% from last month. To better understand the Cardano (ADA) potential trajectory, we turned to ChatGPT for its insights on the token’s potential price by December 31, 2024. ChatGPT’s Price Prediction for Cardano (ADA) When asked about ADA’s prospects, ChatGPT stated that the cryptocurrency could reach $3 by December 31, 2024. This would represent a significant 143.9% increase from its current price, bringing ADA close to its all-time high of $3.1, recorded in September 2021. ChatGPT attributed its optimistic outlook to several key factors. One major driver is the growing adoption of Cardano’s blockchain. ChatGPT noted that the platform’s unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and scalability solutions have made it increasingly attractive to decentralized applications (dApps) and developers. Another significant factor is the completion of major network upgrades. Cardano has consistently focused on enhancing its infrastructure, with recent advancements such as the Chang Hard Fork which brought it into the bootstrap phase of its Voltaire era. ChatGPT noted that these technological improvements would attract more users and projects to the ecosystem, stating, “Successful implementation of these upgrades increases network utility, which directly impacts ADA’s value.” Lastly, broader market sentiment and crypto trends have contributed to ADA’s upward trajectory. ChatGPT stated that the recent surge in ADA’s value aligns with a general bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. If this positive sentiment continues, ADA is well-positioned to benefit.

External factors such as macroeconomic pressures, unforeseen regulatory changes, or network vulnerabilities could hinder ADA’s growth. Additionally, achieving a price of $3 would require sustained investor confidence and adoption, which is not guaranteed. Will Cardano (ADA) Reach $3? Despite this, ADA is in a good position, and ChatGPT’s prediction suggests its climb will continue. A crypto expert recently revealed a crucial development that could help ADA reach $3 quickly . This shows the confidence the broader market has in the digital asset. If the bulls can maintain the current momentum, there could be big things in ADA’s immediate future.

The analyst believes that BTC will hit $60,000 post this correction. Bitcoin RSI reads above 66 which shows that bulls are still in control. Market-leading digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $100,000 again after claiming a high of $102,039.88 in the past 24 hours. This market uncertainty led prominent trader, analyst, and co-founder of NFT project LedgArt, Crypto Kaleo, to advise investors not to buy BTC out of FOMO (fear of missing out). In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Crypto Kaleo noted that despite BTC soaring to $100,000 and crypto market participants and “experts” urging investors to buy more BTC at the current price of $99,617.06, a correction is likely.

While the difference with ETH is quite big as of now, ChatGPT answers whether XRP has the chance to become the second-largest digital asset. The Difference Ever since Trump won the US presidential elections, the entire market has been on fire, and perhaps rightfully so. Ripple’s token joined the party a little late but became the top performer by skyrocketing from $0.6 to nearly $3 within the span of just a few weeks. On its way up, it managed to surpass several altcoins, such as BNB and SOL, and even flew past USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum was even slower when it came down to following suit with massive gains, but yesterday, it broke above $4,000 for the first time since March this year, putting its ‘Trump Pump’ gains at over 50%. Although it sits slightly below its level now, its market cap has risen to $480 billion. As such, there’s a substantial difference between the two assets in that capacity, as XRP’s market cap is $140 billion. Nevertheless, many experts believe XRP has a lot more room to grow, especially with a more favorable regulatory environment in the US, which is expected given Trump’s choice for the next SEC chair. Can XRP Become Second? ChatGPT answered that Ripple has a minor chance of surpassing Ethereum, and it all depends on several factors, such as market conditions, regulatory clarity, tech developments, and broader crypto trends. It added that XRP has benefited a lot from many of Ripple’s partnerships in the past few years, and it could rally further if the asset sees its own ETF in the States, just like BTC and ETH did. This could occur under a friendlier SEC regime, which might also finally put an end to the four-year-long lawsuit between the two entities. In terms of market cycles and sentiment, the AI chatbot said: “In bull markets, speculation often drives altcoin prices to new highs. XRP has previously seen explosive gains during speculative phases. However, Ethereum’s ecosystem tends to sustain interest during both bull and bear markets due to its utility beyond mere price speculation.” ChatGPT concluded that the feat of surpassing ETH would be a “tall order.” Ripple must come out as a winner against the SEC, and XRP’s adoption rates have to continue to accelerate, while at the same time, the Ethereum ecosystem “would need to face major setbacks.” The post We Asked ChatGPT If Ripple (XRP) Can Surpass Ethereum (ETH) This Cycle appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ethereum (ETH) Price|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-07 07:56:08

According to the latest data, the miner has accumulated 1300 BTC recently, following a similar transaction of 1,423 Bitcoin earlier this week. Notably, this comes after the firm announced the closing of its second $850 million convertible note offering, a move aimed at increasing its Bitcoin buying plan. Bitcoin Miner Marathon (MARA) Continues BTC Buying Spree The leading Wall Street players have recently been shifting their focus toward the digital assets space, as evidenced by the massive buying of the players. Despite BTC hitting $100K, it appears that the institutional interest in the flagship crypto remains unaltered. According to recent data, Bitcoin miner Marathon (MARA) has accelerated its BTC buying plan, as evidenced by the latest transactions. Arkham data showed that MARA has recently acquired 1300 Bitcoin, worth around $130.66 million, from yesterday, sparking market optimism. Source: Lookonchain, X In addition, the firm made a similar purchase earlier this week, which has further caught the eyes of the investors. For context, earlier this week, the BTC miner acquired another 1423 Bitcoin, valued at around $139.5 million. Notably, this substantial purchasing activity comes just after the BTC miner’s announcement of the successful closure of its second $850 million convertible note offering. According to the firm, the primary aim of this strategic move was to accelerate its Bitcoin acquisition plan, while also partially repurchasing existing notes that are set to mature in 2026. Will BTC Continue To Rally? BTC price today was up over 1% and exchanged hands at $99,531, making a bounce back from the 24-hour low of $97,629. However, the crypto’s trading volume dropped by 32% to $93,57 billion at the same time. The flagship crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $102,039.88, indicating strong market interest amid Marathon’s buying spree. According to CoinGlass data, BTC Futures Open Interest was down 0.5% to $61.25 billion in a 24-hour time frame, while noting a slight rebound in the short term. Considering that, it appears that the investors are once again entering the BTC market after a short-term pause. In addition, Bitcoin whales are also on a buying spree alongside the institutions. According to Ali Martinez, the whales have accumulated 20,000 BTC since yesterday, worth around $2 billion, signaling strong confidence in the asset.

Cardano Set To Take Over — Analyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-days-at-the-top-numbered-cardano-set-to-take-over-analyst/,"The Cardano native token is one of the top-performing digital assets this week and currently trades at $1.13 and $1.23. While its price action pales in comparison to the industry leaders this week, led by Bitcoin and XRP, ADA’s performance relative to other altcoins has still become a source of optimism for many. Related Reading: No Sweat! Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst One market analyst even sees Cardano’s ADA eventually overtaking Dogecoin in the list of top cryptos by market cap. A recent comparative analysis of Cardano and Dogecoin reflects the former’s dominance over the top meme coin. ADA has surged 14% in the last week, while Dogecoin increased by just 7%. And if we’re looking at a higher timeframe, ADA also shows strength and dominance over Dogecoin. Over the last month, ADA is up by 230%, while Dogecoin registered a 116% increase. Can We Expect A Flip? Both Cardano and Dogecoin are in the Top 10 cryptos by market cap, with Dogecoin ranked 7th and Cardano at 8th. Only around $20 billion separates these two top-performing altcoins. And for crypto commentator Dan Gambardello, there’s a strong possibility that Cardano can flip the script in the next few days. Currently, $1.84 $ADA would flip $DOGE. The time is approaching. The event is imminent. pic.twitter.com/yTbcKe91Hc — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 5, 2024 In a Twitter/X post, Gambardello predicted that ADA would surpass Doge and that the time “is approaching and imminent.” Interestingly, after overtaking Cardano this year, DOGE surged past XRP and USDC to become the sixth biggest crypto by market capitalization, with a $69 billion capitalization last month. However, Dogecoin’s market value dropped after hitting a peak of $0.47992. Cardano, on the other hand, is making its move, backed by solid macroeconomic data. Recently, Cardano reached a multi-month high, increasing its market cap to $45.8 billion. Given this bullish surge on Cardano, Gambardello argued that Cardano is poised to overtake Doge. This will happen, according to the analyst, if Cardano reaches $1.84. Cardano Needs Momentum To Hit $1.84 According to Gambardello, $1.84 is the magic number for Cardano to switch the script and top Dogecoin. However, he did not identify a specific timeframe for this price event. With a total supply of $45 billion, an increase to $1.84 will push the token’s market capitalization to $64.63 billion. This value will move ADA past Doge, which sits at $64.3 billion in the current market landscape. Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP? You’re ‘Disrespecting’ Yourself Before making this assertion, the analyst first targeted a price of $3 for ADA. Analysts also shared that Cardano’s version of a bull run will start once it gets attention from institutions looking to offer exchange-traded funds or ETFs, similar to what happened to XRP. At the time of writing, ADA is trading between $1.13 and $1.23, with a market cap of $41.55 billion.

Its growth and involvement in dApps highlight its significance in the current market cycle.

With an anticipated 700% growth by presale end and prospects for massive returns, DOGEN follows the successful paths of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat.

Sometimes the reasons are clear while others they are not. Investors might get confused looking at some random altcoins taking the top positions on trending table. Let’s see which crypto tokens are trending today. EGO Launched just over a year ago, this is an internal token of Paysenger service. The platform helps content creators, fans and brands for content monetization and audience engagement. The EGO token is currently trading at $0.02375 and is down by 6.15% from yesterday. The volume is down by 16.92%. The amazing thing is that the trading volume is just $2.41 million yet this token is trending at first rank on coinmarketcap. Bitcoin To everyone’s surprise BTC is at position two in trending today, despite it crossed $100k and came back. The largest cryptocurrency needs no introduction as the crypto market has its eyes peeled towards it. Currently trading at $99,358, BTC is once again trying to cross the psychological resistance at $100k. It is currently up by 1.44% in price as compared to the last 24 hours despite a fall of 32.23% in trading volume. Altcoins have yet not started to follow the surge of BTC but for sure has displaced it in regards to trending. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Chainlink Price Rally Set to Break $52, Hit New All-Time High Soon , Super Trump Coin People might be wishing this position would be occupied by Ethereum but it has been acquired by a Trump themed meme coin.

For this particular reason, Trump themed memecoins are taking the rally. Super Trump Coin has left all the other altcoins behind and the trading volume has surged by jaw dropping 500% in the last 24 hours.

Launched on Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain Base, this memecoin is trading at $0.2008 and is down by 1.74%. On the other hand, its trading volume is down by 26%. There are only 0.20% investors of Brett holding more than $100k in it. Most investors have invested between $0-$1000. Ethereum The second biggest cryptocurrency got the fifth position. The reason — 9.99% drop in trading volume. Even though Bitcoin successfully made a fresh all time high above $100k, Ethereum failed to break its 3 years old ath at $4891. The price is witnessing some surge as it is up by 2.29% up and trading at $3,982, but that’s not enough for its believers. Looking Ahead! With the crypto market evolving forever, it is no surprise that altcoins, especially memecoins, gain more traction from investors than Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Pseudonymous trader The Flow Horse tells his 247,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s market peak this cycle could come in as early as the first quarter of 2025. “I don’t care what anyone else says. We are far closer to ‘the end for a bit’ than people want to admit. I would say within the first quarter. After big price moves, the chatter often shifts to even bigger moves – multiples of the current price. Ironically, that’s usually a strong signal that we’re nearing the peak. And it’s just one of many indicators pointing in that direction.” He also predicts that alts will explode, outperforming Bitcoin, in the first to second quarter of 2025, closing out the current crypto bull cycle. “As mentioned before, Bitcoin already won. This seems a bit more applicable to alts. I think Bitcoin tops, we get a nice major rotation into alts, and then it’s a wrap. Within one to two quarters seems more reasonable for all of it.” However, other crypto analysts have a much different opinion. Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 748,400 followers that Bitcoin has much more room to the upside based on a decreasing supply on crypto exchanges and increasing market liquidity. “This is one massive difference from the previous cycles. The amount of BTC on exchanges has substantially decreased and keeps decreasing. A supply shock is imminent with a big amount of liquidity being added. This cycle, we’ll go way higher than we all expect.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Rekt Capital tells his 507,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may reach its cycle peak in about a year based on how long it previously took BTC to hit cycle peaks after the halving events when miners’ rewards are cut in half. Bitcoin’s most recent halving event was in mid-April. “In the 2015-2017 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 518 days after the halving. In the 2019-2021 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 546 days after the halving. If history repeats and the next bull market peak occurs 518-546 days after the halving that would mean Bitcoin could peak in this cycle in mid-September or mid-October 2025.” Bitcoin is trading for $99,741 at time of writing.

Could Sacks’ leadership be the turning point the struggling crypto industry needs? Everyone watches closely to see if Sacks can bring the change many believe is necessary. Sacks Highlights Key Issues In a recent tweet on X (formerly Twitter), Sacks pointed to the personal cost of the initiative, stating, “There are too many stories of people being hurt by Operation Choke Point 2.0. It needs to be looked at.” There are too many stories of people being hurt by Operation Choke Point 2.0. It needs to be looked at. https://t.co/IhCdyQfx0g — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) December 7, 2024 Sacks’ concerns followed comments from Chris Lane, the Chief Technology Officer of the now-defunct Silvergate Bank. Lane revealed that regulatory pressures—not market failures—forced the bank into bankruptcy. Lane said, “FTX didn’t kill us; our regulators did,” linking Silvergate’s financial struggles to the fallout from FTX’s collapse in November 2022. Sacks Promises to Bring Change! As a key figure in the cryptocurrency space, Sacks has committed to investigating and exposing the actions behind Operation Choke Point 2.0. His involvement has given crypto enthusiasts and industry leaders hope, as many believe he can play a role in reducing harmful regulations. During his campaign, Trump pledged to put an end to Operation Choke Point 2.0 to create a fairer environment for cryptocurrency companies. His appointment of Sacks signals that this stance will likely remain a priority, with many seeing Sacks as a way to shift government policy toward more crypto-friendly regulations. Coinbase’s Push for Transparency Amid these discussions, Coinbase is digging into claims of government bias against the crypto industry. The company recently received 23 heavily redacted letters from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which suggest that banks were discouraged from offering crypto-related services unless given explicit guidance. This raises the possibility that Operation Choke Point 2.0 might be larger and more far-reaching than originally thought. . @DavidSacks is a great pick! It's incredible to think what is possible with sharp, pro-tech, pro-business people in government. https://t.co/ub5gFikmzE — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 6, 2024 As the investigation into these practices continues, all eyes are on David Sacks to lead efforts against what many view as unfair rules targeting crypto companies.

In his recent Bloomberg op-ed on December 6, Dudley said that adopting Bitcoin as a reserve currency would bring no real advantages and would mostly benefit current Bitcoin holders pushing for this proposal. After Dudley’s comments, Bitcoin’s price dropped by 4.31% to $98,854, having recently peaked at a record high of $104,000. While Dudley acknowledged Bitcoin’s ability to transfer money without intermediaries, he emphasized that its extreme volatility makes it a poor choice as a stable reserve fund. Bitcoin Act of 2024: A Risky Proposal? Dudley’s comments are a direct response to the Bitcoin Act of 2024 , introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis . The bill proposes creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and implementing transparency measures for managing BTC holdings. Some supporters see this bill as a way to push Bitcoin into mainstream global finance, but others, including Dudley, see it as a risky move. Dudley warned that adopting this bill could drive up Bitcoin’s price without benefiting the government or economy. He also raised concerns about the absence of a clear exit strategy. According to him, this could leave the U.S. government stuck with volatile assets that generate no income. Economic Risks to Consider Dudley provided a detailed economic analysis to back his concerns. He pointed out that even a 2% allocation of global investment portfolios—estimated at around $250 trillion—would push Bitcoin’s price to an astounding $250,000 per coin. If the U.S. government increased this allocation to 4%, Bitcoin’s price could double, creating a speculative bubble that could destabilize global markets. His analysis highlighted the risks of Bitcoin’s volatility, arguing that the market could experience dangerous instability. Let’s Focus on Regulation Instead Rather than promoting Bitcoin as a reserve currency, Dudley urged the Trump administration to focus on regulating the crypto industry. He suggested ensuring that stablecoins are fully backed by U.S. treasury bills, as issuers often claim. Additionally, Dudley emphasized the need for strong consumer protection laws to fight fraud and scams, which have undermined investor confidence in the crypto market. “Strong guardrails” are necessary, Dudley said. Without clear regulations, cryptocurrencies risk remaining unstable and vulnerable to misuse, limiting their benefits to the financial system.

On Saturday, on-chain data signaled that the whale spent roughly $21 million to heavily accumulate the abovementioned coins. As a result, crypto market watchers expect further gains in these coins amid a broader bullish Q4 landscape. Crypto Whale Heavily Bags Pepe Coin, AERO, & FTM Igniting Optimism According to the latest data by Spot on Chain , a crypto whale recently spent 420 WSTETH, worth $2 million, to buy 1.47M FTM in a single transaction. However, this was not the only trade placed by this trader. Per the data, the whale spent nearly $19 million to make other token accumulations over the past few days. Notably, the whale bought 531.7 billion PEPE, worth $11.04 million, boasting a $292K profit on this holding. Further, the same whale purchased 4.55 million Fantom (FTM), worth $5.83 million, boasting a $353K profit on Fantom holdings. Simultaneously, the whale bagged 1.37 million AERO, worth $2.14 million, a few days ago and now holds a profit of $830K on this investment. Overall, these massive purchases have ignited an optimistic torrent among investors surrounding the coins’ future movements, underlining increased market interest. Further, it’s also noteworthy that the whale’s decision not to sell his holdings has solidified investors’ bullish sentiments. How Are These Crypto Performing? At the time of reporting, FTM price soared nearly 1.5% to reach $1.350. Its intraday low and high were registered as $1.263 and $1.369, respectively. The coin soars in tandem with the massive buying pressure brought by the abovementioned crypto whale. However, Pepe Coin price slipped roughly 3.5% intraday and is currently resting at $0.00002129. The meme coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00002044 and $0.00002225, respectively. Besides, the monthly chart for the crypto shows gains of over 50%, indicating further pump imminent in light of the abovementioned buying. Also, AERO price surged nearly 17% intraday and is currently sitting at $2.201. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $1.870 and $2.253, respectively. The crypto soars in tandem with the colossal purchase and a bullish Q4. In turn, market participants continue to expect further gains in the abovementioned coins’ prices amid recent developments. A PEPE price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the coin’s price could double ahead, with a major breakout of 80-100% looming. This bullish projection falls in line with heightened market interest as the year ends. Simultaneously, another report revealed that the crypto exchange giant Binance commenced AEROUSDT futures trading. This enhanced offering has added to market optimism surrounding the token’s future movements.

According to its annual report published on December 6, the council highlighted that the assets lack the needed risk management standard which could open them to certain risks in the market. FSOC notes that these risks pose direct threats to financial stability. In the report , FSOC noted that these potential risks will remain because stablecoins cannot adopt the important risk management standards. Aside from this, the body also blamed the lack of legislative oversight, which could have helped to check these risks. FSOC, therefore, called on federal legislators to create a regulatory framework that will curb these risks. The body also highlighted the need for extending regulations into the wider crypto market, stating that it will help their integration with the traditional market and institutional interest. FSOC reiterates its concerns about the stablecoin market Over the last few years, FSOC has always shown displeasure at the way the stablecoin market is heavily concentrated. The body, in its current report, highlighted that only a single entity controls about 70% of the total market value of the sector. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the entire market capitalization of the stablecoin sector is roughly over $205 billion, with Tether holding a larger chunk of $136 billion, which amounts to 66.3% of the entire figure. Although the report failed to finger any firm, it highlighted the consequences of a single firm’s market dominance. It highlighted that if this happens, the firm’s potential failure could cause disruptions to the crypto industry, causing related effects in the traditional finance industry. For some months now, investors have been uneasy about the lack of third-party audits in Tether’s activities. While investor concerns continue to mount, there are fears that the firm could face liquidity issues like FTX in the future. In 2022, stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) encountered a mishap after it unstacked $2 billion, leading to its unpegging from the US dollar. The token’s value, which was supposed to be 1:1 with the dollar, dropped to $0.09. FSOC claimed that while most stablecoins are required to submit to regular checks by state regulators, most of them provide small verifiable information about their operations and reserve management practices. The body claims that the practice increases the likelihood of fraud and poses a challenge to market discipline. FSOC sees a stablecoin law as the only way out In devising a way out of this predicament, the FSOC suggested that the government needs to come up with a federal regulation. “The Council recommends that Congress pass legislation creating a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers to address run risk, payment system risks, market integrity, and investor and consumer protections,” the council said. However, it notes that if no action is taken it would consider taking one of its own. Meanwhile, FSOC also discussed the increased crypto integration in the traditional finance sector, drumming up the need for more regulatory oversight. It claimed that while the crypto’s market value at $2 trillion is still modest compared to traditional finance, products like ETFs have increased investor accessibility. The value of exchange-traded products has pushed into the $80 billion region, following their approvals this year. The FSOC also talked about the increased risk that the growth of ETFs poses to investors in the industry. The report revealed several regulatory lapses yet to be tackled in the spot market, including fraud and market manipulation. To remove these risks, FSOC wants to grant federal regulators power to oversee crypto products that are not securities. Without removing the transformative potential of these assets, FSOC wants a balanced approach that will safeguard investors and support innovation.

Rise in Solana Token Creation Drives Record Protocol Growth As the protocol behind virtually all token creation on Solana, Metaplex has emerged as a primary beneficiary of the extraordinary surge in digital asset creation on the Solana network. This exponential level of activity, encompassing everything from memecoins to AI tokens and NFTs, directly contributes to Metaplex’s protocol fees. This increased protocol fee generation has in turn funded record-breaking $MPLX token purchases for the Metaplex DAO. Since June 2024, 50% of the prior month’s protocol fees and a portion of the historical fees have been allocated to funding $MPLX token purchases for contribution to the DAO. In November 2024, this culminated in 12k SOL worth of $MPLX purchases — equivalent to approximately $3 million at current prices, marking a substantial 58% increase month-over-month and signifying the largest monthly $MPLX token purchases to date. Building on this momentum, Metaplex’s November protocol fees hit an all-time high of $3.5 million, setting the stage for even larger allocations for $MPLX purchases in December. Record-Breaking Metaplex Protocol Metrics in November November’s protocol activity shattered previous records across multiple metrics: Metaplex saw extraordinary growth in fungible token creation, with 1.4M new tokens minted — marking a 56% increase month-over-month compared to the previous all-time high in October 2024 and a new monthly record. This represented 94% of all Token Metadata assets created, driven primarily by memecoin activity on platforms such as Pump.fun. Metaplex Core, the next generation NFT standard, demonstrated significant adoption with a new all-time high of 354k assets created , driven by expanded use cases made possible due to the standard’s flexible design. User engagement metrics surged as the number of unique wallets interacting with the Metaplex protocol reached 879k — a 34% increase from October and a new all-time high. The protocol’s total collector base expanded to nearly 60 million unique wallets, growing by over 860k in November alone. About the Metaplex Protocol Metaplex is the leading decentralized protocol on Solana and SVM, providing tools and programs for developers and creators to build decentralized applications that use digital assets. With a growing user base and a commitment to innovation, Metaplex is empowering the next wave of decentralized finance and commerce. About the Metaplex Foundation The Metaplex Foundation is a Cayman Islands non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the development and growth of the Metaplex Protocol. By providing open-source tools and resources, the Foundation empowers developers, creators, and users worldwide to participate in a decentralized and inclusive digital economy.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto Investment to Make Right Now,https://thecoinrise.com/cant-believe-you-hesitated-on-binance-qubetics-is-the-best-crypto-investment-to-make-right-now/,"Binance (BNB) has become a hallmark of success within the cryptocurrency industry, exemplifying the immense potential of early-stage investments. Those who participated in its ICO witnessed extraordinary returns, showcasing the transformative power of strategic foresight. However, hindsight often serves as a reminder of opportunities missed. As Binance continues to solidify its position as a leading force in the crypto market, the question naturally arises: What will be the next significant opportunity to capture the spotlight? That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) comes in. Dubbed the best crypto investment of 2024 , Qubetics offers cutting-edge tech and real-world utility through its QubeQode IDE. With the presale in its 11th stage, this might just be your second chance at life-changing gains. Qubetics: Why It’s the Best Crypto Investment Right Now Qubetics is rewriting the rules of blockchain development with its QubeQode IDE . Imagine a world where you don’t need to be a coding wizard to create blockchain applications. QubeQode’s drag-and-drop interface makes blockchain accessible to everyone, from tech startups to mom-and-pop shops. Take a small bakery owner, for example. Using QubeQode, they could create a customer rewards system on the blockchain without hiring expensive developers. Or picture a freelance designer who tokenises their work to sell it globally with just a few clicks. Qubetics is making blockchain not just easy but indispensable. The $TICS presale is currently at $0.0282, with a price hike imminent. For just $500, you could grab 17,730 tokens today, which analysts predict could be worth $88,650 when $TICS hits $5. Compare that to Binance’s current price, and it’s clear why Qubetics is the best crypto investment for 2024. Binance: The King of the Crypto Jungle Binance wasn’t always the behemoth it is today. Launched in 2017, its ICO price was just $0.12. Fast forward to now, and BNB trades in the hundreds, making early investors millionaires. Binance’s secret sauce? A combination of high-speed transactions, low fees, and an ever-expanding ecosystem that includes everything from DeFi to NFTs. Today, BNB is more than a coin; it’s a cornerstone of the crypto world. But even giants have hurdles. Binance faced regulatory scrutiny in multiple countries, and while it has emerged stronger, some investors remain cautious about its future. Analysts predict BNB could hit $800 by 2025, but its high entry price makes it less accessible for small investors. For those who missed Binance’s early days, the search for a more affordable yet equally promising investment has led to Qubetics. Grab This Chance Before It’s Gone Binance built an empire, but Qubetics is building bridges. Its QubeQode IDE democratises blockchain, enabling businesses and individuals to leverage its power without the steep learning curve. Unlike Binance, which largely benefits traders and institutional players, Qubetics caters to everyday users, bringing blockchain into daily life. Missing Binance’s ICO felt like a gut punch, but you don’t have to feel that way again. Qubetics is here, offering a presale price that’s within reach and a vision that’s set to revolutionise blockchain. The best crypto investment isn’t about looking back; it’s about seizing the future. Don’t wait— grab $TICS before it’s too late .

Market analysts say that while the journey to make huge profits is never guaranteed, several top altcoins and platforms are worthwhile investments due to their growth potential. Among them are Ripple (XRP) and FXGuys ($FXG) . Each of them offers exclusive opportunities in the bullish market. Read on to discover why $FXG, a presale cryptocurrency, is generating buzz in the market! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Ripple’s XRP Targets $6 With a New Prediction Amid Bull Market Momentum XRP has been among the notable winners in the current crypto bull market with its massive growth since the start of November 2024. With the exponential upside momentum, analysts believe Ripple’s XRP will continue rising. One analyst, Jacob Canfield, highlighted a notable difference in XRP’s recent move compared to its 2017 rally. With Bitcoin’s (BTC) price five times higher in 2024, Canfield used his Fibonacci extensions to estimate XRP’s possible target at h 11.09 extension. This target translates to about $6.60—double the token’s previous all-time high. The analyst believes this is a realistic FOMO target and cautioned against expecting double-digit prices and beyond. Canfield projected that the Ripple coin might encounter resistance between $2.75 and $3.00, resulting in a pullback to liquidate leveraged longs. Ripple’s XRP was trading at $2.52 on December 4, 2024, up 82% in the past week. Experts say the Ripple coin will rise to $3.38 this month as more developments are implemented on the Ripple network. Although XRP is expected to keep thriving, investors are also buying $FXG, a lucrative DeFi coin dominating the market. $FXG: A Presale Cryptocurrency Dominating the Bull Market As the bull market continues to intensify, analysts and investors are always on the lookout for the next lucrative investment opportunity in the crypto space. As many tokens surge, FXGuys remains unrivaled as the next coin to target for profit. Despite being a presale cryptocurrency, $FXG has massive growth potential that outpaces XRP and other established tokens. $FXG is a great solution for investors aiming to stabilize their portfolios as the market grows increasingly volatile. While XRP records huge profits, the DeFi coin has quickly become a breakout star, dominating the DeFi and PropFi sectors. While other tokens have seen their bull runs short-lived since they ride on hype, FXGuys has long-term growth momentum since its underlying concept blends PropFi, DeFi technology, and online trading. The FXGuys Trade2Earn program offers users $FXG tokens for all executed trades. The feature has increased $FXG’s popularity in this bull cycle, attracting investors in its presale phase and accelerating its adoption rate. Moreover, investors can easily stake their $FXG tokens to unleash an impressive 20% profit and revenue share from investor trading activities. Through the staking concept, FXGuys users will enjoy a double-digit annual percentage yield (APY). Thus, the massive growth potential has enhanced $FXG’s utility and user base, guaranteeing that its presale sells out rapidly. On the other hand, the FX Guys Trader Funding Program has become an appealing feature for retail traders who seek huge profits but do not have enough capital to invest. Skilled and talented traders can access many funded accounts, providing up to $500,000 in trading capital. These accounts have adopted an 80/20 profit-sharing strategy, which favors the traders. Thus, the concept considerably lowers the entry barriers for skilled traders without capital but ready to use their skills to increase profits on the platform. With all these features, investors are rushing to buy the project’s presale token thanks to its long-term growth potential. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE $FXG: The Next Big DeFi Coin – Analysts Predict Massive Growth Potential! Analysts recommend Ripple (XRP) and FXGuys ($FXG) as top options in the crypto market to help increase profits in investors’ portfolios. Special attention goes to FXGuys due to its advanced features and technology. Currently, $FXG is in Stage 2 of its public presale, with the tokens selling at $0.04 each.

Meanwhile, Ethereum also surged above $4000 and is trying hard to secure the levels that could push the prices towards a new ATH. This could be the reason why the XRP price remained bullish in the long term, although the short-term price action indicated a more than 10% drop. Now that the price has begun with a steep recovery, will the XRP price reach $3, forming new highs for the year before the yearend? After marking the interim lows around $2.18, the price rebounded, preventing excess price drain but is yet to trigger a strong upswing. As the volume remains largely still, the probability of a strong rise remains aloof. Meanwhile, the recent rebound indicates there is more room for the bulls to thrive, indicating XRP could be gearing up for a 25% in the next fortnight followed by a 40% upswing in the first few weeks of 2025. The current trade setup of XRP suggests the token has become highly volatile as the Bollinger bands stand expanded and the price remains stuck to the upper bands. Besides, the RSI remains within the overbought range, suggesting the bulls continue to hold a tight grip over the rally. Therefore, the price is expected to rise above 1 FIB at $2.9 this weekend and later head towards the next target at $3.5 at 1.2 FIB before the end of 2024. Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD was set to lauch, which was built to enhance the cross-border payments along with XRP. The rounds of launch had set the XRP price on fire; meanwhile, a delay has caused the price to face a small downturn. The launch is set to happen before 2025, which suggests an XRP price rally is also incoming. The nominal volume ranges between $1 and $2 billion, but now the range between $14 billion and $16 billion has become the new normal This suggests that market participants, bulls, whales, and institutions are extremely vigilant, and a small push beyond $2.8 may trigger the XRP price rally to $5.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 08:40:46

Analysts highlight its staking app and potential price surge after exchange listing. Table of Contents Why ClayBro says STARS can 10X in two weeks Crypto All-Stars lets meme coin holders generate long-term passive income Secure STARS for the altcoin season The Crypto All-Stars (STARS) presale is on a roll. After hitting the $9 million total raised mark, a prominent analyst has published a viral deep dive on the project, tipping it for huge gains once it lists on exchanges. Crypto All-Stars has cultivated a strong reputation among traders and analysts for its innovative meme coin staking application, which is expected to launch once the presale ends. Investors can buy STARS at presale for $0.0016782, but this is the last chance to buy at a fixed price. STARS will launch on exchanges once the presale ends in 14 days. Those who buy after that may need to pay a much higher premium. So don’t leave it to chance. Act now and participate in this promising project from the ground up. Why ClayBro says STARS can 10X in two weeks ClayBro is a popular crypto analyst with over 130K YouTube subscribers. In a recent video, the high-profile expert said that Crypto All-Stars could be the next meme coin to provide 10x gains. But why? ClayBro highlighted that the Crypto All-Stars presale funding is growing exponentially, signaling a deep market appetite that will translate to continued demand once it launches on exchanges. “Doing between $500,000 and $1 million per day, Crypto All-Stars is finally catching on fire. I am extremely excited about what’s going to happen. This could be one of the top meme coins to buy now,” he said. ClayBro also underlined the significant media spotlight that Crypto All-Stars is getting, even being dubbed a “top meme coin” on high-ranking Google search results. And it’s not just a hype job. There’s real substance driving excitement surrounding Crypto All-Stars . For the first time ever, it’s giving the meme coin sector a means of utility. You might also like: Memecoin prices soar as Crypto All-Stars hits $2m in presale Crypto All-Stars lets meme coin holders generate long-term passive income MemeVault and STARS staking offer users ways to generate passive income on meme coins. Beginning with MemeVault, users can lock up 11 of the top meme coins, including Dogecoin , Shiba Inu , and Pepe, to earn passive STARS rewards. For many of the tokens supported, this is the first time holders can use them for anything other than buying and selling. But there’s a kicker: users must hold STARS to access the platform, and their rewards are tied to how much they have. This means that all those meme coin holders who are hungry for passive rewards must accumulate as much STARS as possible. It’s a setup geared toward bolstering demand and price potential. Users can also stake their STARS tokens to maximize their rewards. STARS staking is live amid the presale and currently providing a 245% APY, but this will decrease as the staking pool grows. 25% of the total STARS supply is allocated to presale staking rewards, while 20% is allocated to the presale, 20% to marketing, 10% to exchange liquidity, and 25% to the MemeVault ecosystem. Secure STARS for the altcoin season The Crypto All-Stars presale is ending in 14 days, just in time for the upcoming altcoin season. Altcoin prices have begun to outperform Bitcoin’s this month, reflecting a shift in market dynamics where traders rotate capital into smaller cryptocurrencies to generate more gains. This, in turn, sends the prices of altcoins soaring. For perspective, Bitcoin has risen 32% this month, while Dogecoin has soared by over 100%. Many smaller altcoins have risen even more. Last cycle, once we entered ""Altcoin Season"" territory, we stayed there for 88 days. So far this run, we've only been there for 5 days. The biggest gains come the longer we stay in this zone. This is only the warm up. pic.twitter.com/GZAGy2Ezuz — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) December 5, 2024 Crypto All-Stars is emerging on the market at just the right time, but the window for taking advantage is closing. Traders can buy STARS via the project’s website or by using the Best Wallet app, which can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play Store .

37325688,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624151,1733561675,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37325688.jpeg,White House Crypto Czar David Sacks will investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-czar-investigate-choke-point/,"David Sacks, the White House’s Crypto and AI Czar, is stepping into the storm surrounding Operation Choke Point 2.0, a program that crypto insiders say has sabotaged businesses, wiped out innovation, and gutted the industry’s financial lifelines. In a public statement, David hinted at immediate scrutiny, saying , “There are too many stories of people being hurt by Operation Choke Point 2.0. It needs to be looked at.” His statement came after Chris Lane, former CTO of Silvergate Bank, publicly detailed how regulatory moves destroyed the bank, a once-vital player in the crypto economy. “FTX didn’t kill us. Regulators did,” he wrote, explaining how the bank was driven out of business despite surviving a 70% deposit run after the FTX collapse. Silvergate had been instrumental in creating the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a crucial infrastructure for crypto transactions. But according to Chris, U.S. regulators pulled the rug from under them in early 2023, severely limiting the dollar deposits Silvergate could accept from crypto clients. The bank had no choice but to shut down and liquidate. This sudden pivot from regulators, described by Chris as a “bait and switch,” has become a rallying cry for those who see Operation Choke Point 2.0 as a deliberate move to suffocate the crypto industry. Crypto executives speak out Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano and Ethereum, called Operation Choke Point 2.0 a “coordinated global campaign against crypto.” He took to X (formerly Twitter) to decry the program’s fallout, saying it has crushed businesses, stifled economies, and slowed innovation worldwide. “This isn’t just an American problem,” he wrote. “So many people put their heads in the sand, saying it’s not as bad as the industry makes it out to be. It’s worse. Global. So many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed.” Charles warned that the damage from this crackdown could take years to undo. He urged the crypto community to act quickly to push for legislation, saying, “We have a small window of time to get a law passed.” Gabriel Abed, chairman of Binance and a prominent figure in global crypto circles, revealed how he was personally targeted. First Citizens Caribbean Bank shut down his accounts, which he had held for over a decade, because of a bitcoin-related deposit. The bank’s CEO admitted the closure was to protect its relationships with U.S. correspondent banks, which had labeled crypto businesses as “high-risk.” Biden administration accused of reviving Choke Point Crypto leaders are pointing fingers at the Biden administration, accusing it of resurrecting Operation Choke Point . The original program, launched in 2013 under the Obama administration, pressured banks to sever ties with industries deemed “high-risk,” such as payday lenders and firearms dealers. Crypto execs believe that legitimate businesses were being unfairly targeted. While the program officially ended in 2017, crypto insiders claim its successor began in 2021, this time with blockchain companies in its sights. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been one of the most vocal. He accused Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler of orchestrating the crackdown. “This was one of the most unethical and un-American things that happened in the Biden administration,” Brian said. He revealed that Coinbase has filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover the extent of government involvement. Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini , also weighed in, saying he was “debanked because I’m in crypto.” Tyler confirmed that over 30 tech founders were similarly targeted, many from firms backed by Andreessen Horowitz. “This is about control, not compliance,” said Marc Andreessen , a venture capitalist and another debanked tech founder. He argued that this operation goes beyond crypto, framing it as an attack on individual freedom. The stakes are high for the Democrats, who Brian said the crackdown was “a major factor in them losing the election,” calling Warren “a liability” for the party. A financial crisis for the crypto industry Andrew Torba, founder of Gab, described how Operation Choke Point 2.0 has effectively choked businesses to death. “Without a bank account, you can’t store cash, run payroll, or pay bills,” he said. His accounts were repeatedly shut down by banks, credit unions, and even Christian financial institutions. “The reason was always the same: ‘Our terms say we can do this anytime, for any reason, or no reason at all.’” Banks have admitted off the record that they are being pressured by the government, with threats of audits and regulatory scrutiny looming over their heads. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, has also found herself in the crosshairs. Her bank has been debanked multiple times, prompting her to sue the Federal Reserve. Her lawsuit, which will see oral arguments just a day after Inauguration Day, has been described as one of the most “significant” legal challenges against government overreach in the banking sector. The fallout from Operation Choke Point 2.0 is a reminder of how quickly an entire industry can be brought to its knees when financial access is weaponized. Whether Sacks can bring clarity — or justice — remains to be seen.

Ethereum remains the leading altcoin in the crypto market. The analyst expects newer altcoins to outperform Ethereum in 2025. A crypto analyst on the Altcoin Daily podcast has named several altcoins he expects to perform well during the 2025 bull run. In a recent video, the analyst shared his predictions and explained why these cryptocurrencies could be top choices for investors in 2024. According to the analyst, Ethereum continues to lead the altcoin market, driven by its demand among influential figures like incoming U.S. President Donald Trump and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Notably, the analyst pointed out that Trump owns more Ethereum than Bitcoin.

With whispers of potential gains reaching 10,000%, this token could overshadow popular picks like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets this coin apart? Many are eager to see if it becomes the next breakout in the crypto market. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump’s victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump’s love for crypto is no secret — he’s promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign. And joining him is none other than Elon Musk , the ultimate Dogecoin (DOGE) fan who’s backed the crypto movement and even aligned with Republicans earlier this year. With these two icons fueling the fire, meme coins are set for a wild ride! DOGE Soars 130% in Just One Week! DOGEN will be the Next Star with 500% Surge Following the US election results, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a steady rise: from $0.15 to $0.39 in just one week . DOGEN follows the same upward trend, starting at $0.0003 and now trading at $0.0011, a staggering 300% leap . With a total of 13 presale stages, DOGEN is set to rise to $0.0019 by the token generation event (TGE), which represents a 500% increase from its initial price. Like it DOGE style?

Live the high life you deserve: luxury cars, stacks of cash , and unforgettable experiences await those who go all-in on DOGEN. Don’t settle for ordinary when you can have it all! Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, it has no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially seen as a “memecoin,” Dogecoin’s value surged in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This was driven by social media influence, especially from Elon Musk, and the general crypto market boom. Dogecoin’s large supply and active community contribute to its popularity. In the current market cycle, its attractiveness depends on market trends and investor sentiment toward meme-based assets. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. SHIB’s use of Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for NFTs and decentralized governance. This integration could give SHIB broader utility in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s potential depends on its continued development and adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem. Conclusion In the current bull run, DOGE and SHIB may offer less short-term potential. DOGEN, crafted for those pursuing luxury and success, is set for 700% growth by the presale’s end, with chances for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following the success of tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN is building a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Popcat In October 2020, the internet was charmed by a simple yet hilarious meme featuring a cat named Oatmeal. Two images, one with Oatmeal’s mouth closed and another edited to form an ‘O’ shape, captured hearts worldwide. Now, this beloved meme has pounced into the cryptocurrency scene as the POPCAT token. Unlike serious coins, POPCAT is a meme coin meant purely for fun, with no inherent value or financial promises. It’s the digital embodiment of Oatmeal’s quirky expressions, offering a lighthearted twist to crypto enthusiasts. In the midst of a volatile market, POPCAT stands out not for its tech but for its entertainment value. While traditional investors eye coins with strong fundamentals, meme coins like POPCAT thrive on community engagement and internet culture. They’re reminiscent of other meme coins like Dogecoin, which started as a joke but gained immense popularity. If you’re looking to inject some fun into your crypto experience, POPCAT might be the perfect choice. However, in a market driven by trends and memes, it’s essential to enjoy the ride without serious financial expectations. SPX6900 In the digital age, numbers on a screen can wield more power than gold. Enter SPX6900, a meme token born from the depths of internet culture. Its mission? To surpass the S&P 500 by reaching an astonishing $69 trillion market cap. The logic is playful yet bold: since 6900 is vastly superior to 500, SPX6900 must be infinitely better than any traditional financial instrument. This whimsical thesis captures the spirit of SPX6900 as it embarks on a journey toward financial domination, powered by the sheer belief that bigger numbers make better investments. SPX6900 taps into the energy of meme culture, blending humor with ambition. Its potential lies in its ability to rally a community around a shared joke with serious aspirations. In the current market, meme coins have shown surprising momentum, with examples like Dogecoin capturing global attention. SPX6900 stands out by aiming higher—much higher. For investors looking to ride the next big wave, SPX6900 offers an attractive proposition. It embraces the trend where fun and finance meet, suggesting that in today’s market, the power of a good meme could be the key to unlocking unprecedented growth. Conclusion With the bull run underway, POPCAT, SPX6900, and XYZVerse show strong potential; XYZVerse unites sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth.

37326432,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624163,1733563339,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37326432.jpeg,“Bitcoin beats the dollar forever” – MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor shares investment strategy,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-beats-dollar-forever-microstrategys/,"MicroStrategy’s executive chairman Michael Saylor has spent the past four years hammering one message home: buy Bitcoin and never sell it. As Bitcoin shattered the $100,000 milestone for the first time this week, Saylor took the opportunity to double down on his aggressive investment strategy. “Every day for the past four years, I’ve said buy Bitcoin, don’t sell the Bitcoin. I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at the top forever,” he told Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton. His approach is brutally straightforward: convert spare capital into Bitcoin, hold it long-term, and ignore the noise. “Just keep buying Bitcoin,” Saylor said . He emphasized treating Bitcoin as a long-term capital asset, perfect for money you won’t need for at least four years—or better yet, ten. Dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin quarterly and sweeping long-term savings into the crypto is Saylor’s go-to move, regardless of short-term volatility. “Don’t get worked up over the swings,” he said. MicroStrategy has evidently taken this philosophy to the extreme, transforming itself into what Saylor calls a “Bitcoin treasury company.” Since 2020, the company has been on a relentless buying spree, turning heads and dividing Wall Street. Bitcoin breaks records, but MicroStrategy stumbles Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $103,992 on December 4, a moment that crypto enthusiasts had long anticipated. MicroStrategy’s stock MSTR , which many view as a proxy for Bitcoin, also surged that day, reaching a peak of $543. But the celebration was short-lived. By the next morning, MicroStrategy’s stock plummeted 28%, closing at $406. It dropped another 4.8% on Thursday, leaving investors questioning the strategy. MicroStrategy’s market value hinges on its Bitcoin holdings, but its stock doesn’t always move in tandem with Bitcoin. Right now, the company’s shares trade at 2.3 times the value of its Bitcoin stash, a drop from the 3.4X multiple it boasted in November. For bullish investors, this is a disappointment. Many hoped the stock would trade at a much higher premium, even reaching double digits. Despite the volatility, MicroStrategy’s performance this year has been nothing short of dramatic. Its stock has skyrocketed 512% year-to-date, dwarfing Coinbase’s 84% gain and Robinhood’s 205% rise. Yet, those numbers pale compared to Bitcoin’s recent surge. Investors betting on MicroStrategy to outperform Bitcoin were left hanging. Critics argue the stock doesn’t provide the same upside as Bitcoin itself. Traders have also piled into leveraged MicroStrategy ETFs, amplifying both gains and losses. JPMorgan said earlier this week that leveraged ETFs have become a popular but risky way to bet on the company’s fortunes. Trump’s victory fuels Bitcoin’s rise The crypto market got a fat boost after Donald Trump’s November 5 election win. The president-elect’s crypto-friendly policies, including his decision to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, sent Bitcoin soaring past $100,000. Atkins has a track record of supporting digital assets, and his appointment has been widely interpreted as a green light for Bitcoin-friendly regulations. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy wasn’t always a Bitcoin powerhouse. The company originally sold business analytics software. That changed in 2020 when Saylor began pouring company cash into Bitcoin. Since then, the firm has pivoted entirely, branding itself as a bridge between traditional capital markets and the crypto economy. “Our job is to connect the two worlds,” Saylor said in a recent CNBC interview. This hasn’t come without risks. While Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins appeals to Saylor, it hasn’t insulated MicroStrategy from criticism. Nearly 20 million Bitcoins have already been mined, leaving only 5% of the total supply remaining. Saylor sees this scarcity as a major advantage, predicting 50% annual returns for the cryptocurrency. But skeptics question whether MicroStrategy can sustain its strategy . MicroStrategy has increased its Bitcoin holdings by 60% since September 30. The firm’s average cost per Bitcoin has risen to $58,000, up from $39,000 earlier this year. It should be noted that MicroStrategy bought fewer than 9,000 Bitcoins in 2022 when prices were low but ramped up its purchases as prices soared to record levels. Saylor brushed off these concerns in an interview with Barron’s . “People think you’re going to dilute them, but our plan is to accrete them,” he said. The company measures this accretion using a metric it calls Bitcoin “yield.” While not a yield in the traditional sense, it reflects the increase in Bitcoin held per share. This year, Bitcoin per 1,000 shares has jumped from 0.9 to 1.5, a 60% gain. Volatility has been both a challenge and an opportunity. MicroStrategy’s stock is about 10 times as volatile as the S&P 500 , according to Saylor. This volatility has allowed the company to issue convertible debt at attractive terms, including a zero interest rate and a high conversion price of $672—a 55% premium to its current market price. And analysts remain bullish. Bloomberg claims that all eight firms covering MicroStrategy have issued buy ratings, a sign of continued confidence in Saylor’s strategy. “You don’t need to understand how we do it. You just need to hold your Bitcoin and let us drive the price up,” he has said.

However, while this milestone has generated optimism among investors, market metrics indicate potential risks of profit-taking and corrections. Related Reading: Ethereum Crosses $3,800: Is The ‘God Candle’ Nearing? Analysts Weigh In Another Major Correction Incoming? A CryptoQuant analyst known as ShayanBTC has recently shared insights into Ethereum’s futures market behavior, highlighting a key indicator that suggests caution might be warranted. According to the analyst, Ethereum’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, a critical metric for analyzing market sentiment, has shown a substantial increase in sell-side activity. This development aligns with Ethereum’s approach to the $4,000 resistance level. The metric, which measures the aggressiveness of buyers versus sellers in futures markets, reveals that sellers increasingly dominate trades as the price edges upward. Shayan disclosed that Ethereum’s futures market participants appear to be locking in profits or preparing for a potential price correction. The Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has reached its lowest point in several months, indicating that market participants are leaning toward a risk-off stance. This trend suggests that the aggressive futures market sell orders could slow Ethereum’s upward momentum, paving the way for a potential pullback or consolidation phase. The analyst particularly wrote: The drop in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio implies a possible slowdown in upward price movement as more market participants take a risk-off approach. This aligns with anticipating a price pullback or a correction phase, making it crucial for traders to monitor the futures market for further developments. What Next For Ethereum? At the time of writing, Ethereum still hovers above $$4,000, up by 3.1% in the past day. This price increase has boosted ETH’s market cap above $482 billion as of today and its daily trading volume to roughly $56.7 billion. Notably, the drop in the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio highlighted by Shayan reflects an overall cautious sentiment among futures market participants, often a precursor to heightened market volatility.

If confirmed, Crenshaw would serve on the commission through 2029. But if not, former President Donald Trump could seize the opportunity to nominate an alternative. Crenshaw, known for his closeness to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, has been a strong advocate for stricter climate reporting regulations during his tenure and has consistently opposed cryptocurrency initiatives, including voting against approving Bitcoin ETFs. His opposition to Bitcoin Spot ETFs in particular has garnered a lot of attention. After the SEC approved a series of rule changes that would allow Bitcoin-based products to be traded on national exchanges, Crenshaw issued a strongly worded statement opposing the move. He called the decision “unsound and anachronistic,” arguing that it undermines the SEC’s duty to protect investors. Related News: In Light of the Bull Rally, the Crypto Community's Top 20 Altcoins of Interest in the Last Week Revealed “The ETPs that will be activated by today’s decision are inextricably tied to the Bitcoin spot markets,” Crenshaw said at the time, adding: “The fraud and manipulation that impacts the spot BTC price will almost certainly impact the spot BTC price held in ETPs.

Chainlink whale activity soars by 1,219%, driving LINK’s price growth Chainlink recorded an increase of 1,219% in whale activity on December 2, 2024, with these transactions hitting $858.08 million. This coincided with a 31% price growth, bringing LINK to trade above $24. Interestingly, the token has gained over 35%, highlighting strong market momentum. Whale activity indicates considerable buying and selling, which affects the price of the token. IntoTheBlock data suggests that whales are accumulating LINK and capitalizing on the price rally. The massive activity highlights investor confidence in Chainlink’s growing ecosystem. Chainlink has continued to grow via high-profile collaborations with reputable entities like Swift, Euroclear, and Brazil’s central bank, which leverage Chainlink for its CBDC project. These advancements show Chainlink’s integral role in blending AI, oracles, and blockchain technology across the financial markets. LINK was valued at $24.11 on December 6, up 36.29% in the past week. Analysts say LINK will rise to $29 this month as more whales accumulate the token. As LINK shows massive growth potential, investors are turning to a new $0.12 DeFi coin that could deliver your annual income in a month. Ethereum Eyes $4,000 with growing whale activity and bullish sentiment Ethereum’s ETH is around 18% below its all-time high, recording the potential to surpass $4,000 for the first time in nine months. The main drivers include a growing 7-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and growing whale accumulation. The 7-day MVRV, now at 6.1%, highlights growing unrealized profits and increased optimism among short-term holders. Historically, levels around 7% or higher result in corrections, but the rally may extend further if the sentiment remains bullish. Whale accumulation is also growing, with wallets holding over 1,000 ETH, hitting 5,599, a high since October 6, 2024. This growing interest from whales highlights confidence in ETH’s price trajectory. If ETH surpasses $4,000, it could go to its all-time high of $4,867. However, if the momentum fades, ETH may retest support at $3,688, $3,500, or $3,255. ETH was trading at $3,904 on December 6, up 9.16% in the past week. Analysts say ETH will rise to $4205.16 this month as more investors buy the altcoin. Investors are turning to a new DeFi coin that has massive growth potential. Thus, it is a good crypto to buy. DTX is considered a good crypto to buy over LINK and ETH in this bull market The dynamic crypto market continues to attract investors with innovative projects like DTX Exchange, which is impacting crypto trading massively. With growing interest from Chainlink and Ethereum whales, the DeFi coin has massive profit potential that has made it a good crypto to buy in this bull cycle. DTX Exchange’s unique features position it perfectly to outpace the established investments as more investors rush to buy the token. DTX is selling rapidly in Stage 6 of its public presale, valued at $0.12, which also implies a 500% profit for early buyers who acquired it at $0.02. Additionally, new investors will receive a 67% profit once the DeFi coin completes the presale phase and launches on mainstream markets at $0.20.

With this political shift, the crypto market has been experiencing a big rally for weeks and might continue for a significant time, per analysts. In this, the Trump meme coins also faced a boost, increasing their demand. However, this boost is not constant, as it is too far from their prime days. Interestingly, today is different as they are all up after significant surges. Donald Trump Meme Coins On The Rise With Donald Trump changing his perspective on the crypto industry, creators are launching more and more Trump-themed meme coins to the crypto market. More importantly, these are gaining significant attention, as they are highly volatile and pump easily with Trump-related news. Today, all the major Trump meme coins are up, including tokens like MAGA, TRUMP, STRUMP, and others per CoinmarketCap . In this, the MAGA (maga-hat.vip) is on a week-long rally, where the price has surged 81%. More importantly, it has gained 10% of its value in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $0.0001072 with market capitalization and trading volume of $41.84M and $16.24M. The next in line is the Crypto President Trump (TRUMP), launched just three days ago. In this period, the token has surged 62809.24%, showcasing high demand. In the last 24 hours alone, its value has surged 519%, currently valued at $0.006784. Additionally, its market capitalization and trading volume are at $568.02M and $28.19M. Super Trump Coin (STRUMP) is also following a major rally, as the price has surged more than 19% today. This surge is because of the increased trading activity for the token, as the 24-hour trading volume has surged 500% to $4.42M. Presently, it is trading at $0.002448 with a market capitalization of $4.50M. Interestingly, the same is the case with many other Trump meme coins, confirming an increased demand for this category of tokens. 3 Reasons Why Trump-Themed Meme Coins Are Bullish Today Despite their association with Donald Trump, these Trump-themed meme coins are not always bullish and have declined from their prime. However, the building momentum and the upcoming Trump inauguration can push these tokens to new highs. For now, today’s surge in Trump tokens is surprising, but these three factors made that happen. 1. Donald Trump Crypto Czar David Sacks The biggest reason behind the ongoing Trump meme coins surge is Donald Trump appointing David Sacks as the White House A.I. and Crypto Czar. David is a venture investor and podcaster and has already begun showing interest in crypto regulation. As a crypto czar, David’s main role is to build a crypto’s legal framework. This news itself is increasing trust in the crypto industry. 2. Pro-Crypto Administration Donald Trump has appointed many crypto-friendly associates for this term. It includes picking Paul Atkins for the SEC Chair position . As a result, the excitement is increasing among investors to witness better regulations in this pro-crypto administration. Many industry experts have openly acknowledged that Gary’s leadership has restricted the crypto industry’s growth. With Trump working on his 11 crypto industry promises , including turning the US into crypto capital, investors are eyeing higher gains with Trump-themed tokens. 3. Crypto Market Rally & FOMO Returning To Trump Meme Coins On December 5, 2024, Bitcoin price created a new ATH at $103,900.47, crossing the $100k mark. The token has been bullish for weeks and maintained the crypto market rally. The impact is also visible in the Trump-themed meme coins, as FOMO is building for these tokens. Donald Trump also congratulated the industry for this achievement and took some credit, writing, “YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Although the Bitcoin price has moved down to $99.5k, the user’s sentiments are ‘extremely bullish, which may lead to further gains. Final Thoughts The crypto market is in the prime of 2024, and investors are anticipating this rally to turn into a bull run. With the ‘extremely bullish sentiments,’ and Trump building the pro-crypto administration, the cryptocurrencies are bullish, including the Trump meme coins. More importantly, Donald Trump has appointed David Sacks as the White House A.I. and Crypto Czar, so transparent and crypto-favorable regulations might be coming next. As a result, investors are focusing on the Trump-themed meme coins in anticipation of their future rallies with the Trump administration.

This growth comes amid a heated bull market that continues to draw institutional and retail investors into the crypto space. The rise in active wallets underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets, with stablecoins playing a central role in this expansion. Chainalysis noted that the increasing number of wallets with non-zero balances is indicative of the broader adoption trend, even though wallet counts do not necessarily equate to individual users. The report highlighted a “seismic shift” in how digital assets are perceived and utilized. Researchers attributed this cycle’s unique momentum to a convergence of the digital economy with traditional financial institutions entering the market through products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Stablecoins Lead the Way Stablecoins have emerged as a dominant force in onchain transactions, accounting for 50% to 75% of all onchain activity since the start of 2024, the report revealed. These dollar-pegged assets, often used as on-ramps and off-ramps for the crypto market, are proving to be more than just transactional tools. In emerging markets like Venezuela and much of Latin America, stablecoins have become indispensable as a store of value and a lifeline for remittances. These digital dollars are offering access to liquidity in regions grappling with tight capital controls or limited access to the US dollar. Recognition Among Policymakers The utility of stablecoins has not gone unnoticed by global policymakers. US Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller remarked in October that stablecoins could enhance financial systems by lowering cross-border settlement costs. Echoing this sentiment, the US Treasury’s Borrowing Advisory Committee noted that stablecoins are boosting demand for Treasury bills and improving the efficiency of issuing Treasury assets. Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla also stressed the importance of stablecoins in a letter to US lawmakers. He argued that stablecoins are vital for maintaining the dollar’s relevance in the evolving digital economy and crypto adoption.

This marks an impressive 9.94% growth from October, the biggest monthly jump since November 2021. While stablecoins are rising, The U.S. Financial Services Oversight Council (FSOC) has issued its 2024 annual report , flagging stablecoins as a potential threat to financial stability. The report emphasizes that without proper risk management standards, stablecoins are “acutely vulnerable to runs,” posing risks that could ripple through both the crypto and traditional financial systems. Market Concentration and Vulnerabilities The FSOC highlighted the heavy concentration in the stablecoin market, noting that a single issuer dominates approximately 70% of the market’s total value. Although the report did not explicitly name Tether (USDT), it is evident that Tether, with a $136.8 billion market cap—representing 66.3% of the $205.48 billion total stablecoin market—matches this description. The Council warned that the failure of such a dominant player could severely disrupt the broader crypto market and potentially affect the traditional financial system. Concerns have previously been raised about Tether’s lack of third-party audits, with comparisons made to FTX’s liquidity crisis, further doubling fears. Challenges to Market Discipline The FSOC also pointed out the lack of a robust regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. Many issuers operate outside federal oversight, with some under minimal state-level supervision. The Council noted the absence of transparent reporting on holdings and reserves, which hinders market discipline and increases risks of fraud. Recalling the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) in 2022—when the stablecoin lost its peg to the U.S. dollar, plunging from $1 to $0.09—the FSOC reiterated the risks of unregulated stablecoins and their potential to destabilize the market. To help stabilize existing challenges, the FSOC has called on Congress to quickly create a federal law to regulate stablecoin issuers. This law should focus on issues like protecting against runs, ensuring safe payment systems, maintaining market integrity, and protecting investors. The FSOC also warned that if Congress doesn’t act soon, they may take other actions. Crypto Implications Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino recently highlighted concerns over Europe’s upcoming MiCA regulations, which mandate stablecoin issuers to hold at least 60% of reserves in European banks. Ardoino warned that since banks can loan up to 90% of their reserves, these rules could introduce “systemic risks,” potentially destabilizing the crypto market. The FSOC’s warning underscores the urgency of implementing regulatory measures to secure the stability of both the crypto and traditional financial markets as stablecoins grow in prominence.",News|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|LUNA|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 09:46:54

In a series of X posts recently, Musk has ignited speculations with posts related to Dogecoin, especially as he is known for his active support of the meme coin. In addition, the newly formed organization by Donald Trump, Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, has further fueled optimism. Doge Father Elon Musk Share Cryptic Posts Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is well known among the crypto market enthusiasts, especially for his earlier backing for Dogecoin. In addition, his recent support for pro-Bitcoin Donald Trump, ahead of the US election, has also caught the eyes of the market participants in recent days. Recently, Musk has shared a series of X posts related to DOGE, which has sparked widespread discussions in the market. Notably, in a post, the billionaire shared an image with his son and called himself “The Doge Father”. Besides, he has called his son as “The DogeSon.” Source: Elon Musk, X Meanwhile, he has also commented on the post, saying “Doge & Minidoge.” Additionally, Musk has sparked intrigue with another cryptic post on X, featuring an image of a smoke-shaped Shiba Inu dog engulfing a city. The image, shared without comment, is a repeat of a similar post made by Musk in November, following which Dogecoin has noted a strong rally. Source: Elon Musk, X Notably, the Dogecoin price also saw a spike today following Musk’s post, leaving many speculating over the potential reason behind the post. Besides, the billionaire has shared a flurry of posts regarding the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) recently, sparking optimism, as the short form of the organization resembles the Dogecoin ticker. Dogecoin Rallies Indicating Strong Market Confidence The top meme coins have noted a strong rally recently, indicating a shifting focus of the investors towards the segment. Amid this, the “Doge Father” Elon Musk’s post appears to have further boosted the market sentiment, as evidenced by the recent surge in Dogecoin. DOGE price today was up nearly 5%, especially after Musk’s post, and exchanged hands at $0.45. However, its trading volume fell more than 26% to $7 billion at the same time. Notably, the crypto has touched a low of $0.4213. Furthermore, CoinGlass data showed that Dogecoin Futures Open Interest rose more than 8% to $4.04 billion, indicating strong market confidence in the leading dog-themed meme coin . Besides, the Baby Doge Coin price also rallied more than 51% following the post. However, in another post, the Tesla CEO has backed D.O.G.E. advisor Ron Paul , which has also caught the eyes of the market participants. In a recent update, Paul announced that he recommends eliminating foreign aid completely, saying that since World War II, nothing has benefited the US with its foreign policies. Meanwhile, a recent Dogecoin price analysis hints at a potential rally of DOGE to $0.5. If the momentum continues, the analysis showed that the crypto could target $0.7 next, and potentially rally towards the $1 mark.

BTC Looks Toward $100K It was another historic week in the cryptocurrency markets as bitcoin did what many thought throughout the years as impossible. After dumping $93,500 on Tuesday and $94,500 on Wednesday, the primary digital asset resumed its bull run on Thursday and skyrocketed by almost ten grand. As such, it managed to break through the coveted $100,000 line and jumped to a mark a fresh all-time high of $103,800. After breaking into uncharted six-digit territory, the asset faced a massive flash crash. Perhaps due to the large number of leveraged positions, bitcoin slumped hard by over ten grand and dumped briefly to $92,000 on Friday morning. However, it bounced off and started to regain traction almost immediately. As such, it jumped past $100,000 once again on Friday evening and tapped $102,000.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC.

SUI blockchain: Scaling web3 with user-friendly innovations SUI is a new layer-1 blockchain platform designed to drive global adoption by offering a secure, powerful, and scalable development environment. It uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language to address inefficiencies in current blockchain architectures. SUI focuses on user experience by eliminating common barriers in blockchain interactions. Features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make SUI’s Web3 applications more accessible and user-friendly, setting a higher standard for user experience in the Web3 space. NEAR Protocol: Scalable platform for decentralized applications NEAR Protocol is a platform that supports the creation and launch of decentralized applications. Utilizing sharding technology, specifically the Nightshade solution, NEAR improves efficiency and scalability, allowing it to handle higher transaction volumes. NEAR operates on a distributed network, akin to cloud storage systems, but in a decentralized manner. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, NEAR has raised over $20 million from leading venture firms. The platform includes the Rainbow Bridge, which allows seamless token transfers from Ethereum, and Aurora, a Layer 2 solution leveraging Ethereum’s technology for enhanced performance and lower fees. These features make decentralized applications more accessible and efficient. Unveiling AVAX: Avalanche’s layer-1 blockchain and its versatile potential Avalanche is a Layer-1 blockchain known for its eco-friendly approach, low transaction fees, and capacity to process up to 4,500 transactions per second. It enables users to create customizable Subnets, enhancing network flexibility. Avalanche employs a hybrid consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, achieving transaction finality in under two seconds. The Avalanche network consists of three interoperable chains: X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain, each supporting specific functions such as transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, is integral to the ecosystem—used for transaction fees, staking to secure the network, and managing multiple Subnets. Its role in payments, staking, and enabling custom tokens and blockchain creation underscores AVAX’s potential in the blockchain landscape. Conclusion While established altcoins like SOL, SUI, NEAR, and AVAX have shown promise, their short-term potential appears limited in the current market. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a standout opportunity. As a cutting-edge DeFi platform on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO empowers investors to maximize earnings through AI-driven yield aggregation.

Having surpassed a key price level with a golden cross, analysts are confident that this could signal the beginning of the highly anticipated altcoin season. How Far Can The Golden Cross Push Ethereum? Ethereum, the leading smart contract blockchain saw its native ETH token rise beyond $4,000 today. What’s interesting is that ETH is not only showing signs of strength against USDT but also against Bitcoin (BTC). Related Reading: Ethereum To Pull A BTC 2021-Like Rally? Analyst Shares Massive Prediction In the ETH/BTC daily trading chart below, it can be seen that ETH has been making gains against the top cryptocurrency. The ETH/BTC trading pair has surged from 0.032 on November 21 to 0.04 at the time of writing. Continued strength against BTC is important for any potential upcoming altseason — a period marked by altcoins outperforming BTC as the latter continues to trade sideways within a range. Crypto analyst @venturefounder took to X to confirm that ETH has completed its first golden cross of the year on the daily chart. The analyst highlighted the bullish momentum a golden cross can impart to ETH’s price, stating: Last time this happened, Ethereum was still in the consolidation stages of the bear market but it still went +129%. In the 2021 bull market, the last goldencross took ETH +2,323%. For the uninitiated, a golden cross in trading is a bullish technical indicator that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. In ETH’s context, the 50-day MA has crossed above the 200-day MA, a sign of a strong rally or trend reversal. Another crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa indicated that if ETH decisively breaks through the $4,000 level, its next resistance level could be around the $4,800 to $5,000 price level. According to CoinGecko, ETH’s current all-time high (ATH) value is $4,878 recorded back in November 2021. It is also worth highlighting that Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) are finally starting to get attention from institutional investors. According to data from SoSoValue, US-based spot ETH ETFs attracted $428 million in daily total net inflows on December 5. Altseason On The Horizon? Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), a key metric often used to determine the onset of the altseason has been on a continual decline over the past three weeks. BTC.D has crashed from about 61% to 55%, indicating strong recent performance by altcoins against BTC. Altcoin’s resilience during yesterday’s BTC flash crash to $90,500 is another bullish sign hinting toward a potential altcoin rally in the coming days. In addition, altcoin analyst Crypto Amsterdam noted that it may be time for mid-cap altcoins to start their parabolic cycle.

The LINK price surged all the way to $26.7 levels for the first time since January 2022, after giving a crucial breakout above $20. On-chain data shows that the current surge comes without any retail frenzy which is a positive indicator for a sustained rally ahead. Chainlink Approaches 3-Year High With Minimal Retail FOMO In the last 24 hours, the Chainlink price surged by another 12% hitting a three-year high all the way to $26.3 level. The daily trading volume for LINK has also surged 17% to $1.72 billion while the open interest has surged 12.32% moving to $739 million. Chainlink (LINK) has experienced a notable late-week rally, positioning itself just 10.8% below its three-year high from January 2022. According to the on-chain analytics platform Santiment, the lack of significant retail frenzy around LINK’s recent price movement is a positive indicator for sustained growth. Historically, markets tend to move contrary to popular sentiment, and the current skepticism among retail investors could act as a catalyst for further gains, noted Santiment. Courtesy: Santiment Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov expressed optimism about the expanding use of the blockchain’s services in traditional finance (TradFi) and capital markets. Speaking about the network’s progress, Nazarov remarked: “I see this long list of initial capital markets users and early adopters of multiple Chainlink services as just the beginning.” He likened LINK’s role in TradFi to its success in decentralized finance (DeFi), where it has become a critical standard. Nazarov also noted ongoing active integration efforts, signaling increasing adoption of Chainlink’s solutions in bridging blockchain technology with traditional financial systems. The Chainlink co-founder added: “Whether you’re an asset manager, custodian bank, central bank, financial market infrastructure or various other traditional financial system participant, the Chainlink standard gets you transacting across multiple chains quickly, securely and in a compliant manner. There is no other standard that currently does that”. LINK Price Rally By 500% Ahead The recent LINK price rally comes on the backdrop of a notable LINK whale activity with a big investor scooping $46 million worth of coins. Despite the current run-up, the LINK price is still trading at a 50% discount from its all-time high of $50. Notably, it also highlights the growing investors’ confidence in the top altcoins alongside BTC. However, crypto market analysts continue to predict a staggering 500% LINK price rally giving a massive target of $200 ahead. Chainlink’s price has surged past a critical resistance level at $22.80, marking three consecutive weeks of gains. On the weekly chart, LINK remains above its 50-week and 200-week Exponential Moving Averages, signaling strong bullish momentum.

Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Created in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the supply, reducing circulation. SHIB’s Ethereum basis allows it to interact with decentralized applications like ShibaSwap, a platform for trading tokens. Future plans include an NFT platform and a governance system managed by users. These developments could enhance SHIB’s role in the cryptocurrency market.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 11:09:36

Crypto Analyst’s Bold Prediction for Solana’s rival,https://coingape.com/from-0-125-to-21-crypto-analysts-bold-prediction-for-solanas-rival/,"The cryptocurrency market is full of innovative projects, but few have garnered the attention and interest of investors and experts like this Solana rival, Rexas Finance (RXS). This is an emerging platform that stands out for its approach on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). A top crypto analyst has predicted that RXS could soar to $21 from its current price of $0.125. Rexas Finance: A Solana Rival in Democratizing Real Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance aims at tokenizing real assets to build a niche in the increasingly popular cryptocurrency market. Although there are other existing blockchain projects in decentralized finance (DeFi) or NFTs, Rexas Finance stands out with each approach of tokenizing almost any real world asset — real estate, art, commodities, intellectual property. The focus of the platform is on democratizing asset ownership, enabling liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets. This opens up investment opportunities globally. Rexas Finance can be labeled as an all-in-one platform that enhances accessibility and streamlines asset management for users. It includes innovative tools for tokenization and offers various key components, such as the Rexas GenAI, QuickmintBot, and Rexas Token Builder, QuickmintBot. The platform enhances security, and simplifies token generation in such a way that even new investors to blockchain technology can find it easy to use. This approach opens up new opportunities for institutional and retail investors to access traditionally restricted markets. The Rexas Finance ecosystem is designed to be an inclusive solution, empowering individual investors and companies to integrate blockchain technology into their processes. Rexas Finance (RXS) Tokenomics Crypto Analyst Foresees a Significant Price Increase With Rexas Finance being sold for $0.125 at the moment, this is a significant increase compared to the original presale price – which was $0.03 at launch time. The presale has proven to be a success, nearing its $26 million goal by generating approximately $21 million. The last three months witnessed the price of RXS skyrocket, a trend that is expected to continue. A high profile crypto analyst believes that the value of the RWA token will rise to $21 by the end of 2025, a 16,800% hike from the current rate. Unlike other blockchain projects, the price prediction of RXS is based on its real case use. Rexas Finance is rising as a strong competitor to Solana blockchain by making it easier to tokenize assets, enabling global reach, transparency and offering better liquidity. Analysts are confident that DeFi yield optimization and AI-powered security tokens are features of the platform that will be on demand in the future. Rexas Finance focuses on real-world asset tokenization, a cryptocurrency sector that has not received the much exploration it deserves. We acknowledge how Solana projects have evolved beyond distributed apps (dApps)scaling solutions. However, Rexas Finance is taking a step further by blending blockchain with real world investments. This approach opens up opportunities to transform assets such as commodities, fine art and real estate. Institutional and retail investors are now able to access markets that were not possible to reach. Features such as QuickMint Bot and Rexas Token Builder, make it simple and easier for anyone to create and manage their digital assets, even if you are new to the blockchain space. The Future of Rexas Finance (RXS) In the highly volatile cryptocurrency market, Rexas Finance’s focus on real asset tokenizing presents an attractive long term value proposition. With sufficient market traction, the price of RXS holdings could experience substantial upward momentum, with projections estimating a value of $21 by 2025. Although it is an early-stage cryptocurrency , with blockchain technology constantly developing and the need for distributed asset management solutions on the rise, Rexas Finance has potential to become a giant in the market. Looking ahead, Rexas Finance stands out as one of Solana rivals to watch in the next five years. Even now, its growing ecosystem, and unique approach on real world asset tokenization remain strong.

This undervalued digital asset is generating buzz for its potential to multiply investments exponentially. The upcoming article delves into why analysts are enthusiastic about its prospects and what this could mean for savvy investors. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win. HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! Bitcoin (BTC): The Pioneer of Decentralized Cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, based on blockchain technology, enabling decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without a central authority. It operates as a distributed ledger across network nodes, removing the need for intermediaries like banks. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate them and earn bitcoins. The Bitcoin network experiences a halving every 4 years, reducing miners’ rewards by half, affecting the network’s dynamics due to the capped supply of 21 million bitcoins. This technology has potential for secure and transparent transactions. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin’s unique features may make it attractive to investors. Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, it has no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially seen as a “memecoin,” Dogecoin’s value surged in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This was driven by social media influence, especially from Elon Musk, and the general crypto market boom. Dogecoin’s large supply and active community contribute to its popularity. In the current market cycle, its attractiveness depends on market trends and investor sentiment toward meme-based assets. Conclusion While BTC and DOGE show steady growth, their short-term potential is limited compared to DOGEN. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN is projected to grow 700% by presale end, with potential for thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

T he rewards v2 upgrade marks the first EigenLayer Improvement Proposal under the newly launched EigenLayer Governance Process. The updates, which are expected to benefit external protocols using EigenLayer are expected to launch on the mainnet in January 2025 . EigenLayer enables restaking for extra revenue and fee flexibility The EigenLayer rewards v2 upgrade will allow third-party protocols utilizing EigenLayer, known as actively validated services (AVSs), to distribute rewards to validators based on their performance. According to EigenLayer , they also let validators, or “operators,” set fee rates independently. This proposal will allow better economic viability and to attract diverse participants. EigenLayer rewards v2 also supports batch reward claiming. Stakers and operators can claim multiple rewards in a single transaction, which significantly reduces gas costs. EigenLayer is regarded as one of the foremost restaking protocols on Ethereum. It allows ETH stakers to re-use their staked tokens on the consensus layer. Participants grant permission to EigenLayer’s smart contract to impose extra slashing conditions on their staked ETH in exchange for additional revenue opportunities through service provision. EigenLayer secures $19 billion in restaked collateral and EIGEN token launch Launched in 2023, EigenLayer has secured dozens of actively validated services (AVSs) and nearly $19 billion in restaked collateral, according to DefiLlama . Restaking involves using tokens that have already been staked — posted as collateral with a validator in exchange for rewards — to secure other protocols simultaneously. Currently, around 20 AVSs are live on EigenLayer’s mainnet, with many more in development. These include EigenDA, an AVS run by EigenLayer developer Eigen Labs, and ARPA Network, which specializes in trustless randomization. On October 1, EigenLayer launched its native token, EIGEN, designed to secure protocols against a broader range of faults than traditional proof-of-stake tokens like Ether (ETH), as stated by EigenLayer. In addition, EigenLayer launched a programmatic incentives initiative on September 1 to attract restakers. The program will reward restakers with EIGEN emissions, accounting for around 4% of the token’s total supply. Since September, ARPA Network has distributed 14,000 native ARPA tokens weekly to restakers as part of EigenLayer’s rewards program. With the upcoming rewards v2 upgrade, EigenLayer continues to innovate in the Ethereum ecosystem, creating new opportunities for validators, stakers, and protocols alike. As of December 6, EIGEN is trading at approximately $4.41, with a fully diluted market capitalization of nearly $7.36 billion according to CoinMarketCap data.

As is known, the RSR token has experienced a major rally in the last seven days, experiencing a more than 100% increase in price. The reason for the rise is thought to be US President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency ally, for SEC Chairman. Atkins served as an advisor to the Reserve Protocol. Atkins, who is also a former SEC member, is believed to be a name that will breathe new life into the entire cryptocurrency market.

Lunex Network is stealing the spotlight with remarkable growth, outpacing Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic. Offering cutting-edge features like non-custodial asset control, advanced staking options, and seamless interoperability, Lunex Network has emerged as a promising alternative. Could Bitcoin Cash Hit $600 This Year? Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is well-known as Bitcoin’s practical alternative. This altcoin places efficiency and usability above prestige. Bitcoin Cash is currently selling at $551, up 65% from last month. Bitcoin Cash is a decentralized payment method that attracts companies or users seeking to avoid the high charges of conventional payment systems. Institutional inflows into crypto climbed to $3.13 billion this month, largely from Bitcoin ETFs. This influx has boosted Bitcoin Cash’s performance. Although Bitcoin Cash had difficulty breaking the $595 resistance level last week, its real-world utility continues to push it over the limit in the decentralized payment space. More businesses will likely begin accepting crypto-friendly payments, so Bitcoin Cash might continue its upward trajectory. Ethereum Classic’s Price Grows By Over 100% Ethereum Classic (ETC) has performed remarkably in Q4, with a 109% increase during the last month. The coin soared 14% in the last twenty-four hours largely because of more whale activity. Social media metrics for Ethereum Classic also reached a peak this year. Ethereum Classic recently reached a six-month high of $36 but faces resistance at $37.38 & $39.78. The 20-day EMA crossing above the 50-day and 200-day EMAs indicates an upward trend might continue. Nevertheless, with the RSI at near 64, a short-term pullback is possible. Bitcoin’s price will be crucial, as Bitcoin’s bullish momentum might push ETC above $40. If Bitcoin slows, ETC might revert to $31-$32. Though its reputation has fallen lately, Ethereum Classic is a safe investment choice. Ethereum leads the layer-1 blockchain space but Ethereum Classic can not compete directly. Nonetheless, Ethereum Classic still has potential and might provide a 2-5x return for brand-new investors. How Lunex Network Revolutionizes User Experiences in Crypto Trading Lunex Network (LNEX) connects various blockchains and offers a non-custodial exchange for immediate crypto swaps and transfers. Unlike many exchanges that require several KYC steps for token conversion and wallet transfers, Lunex Network enables users to trade in a single, fast, and anonymous way. Lunex Network also allows users to build up portfolios of over 50,000 cryptocurrencies while keeping an eye on their investments via a non-custodial wallet The platform is well placed to benefit from the burgeoning DeFi sector which is anticipated to reach $337 billion by 2030. With $LNEX tokens going for $0.0038 during the continuing presale, the time is right to invest. Early buyers of $LNEX at $0.0012 have reaped over 200% returns in profit. The Lunex Network presale has raised more than $4 million, a huge show of investors’ confidence. Experts project that $LNEX might surge 2000% before the presale ends as demand for the $LNEX token increases. Lunex Network is a hidden gem in the world of crypto trading. Lunex Network (LNEX) is not just another DEX — the platform is the potential future of decentralized trading and is offering low fees, security, and privacy to traders worldwide.

Supply Chain Innovation: Providing transparent, real-time tracking of goods and optimizing logistics through predictive analytics. Gaming and Entertainment: Supporting next-gen gaming platforms with fast, scalable transactions and intelligent in-game mechanics. What Every Investor Should Watch For As with any emerging project, it’s important to evaluate the coin’s fundamentals before making investment decisions. Key factors to monitor include: Developer Ecosystem: A strong community of developers is critical for building applications and driving adoption. Institutional Partnerships: Collaborations with established businesses can lend credibility and accelerate growth. Tokenomics: A well-structured token economy ensures long-term sustainability and incentivizes participation. Is This the Coin That Changes Everything? While it’s still early days, the excitement around this coin is hard to ignore. If it delivers on its promises, it could become one of the most influential blockchain projects of this decade, driving innovation and adoption across industries.

Let’s take a look at their journeys, market interplay, and potential trajectories. Lightchain AI—changing decentralization through AI At its core, Lightchain AI (LCAI) isn’t just a typical blockchain project—it’s an ambitious melding of artificial intelligence capabilities and decentralized governance. Here’s why LCAI stands out: Breaking c PoI and AIVM Unlike Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Intelligence (PoI) actively incentivizes contributors for real-world AI computations, including tasks like model training, inference, and optimization. It’s a direct step forward in making blockchain networks more practical and smarter. But it doesn’t stop there. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) brings something entirely unique to the table. It’s a computational layer within the blockchain designed specifically for AI tasks—think of it as a playground for developers pushing the boundaries between automation and intelligence. Big picture vision Lightchain AI also enables a transparent AI framework to audit AI decision-making processes and fosters decentralized governance, giving power back to its token holders. Combined with these futuristic functions, it redefines traditional blockchain limitations into forward-thinking opportunities. With the current presale price sitting at $0.001125, LCAI is positioning itself as an accessible yet long-term investment rooted in real utility. And with features like its Meme coin Launchpad, it’s even creating a secure space for the very figures it could rival. You might also like: Why Lightchain AI is stealing the spotlight from Ethereum and Solana What about PEPE? On the other side of the spectrum is Pepe Coin—a memecoin created as an homage to the internet’s favorite frog mascot. Currently priced at $0.00002196, PEPE offers an entirely different player into this duel. It thrives on market hype, humor, and speculative trade. Why PEPE attracts attention Memecoins like PEPE gain legs by fostering community-driven engagement rather than use-case-heavy infrastructure. Take DOGE , SHIB, and now PEPE—they’re easy entry points for younger traders and offer short-term, high-risk betting grounds. Strengths Community power drives its virality across social platforms. Gains trading volume fast, mostly when fueled by trending news or whale activity. Works as a speculative asset with potentially massive (albeit volatile) returns. Weaknesses Lack of inherent functionality or utility beyond trading. Relies too heavily on market sentiment and therefore is highly volatile. Put simply, while PEPE may double or triple its market cap during a bull run, sustained growth becomes a question mark. What do the markets say? Volume comparisons PEPE thrives on instant spikes, seeing volume surges during Twitter/X mentions, trends, or social media movements. However, Lightchain AI aligns itself with consistent, strategic growth tied to meaningful application and adoption. Fundraising efficiency LCAI has already gained traction through its presale—strategically designed to fuel real innovation. With transparency in tokenomics, it provides clarity not just to investors but to its developer ecosystem. Meanwhile, PEPE depends heavily on the collective enthusiasm of holders but lacks the kinds of reinvestment opportunities a tech-heavy project like LCAI possesses. While the “pump-and-dump” nature may entertain adventurous traders, it doesn’t build long-term blockchain utility. Community building Why this category matters? Cryptocurrencies aren’t just technologies—they’re movements. And on this front, PEPE exudes sociocultural virality, whereas Lightchain AI focuses on meaningful results that shape businesses, AI experts, and developers. PEPE appeals to casual, retail traders seeking simple fun. LCAI is for innovators and investors looking to solve real-world automation problems while improving performance across supply chains or predictive models. What the next move could be We can’t pretend to know everything about crypto evolution, but here’s a breakdown: PEPE’s scenario Memecoins like PEPE may continue to provide rollercoaster excitement, particularly during bull cycles when FOMO hits fever-pitch. But long-term relevance depends on expanding beyond humor and speculation. Realistically, PEPE’s strength comes less from fundamentals and more from the waves of the unpredictable crypto community. LCAI’s edge The Lightchain Protocol roadmap is already in motion, leading with smart-market penetration based on revolutionary utility. With its Proof of Intelligence (PoI), meaningful AI-focused computations, and high scalability, LCAI isn’t just captivating—it’s transformational. Cryptocurrency increasingly needs projects that blend real-world value with unique integrations, making Lightchain AI one of the best-prepped players in defining the next era of blockchain.

However, blockchain analysts have noticed that the influencer’s wallets reveal a different focus—heavy investments in Rexas Finance (RXS), a new and rapidly growing altcoin. The crypto community is now rather curious about this disclosure. While Ripple remains a formidable competitor in crypto, the influencer’s preference for Rexas Finance raises questions about the altcoin’s potential to outperform its rivals. Rexas Finance may be the next major player in the crypto scene. Ripple’s Explosive Growth Potential Ripple current price explosion and higher trading activity show its continuous importance in the cryptocurrency market. The influencer’s 780% estimate points to a future price objective of $23.54, demonstrating faith in Ripple’s continuous legal successes and hope for its use. Using XRP in cross-border payments and joint ventures with financial institutions strengthens this positive picture. But the abrupt turn of attention to Rexas Finance suggests the influencer might find even more possibilities elsewhere. Investors question whether this less-known cryptocurrency could yield returns more than even Ripple’s boldest expansion path. Rexas Finance (RXS): The New Altcoin on the Block Rexas Finance is now in stage 9 of its presale, with a price of $0.125. The project has raised over $21.7 million and sold over 297.6 million tokens, indicating high investor interest. Rexas Finance offers a comprehensive ecosystem that overcomes fundamental deficiencies in the cryptocurrency sector. RXS, which focuses on real-world utility, drives innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), particularly in real estate tokenization. Its platform enables efficient, secure, and transparent transactions, drawing interest from both institutional and retail investors. The influencer’s taste for Rexas Finance most likely results from its strong foundations and great expansion possibilities. Early adopters might make big profits with the present presale price of $0.125 and ambitions to list at $0.20. Given market analysts’ projections of RXS rallying by as much as 2,500% in the next six months, this presents an interesting investment prospect. Ripple and Rexas Finance have great futures, even if they target different cryptocurrency markets. Rexas Finance is carving a place in DeFi innovation, but Ripple excels in its focus on cross-border payments. Although Ripple’s institutional relationships and well-known reputation offer stability, its growth might be limited compared to more current projects like Rexas Finance. Being a younger token, RXS presents a little risk but maximum benefit. It has appealed to investors seeking exponential returns through the ongoing presale. The success of a cryptocurrency is greatly influenced by the attitude of its community. Because of its track record and general acceptance, Ripple has a devoted following. But Rexas Finance is quickly developing its community through open projects and calculated alliances. Its early acceptance by more than 297 million token holders emphasizes its rising appeal. The Certik audit and listings on big sites like Coin Market Cap and CoinGecko further boost Rexas Finance’s trustworthiness. These elements, taken along with the influencer’s endorsement, imply that RXS is a project with real-world uses and long-term potential rather than just a speculative token. The influencer’s investing approach emphasizes why Rexas Finance appeals more than established coins like Ripple. Although XRP’s expected 780% increase is remarkable, given its present price point and early-stage usage, RXS presents the possibility for significantly higher profits. Conclusion Ripple’s comeback and possible 780% gain demonstrate its continued relevance in the cryptocurrency industry. However, the fact that a well-known influencer has turned their attention to Rexas Finance shows that the investment environment is changing. Regarding altcoins, Rexas Finance stands out because of its strong presale success, ecosystem, and high growth potential. At $0.125, RXS is a fantastic investment for people who want to make a lot of money quickly. The token has plans to grow even more. Projects like Rexas Finance might reinvent the investment scene as the cryptocurrency market develops, challenging even well-known companies like Ripple. Whether you are a novice or a seasoned investor, monitoring Rexas Finance could be a game-changing choice for 2024 and forward.

The December 5 crash knocked BTC to $90K and tirggered more than a billion US dollars worth of liquidation. But this one indicator showcases that the second attempt to overcome $100K will be massively bullish. Regardless, Bitcoin price today hovers around No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago on No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago after hitting a daily high of No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago today after a No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago% move on December 7. Bitcoin Price Slides Below $100K, What’s Next? Bitcoin price crashed 13.53% between December 4 and 5, wiping out an excess of $1.5 billion worth of positions in just 19 hours. On December 5 alone, more than $1 billion worth of longs and short positions got wiped from the cryptocurrency market. BTC Crash, Crypto Liquidations But why did Bitcoin suddenly dip below the historic $100,000 level, and will it recover? Let’s discover! Meitu, dubbed as the chinese MicroStrategy, sold its crypto holdings, which led to the sudden drop in Bitcoin price on December 4. The Chinese selfie application operator sold 940 BTC and 31,000 ETH, realizing nearly $80 million in profits, the company’s Wednesday statement noted. Bitcoin Crash: Meitu Filing Shows BTC, ETH Sale Bitcoin price today is up No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago% and trades at No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago. Value of BTC trades at No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago, bringing the year-to-date gain from 56% on October 20 to roughly 130% as of December 7. The YTD performance has slumped due to the recent BTC crash. Although many altcoins have shot up over triple digits, Bitcoin is catching up. Ethereum price’s YTD performance is lackluster, stands at 70%, and is well below BTC. Although Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin’s popularity is due to its first-mover advantage and its being a secure, decentralized network. In addition, many narratives, like digital gold, inflation hedges, and uncorrelated assets, have kept BTC at the forefront of the crypto market since its inception in 2009. Will Bitcoin End 2024 on Positive Note? Industry veterans’ speculation of a bull run post-US elections was right, and Bitcoin is likely to end November 2024 on a positive note. Many even expect a six-digit target for BTC by the end of November, and this is due to the historical returns . History shows that Bitcoin has always performed massively in the fourth quarter. Historical Bitcoin Price Performance With that said, if Bitcoin price hits a new ATH in November or December, Bitcoin’s market capitalization, which stands at No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago, could finally hit the $2 trillion mark. Bitcoin’s Market Capitalization While Bitcoin’s market cap hovers around No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago, with Ethereum, the duo controls nearly 65% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Despite the seven-month consolidation, Bitcoin’s $1.93 trillion market cap remains strong, anticipating it reaching $2 trillion before 2025. BTC: A composition of 24-hour Trading Volume Being the top crypto has its benefits; more people tend to flock toward the asset. Likewise, BTC’s 24-hour trading volume stands at No data found for bitcoin on 39 minutes ago. Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, contributes a major portion of this volume. Binance’s share of BTC’s 24-hour trading volume comprises spot and perpetuals trading. While spot volume hovers around 11%, perpetual volume is 41%. Exchanges like OKX, Bitget, etc, follow Binance. Key Bitcoin Upgrades With a market cap of $1.93 trillion, it is necessary for the network to remain secure, decentralized, and scalable. This is possible by upgrading the Bitcoin network regularly. Here are some notable upgrades the Bitcoin network has received or planned to receive since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin Network Upgrades Since 2009 Here are some key milestone upgrades to the Bitcoin network over the past decade. 2020-2024: Taproot Upgrade (2021): Improved Bitcoin’s smart contract functionality, allowing for more complex transactions and enhanced privacy.Muir Glacier Upgrade (2020): Delayed the “ice age” that would have slowed down the network, ensuring the continued smooth operation of Bitcoin. 2017-2019: Segregated Witness (SegWit) Upgrade (2017): Increased the block size limit, allowing for more transactions to be processed on the network, and improved the overall scalability of Bitcoin.

As of today, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) disclosed official data that in November, the central bank reinitiated gold purchases for its reserves, a move it had paused for six months after the precious metal reached record-high prices. According to Fed Chief Jamie Powell and other analysts, Bitcoin is not a competitor to the dollar; rather, it is a competitor to gold. Bitcoin exhibits numerous similarities to gold, including its enduring nature, scarcity, and mining difficulty . In recent months, BRICS nations have intensified efforts to introduce their own currency as part of a broader de-dollarization initiative. The decentralized finance, which is inclined toward Bitcoin, has been taken into account. China, however, has not been sure about legalizing crypto entities. The nation has opted to take small steps, like virtual tokens regulated by the stablecoin bill in Hong Kong , most recently. China has opted for gold as its reserve asset; in fact, in 2023, the PBOC was the world’s largest official sector consumer of gold. China re-introduces gold purchases According to reports , at the end of November, China’s possession of gold increased by 160,000 fine troy ounces to 72.96 million fine troy ounces. This marked an increase from 72.80 million troy ounces months before. In April of this year, the PBOC increased its stockpiles, which contributed to the resilience of bullion prices. However, in November, the value of China’s gold reserves decreased from $199.06 billion in October to $193.43 billion. November was gold’s first monthly price drop since June, which was precipitated by a post-US election sell-off that was led by Donald Trump’s victory. Also, spot prices for the precious metal have declined by 5% since reaching a record high of $2,790.15 per ounce on October 31, but they have still increased by 28% thus far this year. In October, gold reached an all-time high due to more people looking for safe havens because of the recent US presidential election and the tension in the Middle East and Ukraine. In addition, China’s consumers have decreased their demand for bullion as prices have increased by nearly 30% thus far this year. Although gold bars and coins have maintained their value for the first three quarters, retail sales of discretionary items such as jewelry have dropped as investors attempt to protect their wealth from a weakening economy. Source: World Gold Council Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said, “The resumption will send a signal that the PBOC has grown accustomed to these record-high price levels and is prepared to build reserves regardless.” The PBOC’s resumption of purchases may also boost Chinese investor demand, which has been low since the bank suspended its 18-month purchasing campaign in May. The current state of the gold market Gold (XAU/USD) is currently trading at $2,640.30, representing a 0.32% increase. However, it continues to be below the critical pivot at $2,644.90. On Friday, gold tried to break through a bearish flag pattern again but failed. Source: TradingView $2,634.00 and $2,623.66 provide support, while key resistance targets are $2,657.02 and $2,666.24. The 50-day EMA at $2,642.35 provides near-term stability, while the 200-day EMA at $2,646.99 emphasizes resistance. The bullish momentum may be confirmed by a break above $2,644.90, while a sustained decline below this level could move sentiment to bearish, with a focus on lower support levels.

Amid the excitement, Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3 and a well-known Bitcoin advocate, has made a bold prediction involving what he calls the “Omega Candle.” According to Mow, this remarkable market movement could propel Bitcoin’s price to an incredible $1 million . What is the Omega Candle? Samson Mow describes the Omega Candle as a monumental surge in Bitcoin’s price, characterized by an overwhelming wave of demand that wipes out resistance levels. Unlike typical rallies, this candle would stand out as a massive green spike on price charts. “The Omega Candle isn’t just a rally,” Mow explained. “It’s a tidal wave that will redefine Bitcoin’s value, taking it into six-figure territory and beyond.” Mow believes this event will happen once Bitcoin breaks past $100,000, setting the stage for an unparalleled leap in value. MicroStrategy’s Role in the Omega Candle Mow sees MicroStrategy , a company led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, as the key player in this big move. He explained that the trigger could be something called a “gamma squeeze.” The gamma squeeze on $MSTR is what causes the first Omega Candle. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) December 7, 2024 A gamma squeeze happens when traders buy a lot of call options, betting that a stock’s price will go up. To cover their risks, market makers buy the stock itself, which then pushes the price even higher. Mow thinks this could happen with MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), as the company continues to buy large amounts of Bitcoin. If MicroStrategy’s stock price rises quickly, it could also bring a lot of attention to Bitcoin, causing its price to soar as well. Why Breaking $100K Matters Reaching $100,000 is not just a price milestone. It’s a psychological level that could inspire more investors to enter the market. Analysts suggest that once this happens, Bitcoin’s next target could be $114,000 or even higher, paving the way for Mow’s ambitious Omega Candle prediction.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 11:40:11

Besides, Bitcoin’s dominance has dropped from the yearly highs of close to 60%, while the dominance of the other altcoins has risen from 28% to levels above 33%. While BTC marches towards a 6-digit figure, some of the altcoins are about to mark a 4-digit figure soon. BinanceCoin (BNB) BiananceCoin has maintained a consistent volume since the start of the year, but still, the price maintained a strong ascending trend to mark fresh highs close to $800 at around $793.35. Presently, the token is just 6% away from its highs and hence the BNB price is expected to initiate a strong upswing in the coming week. The BNB price has entered the final resistance phase before marking a new ATH. The token just hit 1 FIB at $795. However, the RSI is bullish and testing the upper threshold, intending to enter the overbought zone. Besides, the MACD displayed a bullish crossover as buying pressure mounts up. The current trade setup suggests the price is about to break the ATH but to reach $1000, the token needs to surpass 1.2 FIB at $940. BitcoinCash (BCH) The popular Bitcoin fork, BitcoinCash, has been ranging significantly high within an ascending pattern since the start of 2023. The token has been forming constant higher highs, suggesting the bulls to have remained extremely dominant since the rebound in June 2023. However, the technicals have turned bullish and hence a new yearly high above $1000 could be imminent. The BCH price seems to be in the middle of a parabolic recovery phase after facing rejection from yearly highs at $719. The supertrend has turned bullish while the DMI levels remain strongly within the bullish range. Therefore, the BCH price is expected to maintain a healthy upswing, surpass the pivotal resistance zone between $710 and $773 and hit the upper resistance of the rising parallel channel at $929. If the bulls display some strength here, a rise above $1000 could be imminent, testing higher targets. Bittensor (TAO) The TAO price remained stuck within a descending trend since the beginning and after a strong rebound, it headed back to the resistance. Currently, the price has risen above the resistance zone between $647.3 and $672.8, which is also the neckline of the cup & handle pattern. Therefore, the TAO price is believed to maintain a healthy ascending trend to reach $1000 soon. As seen in the above chart, the price has risen above the neckline and is expected to enter the discovery phase soon. However, the volume remains elevated and hence a notable rise in trading activity is expected to push the price close to $1000 but before surpassing the milestone, bears could book some profits and slash prices to some extent. After a small retracement, the Bittensor price is expected to rise above $1000 and reach $1,100.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BCH|BTC|TRADING|BITTENSOR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 11:40:59

Likewise, crypto has come to realize that TradFi’s infrastructure, vast resources, and customer base hold the key to expanding its ecosystem. Despite finding common ground, technological, ideological, and operational gaps remain, creating a rift that will ultimately limit fruitful collaborations if not addressed. Don’t forget that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is only celebrating its “sweet sixteen” this year, and crypto as a whole still has a lot of momentum to gain. On the flip side, mainstream banking is so entrenched in society through centuries of growth that it’s not going anywhere soon. Therefore, the lack of a mechanism for meaningful cooperation and coexistence will ultimately harm the world’s economic order. Since the crypto movement effectively inserted itself into the financial order, the onus is primarily on it to accommodate TradFi, which operates on the same principles it has had for centuries. It’s not that TradFi can’t change; it’s just that as the economic gatekeeper, the sector moves at a much slower pace. Expecting change at that scale so soon is akin to a four-year-old demanding to graduate college. As things stand today, common instruments like debit cards are still disconnected from the DeFi protocols and tokenized real-world asset platforms that pique TradFi’s interest. And buying crypto off a centralized exchange to then stake on a DeFi protocol with a separate wallet contradicts crypto’s “efficiency” narrative, especially when banks allow customers to log into one app and buy, sell, or trade stocks with a few taps. It highlights the desperate need for interoperability infrastructure that can smoothly link TradFi systems—including various currencies and permissioned chains—with blockchain-based applications and protocols. Addressing this barrier would empower institutions to expand their engagement with DeFi and crypto while providing new crypto users with a pain-free onboarding experience. DeFi protocols have, to some extent, upped their compliance with KYC and AML processes, but more is needed to get banks on board. Intense auditing and enhanced security measures powered by automated monitoring tools, for example, would go a long way to boost TradFi’s confidence in DeFi. While maximizing broad collaborations between TradFi and DeFi requires the former to do more heavy lifting, the latter should be willing to lend its support to enhance joint infrastructure solutions with better risk-management models and expertise in custody and liquidity provisioning. Infrastructure that takes the needs of both ecosystems into account is the only surefire way to keep their dialogue ongoing. And some projects are taking the initiative to make this blend more seamless. For example, Vixichain is a young project with big ambitions to encourage greater TradFi involvement in DeFi by inviting financial institutions to serve as validators on its compliant Layer-1 blockchain. Vixichain creates a safe environment for financial institutions to interact with DeFi protocols on public blockchains through a stablecoin that uses NFT technology to ensure traceability and authenticity. Its stablecoin is backed by fiat reserves and supported by its native VIXC token to fuel real-world utility across an integrated and compliant environment. As Bitcoin soars past $100,000 for the first time , there is great hope that together, TradFi and DeFi can forge not only a path to constructive cooperation but an integrated system that addresses the financial needs of billions of people. Making this happen requires both DeFi’s innovative potential and TradFi’s resources and infrastructure to lay the foundation for a new and more efficient financial era.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Shiba Inu cools off, investors are rotating profits into Pepe and the lesser-known Cutoshi, primed for growth. Table of Contents Shiba Inu is consolidating just below resistance Pepe is ready for a breakout How Cutoshi rewrites the meme coin script Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to dominate the meme coin landscape as the second-largest meme on the market. However, as Shiba Inu entered a cool-off phase, many investors have started rotating profits into Pepe (PEPE) and Cutoshi (CUTO) as they both appear primed for the next leg up. While Pepe is an obvious choice, Cutoshi is still relatively unknown to the broader crypto audience. Shiba Inu is consolidating just below resistance Shiba Inu continues to gain ground, albeit its momentum has slowed down slightly, which was to be expected given its massive $17 billion market cap. Over the last week, Shiba Inu finally managed to reclaim and hold the $0.000029 resistance, although at $0.000033, selling pressure intensified, forcing a pullback. Today, Shiba Inu sells for $0.000029, following a noteworthy 22% weekly increase. The Krypto King shared a chart reading just the other day, pointing out that Shiba Inu is in the process of breaking out of a multi-year descending trendline. A successful retest of this level would confirm Shiba Inu’s bullish thesis and its possible surge to a new all-time high in early 2025. Moreover, Shiba Inu’s burn mechanism went into overdrive as more than 2 billion SHIB tokens were removed from circulation just a few hours ago. If this burn rate is sustained, it will give the extra leverage that Shiba Inu needs to enter escape velocity. You might also like: DOGE in huge demand, Cutoshi trends globally as Popcat meets resistance Pepe is ready for a breakout Over the last year and a half, Pepe scaled the crypto ranks with ease, and its last pump saw it enter the top 20. On the monthly time frame, Pepe is up by over 144%, while also factoring in the correction that saw it retrace from its $0.000024 all-time high to $0.000020, where it’s currently consolidating. In the last 24 hours, Pepe gained 1.2% and is still moving in a narrow range around the $0.000020 mark. A massive upward move seems to be imminent for Pepe. Analyst Chandler Bing shows that Pepe already broke out of the bullish flag pattern in the 4-hour time frame. Meanwhile, large wallets are taking profit, with one whale in particular unloading a 350 billion PEPE clip worth approximately $7.3 billion, according to Spotonchain data. This led to a dip in Pepe’s daily RSI, which currently sits at 58 points, meaning that buyer interest is still high without entering the dangerous overbought territory. Source: TradingView How Cutoshi rewrites the meme coin script The simple truth is that most meme coins are purely speculative assets, and just a few outliers, like Pepe and Shiba Inu, manage to become stable stores of value and thrift in the long run. Cutoshi is among these outliers, as it merges meme energy and DeFi utility on a single, cross-chain protocol. This hybrid approach ensures amazing returns in the 2025 bull run and future-proofs the project as it offers a real use case. Just like Japanese Lucky Cats bring good fortune to businesses and households, Cutoshi seeks to bring good fortune to its community through its unique reward system. Users will have the opportunity to earn money via different income avenues. Through the Cutoshi Farming initiative, they can complete various missions and tasks to spread awareness about Cutoshi on social media. In exchange, they will earn Cuto points, which can be redeemed for CUTO once the presale wraps up. Moreover, once the token launches, they can also stake their CUTO and receive recurring monetary rewards on autopilot. Over $1.27 million has been raised so far and the 4th stage of the presale has just kicked off, which is currently in its third stage. CUTO tokens are now available for $0.031, which is a perfect entry point for early investors who want to be on the winning side of Cutoshi’s utility-driven meme revolution.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA.

Despite a brief dip to $3,615 on Dec. 5, Ether has rebounded strongly, maintaining its higher-high and higher-low pattern on the 4-hour chart. At the time of writing, Ether is trading near its yearly high of $4,098, with a healthy relative strength index (RSI) remaining below the overbought threshold. Ether Maintains Uptrend Crypto analysts are optimistic about Ethereum’s future . An anonymous trader known as “Venture Founder” highlighted that the asset is nearing a significant breakout from a three-year ascending triangle pattern. The trader anticipates a “paradigm shift” for Ethereum, with a bold price target of $15,937 by May 2025. A surge to this level would elevate Ethereum’s market cap beyond $1 trillion for the first time. However, for these bullish projections to hold, Ethereum must maintain key support levels. Analysts stress the importance of closing its weekly candle at $3,800 to increase the likelihood of retesting its all-time high of $4,878. Spot ETFs and DeFi Metrics Drive Momentum Institutional interest in Ethereum is also intensifying, particularly in spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). After lagging behind Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, Ether ETFs have begun to gain traction . Recent reports revealed the largest daily inflows since their launch, with $428.5 million entering the market. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has been a significant contributor, accounting for over $500 million in inflows this week alone, bringing its total to $2.6 billion. Since Nov. 18, spot ETH ETFs have attracted more than $1.3 billion, signaling growing confidence among institutional investors. Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has also seen remarkable growth. According to data from DefiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum’s blockchain reached a yearly high of $77 billion on Dec. 5. This increase reflects growing adoption and robust utility in Ethereum’s DeFi space, further solidifying its position as a leader in the crypto market. With growing institutional interest, positive technical patterns, and strengthening DeFi fundamentals, Ethereum appears poised for a transformative phase in the years ahead.

The broad S&P 500 gained 0.25%, closing at 6,090.27, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 0.81%, finishing at an impressive 19,859.77. Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Amazon led the Nasdaq’s charge. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Industrial Average wasn’t so lucky, dropping 123.19 points, or 0.28%, to end at 44,642.52. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have now posted three straight weeks of gains, rising 0.96% and 3.34% over the last week, respectively. The Dow fell behind, shedding 0.6% over the same period. These movements came as traders digested a better-than-expected November labor report, which eased worries about an overheating economy and raised expectations for another Federal Reserve rate cut. Jobs data fuels optimism November’s labor report , released Friday, showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 227,000, easily outpacing the Dow Jones estimate of 214,000. This was a dramatic jump compared to October’s upwardly revised gain of just 36,000. The unemployment rate crept up to 4.2%, as expected. The numbers painted a picture of a labor market that is clearly softening, a sweet spot for those betting on the Fed cutting rates. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool , which tracks market expectations for Fed moves, put the probability of a December rate cut at 85% after the report. Despite the cooling labor market, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has maintained that policymakers aren’t in a rush to lower rates, though the latest data may provide the justification they need to act. Tech stocks dominate as retail patterns change Tech stocks carried much of the day’s weight, with Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Amazon driving the Nasdaq’s strong performance. This upward momentum in tech reflects investors’ confidence in these companies’ growth, even in a volatile economic climate. Meanwhile, retail trends signaled a shift during the Black Friday season. Bank of America data revealed that online retail spending rose 7.9% in the week ending November 30 compared to the same period in 2023. At the same time, brick-and-mortar retail dipped by 0.3%. The shortened holiday shopping season, with Thanksgiving falling five days later this year, might have contributed to the uptick in online activity. Gains in spending were reported across multiple categories, despite the decline in physical store traffic. And then of course, retail hero Roaring Kitty made his routine re-appearance with an on-brand cryptic post that might or might not be hinting at a livestream later in the month. Bitcoin steals the show Bitcoin made headlines this week after surpassing the $100,000 threshold, but Citi analysts cautioned against assuming the cryptocurrency is immune to economic headwinds. Analyst Alex Saunders warned that Bitcoin could struggle in a weakening economy or from shifts in investor sentiment, especially with tariff uncertainties and labor market dynamics at play. “We do not think Bitcoin or other digital assets will be immune from a weakening economy,” Saunders said. He also pointed to regulatory clarity potentially favoring non-Bitcoin tokens due to Bitcoin’s classification as a commodity and its dominance in ETF vehicles. Global markets react to political shifts European markets wrapped up the week with modest gains. The Stoxx 600 climbed 0.2%, erasing earlier losses, while France’s CAC 40 index jumped 1.4% despite political chaos. French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned on Thursday after lawmakers from both the left and right brought down his government over a controversial budget. President Emmanuel Macron criticized the move, accusing politicians of ignoring voters, and vowed to serve out his term until 2027. In Asia, markets were mixed as South Korea grappled with political instability following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s brief imposition of martial law. Currencies reflected some of the turmoil, with the euro slipping 0.1% to $1.0571 after recording gains from the previous session. Traders are bracing for more turbulence as central banks and governments respond to shifting economic and political conditions. The U.S. stock market’s performance, however, remains a bright spot in an otherwise uncertain global economy.

The upward move came as an analyst pointed out a bullish pattern recently formed on the Ether chart. According to their analysis, the second-largest crypto is gearing up for a big breakout. Ether To Hit $15,937 If History Repeats Itself According to data from CoinGecko , Ether’s price has since settled at $4,002 as of press time, still up 2.8% on the day after giving up some gains above $4K. A popular analyst going by the online moniker venturefounder on X believes that Ethereum is about to register an astronomical rally that will send its price to a new all-time high. Venturefounder noted that ETH is on the verge of breaking out of a three-year consolidation phase. Moreover, the trader thinks Ether could soon break out of the range where it has hovered for the last seven years. Venturefounder postulated: “Ethereum likely to repeat this impulsive breakout it did after between 2016-2017 to shoot to new ATH. Price Target: $15,937 by May 2025.” Ethereum’s market cap would soar above $1 trillion for the first time ever if its price nears $16,000. Nevertheless, the pundit indicates that ETH must first close its weekly candle with $3,800 support to be able to first retest its current lifetime high of $4,878 en route to new ATHs. Spot Ether ETF Inflows Buoy Bullish Momentum Ether’s latest surge above $4K follows the nine ETH ETFs’ biggest single-day of inflows in history, according to data from Farside Investors. The $431 million in inflows registered on Thursday surpassed the previous record of $333 million on Nov. 29. Despite a tepid launch, the Ether ETFs have been at a daily net positive since Nov. 21 and have accumulated over $1.1 billion in net inflows in the past two weeks.

Meanwhile, other altcoins like Lunex Network (LNEX) and Ripple (XRP) are also getting attention from investors. While XRP is one of the top 10 altcoins that recently skyrocketed past $2, LNEX is a rookie presale star, giving early buyers a 175% return. As Lunex Network may disrupt the DeFi market, which Statista predicts could be worth $376M by 2025, experts are also bullish for LNEX. They foresee this token potentially becoming the next 30x DeFi crypto soon. Crypto GVR: The Binance Coin price could hit $1,000 soon As a top 5 cryptocurrency, Binance Coin is now seeing some green price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Binance Coin grew from $565 to $642 in the past 30 days. In other words, its value skyrocketed nearly 15% in just a few short weeks. Market analyst Crypto GVR made a bold Binance Coin price prediction. According to his X post , this crypto coin may hit $1,000 in three months.

This comes as crypto institutional players shift their attention to the asset following its strategic position in cross-border payments. In the last 15 days, movements to XRP have seen a skyrocketing rally to multiple highs not recorded in months. XRP trades at $2.44, a 29% surge in the last 7 days, moving against the wider market. The crypto has shown a consistent bullish momentum since Donald Trump’s win at the November polls as whale point to a new bullish season for the asset after long periods in the doldrums. XRP surged 56% in the past week, while monthly figures stand at an incredible 352% gain. Since its launch, whales have never been this involved with the asset for a variety of reasons. Other assets like Ethereum and Solana previously recorded larger whale inflows. This was due to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) attack on Ripple and two executives, which plunged market sentiment. As a result, XRP traded below the $1 mark for years. On-chain analysts have flagged the asset’s soaring price as an opportunity for whales to consider profit-taking. A surge to $10 might see more signs of XRP in exchange flows. “ Historically, significant spikes in whale-to-exchange transactions (marked by red circles) align closely with XRP price peaks. This suggests that whales move large amounts of XRP to exchanges to sell near local or cycle tops. The latest spike in whale-to-exchange activity coincides with XRP reaching a local price of around $2.3. This could indicate whales preparing for potential profit-taking or increased market activity,” CryptoQuant wrote. Global Payment Spark Institutional Demand Three major factors for bullish institutional activity in crypto revolve around its latest partnerships, incoming positive US regulation signaling a strong recovery following the SEC lawsuits and a wider market rally. Ripple has stood out regarding cross-border solutions, partnering with banks and other institutions instigating in multiple jurisdictions. This year, Ripple tapped a major partnership with the DIFC innovation hub in Dubai, adding to several others, including efforts in stablecoins and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Positive crypto regulation could also turn the tide for the wider market, with institutional appetite soaring for crypto assets. XRP stands to gain from this rising demand. Inflows in XRP are projected to continue if positive signals remain in the markets.

Could Lightchain AI’s next-gen tech influence the crypto landscape and drive value for other projects like Chainlink? Below, we’ll explore Chainlink’s potential price trajectory through 2025, the role of AI innovation, and how Lightchain AI is spearheading this evolution. Lightchain AI—The next frontier in blockchain innovation Before we deep-dive into Chainlink’s price predictions, it’s crucial to grasp the seismic shift Lightchain AI is driving in the crypto ecosystem. Why Lightchain AI matters Built on the foundation of Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI is the first blockchain designed to merge the power of artificial intelligence with decentralized governance and computation. Here’s why it’s groundbreaking: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Rewards nodes that perform valuable AI computations like model training and optimization, shifting consensus towards meaningful contributions. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Handles AI-specific tasks like data analysis directly on the blockchain, transforming dApp (decentralized app) development and governance. These advancements don’t just push blockchain boundaries—they redefine them. And projects like Chainlink could well thrive in this AI-infused crypto revolution. But before we look at the future, here’s where Chainlink stands now. A snapshot of Chainlink today At the time of writing, Chainlink (LINK) is priced at $25.12, boasting a 5.98% gain in 24 hours. Known for its decentralized oracles that connect blockchain systems to real-world data, Chainlink has become an essential tool for smart contracts and DeFi ecosystems. Its network effects and integrations with major platforms cement its reputation, but is this growth enough to carry LINK toward new price heights by 2025? Chainlink price prediction 2025 Week 1, January 2025 Current momentum and heightened partnerships see LINK hover between $40 and $45. Continued adoption of Chainlink’s oracles by DeFi projects boosts its credibility among institutional investors. Week 2, April 2025 Late Q1 reports stronger-than-expected adoption within enterprise ecosystems. LINK rebounds slightly from its before-tax season volatility, trading between $50 and $60. Integration with platforms using AI-driven engines like Lightchain AI further strengthens its backbone. Mid-2025 By June 2025, Lightchain AI’s testnet deployment fully synergizes with Chainlink’s smart contract solutions. This alignment propels LINK to the $65 to $75 range, fueled by speculation around Lightchain’s contribution to on-chain intelligence and advanced governance technologies. End of 2025 Closing the year, LINK could reach $80 to $90, reflecting increased demand for intelligent oracle solutions in an AI-powered blockchain ecosystem. If Lightchain AI achieves anticipated partnerships, LINK might even test the $100 mark, particularly with sentiment shifts during the bull market. Lightchain AI and Chainlink—a perfect pair? Innovation thrives at the intersection of groundbreaking technologies, and Lightchain AI’s Proof of Intelligence might open new doors for Chainlink’s data oracle dominance. Chainlink could: Enhance Efficiency: By leveraging AI-optimized data streams powered by Lightchain’s AIVM. Enable Smarter Contracts: Using more precise decision-making models sharpened by PoI’s machine-learning consensus. Accelerate Growth: Accessing Lightchain’s ecosystem might reduce operational inefficiencies while increasing scalability. The AI-blockchain change is bigger than ever The crypto sector is a playground for innovators—and Lightchain AI is rewriting the rules.

The new legislation could significantly boost crypto investment despite its lack of guidance and clear implementation strategies. Czech Republic Abolishes Capital Gains Tax On Bitcoin Prime Minister Petr Fiala announced the news, adding that the proposal, supported by Chamber of Deputies member Jiri Havranek, will help reduce the burden on taxpayers. The proposed amendment exempts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from capital gains tax. “No capital gains tax on bitcoin has just been passed in The Czech Republic with all members of the parliament voting for it.” The measures align with the Czech Republic’s efforts to streamline cryptocurrency regulations and foster a more crypto-friendly environment. The Czech Republic's Prime Minister stated on X, “A new time test will apply that guarantees that if you hold cryptocurrencies for more than three years, their sale will not be taxed. We make life easier for people and support modern technologies.” Pavel Rusnak, co-founder of SatoshiLabs, the company behind the Trezor Wallet, shed some light on the amendment, adding it was passed by 169 votes, with almost all parliamentarians backing it. Under the policy, investors will not be required to pay capital gains tax on profits from the sale of BTC and other cryptocurrencies if they meet two conditions. The total gross income from the sale of crypto assets in a year must not exceed CZK 100,000, and the investor must hold the assets for more than three years. The exemption for cryptocurrencies is similar to the existing tax exemption for securities, part of ongoing discussions about reforms in crypto taxation in the country, intended to align with EU regulations. Previously, profits from crypto transactions were subject to a capital gains tax rate that varied between 0% and 19%, depending on the nature of gains and other factors. However, the authorities have not released additional guidance on implementing the new rules. This means taxpayers must rely on general principles. Without a dedicated definition of digital assets in the Income Tax Act, the exemption could apply to various crypto holdings. Global Crypto Taxation Policies Tax policies on crypto transactions vary significantly across the globe. For example, in the US, capital gains tax on crypto and other digital assets ranges from 15% to 20%, depending on income brackets. Italy considered raising the tax on crypto transactions above 2,000 euros to 42%. However, the government ultimately settled on a 28% tax rate. Russia recently classified crypto as a taxable property, with mining income now taxed based on market value, allowing crypto miners to deduct expenses while capping personal income tax on crypto-related earnings at 15%.

The cryptocurrency recently had a historic moment when it crossed the $100,000 mark, becoming worth six figures for the first time. Analysts at the blockchain intelligence platform CryptoQuant revealed in a weekly report that this growth has been driven by the broader adoption of Bitcoin among institutions and corporations, especially after the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and improving regulatory clarity. Institutional Adoption Drives BTC Growth According to CryptoQuant, the surge in Bitcoin’s realized cap reflects a significant influx of investment and a growing confidence in the cryptocurrency as a reliable investment asset. Bitcoin is increasingly becoming integrated into traditional financial systems, and this development is paving the way for more liquidity to move into the ecosystem. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January created a regulated and accessible avenue for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to BTC without the hassle of directly owning the asset. These products now own over a million BTC with billions of dollars in trading volume. “Indeed, this year’s Bitcoin price rally has been driven by large investors buying. On-chain data reveals large Bitcoin investors increased their holdings by a net 275k Bitcoin so far in 2024, reaching a record high of 16.4 million Bitcoin,” CryptoQuant stated. Bitcoin’s Utility Expands Besides U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, institutions like the business intelligence firm MicroStrategy have increased their BTC holdings significantly since the start of the year. MicroStrategy held 189,000 BTC by January, but the firm’s latest announcements reveal that the holdings have surged to 402,100. Other U.S.-based companies like the healthcare technology provider Semler Scientific have also adopted BTC as a strategic reserve asset, resulting in their continuous accumulation of the cryptocurrency. As corporations continue to buy BTC, crypto exchanges are reporting notable spikes in their average BTC and Tether (USDT) deposits. Average bitcoin deposits across all exchanges rose from 0.36 BTC last year to 1.65 BTC currently, while USDT deposits grew from $19,600 to $230,000. Meanwhile, new use cases on the Bitcoin network, like the Runes protocol, have expanded the former’s utility beyond being a store of value, enabling the minting of tokens directly on the blockchain.

Van de Poppe tells his 748,300 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are set to rally as profits generated from investing or trading Bitcoin ( BTC ) are channeled to the rest of the crypto ecosystem. According to the widely followed trader and analyst, most of the altcoins are at record lows against their Bitcoin pairs. “This means that there’s still a massive upward run to be made from those altcoins. Many of them need to go up 4x against Bitcoin to meet the levels of earlier this year. The altcoin markets have been in a bear market for the entire year. That’s insane!” Van de Poppe further says that the rallying of altcoins is preceded by a rally in Bitcoin. “It’s basically just a confidence play where Bitcoin breaks through its resistance and has a significant run, after which it stalls, consolidates, and people who have been making a significant amount of profit on Bitcoin are rotating toward the other parts of the ecosystem – Ethereum and altcoins.” Bitcoin is trading at $99,169 at time of writing, up by less than a percentage point over the past 14 days. Ethereum ( ETH ) is trading at $4,010 at time of writing, up by around 22% over the last 14 days. In the Ethereum ecosystem, the widely followed analyst says that the second-largest crypto asset by market cap will rally first followed by the Ethereum-based large-cap altcoins. “Smaller caps will follow at a later point, but the return on investment will be significantly higher.” Van de Poppe says that over the coming six to 12 months, Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin.

In its recent Belt and Road Forum, the officials earmarked the country’s many crypto trails and regulations as one of its strengths in the face of uncertainties. While the euphoria of Trump’s re-election has been powering Bitcoin for a while, the officials are wary of his decisions. Chairman of the think tank Silk Road Economic Development Research Center, Joseph Chan discussed Trump’s unpredictable nature. “Trump is unpredictable. He may change his mind tomorrow; you never know,” he said. Chan was also one of the organizers and panelists at the recent Web3 and digital economy event. However, he believes the country’s consistent regulation is a win, noting that it is the right approach. Hong Kong officials discuss blockchain at its Belt and Road forum The Belt and Road Forum is a series of events held in Hong Kong to push the Belt and Road initiatives. The event discusses the promotion of trade and development among select regions. Hong Kong has been a driver of this initiative, showcasing its role in cross-border payments facilitation. The local government has also often talked about the role that blockchain could play in achieving the initiative. In his opening remarks, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu talked about tokenization. In the speech delivered via a video, he noted that tokenization, which requires putting real-life assets on a blockchain, is gaining influence in the finance industry in Hong Kong. He also included blockchain’s ability to help its cross-border payment push, the same key topics that were discussed during the Fintech week in October. “Our robust capital support forms a solid foundation to foster the digital economy. This is bolstered by a vibrant fintech ecosystem encompassing over 1,100 companies,” Lee said. Hong Kong has been making a big push into the Web3 industry following its recent failure to make headway during the pandemic. Big companies pulled out of the program citing issues related to the regulatory uncertainty in the region. While it released a new mandatory modality to solve any issues related to regulations on the part of the government, the program has not been as successful as expected. It has raised eyebrows among crypto participants, seeing few applicants. Chan acknowledges the need for a regulatory shift In his statement, Chan highlighted that Hong Kong needed a regulatory shift to catch up with other countries. Meanwhile, the United States is on its way with the recent appointment of Paul Atkins as the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman. With Gensler billed to step down with the outgoing administration, the market will breathe a sigh of relief following the appointment of pro-crypto Atkins. However, Chan noted that Hong Kong is still quite young in the crypto industry. Regardless, he feels Hong Kong has what it takes to lead globally. Chan said it would happen eventually, but he doesn’t see it happening in Trump’s regime. Chan said Trump taking office will give the United States an upper hand. “Because the policy suddenly eased with Trump taking office, the US may have an upper hand in the next three years,” he said. Chan believes that in 10 years, it will be a new dawn for the industry, and Hong Kong could play a bigger role. Hong Kong’s regulation appears fair, and has been tipped to attract investors because it promises protection, Chan noted. Founder and CEO of Red Date technology, He Yifan said that “if [mainland] China doesn’t open up to crypto before Trump leaves office, then it probably won’t ever open up.” China currently holds the second most Bitcoin, behind only the United States. Most of the assets were confiscated as proceeds of crime.

On December 5, Whale Alert reported that within the last 24 hours “22,018,660 XRP worth $50,355,056 was being transferred from Binance to unknown wallet.” The price of XRP has surged significantly since November, breaking through the $1 and $2 levels before it faced resistance moving toward $3. XRP is currently up an impressive 24.61% so far in December. This upsurge has taken XRP up in the crypto rankings, and it is currently the third-largest cryptocurrency, with a market valuation of $139 billion.

DTX Exchange (DTX), Sui (SUI), and Stellar (XLM) are appealing to investors looking to make huge profits in the current market. Leading the pack is DTX, a presale cryptocurrency hosted on a hybrid trading platform that blends CEX and DEX. Meanwhile, SUI and XLM have recorded their respective breakthroughs in the DeFi and cross-border payments sectors, and they continue to gain traction. Read on to know why DTX, a new crypto coin, could lead the other crypto gems in dominating this bull cycle! DTX Exchange: The Revolutionary Presale Cryptocurrency Platform Transforming Hybrid Trading DTX Exchange is a new hybrid trading platform that does not conform to the norms of the crypto sector. Instead, the developers blended CEX and DEX’s best features and elements to develop an advanced trading platform. Interestingly, the new crypto is the trendiest DeFi coin, and as a result, it could dominate the industry and compete with SUI and XLM. Unlike the established exchange protocols, DTX Exchange’s trading protocol will consist of wallet-based solutions and non-custodial storage. Users can trade up to 120,000 assets across stocks, forex, bonds, ETFs, and cryptos via a blended wallet without requiring traditional bank accounts. Additionally, DTX Exchange’s non-custodial storage solutions will avoid the involvement of centralized authority with assets and funds. In that context, DTX Exchange is now on track to revolutionize the $10 billion global online trading sector. Hence, experts believe the new exchange-based project will outpace established platforms. Its underlying token, DTX, has been selling out in presale, raising over $9.4 million in early funding. With this remarkable performance, the presale cryptocurrency ranks as 2024’s best presale. With its huge growth potential, DTX is expected to outshine SUI and XLM in the crypto market. Sui Launchpad: Powering SUI’s Growth and Attracting Investors Amidst Bullish Market Republic and the Sui Foundation launched Sui Launchpad, a platform designed for private market assets, in partnership with DeLorean Labs. DeLorean Labs will be the first token issuer on the Sui Launchpad. Meanwhile, SUI is showing remarkable growth, gaining by around 14% on December 3, 2024, after the launch of Sui Launchpad. Moreover, the surge was also catalyzed by a breakout from a bullish head-and-shoulders price pattern, with the potential to rally 60% to hit $5.51. Since SUI is trading above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with an RSI of 61, it is poised for more gains. Furthermore, over $40 million in outflows from exchanges indicate strong investor confidence, attracting more investors to the asset. SUI was valued at $3.88 on December 5, up 9.42% in the past week. Experts say SUI will rise to $4.72 this month as more developments are implemented on its network. Investors are also buying DTX, a new presale cryptocurrency, which promises huge profits once it launches on mainstream markets. Stellar’s Cross-Border Payment Solutions Shine, Pushing XLM’s Price Higher Stellar is not a stranger to crypto space. Renowned for its efficient cross-border payment solutions, Stellar has developed a massive ecosystem that links banks, individuals, and payment processors. With its focus on low-cost transactions, the ecosystem remains a strong option for investors looking for steady growth. On that note, Félix, Bitso, and the Stellar network collaborated recently to enhance cross-border remittances targeting US-based Latino immigrants, as highlighted in a recent report. By blending blockchain technology and USDC stablecoin, the collaboration offers cheaper, quicker, and safer strategies for remitting money to the Latin American region. Nonetheless, Stellar’s maturity could restrict XLM’s upside momentum. While it continues to innovate, the room for a massive 20x surge is left for new crypto coins like DTX, which is more agile. XLM was valued at $0.4905 on December 5, 2024, up 2.78% in the past week. Analysts believe XLM is a gem in the current bull cycle and will surge to $0.5322 this month as more developments are implemented on its network. DTX, SUI, and XLM: Top Crypto Gems Dominating the Bull Market! In the appealing crypto bull market, DTX Exchange (DTX), Sui (SUI), and Stellar (XLM) stand out as promising gems that will deliver huge ROI for investors. While SUI and XLM record significant gains, DTX is shining and leaving them in its wake. The presale cryptocurrency is poised to dominate the market due to its massive growth potential. DTX is available in Stage 6 of its public presale, valued at $0.12, and has delivered 500% profit for early buyers who purchased it at $0.02. Furthermore, Stage 6 investors will enjoy a 67% ROI once the token is listed on major exchanges.

Despite losing majority of the gains made in the last few days, ADA bulls seem to be targeting higher price levels Looking at the daily chart for ADA, there hasn’t been much change. The key support area to watch is between $0.644 and $0.94, which is important due to Fibonacci retracement levels, especially in a potential Wave 4 correction. If ADA falls below $0.644, it could signal the end of the current uptrend. Potential for Higher Prices A possible target range for the next price surge is between $1.72 and $2.95 , depending on whether the price continues its current uptrend or completes a correction. A higher low and higher high are expected before the top is reached. Micro Support Levels For shorter time frames , the key micro support zone is between $1.11 and $1.21. As long as the price stays above $1.11, the expectation for an upside breakout remains valid. A break below $1.11 could lead to a short-term bearish scenario, but the overall trend remains up as long as it stays above the critical $0.644 level. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction: Will the ‘Omega Candle’ Drive BTC to $1 Million? , Key Price Levels to Watch $1.11: Micro support level, the pivot point for potential upside. $1.24: A break above this level could signal the start of the next wave up. $1.32 – $1.33: Further confirmation would come from breaking the previous high. $1.49+: This is the next upside target area if the price continues to rise. What’s Next? If ADA breaks the $1.11 level, the bullish pattern will lose strength. However, if the price holds, we could see a breakout toward the higher targets. It’s important to watch for clear breakout signals before focusing on smaller time frames for potential price action. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Notably, a top analyst recently highlighted that as the XRP noted a slight retreat, many investors took the opportunity to buy the dip, signaling long-term confidence in the asset. Besides, it also comes as Brad Garlinghouse recently gave an interview with 60 Minutes regarding the crypto industry’s fight for regulatory clarity in the US. Ripple Whales Buy 120M XRP Sparking Optimism The XRP has noted a strong rally recently, nearing the $2.9 level this week, amid soaring investors’ optimism. However, like the other traditional as well as digital assets, the surge was not without some pullbacks. For context, the crypto has retreated from the $2.9 level to as low as $2.2 in the last 24 hours, as traders appear to be taking a pause. However, amid this, top crypto market expert Ali Martinez has highlighted a bullish sign for the crypto. In a recent X post, the analyst said that as the XRP price dropped to the $2.2 level, Ripple whales took the opportunity to buy the dip. He noted that the whales have purchased more than 120 million XRP recently, worth around $288 million. Source: Ali Martinez, X This massive XRP whales’ buying trend also highlights the growing market confidence in the asset. In addition, it also sparked optimism over further gains ahead, potentially sending the crypto to a new ATH in the coming days. In addition, the recent interview of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse with 60 Minutes, which is scheduled to air on Sunday, December 8, is expected to fuel further optimism. Garlinghouse, in a recent X post, said that “- the interview I gave with 60 Minutes about crypto’s fight for regulatory clarity in the US will air live this Sunday, Dec 8.” Will Brad Garlinghouse’s Interview Impact Market Sentiment? As Brad Garlinghouse confirmed his interview with 60 Minutes, speculations are soaring over its potential implications on XRP as well as the broader crypto market. For context, pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli notes that while the show’s audience, mainly “Boomers”, may not be crypto-savvy, they hold significant financial influence. This has fueled speculations over the upcoming move by the Ripple whales. Rispoli also said that the interview’s editing and tone could sway market sentiment, leaving many hoping for a positive spin. Considering that, the interview’s outcome is eagerly awaited by the crypto community. Meanwhile, this also comes amid a time when the broader market is expecting pro-crypto regulations in the US under Donald Trump’s presidency. Besides, the resignation announcement of the US SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whom many deem as an anti-crypto regulator, has added to the sentiment. However, the recent US SEC appointment of its lead attorney in the Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit as the Chief Litigation Counsel has weighed on the sentiment. Despite that, XRP price today was up more than 6% and exchanged hands at $2.44. Its one-day trading volume dropped 10% to $12 billion, while XRP Futures Open Interest rose 6% to $3.74 billion. Considering all these aspects, the future momentum for XRP looks bright. In addition, top crypto market analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has recently shared a bold forecast for Ripple’s native crypto. In a recent X post, the analyst hints at an XRP price rally to $27 ahead, which could pave the way for the crypto to hit $130 in the coming days.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 13:11:00

He was arrested in August at a Paris airport and subsequently charged with multiple counts related to failing to prevent the spread of extremist and terrorist content on the messaging platform. Durov was accompanied by his lawyers, David-Olivier Kaminski and Christophe Ingrain, to attend the hearing at 10 a.m. CET. According to an anonymous source familiar with the proceedings, his questioning centered on Telegram’s alleged use for illicit transactions. When approached by Agence France-Presse (AFP) for comments, Durov declined to provide further details, expressing trust in the French justice system without elaborating on the specifics of the case. The Telegram head, originally from Russia, left his home country after Telegram was banned from 2018 to 2021. His departure came after a standoff with the Russian government, which demanded user data from Telegram, a request Durov refused. He later became a French citizen in 2021, though he had resided in Dubai for many years prior to his arrest. In Dubai, he was known as the youngest and richest billionaire in the Middle East before his legal troubles began in France. Pavel Durov’s court charges The legal saga surrounding Durov began on August 24 when he was temporarily detained at Le Bourget airport in Paris. He was subsequently released on bail of approximately $6 million but remains under restrictions, with authorities barring him from leaving France until March 2025. The Paris prosecutor’s office, known as the Parquet de Paris, officially issued preliminary charges against Telegram founder Pavel Durov on August 28. The charges accuse Durov of facilitating a platform that enables illicit transactions. If convicted, Durov could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of $550,000. The investigation into Telegram began in February 2024, with French authorities launching a preliminary probe into the messaging platform. The inquiry escalated to a judicial investigation on July 8, more than a month before Durov’s arrest in Paris. Since his arrest, Durov hasn’t made the “child pornography” case filed against him any easier. In early November, per a Forbes report, he announced the launch of a controversial initiative to cover the cost of IVF treatments for women under 38 who wish to conceive using his sperm. The initiative follows statements Durov made in July, revealing that he has fathered over 100 children across 12 countries through sperm donations over the past 15 years. He also plans to “open-source” his DNA, allowing his biological children to connect more easily. Durov explained that he was once encouraged by a staff member at an IVF clinic to view sperm donation as his “civic duty” to assist couples struggling to conceive. Telegram improves efforts to combat illegal content In other news, Telegram recently unveiled a new partnership with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK-based charity specializing in the identification and removal of child sexual abuse imagery. The collaboration is part of Telegram’s ongoing efforts to rehabilitate the platform’s reputation regarding illegal content, particularly child exploitation material. Telegram has agreed to deploy IWF’s tools and data to detect, disrupt, remove, and block instances of child sexual abuse material. According to the IWF, thousands of instances of CSAM have been identified on Telegram since 2022. The charity, which operates as a global leader in the fight against online child sexual abuse, will now provide Telegram with unique digital fingerprints of known illegal content, helping the platform better identify and prevent the spread of abusive material. Derek Ray-Hill, interim CEO of IWF, hailed the partnership as a “transformational first step,” emphasizing that the initiative is only the beginning of a longer journey to eliminate online sexual abuse material. “We look forward to seeing what further steps we can take together to create a world in which the spread of online sexual abuse material is virtually impossible,” Ray-Hill said. Remi Vaughn, Telegram’s head of Press and Media Relations, echoed Ray-Hill’s statement, affirming IWF’s tools would enhance Telegram’s existing content moderation mechanisms.

In this piece, we will explore the five altcoins to buy that might transform $1,000 into $100,000 by December’s conclusion. Every one of these tokens signifies a distinctive mix of community-focused attraction, creative applications, and speculative possibilities. Altcoins to Buy to Turn $1,000 Into $100,000 by the End of December Let’s examine the reasons GOAT, MTAUR, HAIR, SHIB, and TRUMP might be your next significant investment. 1. GOAT BASED ($GOAT) Currently priced at $62.02, $GOAT has seen an increase of 6113.49% in just one day, reflecting a massive surge in popularity and speculation. As one of the best meme coins to buy in December, GOAT was created by Truth Terminal, embodying the blend of AI, finance, and meme culture. $GOAT’s mission is to challenge the boundaries of AI autonomy and decentralized systems, reflecting a deep, transcendent power that appeals to a loyal following. Its rapid growth is likely fueled by the chaotic, unpredictable nature of meme coins and the allure of large volume investments. Potential: The sudden rise of $GOAT is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it shows the immense power of meme coins to draw attention and investment. On the other, such a volatile rise may indicate a speculative bubble. If the community and AI-driven narrative can maintain momentum, $GOAT could continue to grow, but caution is advised given its speculative nature. 2. Minotaurus ($MTAUR): Top Gaming Altcoins to Buy At $0.00006002, with early participants who bought at 0.000040 USDT witnessing approximately 50% growth in their portfolio, Minotaurus (MTAUR) offers a promising presale opportunity. The token is deeply embedded in the casual gaming space, providing real utility in unlocking features like avatar customization and access to exclusive zones. Its unique in-game applications and the 70% savings from its future listing price, make it an enticing altcoin to buy for early adopters. Potential: Minotaurus’ focus on sustainability with tokenomics like the cliff and vesting system helps ensure long-term stability. Given the growing $15 billion casual gaming market, MTAUR could see significant adoption and value increase. The current presale phase, coupled with a 100,000 USDT giveaway, adds to its appeal, providing a solid chance for investors to capitalize on potential future gains. 3. HairDAO ($HAIR) Priced at $0.0111016, with a 238.65% increase, $HAIR is not just a meme coin but also a movement, advocating for a healthier crypto ecosystem. As a DAO focused on leadership within the crypto space, HairDAO combines political insights with blockchain innovation, emphasizing regulatory clarity and innovation. Its fun and impactful approach could attract both meme coin enthusiasts and those looking for altcoins to buy with a solid backing. Potential: HairDAO’s appeal lies in its connection to real-world crypto policy advocacy, which could help it stand out in a crowded market. As meme coins become more integrated into the broader crypto ecosystem, $HAIR could benefit from its unique positioning, especially with support from influential figures in the space. 4. Shiba Inu on Base (SHIB) At a present price of $0.01955, experiencing a 501.53% increase in a single day, $SHIB utilizes the scalability and minimal fees of the Base blockchain. The initiative merges the fun, community-focused spirit of the Shiba Inu meme with the cutting-edge attributes of the Base blockchain. This innovative meme cryptocurrency seeks to establish an entertaining, interactive environment for its community while differentiating itself from other meme coins. Potential: Embracing innovative elements in the Base blockchain could give SHIB a competitive advantage, drawing in users who appreciate minimal transaction costs and significant scalability. Its link to the larger Shiba Inu community could enhance demand, turning it into a potentially profitable investment. 5. Crypto President Trump (TRUMP) Priced at $0.008777 with a 512.84% rise, TRUMP appears on our altcoins to buy list as both a speculative investment and a cultural icon. The project’s appeal is rooted in the unique blend of political and meme culture, capitalizing on Trump’s enduring influence. As a collectible and speculative asset, TRUMP offers a way to engage with both communities while making speculative investments, pausing as one of the top trump coins to buy in December. Potential: The project’s dual role as both an investment and a cultural artifact could attract a diverse audience. While its value is highly speculative and depends on broader political and cultural trends, $TRUMP’s market position as a unique meme coin could provide substantial returns for investors willing to take the risk. Final Thoughts: Managing Risk and Reward in Early-Stage Altcoins to Buy Putting money into early-stage cryptocurrencies such as these carries considerable risk and potential gain. Although the appeal of substantial gains is enticing, the fluctuating and speculative characteristics of these ventures indicate that losses can also be a genuine risk. Therefore, it is important to conduct your own research and risk assessment before diversifying your assets. It is uncertain to transform $1,000 into $100,000 by the end of December, but with the appropriate strategy, these altcoins to buy may provide significant gains.

With Bitcoin ($ BTC ) crossing the monumental $100,000 mark and Ethereum ($ ETH ) reclaiming $4,000, retail traders are diving headfirst into speculative assets like memecoins. Source: coinmarketcap.com Adding to the bullish narrative, the Santa Claus Rally—a historical pattern of seasonal crypto strength—has further boosted sentiment, creating fertile ground for tokens like Bonk ($ BONK ) and Dogwifhat ($ WIF ). Both tokens, part of the Solana ($ SOL ) ecosystem, are mid-tier memecoins that encapsulate everything thrilling—and risky—about crypto speculation. The just-updated CMC Altcoin Index Chart above illustrates the dramatic acceleration of altcoin activity, as market enthusiasm shifts from Bitcoin dominance to broader speculative plays. So, what sets BONK and WIF apart, and which one is better positioned for short- and long-term gains? Let’s break down their fundamentals, technicals, and trading strategies. Fundamentals: Two Faces of Speculation Despite their shared roots in the Solana ecosystem, BONK and WIF follow very different narratives. BONK markets itself as a community-driven token with utility aspirations, while WIF is a self-proclaimed scarcity-driven memecoin relying purely on hype. Both have attracted considerable attention, but their fundamentals reveal distinct strengths and vulnerabilities. Market Cap and Age: BONK: Launched in December 2022, BONK has climbed to a market cap of $3.28 billion, driven largely by its grassroots community and ties to Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. WIF: Debuting in early 2024, WIF has overtaken BONK with a $3.54 billion market cap, fueled by its viral appeal and tighter supply narrative. Tokenomics and Circulating Supply: BONK: With a mind-boggling 92.71 trillion total tokens, about 81.48% (75.53 trillion) are in circulation. While its widespread airdrop ensured high retail engagement, the enormous supply risks dilution over time. WIF: Featuring a drastically smaller supply of just 998.84 million tokens, WIF plays the scarcity card well, making it particularly appealing to speculative traders. Holder Distribution: BONK: While its airdrop created a robust community of small holders, top wallets still dominate a large portion, raising questions about centralization risks. WIF: Transparency remains a sticking point. With 25% of its supply in the hands of top wallets, traders are effectively betting against whales. Utility and Use Cases: BONK: Deeply integrated into Solana’s NFT and DeFi ecosystems, BONK aspires to be more than just a meme. It’s positioned as a liquidity token for DEXs and a payment token for NFTs, though adoption is still nascent. WIF: Let’s not sugarcoat it—WIF exists purely for speculative mania. Its lack of utility makes it a short-term play, but that’s also where its explosive potential lies. Key Takeaway: BONK’s focus on integration with Solana’s ecosystem gives it a thin veneer of utility, while WIF leans unapologetically on scarcity and hype. Both are risky, but BONK’s fundamentals offer slightly more longevity if memecoin mania fizzles. Technical Analysis: Dissecting the Charts The charts tell the story of speculative assets like BONK and WIF better than their fundamentals ever could. Using daily, 4-hour, and weekly charts, we’ll highlight actionable levels and the potential for larger moves, referencing the accompanying annotated visuals. Daily Charts: Key Levels and Momentum $BONK Daily: Price: $0.000043 Support: BONK reclaimed the critical $0.000043 zone, previously a strong resistance level. This flip to support signals renewed buying interest. Volume: Selling pressure has diminished, as noted in the retracement after the ATH at $0.00006, suggesting quiet accumulation. RSI: Cooling at 57.4, offering room for another leg higher Targets: Breaking above $0.000045 could target $0.00005, with $0.00006 as a make-or-break resistance. $WIF Daily : Price: $3.47 Resistance: WIF faces heavy resistance at $3.56-$3.58, marked as the last key hurdle before a potential rally to its ATH. Volume: Recent spikes confirm strong defense of $2.91 (now support). RSI: Holding at 58.1, signaling healthy momentum. Targets: Clearing $3.58 could lead to a retest of $4.85 (ATH), with $5 as a psychological extension. 4-Hour Charts: Short-Term Momentum Short-term charts reveal immediate trends and potential reversals: BONK: Consistent higher lows signal an ongoing uptrend, but overbought RSI near $0.000045 warns of potential consolidation. WIF: Cleaner structure, with solid accumulation zones near $3.00-$3.50, making it a steadier near-term candidate. Weekly Charts: Long-Term Potential BONK: A move above $0.00006 would open the door to $0.00008-$0.0001, provided Bitcoin’s momentum fuels sustained altcoin mania. WIF: The weekly chart shows a potential third test of $4.85, often a precursor to explosive breakouts. Long-term targets sit at $6-$7, assuming memecoin fervor persists into late 2025. Strategies: Beyond the Breakout Memecoins thrive on speculation, and both BONK and WIF offer enticing setups for traders with high risk tolerance. Refer to annotated levels on the charts for precise entries and exits. BONK Trading Strategy: Short-Term: Buy above $0.000045, target $0.00005-$0.00006, with a stop-loss at $0.000041. Long-Term: Accumulate during consolidations below $0.00005. If it clears $0.00006, watch for an extended rally toward $0.0001 by late 2025, fueled by continued Solana adoption. WIF Trading Strategy: Short-Term: Enter above $3.58, targeting $4.85-$5, with a stop-loss at $3.40. Long-Term: Accumulate near $3.00-$3.50, aiming for a breakout above $4.85. Long-term targets sit at $6-$7 if memecoins sustain their hype cycle. Risk Management: Don’t let the Santa Claus Rally blind you to risks. BONK below $0.000041 or WIF below $3.40 could signal sharp corrections. Summary: Altseason’s Speculative Sweet Spot Memecoins are the ultimate high-risk, high-reward trade in this speculative altcoin season. BONK and WIF represent two distinct approaches to memecoin dominance: BONK: A utility-driven token banking on Solana’s broader growth. It’s a longer-term play, with potential upside tied to ecosystem adoption. WIF: A scarcity-driven moonshot for short-term speculators. It’s a pure adrenaline trade, with its fate tied to hype cycles. As the CMC Altcoin Season Index (85/100) suggests, the market is primed for speculative surges. If memecoin mania persists into 2025, both BONK and WIF could deliver massive returns—but only for traders with discipline, patience, and a willingness to ride the wildest part of the bull market.

BTC price is rising back above $100K while ETH prices have already achieved $4000 resistance. With this, memecoins like Mog Coin (MOG), FLOKI (FLOKI), and a few more have geared up to lay down a strong rally. Mog Coin (MOG) Price Analysis MOG price is trading within a discovery phase after the token smashed a new ATH at $0.000004022, just a few moments before. The platform witnessed a massive influx of liquidity as the volume surged from levels below $100 million to over $300 million in just a few hours. The major catalyst is said to be its listing on Coinbase, attracting new traders onto the platform. As seen in the above chart, the MOG price is reading within a discovery phase but is facing some bearish pressure after rising above 1.4 FIB at $0.0000039. On the other hand, the RSI remains stuck within the upper bands or the bullish region, testing the upper threshold and trying to enter the overbought zone. However, the levels have never entered the zone since inception and if this move materialises, then the MOG price rally could hit higher targets above $0.0000055 soon. FLOKI (FLOKI) Price Analysis The FLOKI price is breaking above a crucial price level, which is believed to attract investors with huge liquidity. The token surged, forming new highs in recent times and now that the token has gained back the bullish momentum, the price is believed to surge heavily and form a new ATH in the next few days. The FLOKI price consolidated within a narrow range for a while and as the markets entered the last few weeks of the year, the token’s volatility has increased. The Bollinger bands have contracted after a massive expansion, suggesting the volatility has dropped heavily. Besides, the MACD is about to undergo a bullish crossover as the selling pressure fades off. Therefore, the FLOKI price is believed to launch a bullish attack and for a new ATH at $0.0004 soon.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|FLOKI|MOG,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 13:27:02

Built on Ethereum, this ERC-20 token blends the appeal of meme coins with real-world utility through blockchain gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi). Yeti Go, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game, is at the heart of Yeti Ouro’s ecosystem. Players use YETIO tokens to participate in races, unlock customizations, and earn rewards. The game’s high-quality design, powered by Unreal Engine, creates an engaging experience that’s drawing in gamers and investors alike.

This week’s report provides several different attacks as a way of bringing greater attention to the threats that remain and the dynamic nature of cyber security in the crypto space. DMM Bitcoin’s Collapse: $320 Million Stolen Japan’s leading crypto exchange, DMM Bitcoin , suffered a devastating security breach in May 2024, losing 4,500 Bitcoins worth $320 million. The attack forced the exchange to shut down operations in October after receiving an improvement order from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA). To address the fallout, DMM Bitcoin’s parent company, DMM.com, provided ¥55 billion to compensate users. Meanwhile, the exchange has started transferring its remaining assets to SBI VC Trade, a process set to be completed by March 2025. However, this move comes with restrictions on margin trading and transaction fees, highlighting the challenges of recovery after such a massive loss. Coins.ph Hacked: A Social Media Breach On December 2, the Filipino cryptocurrency exchange Coins.ph fell victim to a social media hack. Cybercriminals hijacked the exchange’s X (formerly Twitter) account , promoting a fake token called $COINSPH. They used advanced social engineering techniques to trick users into investing. The attackers exploited the Solana network , known for its low transaction fees and fast processing, to build a convincing scam resembling a multi-level marketing scheme. Fortunately, Coins.ph acted quickly, regaining control of its account and removing the fraudulent posts within hours. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, the highlights soon turned into criticism and legal threats after the token crashed within a few hours of the launch due to mass selling. Many have claimed this to be insider trading, but the Hawk coin team claims it is the snipers. Regardless, the holders became the victims as many lost their entire investment. However, a popular YouTube investigator, Coffeezilla, brought a totally unique revelation to this Hawk Tuah Girl memecoin scam, claiming that the reality is different from what many claim. Hawk Tuah Girl Memecoin Scam Didn’t Rug $50M But $3M The Hawk Tuah Girl Memecoin Scam unfolded when the Hawk coin’s price and market cap surged to a high on December 4 but dropped 91% within three hours. The on-chain report revealed the mass selling of the tokens from the top token holders, which raised suspicion of insider trading. The Bubblemaps reports confirmed that 96% of the Hawk meme coin supply is intertwined and clustered in one single place, which resulted in mass selling. With much such information, a few analysts, like Nirsex, claimed that this Hawk Tuah Girl memecoin scam probably made $50M to Hailey Welch. However, that is controversial, as the YouTube investigator claims that ‘She didn’t rug $50M.’ However, this does not also mean that there was no scam, as the investor asserted there was a scam, especially in the tokenomics of the token. Through an X post and a full 24-minute YouTube video, the YouTuber Coffeezilla claimed that she did rug for 500M and did not profit $50M. Instead, she might have made around $1M in fees scam. More importantly, this Hawk Tuah Girl Memecoin Scam took place as the team presold a few million tokens to ‘strategic investors’ who crashed the price with mass selling. Can yall stop these insane headlines. She didn’t rug for 500M and she didn’t profit $50M. FFS. 1. The team presold a few million to “strategic advisors” who sold early. 2. The token got sniped. 3. LP made >$1m on 15% fees according to the meteora tracker. https://t.co/drp6RlGog0 — Coffeezilla (@coffeebreak_YT) December 6, 2024 Breaking Down Coffeezilla’s Report on Hawk Coin Scam The popular Youtuber Coffeezilla, with 638k followers, interacted with the popular Solana memecoin , Hawk coin team through an X live called “The Hawk Truth.” With that live, the creator interacted with three important people from this Hawk Girl coin project, including Hailey Welch, Howie Mandel, and a person who is actually managing the token. However, the X live remained inconclusive as the team failed to properly answer Coffeezilla’s questions, leading him to claim that “This is the worst tokenomics I have ever seen, and It is a scam. Tokenomics is a scam, that is my opinion.” Presale Led To Mass Selling Ceffeezilla explained the Hawk Tuah Girl memecoin scam in a 24-minute YouTube video. He revealed that the reason behind this crash was that the Hawk coin team released only 3% to the Meteora pool and left the 17% allocation unlocked from day one, which led to early access, making heavy profits for early joiners and sellers. “You guys released 3% to Meteroa while you have 17% percent of the token allocation unlocked day one on from your strategic allocation. Are you guys insane? What do you guys think exactly is going to happen when your insiders get sent their tokens?” More importantly, the team had this presale, which sold millions of tokens to 285 investors per Bubblemaps report. Out of these 89 wallets sold all of their Hawk coin holdings, 47 wallets sold more than 50%, 19 wallets sold less than 50% of the total holdings, and the remaining 130 HODL the token. 1/ We found that 285 investors joined $HAWK presale • 89 wallets sold 100% • 47 wallets sold ≥ 50% • 19 wallets sold • 130 wallets sold 0 Total sold: $3.3M ↓ https://t.co/b3GpKDoHfG — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) December 5, 2024 The YouTube investigator agreed with the stats, claiming that his on-chain analysis had the same result, which is why the token crashed. In this, one crypto trader lost $1.4 Million in just 15 mins as invested right before the token collapsed 91%. Trading Fees Scam Dexscreener data indicates that the biggest sniper has made $1.3M in profits. However, the Hawk coin team made the biggest profit even without the Hawk Tuah Girl memecoin scam as they introduced heavy trading fees of 15%, making almost $3M within 24 hours of the launch. During the X life, Coffeezilla also claimed that they generated millions of dollars in fees while the fans got the rug pulled not only from snipers but from insiders as well. He mentioned that the on-chain data indicates direct transactions from the main account, making 50k, which indicates insider trading. However, the team did not respond to the allegations entirely and joked that they would not sell for just $50K. Nevertheless, they did answer to high fees, revealing that this was required to run the project. Additionally, in an earlier X post, Haley claimed that the high fees were to limit the snipers from mass selling, but that failed. Concluding Findings on the Hawk Tuah Girl Memecoin Scam Overall, the Coffeezilla claims state that apart from the possibility of insider trading, the Hawk Tuah girls and the team have made $2.8M in trading fees, which is a scam itself. More importantly, the token creators fooled the audience as the victims were Hailey Welch’s followers who lacked even basic crypto knowledge. The YouTube creator also showed concerns over transparency, as the team failed to acknowledge their mistakes, especially selling Hawk coins before launch, leading to uncontrolled selling. Another important point highlights that the ownership of the project is unclear as to who owns the profits and in what percentage, creating accountability concerns. However, he also acknowledged that the role of Hayley Welch in the Hawk Tuah Girl memecoin scam is unclear, especially about making $50M.

Can Gensler Use His ‘Lame Duck’ Period to Settle Unfinished Business?,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-vs-sec-whats-next-can-gensler-use-his-lame-duck-period-to-settle-unfinished-business/,"The post Ripple vs. SEC: What’s Next? Can Gensler Use His ‘Lame Duck’ Period to Settle Unfinished Business? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News President-elect Trump recently announced that Paul Atkins will be the new SEC Chair , taking over from the current chair, Gary Gensler, who is set to step down in January . This news has generated significant attention, as many believe Atkins will foster a more crypto-friendly environment. One of the key cases being closely followed is the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case . Experts are now analyzing potential outcomes and how the case could be dismissed. In an interview with Thinking Crypto , Ron Hammond from the Blockchain Association said that he has been speaking with a lot of lawyers from various companies, some involved in lawsuits and others not. The situation is unclear, as the next steps in these cases are still uncertain. For example, in the Coinbase case, things have progressed quite far, and it’s hard to back out now. The SEC argues that these are securities, but some commissioners, like Atkins, are pushing back, saying they no longer agree with that stance. The next steps could involve wrapping up the case, as it conflicts with the current SEC priorities, or perhaps a settlement. However, many lawyers are still unsure how these cases will end. Additionally, the SEC may appeal some of the recent decisions, like the Blockchain Association’s recent win with the dealer rule, which could complicate things further. Will the Ripple vs SEC drama shape XRP’s future? Read XRP price prediction to find out how the case could impact the market! There are also questions about ongoing cases like those with OpenSea and Uniswap. He said that it’s still unclear whether these will lead to full lawsuits or stay in the Wells Notice stage. He added that we would have to wait and see if Congress can pass legislation, particularly in the Senate, which could impact these cases. The expert said that there’s also the possibility that the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, may use the “lame duck” period to push for changes in how the laws are applied, but we are still in a waiting phase. What is ‘Lame Duck’ Period? A “lame duck session” is a meeting of Congress that happens after the November election but before the new Congress begins its term. Lawmakers use this time to address unfinished business or urgent issues. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37334131,https://finbold.com/?p=217712,1733578378,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,This is how Bitcoin (BTC) performed in 2024 so far,https://finbold.com/this-is-how-bitcoin-btc-performed-in-2024-so-far/,"As 2024 comes to a close, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has had an impressive year, highlighted by its all-time high above the coveted $100,000. Several catalysts have been central to this achievement, such as the entry of major Wall Street players into the cryptocurrency space alongside discourse on the asset in the political arena. Bitcoin started the year at approximately $42,200, rallying over 136% year-to-date, marking one of its most bullish annual trends. By press time, the maiden digital asset was trading at $99,930 Bitcoin year-to-date price chart. Source: Finbold The year can be broken into three distinct phases. Bitcoin saw a sharp surge from January to March, breaking past $70,000. This rally was fueled by renewed investor interest and growing institutional adoption, largely driven by the approval of spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) in the United States. The market entered a consolidation phase from April to around September, with Bitcoin fluctuating between $60,000 and $71,000. However, October marked the start of a resurgence in momentum, with Bitcoin blasting through $80,000 and setting its sights on the critical $105,000 resistance level. Catalysts of Bitcoin’s 2024 performance 2024 began with Bitcoin receiving a major mainstream nod following the approval of the spot ETF on January 11, a key event that helped the asset claim its record high above $70,000. Bitcoin proponents highly anticipated the ETF, which they view as a gateway to institutional investors. To this end, BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK ) iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with $50 billion in assets, has been one of the notable ETFs. Although there remains some skepticism regarding Bitcoin, especially concerning its volatility, the ETF is viewed as the asset’s gateway into the traditional finance sector. From there, Bitcoin’s price compressed but experienced an uptick in interest as the asset gained more attention in the political scene around the November U.S. presidential elections . The chatter was initiated after then-Republican nominee Donald Trump attended the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, where he made several promises, including the contentious one of making the digital asset part of the strategic reserve. At the same time, Trump, now the president-elect, promised to replace Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Chair Gary Gensler, who the crypto community has criticized for allegedly stifling the sector’s growth. Interestingly, Gensler has since announced his resignation from the regulator, with Trump nominating pro-crypto Paul Atkins. This move partly contributed to Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 . Generally, Trump’s election and intentions to implement some of his crypto promises have contributed to Bitcoin’s newfound momentum. What next for Bitcoin in 2025 Looking ahead, there remains positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, especially regarding its price movement. As reported by Finbold, banking giant Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick predicted that Bitcoin is likely to trade at $200,000 in 2025, driven by institutional capital inflows into the asset. Of interest is that the bank accurately predicted that Bitcoin would trade at $100,000 before the end of 2024. Bernstein analysts have also shared the same outlook. They believe Bitcoin will hit a cycle high of $200,000 by late 2025, fueled by regulatory clarity and growing institutional adoption. “We remain convinced $100,000 is not the final milestone. We expect Bitcoin to hit a cycle-high of $200,000 in late 2025,” concludes Bernstein. Paul Atkins, a former SEC Chair (2002-2008) is a known advocate for crypto & blockchain technology. He is also the co-chair of the Token Alliance, part of the Chamber for Digital Commerce, focused on digital asset regulation,” the analysts stated. As prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez demonstrated , technical indicators also point to a possible cycle top in 2025. In the last two cycles, Bitcoin took 1,065 days to rise from a market bottom to its peak and 1,430 days to complete a full cycle. If this trend continues, the next peak could occur by October 2025, suggesting the current bull run is just getting started. Bitcoin cycles analysis chart. Source: TradingView In the long run, Bernstein predicts Bitcoin will eventually replace gold as the top ‘store of value,’ becoming a key part of institutional portfolios and corporate treasuries. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has also suggested that Bitcoin is a competitor to gold but not the U.S. dollar.

President-elect Trump wasted no time claiming credit for the surge, celebrating the milestone as proof of his pro-crypto policies. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is gaining investor confidence as it eyes $6,000. At the same time, a new Ethereum-based token, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), is capturing attention, with analysts predicting it could follow Bitcoin's parabolic trajectory in the coming years. Bitcoin Breaks $100K Barrier, Trump Takes All the Credit After weeks of intentionally building up its price, Bitcoin finally swept past six figures on late Wednesday. Bitcoin price was more than $103,000 on Thursday morning. This historical crossing of the Rubicon was a thunderclap through the market, with traders and analysts still excitedly discussing the long-term implications. And Trump, never one to duck the limelight, congratulated ""Bitcoiners"" on Truth Social. ""CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!"" he wrote on the site. Analysts say Trump's pro-crypto stance is the main reason for Bitcoin price surge. They believe his cabinet appointments and regulatory relaxation have given institutional investors hope in the long run. The milestone underscores Bitcoin's gradual transformation into an accepted mainstream asset and its function as a store of value. Ethereum Starts Moving While Bitcoin is in the news, Ethereum is quietly building its argument for long-term growth. Currently trading at $3,719, ETH has risen 51% in the last month. With Microsoft founder Bill Gates joining the pressure on Bitcoin, the developers are rather bullish for Ethereum. Most of them say it may hit $6,000 by mid-2025. Ethereum's move to Ethereum 2.0 has cut energy use while increasing staking incentives, winning over more investors. As it is an essential component of the decentralized finance (DeFi) network and also what underpins non-fungible tokens (NFTs), many developers and institutions prefer Ethereum. Its use and acceptance also make it a prime contender for continued growth. Yeti Ouro: The Next Parabolic Success? While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the market, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is emerging as a potential breakout star. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this new ERC-20 token offers a unique mix of meme appeal and real-world utility. At the heart of the Yeti Ouro ecosystem is Yeti Go, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game. Players use YETIO tokens to compete in races, customize vehicles, and earn rewards. The game’s high-quality graphics and engaging gameplay make it a standout in the P2E market. Yeti Ouro’s deflationary tokenomics set it apart. With a capped supply of 1 billion tokens and a burn mechanism reducing circulation, YETIO creates scarcity that could drive long-term value. The presale has already sold out 80%, raising close to $1 million. Investors are flocking to the project, drawn by its innovative ecosystem and strong growth potential.

Dogecoin price analysis gives out a highly bullish scenario regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has improved up to $0.449 high in the past 24 hours. Side by side, the cryptocurrency gained up to 5.66% of value through the day. The bulls have been leading the market since yesterday. Technical indicators, as well as the price charts, are giving out a bullish verdict with regards to the current price movements. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has a strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is considered a highly volatile coin, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification is advised. However, the coin is expected to touch the $0.249 level by 2025. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.449 as observed over the last 24 hours. Side by side, the presence of strong resistance at the $0.456 mark is yet to be overcomed by DOGE. Will DOGE reach $0.250? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by August 2024. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value of $0.099, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, the robust community support for this specific meme coin can push it to $1 soon. Will DOGE reach $5? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. The market speculates that DOGE will reach the $5 level by 2033. Though the time is considerable, it’s worth holding for handsome profits. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.219 on March 28, 2024, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.66 mark by 2030, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Dogecoin CoinGlass data shows that Dogecoin’s trading volume has surged by more than 76%. The surge is attributed to significant whale activity. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin and expect further upside in the coming days. Dogecoin recorded a 31% gain to lift its price to $0.28 over the weekend, maintaining its bullish momentum. Since November 2021, the token’s current price has been the highest it has ever been. The value of the meme coin has increased by 155%, and it is currently double what it was a month ago. CoinGecko data indicates that Dogecoin has increased by 86% in the past week. The number is still well below the $0.71 mark, which was the peak established in May 2021. Read more about it here .

By 2030, DOGE may reach $1.36. Dogecoin historic price sentiment 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001, but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. Dogecoin traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. In 2023, Dogecoin began trading around $0.08, and closed the year at $0.08955. DOGE began 2024 consolidating around the $0.08 region. The market-wide bull run of March 2024 saw DOGE trading above $0.2, reclaiming its November 2021 levels. After June’s crashing price action, when DOGE plunged to $0.122 from the $0.160 range, July observed a further low of $0.107, but the meme coin recovered back to $0.134 by the end of the month. In August 2024, Dogecoin’s price fell from $0.1216 to $0.1011, and in September, DOGE recovered back to the $0.1282 range. October saw some recovery, as DOGE/USD recovered up to the $0.1759 range by the end of the month, and in November it spiked to $0.4312. At the start of December, DOGE is trading near the $0.440 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-07 13:37:00

In particular, this trend can be attributed to the increasing popularity of Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) denominations, both of which have effectively thrived during significant market weeks. However, as their influence fades, it appears that the Rexas Finance (RXS) market is taking over the reins. The Fall of Solana and Dogecoin in Market Leadership Solana is a strong platform with simple, low-cost transactions that many decentralized applications switched to. However, the numerous instances of the platform being offline or issues with scalability prospects pose significant drawbacks. Existing channels have since grown in popularity, leading many to believe Solana will struggle to lead future bull runs. Another altcoin with a similar backstory is Dogecoin. Although propelled by social media at one point, the account gained significant backing from well-known individuals. Unfortunately, for many who followed the projects due to memes, there was little money to be made - long term due to its low use; the chances of Dogecoin performing another bull run seem minimal with its current situation. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Bull Run Leader in the Making Rexas Finance clearly emerges as one of the projects that will be best placed to lead the next bull run. The presale of the project has been going on for a while and has already accumulated over $21.8 Million, which shows good confidence from the investors. Direct sales of tokens have been featured at $0.125 as it promises good returns for early investors. One of its unique features is its tokenomics model. The model features certain parameters that mitigate and sustain the growth of the project for long-term investment. The model takes a deflationary stance through periodic token burns that decrease the supply and help price appreciation. These facts guarantee that Rexas Finance is not an ordinary token but an all-rounded practical project built to serve the community and become part of the ecosystem. In the crypto industry, security measures and transparency are very important concerns, and Rexas Finance does not disappoint in that regard. The project's Certik audit removes investors' worries about its security and smart contracts. Future listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap will definitely enhance visibility and attract more people, thereby increasing liquidity. This is coupled with the fact that community engagement is another key pillar of the strategy being advanced by Rexas Finance. The project’s $1 million giveaway, among others, has helped build a loyal and engaged community around the industry. Such ground support is important in achieving and building support even through down markets, including adopting the product feature. Market Predictions: RXS Price Projections for 2025 At Stage 9, Rexas Finance is being sold for $0.125, and the next stage will sell for $0.15. The token is getting more popular each day, as the total number of tokens sold is currently at 298 million. There are predictions that when the token is launched, the price will increase to at least $ 1 or even more by the year 2025, thus providing early investors with returns above 10 times the amount invested in the project. This view is quite bullish, considering the impressive fundamentals of the project as well as its community and market-focused strategy. Different from most speculative assets, Rexas Finance's growth is expected to be based on utility, adoption, and constant improvements. The upcoming bull run is expected to favor projects that add credible or tangible value to the crypto space. Rexas Finance will have benefited from its focus on innovation, security, and the community, for it will be primed for the next phase of growth. Key Factors Driving Rexas Finance’s Bull Run Potential There is a net biographical feature in Rexas Finance tokenomics that boosts the price cycles and improves the equilibrium. The $ 1 million giveaway and similar community activities promote active involvement and push for audience loyalty. As the project matures, the most valuable use cases for Rexas Finance will be created through partnerships and the expansion of the ecosystem. These factors collectively lead to the justification of Rexas Finance's chances to be at the fore of the next bull run. Conclusion Having acknowledged Solana and Dogecoin as having made their spot, then the forthcoming bull run will not be left backward by bringing forth projects with value, usability and an active community. Rexas Finance, with its excellent presale figures, is the most appropriate example, as it has an expanding development strategy and a strong base in fundamental factors. To investors in the research for a great level of returns on their investment, Rexas Finance is an opportunity where one can enter the platform at an early stage and will be in a position to come out leading into a profitable 2025.

The December 6 report stated the lack of robust risk management practices among stablecoin issuers, leaving the sector vulnerable to sudden market disruptions. “Stablecoins remain acutely vulnerable to runs in the absence of appropriate risk management standards,” the FSOC stated. The council also noted the market’s extreme concentration, with a single issuer dominating nearly 70% of the $205 billion stablecoin market capitalization. FSOC Calls for Comprehensive Regulation While the report refrained from naming the issuer, data from CoinMarketCap identifies Tether as the leader, holding 66.3% of the market share with a capitalization of $136.8 billion. The FSOC warned that the failure of such a dominant player could ripple through the crypto-asset market and impact traditional financial systems. The council likened this vulnerability to the TerraUSD (UST) collapse in May 2022, where a $2 billion de-pegging event caused the stablecoin’s value to plummet to $0.09, shaking investor confidence globally. The FSOC strongly urged Congress to enact federal legislation to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. The council proposed guidelines to address risks such as payment system inefficiencies, market integrity, and fraud while ensuring consumer protection. “Although a few stablecoin issuers are subject to state-level oversight, many provide limited verifiable information about their reserve management practices,” the report highlighted, adding that the lack of transparency hampers effective market discipline and amplifies systemic risks. Looking Forward According to the FSOC, inaction could force the council to explore alternative measures to mitigate these risks. While welcoming Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework , which mandates stablecoin issuers to hold at least 60% of reserves in European banks, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino expressed concerns about unintended consequences. Ardoino argued that the lending practices of European banks could introduce systemic risks for stablecoin issuers, potentially destabilizing the broader crypto market. As the stablecoin market grows, its inherent risks remain under scrutiny. The FSOC’s call for regulatory action underscores the urgency to balance innovation with financial stability.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 13:55:00

Sacks expressed concern about the policy's negative impacts, tweeting that “too many stories” have emerged of people harmed by these measures. Former President Donald Trump recently promised that if he were re-elected, he would “immediately terminate Operation Choke Point 2.0” to ensure a fair and inclusive banking environment for crypto companies. Operation Choke Point 2.0 is perceived as a modern iteration of the original Operation Choke Point, which was implemented during the Obama administration. The previous program aimed to cut banking services to industries deemed high-risk, such as payday lenders and firearms dealers. Critics argue that the renewed focus on crypto firms stifles innovation and could damage the U.S. position in the global digital economy. Related News: Giant Whale Makes a Big Sale in Altcoin, Up 100 Percent in One Week The debate surrounding the policy intensified after Chris Lane, a prominent crypto commentator, shared his perspective on the implications of the policy. Lane highlighted the critical role of Silvergate Bank’s SEN (Silvergate Exchange Network), a key player in facilitating cryptocurrency transactions that faced regulatory scrutiny prior to its eventual collapse.

Economist Peter Schiff believes that if the American government decided to adopt the firstborn crypto, it would have an adverse effect on the greenback by inflating the money supply. Unforeseen Consequences Schiff, who is a known Bitcoin critic, said that there will be unforeseen consequences on the value of the US dollar once the US government continues its plan of intervening in the Bitcoin markets, which could lead to an unsustainable economic bubble. The financial commentator believes that the surge in Bitcoin price is largely fueled by government intervention, saying that it might have a negative effect in the long run that could eventually lead to the collapse of the global currency. In a post, Schiff argued that the cryptocurrency could destroy the US dollar because the government adopted it. Ironically, #Bitcoin may end up destroying the dollar after all—not because it replaces the dollar as a global reserve currency, but because the U.S. government embraces Bitcoin, prints trillions of dollars to buy it, and fuels a larger bubble that squanders the nation’s wealth. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 5, 2024 “Ironically, #Bitcoin may end up destroying the dollar after all—not because it replaces the dollar as a global reserve currency, but because the US government embraces Bitcoin, prints trillions of dollars to buy it, and fuels a larger bubble that squanders the nation’s wealth,” Schiff remarked. According to him, a large-scale crypto adoption by the US government would mean buying Bitcoin with newly printed currency which could potentially inflate the money supply, adding that the US might end up in a large-scale economic bubble. He added that such crypto intervention could also diminish the confidence of investors in the US currency. Political Lobbying Schiff argued that the exponential growth of Bitcoin which allowed it to go beyond the $100,000 mark is not driven by organic market demand, saying that the crypto reached that milestone because of political lobbying and government support. It’s ironic that #Bitcoin only hit $100k by buying off politicians and getting in bed with government. Without expected government intervention, this milestone never would have been hit. What couldn’t be done in a free market was achieved through the cohesive power of the state. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 5, 2024 “It’s ironic that #Bitcoin only hit $100k by buying off politicians and getting in bed with the government,” Schiff said. As an economist, Schiff worries that a government-backed momentum on the alpha crypto could be leading the US to the path toward an economic bubble. He said that Bitcoin might not have reached $100,000 per coin without the government’s influence. “Without expected government intervention, this milestone never would have been hit. What couldn’t be done in a free market was achieved through the cohesive power of the state,” he explained. Criticizing The Proposed Bitcoin Reserve Schiff lambasted the proposal to establish a national Bitcoin reserve, arguing that buying large amounts of BTC might destabilize the dollar. US President-elect Donald Trump has been proposing the creation of a Bitcoin reserve which Schiff said is a proposal that will require the US government to buy large amounts of the crypto every year. He predicted that the US might end up holding 1 million Bitcoins. The financial commentator said that the US might be pushed to sell its gold reserves to finance its purchases of Bitcoin to build up its reserves. He warned that it could lead to a financial crisis because it might give an impression that BTC is more viable than the US dollar, adding that it will diminish the global dominance of the US dollar because investors will lose their confidence in the currency.

However, the large-cap altcoins seem to have woken from their slumber to close the week, with the Chainlink price showing good signs of recovery after falling into a consolidation range. The price of LINK came flying out the gates to start the week, surpassing the $20 mark again for the first time since March. With the altcoin seemingly back on track, the question on the minds of investors would be — what next for the Chainlink price? Can LINK Price Return To Its 3-Year High Of $28.5? In a new post on the X platform, crypto intelligence firm Santiment discussed the promise of the Chainlink price and its newly-found momentum. The prominent on-chain platform highlighted that the altcoin is just a few good performances from recovering a significant price level. Related Reading: XRP Price Marks $2.13 And $2.92 As Primary Fibonacci Levels, What Happens When Wave 2 Begins? According to Santiment, the price of Chainlink is about 10% from reaching $28.5, a level the cryptocurrency lost as far back as January 2022. The market analytics firm believes that most on-chain signals are pointing to a higher likelihood of reclaiming this price level in the near future. 🔗📈 Chainlink has enjoyed a late-week rally, and now needs to climb just +10.8% to match its 3-year high from January, 2022. It is encouraging that there is very little retail FOMO toward LINK. Markets move the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations, so the crowd’s… pic.twitter.com/UuKdmMMXWA — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 6, 2024 Santiment mentioned that traders have refrained from being overly excited but have rather remained level-headed. On-chain data reveals that there has been little retail FOMO towards the price of LINK following its recent bullish run. For context, FOMO (fear of missing out) is a sentiment amongst crypto traders that often involves making impulsive investment decisions. As Santiment noted, spikes in crowd FOMO could put downward pressure on prices, leading to abrupt corrections. Moreover, the crypto market historically moves in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations. Hence, the low trader sentiment towards the Chainlink price could prove pivotal in the continuation of the altcoin’s rally to the $28.5 mark. Chainlink Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of LINK stands at around $25.5, reflecting an impressive 10% jump in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko, the altcoin’s performance on the weekly timeframe is even more remarkable, with an over 40% rally in the last seven days.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 14:42:00

He believes there’s some good that can come out of the underlying principles of crypto. Markus, who uses the pseudonym Shibetoshi Nakamoto on social media as a playful nod to Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, said his reignited interest in crypto is not solely due to the recent price surges. Source: X Replying to a commentator on his recent post, Markus said crypto’s infrastructure has fueled his growing trust in the incorruptibility of code over people. “ Humans are so much more easily corruptible than code, ” he remarked. The discussion sparked commentary from followers, with one highlighting how crypto can counter excessive bank fees. Markus responded with a sharp critique of banking practices, stating, “ The more you learn about how banks operate, the more it deserves to be disrupted .” Dogecoin celebrates 11th anniversary The Dogecoin (DOGE) community is in a celebratory mood as the cryptocurrency marks its 11th anniversary since its launch on December 6, 2013. In a post on X, Markus reflected on DOGE’s journey and expressed disbelief at its enduring success. “I didn’t expect some silly thing I made in a few hours to have such a tremendous impact on the world,” he wrote. He called the anniversary celebrations a “nice reminder” of the potential for even small actions to create significant ripple effects. Source: X Dogecoin’s market cap now exceeds $65 billion, making it the seventh-largest crypto by market capitalization. Over the past week, DOGE surged nearly 20%, reaching a local high of $0.46 before settling at the $0.427 level. At the time of writing, the coin is changing hands at $0.44, reflecting a 4.4% uptick in 24 hours but maintaining a 5.3% weekly increase, per data from Coingecko. Analysts hopeful of a bullish market trend Market analysts are optimistic about Dogecoin’s trajectory. They point to a 25-day consolidation phase that followed a November price surge. Historical patterns suggest that such consolidation periods often precede significant rallies. Crypto analyst Master Kenobi predicts that the coin could hit $1 during its next upward movement. Similarly, Kevin Capital envisions the potential for DOGE to climb even higher, estimating a price range of $3 to $4 if market momentum remains strong. Notably, analysts are maintaining a bullish outlook on DOGE in the long term. Following a substantial surge between October and early November, the coin entered a consolidation phase, but traders are optimistic that its upward momentum will remain intact. In a recent post on X, analyst KrissPax noted that Dogecoin is exhibiting a classic ascending triangle pattern on its two-hour chart. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and a flat-top resistance line, is often associated with bullish price movements. Source: X KrissPax pointed to a recent leverage flush as part of the consolidation process, further strengthening the case for a potential breakout. Rekt Capital also echoed the ascending triangle pattern, suggesting that a breakout could propel Dogecoin to $0.56. This technical setup, combined with Dogecoin’s historical market behavior, has fueled optimism among crypto enthusiasts that the coin could reach new highs soon. Moreover, Elon Musk’s association with Dogecoin continues to be a significant influence on its market performance. The billionaire has been a vocal supporter of the meme coin, often driving investor interest with his public endorsements. His close relationship with President-elect Donald Trump led to the creation of a US financial monitoring department named the Department of Government Efficiency, which has a similar acronym to the crypto DOGE.

Bulls Eye 30% Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular and the world’s largest crypto-meme coin is poised to soar again because of its bullish price action. For over three weeks, DOGE has been consolidating within a narrow range and has formed a bullish pattern on a daily time frame. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, DOGE has broken out from an ascending triangle pattern and is heading upward. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if DOGE sustains this breakout and closes a daily candle above the $0.45 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach the $0.57 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View On the positive side, DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 65, below the overbought territory, indicating that the meme coin still has enough room to rise. The RSI is a technical indicator used by traders and investors to determine whether an asset is in an overbought or oversold area, helping them make informed trading decisions. Bullish On-Chain Metrics In addition to the positive technical analysis, whales and institutions have shown a strong interest and confidence in the meme coin, as reported by on-chain analytics firms such as IntoTheBlock and Coinglass . Data from IntoTheBlock revealed that the large transaction volume for DOGE has surged by 42% in the past 24 hours, indicating heightened participation from whales and institutions. Additionally, exchanges have witnessed $103.43 million worth of DOGE outflows. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency context, outflow refers to the transfer of assets from exchanges to wallets, which indicates potential upside momentum, a possible buying opportunity, and reduced selling pressure. Current Price Momentum At press time, DOGE is trading near $0.44 and has registered a price gain of over 4.10% in the past 24 hours.

Recently, Fed Chief Jamie Powell and other analysts shared that Bitcoin is not a competitor to the dollar; rather, it is a competitor to gold. Bitcoin exhibits numerous similarities to gold, including its enduring nature, scarcity, and mining difficulty. BRICS nations have also intensified their efforts to introduce their own currencies as part of a de-dollarization initiative. The decentralized finance, which is inclined toward Bitcoin, has been taken into account. China, however, has not been convinced about legalizing crypto entities. The nation has opted to take small steps, like virtual tokens regulated by the stablecoin bill in Hong Kong, most recently. China has opted for gold as its reserve asset; in fact, in 2023, the PBOC was the world’s largest official sector consumer of gold. In a recent development, China’s central bank expanded its gold reserves in November, ending a six-month pause in purchases after the prices for the precious metal rose to a record, official data by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) revealed on Saturday. In 2023, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) was the world’s largest official buyer of gold. After pausing its 18-month buying streak in May, the PBOC may resume purchases, which could boost gold demand among Chinese investors. Notably, by the end of November, China’s gold holdings increased to 72.96 million fine troy ounces, up from 72.80 million the previous month. “The resumption will send a signal that the PBOC has grown accustomed to these record high price levels and is prepared to build reserves regardless,” noted Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank as per a Reuters report. Gold hit an all-time high in October, driven by increasing haven demand amid tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine and the uncertainty surrounding the recent US presidential elections. The metal has erased some of the gains after a Trump victory and geopolitical tension in the Middle East showed signs of de-escalating. In addition, China’s consumers have decreased their demand for bullion as prices have increased by nearly 30% thus far this year. Although gold bars and coins have maintained their value for the first three quarters, retail sales of discretionary items such as jewelry have dropped as investors seek to safeguard their wealth from a weakening economy.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 14:54:26

Attackers used sophisticated malware and social engineering to bypass security protocols. The incident highlights critical vulnerabilities in DeFi security, urging the adoption of hardware-level transaction verification across the industry. Radiant Capital has confirmed new findings surrounding the devastating $50 million cyberattack it suffered on October 16, 2024. An investigation by cybersecurity firm Mandiant identified the attackers as UNC4736, a North Korea-linked threat group connected to the nation’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). This is another alarming rise in the sophistication of cyberattacks targeting decentralized finance (DeFi), showing the urgent need for stronger security measures in the industry.

US council calls on Congress to enact crypto oversight,https://crypto.news/stablecoins-on-shaky-ground-us-council-calls-on-congress-to-enact-crypto-oversight/,"The Financial Services Oversight Council (FSOC) is urging Congress to pass legislation that establishes a comprehensive federal framework for regulating stablecoin issuers. A government organization — established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 — published a report on Friday, Dec. 6, detailing what it perceives as a growing threat to the U.S. financial system. Stablecoins, the FSOC says, “continue to represent a potential risk to financial stability because they are acutely vulnerable to runs absent appropriate risk management standards.” The sector also remains largely concentrated, with a single firm accounting for “around 70 percent of the sector’s total market value,” council stated, referring to Tether ( USDT ). You might also like: Ripple targeting year-end RLUSD stablecoin launch: report Why Tether is problematic As of 2024, Tether remains the dominant player in the stablecoin space. While the FSOC report did not mention any company names, it cautioned that the lack of risk management standards with firms involved with stablecoins makes the sector “vulnerable to runs.” And Tether has faced scrutiny for not providing audits to verify that its coin is backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars or other assets. Critics argue that if Tether does not hold sufficient reserves, it could collapse, causing a major disruption in the crypto market. ng up over 70% of the $204 billion market. In a Sept. 14 social media post, Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons criticized Tether for its “lack of third-party audits,” calling the stablecoin an “existential threat to crypto.” See below. 3/17) There has never been an audit of USDT, despite promising to do so since 2015 This means we have to take their word for the vast majority of reserves, as they cannot be independently verified The first firm to attempt an audit even got fired for being too thorough in 2018! pic.twitter.com/OYfj21HsKJ — Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) September 14, 2024 Previously, the firm settled charges alleged by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2021 for making “untrue or misleading statements” about the reserves backing its stablecoin. Stablecoins have also faced heightened scrutiny since the collapse of TerraUSD (UST). Once a prominent stablecoin, UST lost its dollar peg in May 2022, triggering a catastrophic death spiral that wiped out over $40 billion in value from the crypto market. Despite these concerns, stablecoins remain widely used, especially for trading and liquidity. Specifically, the FSOC warned that if the market dominance expands, its potential failure could “disrupt the crypto-asset market” and trigger “knock-on effects” for the broader financial system. A few stablecoin issuers are under state-level supervision, but many “operate outside of, or in noncompliance with, a comprehensive federal prudential framework.” Further, it added that these firms often provide “limited verifiable information” about their reserves and holdings, making it difficult to ensure “effective market discipline.” Calls for legislative action The FSOC recommended passing stablecoin regulations to alleviate risks. It urged Congress to develop “a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers” and provide federal financial regulators with explicit rulemaking authority over the crypto-asset spot market. “If comprehensive federal legislation is not enacted, Council members remain prepared to consider steps available to them to address risks related to stablecoins,” it added. This is not the first time the FSOC has pushed for such measures; similar recommendations were made in its 2023 annual report . Congress is currently reviewing the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, a bill aimed at establishing clear regulations for stablecoin issuers. While the legislation has yet to pass the House, crypto proponents believe it could progress under the incoming Trump administration . Meanwhile, concerns over stablecoins extend beyond the U.S. On Dec. 4, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission published a consultation paper outlining plans to enhance oversight of the stablecoin sector. Similarly, Banco Central do Brazil (BCB) has raised concerns about the risks stablecoins pose and has proposed banning withdrawals to self-custody wallets as part of efforts to tighten regulatory oversight.

The appointment of cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins as SEC chair and approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs have boosted institutional interest in Bitcoin. Empirical evidence suggests this could be the beginning of a new price discovery phase, meaning the bull run has more legs. A closer look at Bitcoin's performance in the month of December in each Bitcoin halving year suggests more short-term gains are likely. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) recently surpassed the $100,000 mark for the first time ever, proving naysayers wrong. I do not own Bitcoin, but I have exposure to cryptocurrencies through my investment in Coinbase Global Inc. ( COIN ). Bitcoin is up 125% this year while COIN stock is up 104%, and I will take that as a win. For context, the S&P 500 index has substantially underperformed Bitcoin despite rising almost 28% this year. Seeking Alpha Bitcoin's rise to the mainstream has truly been one for history books. I am not planning to dive into Bitcoin's history here, but to determine the future trajectory of prices, it is important to understand some of the recent developments that have paved the way for Bitcoin to reach never-before-seen highs. Below are some of the main reasons behind Bitcoin's bull run in the recent past. President-elect Donald Trump's pro stance on cryptocurrencies. Expected regulatory changes in favor of cryptocurrency adoption. The appointment of cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins as SEC chair. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year which has paved the way for increased institutional ownership. Expectations for favorable tax policy changes with a focus on lower capital gains taxes for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin faced some selling pressure soon after hitting the $100K mark. According to Investing.com data, the 10% decline in Bitcoin prices after reaching $100,000 wiped out $300 million in long positions and $400 million in futures within minutes, suggesting that investors should look for strong resistance around the $100K mark. As a long-term-oriented growth investor who focuses on the fundamentals of companies (or digital assets for that matter), I will only invest in Bitcoin if its fundamentals can support higher prices. The argument for investing in Bitcoin is quite simple; there is a limited number of Bitcoin that will ever be in supply, and the growing demand will keep on pushing prices here. This is true until it is not. For investors with a long enough investment time horizon, it's important to understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to see sustainable demand growth in the long term when post-election euphoria wanes. The Price Discovery Phase Is Likely To Push Bitcoin Higher Bitcoin is arguably in a price discovery phase after crossing $100,000 as traders and institutional investors try to determine the fair market value of the digital asset in this new environment where Bitcoin has garnered significant media attention. The regulatory environment is also expected to turn favorable with the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC chair, making it all the more reasonable to believe Bitcoin deserves to trade at new highs. According to Capriole Fund founder Charles Edward, every new Bitcoin price discovery cycle lasts, on average, 4-7 months and the first month of this cycle started in November with Donald Trump's victory. Bitcoin surged more than 1,500% during the 2017 cycle and almost 250% during the 2021 cycle. A fraction of those gains in this cycle would easily push Bitcoin prices close to $200,000, which seems a stretch for now but I would not be naive to rule out the probability of this happening given the strong interest in Bitcoin today. Empirical evidence reveals another reason for Bitcoin bulls to stay bullish in December. In every Bitcoin halving year, December has been a great month for Bitcoin. Bitcoin halved in April 2024, and below are the observed Bitcoin returns in the month of December after a halving event. Period Bitcoin return December 2012 6% December 2016 31% December 2020 47% Source: Author's calculations Even if we look at the bigger picture after a Bitcoin halving event, we find that Bitcoin's bull run is likely to last longer. Below are the observed returns following a Bitcoin halving event. Halving date Return after 100 days Return after 250 days Return after 300 days November 28, 2012 257% 760% 987% July 9, 2016 (3%) 79% 136% May 11, 2020 37% 321% 492% Source: Author's calculations The most recent Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024, when the block reward for mining was reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. At halving, Bitcoin was trading at around $64,000. Since the halving, 231 days have passed, and Bitcoin is up 56%. From a historical viewpoint, Bitcoin has underperformed after this halving event, and as we approach the 300-day mark since the halving, Bitcoin will have to surge much higher to reach the historical average returns post-halving. I am not suggesting that Bitcoin prices will rise as much as they did back in 2012 when prices were in double digits, but history suggests this bull run is just getting started. Bitcoin As An Inflation Hedge Bitcoin seems to be showing some inflation-hedging properties, which is a good sign as this would help the digital asset secure an important position in institutional portfolios. A recent study conducted by Harold Rodriguez and Jefferson Colombo of the Sao Paulo School of Economics found that Bitcoin has reacted positively to CPI shocks (differences between estimates and actuals) between August 2010 and January 2023. As illustrated below, gold has also reacted positively to those inflation shocks, which does not come as a surprise given gold is considered an inflation hedge. Sao Paulo School of Economics Since the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year, institutional ownership of Bitcoin has increased sharply. According to Geoff Kendrick, the Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank, around 3% of the total Bitcoin supply will be held by institutional investors by the end of this year. He revealed that institutions have bought a net 683,000 bitcoins this year. With Bitcoin gaining recognition as an inflation hedge, the demand for the digital asset is likely to remain elevated in the long run as it becomes a key ingredient of every institutional investment portfolio. This is exactly what happened when spot gold ETFs were launched a couple of decades ago. Risks To Monitor Bitcoin is highly volatile, and this is an intrinsic characteristic of the digital asset. Therefore, investing in Bitcoin is only suitable for investors with a strong gut who are willing to weather significant corrections along the way. The good news is that volatility has subsided in the recent past but this is still a major risk investors need to monitor. BiTBO Investors should also keep an eye on regulatory shocks. Recent regulatory decisions have been favorable for long-term Bitcoin adoption, and an adverse development may come as a major shock, leading to a sharp decline in prices. When the consensus is distinctively positive, I try to remain cautious as a minor negative development can often cause chaos by catching investors off guard. Takeaway Bitcoin, after crossing the psychologically important $100,000 mark, seems well-positioned to enjoy more short-term gains as it enters a new price discovery phase. I am also encouraged by the inflation hedging characteristics exhibited by Bitcoin of late, attracting institutional investors. Despite maintaining a generally bullish stance on Bitcoin's prospects, I continue to prefer gaining exposure to Bitcoin and the broad cryptocurrency sector through my investment in Coinbase stock as it opens up the possibility to profit regardless of which cryptocurrency dominates the world in the long run.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-07 15:14:13

Just days after cryptocurrency behemoth Grayscale joined the SOL ETF race, sparking hopes of an impending greenlight, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has informed at least two prospective would-be ETF issuers that it will reject their applications. SEC To Throw Out SOL ETF Filings Fox Business journalist took to X to reveal that the SEC had informed at least two of the five Solana ETF applicants that the approval process for the form 19b-4 filings would not proceed further. This means the top Wall Street regulator will reject the filings in its anticipated January 2025 decision. While the SEC update indicates a temporary hurdle for SOL ETFs, the anonymous sources told Terrt that the SEC is unlikely to greenlight any new crypto-based exchange-traded funds under the current United States administration. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1864874666445152672 The report from Terrett comes as several asset managers have sought approval for investment vehicles that track Solana’s spot price. As ZyCrypto reported , Grayscale Investments recently filed with the SEC to transform its Solana Trust, which manages over $133 million in assets, into a spot SOL exchange-traded fund. Several other asset managers, including 21Shares , Canary Capital , VanEck , and Bitwise , have also filed paperwork for SOL ETFs. It’s worth mentioning that the SEC previously rejected Cboe BZX’s application for two SOL ETFs due to concerns about Solana’s classification as an unregistered security. All Hope Not Lost For SOL ETFs With the current U.S. SEC chairman Gary Gensler departing next month, there are renewed hopes about potential SOL and other crypto ETFs. Former crypto-friendly SEC commissioner Paul Atkins is set to replace current chair Gary Gensler in January. With Atkins at the helm, there is increasing optimism that more crypto ETFs could hit the market. Moreover, President-elect Donald Trump has appointed venture capitalist David Sacks to oversee crypto policy initiatives and artificial intelligence. Sacks is a known Solana investor. In 2022, he confirmed holding SOL tokens during a talk with fellow VCs regarding their crypto investments. Even more interesting, there are reports that Sacks was among the early buyers of the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. Some believe his involvement in the Trump regime could clear the path for spot SOL ETF approvals next year.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-07 15:14:44

Meanwhile, Brazil has seen a remarkable surge in Bitcoin ATMs. This change in Argentina is viewed as a step toward acknowledging the technological nature of these sectors and their conformity with the law’s goal of promoting knowledge-intensive and innovative activity. Law No. 27,506, enacted in 2019, seeks to boost areas like as software development, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and audiovisual industries through fiscal incentives, thereby contributing to quality job creation and national growth. The suggestion emphasizes that, while bitcoin mining and blockchain development are not officially included in the current laws, their technological intensity makes them compatible with the law’s purposes. This formal inclusion could address current regulatory issues and help to expand these operations in Argentina. In his presentation, Senator Atauche emphasized the need for regulatory clarity and access to sustainable energy infrastructure to maximize the potential impact of cryptocurrency mining on the national economy. He proposed incorporating a new subsection in Article 2 of Law 27,506, formalizing the inclusion of blockchain and cryptocurrency-related activities within the promoted sectors. Atauche argued that this amendment would not only advance technological development but also drive innovations in hardware, software, cryptography, and cybersecurity, ultimately optimizing resource utilization in the mining sector. Brazil sees surge in Bitcoin ATMs as cryptocurrency adoption grows CoinATMRadar data shows nine Bitcoin ATMs in Brazil’s largest cities, including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Petrópolis, São Bernardo do Campo, and Bauru. This represents a significant increase from just four ATMs in 2021, demonstrating the rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies by Brazilians. Coin Cloud has played an important role in this ATM expansion, taking substantial steps to improve the availability of Bitcoin ATMs in key urban areas. The company’s plan seeks not just to meet current demand, but also to promote a greater knowledge and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Brazil. Coin Cloud is well-positioned to boost Brazil’s prominence in the cryptocurrency environment, with plans for additional expansion in the works. Constitutional convention of Cardano kicks off in Argentina Intersect has officially announced the start of the Cardano Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires, where more than 120 delegates will work to finalize and approve the Cardano Constitution. This momentous event represents an important step toward developing a strong governance framework for decision-making inside the blockchain ecosystem. “With a strong representation from Latin America, backed by the organization of Intersect members, this convention highlights the power of a truly global and inclusive community shaping a more equitable and innovative blockchain future for all,” said Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder and CEO. According to Intersect, the Cardano ecosystem’s membership organization, the Constitutional Convention marks a watershed moment in blockchain governance. The proposed governance paradigm includes decentralized representatives (DReps), a decentralized treasury, and voting processes that take place on-chain. This program demonstrates a concentrated attempt to incorporate democratic ideals into Cardano’s operating architecture, encouraging openness and community participation in decision-making. The convention, which will be held concurrently in Buenos Aires and Nairobi, is the result of more than two years of planning, including 65 workshops in more than 50 countries and participation from over 2,000 community members. The convention’s key goals include building a decentralized future, unleashing resources for future technological developments, and developing local talent. Cardano’s concentration on Argentina highlights the continent’s increasing leadership in decentralized innovation and financial inclusion, with the goal of leveraging local expertise to promote global growth.

As such, some market participants decided to cash in on profits. After reports that long-term holders had disposed of portions of their bags, it’s now the turn for BTC miners, whose collective balances have dropped significantly in the past few days. The popular analytics platform Santiment revealed that miners, the backbone of the Bitcoin network, had liquidated more than 85,500 BTC in just 48 hours. The team described this substantial sell-off as the “most extreme we’ve seen since late February (2 weeks before the then $73K all-time high.) Recall that BTC’s price tumbled in the following weeks back in the first quarter of the year and failed to break its record until November 6. Although that sounds like a warning sign for future BTC price movements, Santiment was quick to reassure the public that the landscape is different now. This is because large bitcoin investors, known as whales and sharks, continue to accumulate the asset. Consequently, Santiment concluded that the declining balances of BTC miners is a “net-neutral signal,” at least for the time being. Bitcoin’s collective mining balances have been dropping since April, 2024. However, this latest drop of 85,503 BTC in just 48 hours is the most extreme we’ve seen since late February (2 weeks before the then $73K all-time high). Note that these wallets have NOT been… pic.twitter.com/gTQPoS7IzC — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 6, 2024 Perhaps the two biggest proofs of this narrative are corporations led by MicroStrategy and US investors, who continue to pour large sums into BTC. MicroStrategy has announced enormous BTC purchases worth almost $10 billion on the past three consecutive Mondays. The Bitcoin ETFs in the States have enjoyed the timeframe since the US elections, and the past week didn’t disappoint, with another couple of billion dollars entering the financial vehicles.

The letters, dating from March 2022 to May 2023, indicate increased scrutiny of crypto activities in the banking sector. Coinbase, represented by consulting firm History Associates Inc., filed a lawsuit against the FDIC in June, claiming the agency was trying to isolate the cryptocurrency industry from banking services. The lawsuit also sought the release of “halt letters” the FDIC reportedly issued to several financial institutions. In a March 2022 letter, the FDIC stated, “…at this time, the FDIC has not yet determined what regulatory filings would be required for a bank to engage in this type of activity. As a result, we respectfully request that you cease all activities related to crypto assets.” Related News: For the First Time in a Long Time, Positive News for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies from a European Country The lawsuit also alleges that the FDIC failed to comply with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, leading Coinbase to seek a court order to compel the agency to release the documents. The FDIC Office of Inspector General, which oversees the agency’s operations, confirmed in a 2023 report that the FDIC began issuing “pause letters” to financial institutions in 2022. These letters not only requested a halt to the expansion of crypto activities, but also requested detailed documentation related to crypto, including cost-benefit analyses, disclosures, and marketing materials. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal called the developments proof that regulatory measures like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” are real. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Grewal said the letters confirm that the regulatory push to restrict crypto banking access is more than just a “conspiracy theory about the crypto industry.” *This is not investment advice.

According to a Bloomberg report , the duo is working on actualizing an initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. The trading platform could go public in the second quarter of 2025. However, this remains a tentative date for the IPO launch. Overcoming Regulatory Challenges Last year, eToro engaged in a private funding round that saw it realize about $3.5 billion valuation . With this planned IPO, it hopes to surpass that level. The trading platform remains in discussion with other partners that could join, including banks. It is worth mentioning that eToro had serious regulatory issues in the U.S., resulting from allegations of operating as an unregistered broker. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached a settlement agreement in September 2024. The agreement saw eToro shelling out $1.5 million to settle charges of operating without registration for its brokerage and clearing services. The trading platform neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings but agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist order. It also complied with the directive to restrict its crypto offerings for the U.S. customer base. Favorable Climate for Crypto IPOs The recent IPO move is coming at a significant time in U.S. crypto history. This is partly driven by the decision of President-elect Donald Trump to appoint pro-crypto individuals into key positions. Notably, the next SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, is very crypto-friendly, and his leadership could spur crypto-focused companies to go public. Following the news of Atkins’ nomination, the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem has reacted with positive sentiments. Bitcoin, the world’s leading digital asset, has historically climbed to $100,000 while the leading altcoin, Ethereum, has also crossed the $4,000 mark. Ethereum last reached that price level in March 2024. eToro’s Global Reach and Future Prospects eToro, founded in 2007, provides users with a platform to trade and follow top crypto and stock investors. Its registered user base totals over 38 million spread across 75 countries. These will look forward to further details of the planned IPO in 2025.

37337602,https://coingape.com/?p=228346,1733585255,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Analyst Reveals Critical Targets As Cardano Price Eyes $2,https://coingape.com/analyst-reveals-critical-targets-as-cardano-price-eyes-2/,"Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, has shown a modest gain of over 3% in the past 24 hours, trading above the $1.20 mark at the time of writing. This recovery comes despite ADA losing a portion of the gains achieved earlier in the week. Analysts suggest that ADA bulls are positioning for a potential rally, with a long-term price target of $2. Cardano Price Eye $2 Target as ADA Holds Key Support Above $1.11 According to a recent analysis , Cardano price continues to demonstrate resilience, with a key micro-support zone identified between $1.11 and $1.21. Analysts emphasize that maintaining the $1.11 level is crucial to sustaining bullish momentum. This zone acts as a pivot point, and its stability reinforces the outlook for further gains. The broader trend for Cardano price remains upward as long as ADA stays above the $0.644 retracement level, which is tied to critical Fibonacci levels. A drop below this mark could indicate the end of the ongoing uptrend, necessitating caution among investors. Current price action suggests that ADA price prediction may form a higher low and higher high, both of which are essential components for continued upward movement. If the current trend holds, analysts project potential targets for Cardano price ranging from $1.72 to $2.95. These levels hinge on the continuation of bullish momentum, supported by key technical indicators. The next major confirmation for Cardano price rally would come from breaking the $1.32-$1.33 range, representing a significant previous high. Surpassing this range could pave the way for further targets, starting at $1.49 and potentially reaching $2. Source: YouTube The Role of Micro and Macro Support Levels For shorter time frames, the zone between $1.11 and $1.21 serves as a critical micro-support region. Analysts assert that as long as the price remains above this threshold, the bullish structure remains intact. A break below $1.11, however, may lead to a short-term bearish scenario, though the macro trend remains optimistic above $0.644. Macro support levels such as $0.644 are integral to ADA Prediction, as falling below this level could invalidate the broader uptrend. This makes the $0.644-$0.94 range a vital area to monitor for any major corrections. Similarly, the MACD shows a bullish crossover as the MACD line crosses above the signal line, indicating potential upward momentum in the ADA/USD price action. The histogram also reflects this shift, transitioning from red to green, suggesting strengthening buying pressure. While the short-term outlook hinges on micro-support zones, the long-term Cardano prediction remains optimistic as ADA prediction eyes $2 and beyond. More so, ADA whales have significantly boosted their accumulation during this bull run, purchasing $276 million worth of Cardano tokens recently. Notably, 100 million ADA tokens were acquired in just 24 hours, reflecting growing confidence among large investors. This surge in whale activity, coupled with increasing retail interest, underscores strong demand for ADA as the altcoin season gains momentum.

During this decline, the asset’s perpetual funding rates in the derivative markets took a hit. However, traders may yet retain enough leverage to strongly influence price volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track To Replace Gold In 10 Years, Trading Firm Predicts Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook Uncertain Due To Heightened Leverage In an X post on December 6, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode expressed that Bitcoin’s perpetual funding rate may hold significant implications for the asset’s short-term price. For context, perpetual funding rates are periodic payments made between traders in the perpetual futures market to ensure the contract price aligns with the spot price of Bitcoin. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, which is bullish while negative funding rates represent the vice versa. According to Glassnode, BTC’s perpetual funding rates initially showed signs of stabilization on its weekly frame amidst speculative demand. However, the asset’s surge to $100,000 on Thursday driven by increased market leverage saw these funding rates rise by 3.6x their weekly average. Notably, Bitcoin’s perpetual funding rate hit a peak of 0.062, representing its highest value since April. Importantly, the analytics team at Glassnode notes that this rate spike suggests significant influence by the derivative market on Bitcoin’s ascent above $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s flash price resulted in a major decline in its funding rates slightly above 0.024. Despite this fall, Glassnode states these rates are still relatively high compared to earlier this week, indicating the Bitcoin market still contains a significant level of leveraged positions. This residual leverage in the market indicates a strong potential for increased price volatility. Therefore, Bitcoin’s price movement in the coming days appears unclear as a reversal on either side could trigger a significant level of liquidation, inducing a cascading effect. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $100,000: Road To More Gains Or Potential Bull Trap? Analyst Has Answers STH Cost Basis Points To $112,000 Price Target In other news, renowned analyst Ali Martinez has posted a Bitcoin price prediction based on the asset’s short-term holder (STH) cost basis i.e. the average price at which those who typically acquired BTC over the last 155 days. It indicates a break-even level for these investors. According to Martinez, the STH behavior indicates that Bitcoin would reach a local top or $112,926 price based on a +1 standard deviation that adjusts the level of STH cost basis upward to account for price volatility and behavioral trends. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $100,137 after its recovery from Friday’s crash faced a rejection at $102,000. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 42.46% and valued at $89.12 billion.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 303,200 followers on the social media platform X that he sees Dogecoin ( DOGE ) outperforming Bitcoin (DOGE/ BTC ) as the pair approaches the resolution of a triangle pattern. A triangle structure is typically viewed as bullish if spotted while an asset is in an uptrend. Says Bluntz, “Sounding like a broken record at this point but I’m gonna say it again anyway, when DOGE breaks this three-week accumulation, it’s going to be a violent upside move.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, DOGE/BTC is trading for 0.00000437 BTC worth $0.44. Looking at Bitcoin itself, Bluntz believes that BTC is ready to resume its rallies after completing an ABC correction on the four-hour chart. “Perfect liquidation candle on BTC, looks like a running flat ABC done, in my opinion. Leverage successfully wiped.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to see more rallies after concluding an ABC wave pullback. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will soar above $112,000. Bitcoin is trading at $99,284 at time of writing. Next up is the memecoin dogwifhat ( WIF ). According to the trader, WIF is raring to break out from a re-accumulation pattern as the coin prints bullish higher low setups. “This WIF accumulation is gagging for a bust-up.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that a breakout will happen once WIF clears $3.50. WIF is trading at $3.44 at time of writing.

Trump supported the idea on the campaign trail, and crypto-friendly lawmakers are reportedly crafting plans to make it a reality. Bitcoin holders are thrilled at the thought of skyrocketing prices, but for the average taxpayer and the US economy, this proposal could be catastrophic. A current bill in Congress suggests purchasing 1 million Bitcoin over five years, with a mandatory holding period of at least two decades. If enacted, such a program could cause prices to spike dramatically as investors scramble to ride the wave. But what happens when the dust settles? Bitcoin’s missed its mark at becoming real money Bitcoin is hands down one of humanity’s greatest inventions. It has plenty of advantages. You can store millions of dollars worth of it on a thumb drive. It allows semi-anonymous transactions, identified only by a string of characters. And you don’t need banks or middlemen to transfer it. But calling it money is a stretch. You see, while Satoshi did mean for BTC to be an alternative, better currency, we’ve managed to turn it into an investment product. Evidently, that hasn’t turned out entirely too well. For starters, it’s far too volatile. One day, your Bitcoin can buy a car, the next, it might only get you a coffee. Businesses aren’t required to accept it, and over 90% of the world doesn’t. Unlike stocks or bonds, Bitcoin doesn’t generate income. There’s no interest, no dividends. Its supply is capped at 21 million tokens, with nearly all of them already mined. This scarcity makes prices skyrocket whenever demand rises, but it also means the market is driven purely by speculation. Right now, Bitcoin’s market value is around $2.04 trillion, with each token priced at roughly $99,000. A government reserve would offer no benefits to citizens A national Bitcoin reserve would be a goldmine for current Bitcoin holders. If the US government enters the market, demand will shoot through the roof. Even a small investment ripple could send prices soaring. Imagine if global investors decided to allocate just 2% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. With global stocks and bonds valued at $250 trillion, this would push Bitcoin’s total market value to $5 trillion—or $250,000 per token. If that allocation increased to 4%, prices would double again. But what’s in it for taxpayers? Absolutely nothing realistically speaking. A Bitcoin reserve would be volatile and produce no income. Selling it would crash the market, making it nearly impossible to liquidate without massive losses. To buy Bitcoin, the government would either need to borrow money which increases national debt, or print more money, fueling inflation. The Cynthia Lummis bill even suggests tapping into the nation’s gold reserves to fund these purchases, essentially swapping one stable asset for a wildly speculative one. Naturally, there are expectations that the Federal Reserve will block the bill, and Congress would likely side with them. On Thanksgiving weekend, Bitcoin’s price hovered around $98,000 but broke through the six-figure barrier after Trump announced Paul Atkins, a crypto lover, as the new SEC chair. Atkins replaces Gary Gensler, whose tenure was marked by aggressive lawsuits against crypto companies. Trump’s proposals include forming a crypto advisory council with industry heavyweights. His tariff policies may also be pushing investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. From pizza to six-figures Bitcoin wasn’t always the financial juggernaut it is today. It started in 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin blockchain. Nakamoto’s vision was simple: a decentralized currency outside the control of governments and banks. Using blockchain technology, Bitcoin created a transparent ledger where every transaction is recorded and visible to all. In 2010, Bitcoin made headlines for its first real-world transaction. A Florida man traded 10,000 Bitcoin—worth about $41 at the time—for two pizzas. Today, those tokens would be valued at around $1 billion. That infamous trade is celebrated annually on “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” Bitcoin’s first major price milestone came in 2013 when it crossed $100. But as its popularity grew, so did scrutiny. Regulators raised concerns about its use in illegal activities, particularly on platforms like Silk Road, the anonymous marketplace that was shut down by authorities. In 2013, China banned financial institutions from using Bitcoin, and the US Treasury issued guidelines warning users about potential legal risks. Bitcoin’s first boom arrived in 2017 when its price soared to $19,000. This surge was fueled by the launch of Bitcoin futures contracts and a wave of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). However, the market soon crashed, exposing the fragility of many crypto projects. Despite setbacks, Bitcoin remained resilient, reaching new heights during the pandemic as retail investors flocked to digital assets. Regulatory risks and vulnerabilities A national Bitcoin reserve would also amplify existing risks in the crypto market. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it attractive, but it also leaves the door open for fraud, scams, and illegal activities. Stablecoins, which are supposed to maintain a fixed value, sometimes lack proper backing, creating additional vulnerabilities. Without clear regulations, these issues are unlikely to disappear. The government’s involvement could also set a dangerous precedent. If the US starts hoarding Bitcoin, other nations might follow suit, turning the crypto market into a geopolitical battleground. This would make Bitcoin even more volatile and speculative, undermining its credibility as a stable asset.

The Pengu token will be launched on the Solana blockchain, with a total supply of 88,888,888,888 tokens. Despite this, the Pudgy Penguins NFTs themselves are based on the Ethereum network. Pengu Token According to Pengu’s tokenomics , approximately 25.9% of the total token supply will be allocated to the Pudgy Penguins community, while 24.12% is designated for other communities and new “Huddle” members. The project’s team, including both current and future members, will receive 17.8% of the tokens, subject to vesting schedules to maintain long-term engagement. Additionally, 11.48% of the coins will remain under the control of the company, with similar long-term conditions. “With PENGU, the millions of Pudgy Penguin fans and the hundreds of millions of people outside of crypto that see and share the Pudgy Penguin every day finally have the opportunity to align themselves with the character. Now, everyone can join The Huddle.” Pudgy Penguins’ Growth Pudgy Penguins first entered the top 10 largest NFT collections in September 2023, claiming a 2.7% market dominance as its floor price remained stable during a wider NFT market correction. By October 2024, the project’s dominance had surged to 9.5%, according to CoinGecko’s report . This significant growth comes after several ‘blue chip’ NFT collections, including Moonbirds, Veefriends, Doodles, Meebits, World of Women, and Cool Cats, experienced price drops and fell out of the top 10 rankings. Amid a broader market rally, Pudgy Penguins’ floor price too hit a new all-time high on Thursday, alongside other collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks. At the time of writing, Pudgy Penguins have a floor price of approximately 19.49 ETH, which is valued at about $75,406, with a market cap reaching around $670 million, as per CoinGecko’s dashboard . In the last 24 hours, its trading volume has skyrocketed by 331%, surpassing $16.47 million.

ADA has shown extraordinary performance over one month, virtually tripling in value and exceeding Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Given an estimated market value of $39.6 billion, the rise supports its eighth rank among cryptocurrencies. ADA's price skyrocketed from $0.33 to $1.11 in thirty days, a 236% increase. Right now, the token moves steadily at $1.13. Even with this amazing comeback, ADA's price is still much below its all-time high of $2.80, which was attained during the 2021 cryptocurrency explosion. Many question if ADA may turn a $1,000 investment now into a millionaire-maker by 2025 as market hope rises. Price Forecast for Cardano in 2025 Future prospects for Cardano seem bright; experts project more increases by 2025. This year corresponds with the expected consequences of the Bitcoin halving, a cyclical occurrence that affects market mood and propels crypto prices. Cardano is expected to follow suit if Bitcoin hits fresh highs for altcoins. Furthermore, regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency market can help ADA's price stay in line. The outcome of continuous legal conflicts between the SEC and big exchanges, as well as possible congressional participation, could create a more suitable climate for cryptocurrencies. A major influence is Cardano's development roadmap. Introduced in recent upgrades, the community-driven governance approach helps users influence the platform's direction. A fresh road map or significant update could draw additional interest and funding, driving higher ADA prices. Analysts project Cardano hitting a possible high of $2.42 in 2025. With today's price of $1.13, a $1,000 investment would produce about 884 ADA tokens. Should ADA equal $2.42, the value of this investment would rise to $2,140, double the starting amount. ADA's potential for development still appeals to consistent profits, even if it cannot produce millionaires overnight. Introducing Rexas Finance (RXS): The Next Crypto Millionaire Maker Although the recent surge of Cardano is making headlines, Rexas Finance is becoming a disruptive actor in the cryptocurrency market. Launched on September 8, 2024, Rexas Finance is transforming the undeveloped industry with great potential in the real-world asset tokenizing market. By allowing users to tokenize real estate, art, and intellectual property, Rexas Finance is making asset ownership and liquidity more easily available, transparent, and efficient. Since its inception, Rexas Finance has completed several presale stages, with each stage selling ahead of time. Mirroring the early success of initiatives like Solana and Dogecoin, early investors have already achieved an astonishing 316% return on investment. Rexas Finance Tokens (RXS), now in Stage 9, cost $0.125. Selling 291,538,425 tokens out of 335,000,000, the initiative has now raised $20,942,508 out of its $26,375,000 objective. Rexas Finance intends to list on three top-tier exchanges in Q1 at an initial price of $0.20, looking ahead to 2025. Following these listings, analysts project a spike in demand for RXS tokens; prices are expected to hit $5 in mid-2025 and $20 by year-end. The platform's actual use cases and proven leadership in asset tokenizing drive this positive view. Potential Return on Investment: Rexas Finance against Cardano The possible profits for investors considering Rexas Finance are astonishing. With the present price of $0.125, a $1,000 investment would produce 8,000 RXS tokens. Should RXS meet the projected $20 price by the end of 2025, the value of these tokens will skyrocket to $160,000. Rexas Finance offers an exponential possibility when compared to Cardano's predicted doubling of investment. Although Cardano is still a dependable investment in cryptocurrencies, Rexas Finance is a transforming tool with great future development capacity. Rexas Finance presents a special chance for investors looking for significant returns since it emphasizes transforming asset tokenization and has outstanding presale performance. For someone wishing to join the next wave of crypto billionaires, a $1,000 investment in ADA today could offer strong gains by 2025, but the same amount invested in Rexas Finance could produce life-changing effects.

37338352,https://finbold.com/?p=217792,1733586665,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Why there’s ‘nothing preventing’ Ethereum from hitting new all-time highs,https://finbold.com/why-theres-nothing-preventing-ethereum-from-hitting-new-all-time-high/,"Ethereum (ETH) finally broke past the $4,000 resistance after months of consolidation below the level, and on-chain metrics are signaling that the asset is poised to hit new record highs. Specifically, the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization is showing minimal resistance on the way up while maintaining strong support. To this end, ETH is facing modest resistance around $4,540, with the asset recording a strong demand zone at $3,560, offering a solid foundation for a possible price breakout, according to on-chain data sourced from IntoTheBlock as shared by cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez in a December 7 X post . “There is nothing preventing Ethereum from reaching new all-time highs. The only modest resistance zone ahead is around $4,540,”Martinez said. Ethereum’s In/Out of the Money Around Price. Source: IntoTheBlock The analysis is based on ‘Ethereum’s In/Out of the Money Around Price,’ which shows that about 89% of ETH holders are ‘in the money’ at the current price of around $3,990. A demand zone between $3,535.55 and $3,588.88 supports stability and includes over 11.6 million ETH purchased by 1.3 million addresses. On the other hand, the resistance zone around $4,540 to $4,579 is relatively small, involving just 600,936 ETH held by fewer than 61,000 addresses. This suggests that once Ethereum surpasses $4,540, it could move rapidly toward new highs, with limited opposition from sellers. Ethereum’s path to $10,000 At the same time, on December 7, a cryptocurrency analyst with the pseudonym Captain Faibik suggested that technical indicators show Ethereum has broken out of a massive triangle pattern on the weekly time frame, signaling the start of a potential 2025 bull run after a prolonged consolidation phase. If this move is sustainable, the analyst suggested that Ethereum might face a possible midterm target of $10,000. Ethereum price analysis chart. Source: CryptoCove Part of Ethereum’s bullish sentiment is tied to the general crypto market rally initiated by optimism around Donald Trump’s election and his anticipated pro-crypto policies. At the same time, the cryptocurrency spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) is also witnessing record capital inflows. Notably, on December 5, Ethereum ETFs recorded a historic $428 million inflow —the largest single-day inflow ever. This surge points to growing institutional confidence in Ethereum. ETH ETF capital inflow. Source: Bloomberg Besides the technical aspects, Ethereum’s price growth will likely be influenced by ongoing network development. In this case, Ethereum’s All Core Developers approved EIP-7691: Blob Throughput Increase, advancing plans for Pectra (Prague-Electra), the network’s most significant upgrade since The Merge. EIP-7691 is anticipated to boost scalability by increasing blobs per block, which is essential for layer-2 solutions. After the 2025-2026 upgrade, the target and maximum blobs will rise to six and nine, potentially enhancing Ethereum’s efficiency and data capacity. Ethereum price analysis Ethereum was trading at $4,002 by press time, rallying almost 2% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the asset is up about 10%. ETH seven-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap At the current valuation, Ethereum is showing bullish momentum both in the short and long term, as highlighted by the fact that ETH is trading above its 50-day ($3,029) and 200-day ($2,927) simple moving averages ( SMA ). However, momentum indicators, led by the relative strength index ( RSI ), signal overbought conditions, suggesting a potential short-term pullback.

While some projects gain attention through adoption and infrastructure upgrades, others capitalize on gamified engagement, driving more participation. Bittensor (TAO) exemplifies the growing momentum, breaking resistance levels and targeting its next price milestone. Meanwhile, Chainlink’s (LINK) steady adoption hints at bullish prospects, with predictions aiming to peak in 2025. At the same time, BlockDAG’s (BDAG) innovative 5-tiered bonus system has unveiled 150% and 170% bonuses, with the remaining higher rewards hidden as enticing mysteries. This unique structure has triggered whale activity, driving its presale to an impressive $158 million. Bittensor Price Target: Strong Momentum Ahead? Bittensor has gained significant momentum, with its price surpassing the critical $645 resistance level. Analysts are optimistic about Bittensor hitting its price target, as forecasts show $1,000 within two months. Recent trading data supports this bullish outlook, as TAO climbed from $300 in September to $692.63, marking a 24.84% weekly and 12.43% daily increase. Technical indicators show bullish convergence in moving averages and strong support between $500-520. The previous resistance at $645 has flipped to support, strengthening the upward trajectory. Coupled with steady trading volume, the ecosystem’s growth reinforces a $1,000 Bittensor price target for upcoming months. Chainlink Price Prediction: A Promising Outlook for 2025 Chainlink’s steady performance and historical data point to intriguing prospects for 2025, fueling interest in Chainlink price prediction. Analysts suggest a potential minimum price of $14.88, with a bullish peak projected at $22.06. Current indicators highlight mixed market sentiment, yet the 24-hour trading volume of $221,980,701 shows strong investor participation. Current real-time prices stand at $12.8261, showcasing resilience in the face of market fluctuations. Chainlink price prediction further indicates an average trading range of around $23.14, driven by the new year’s momentum and expanding adoption. Traders are urged to monitor technical charts closely, aligning strategies with these projections for potential gains. Buyers In for a Treat as BlockDAG Drops The Biggest Bonuses Ever! BlockDAG has unlocked a whole new level of excitement with its 5-tiered bonus system, and crypto fans are going crazy. The first purchase using the BDG250 code unlocks a 150% bonus, and the second jumps to 170%. But the real twist? Beyond that, the bonus percentages are wrapped in ""mystery boxes"" — hidden treasures that only reveal themselves as the purchase continues. Every bonus is bigger than the last, but no one can know the exact figure until they earn it. Such a gamified bonus system is sitting well with buyers, pulling curious minds deeper into the BlockDAG ecosystem. This unique approach has crypto enthusiasts scrambling to secure their spot. And with the bonus offer valid only until January 8th, the time is ticking. BlockDAG’s unprecedented profitable trajectory matches its presale dominance: over 16.8 billion coins sold and the network has raised past $158 million. The presale is currently in batch 26 and the BDAG coin’s value has rocketed to hit $0.0234, revealing a 2240% surge from batch 1 pricing. Whale activity? You bet. Major players are stacking up BDAG coins using the bonus code before the demand for the coins pushes its prices higher. The future of BlockDAG and its holders is bright. With the bonuses brining in immense whale activity in the ecosystem, crypto analysts project the BDAG value to hit $1 in no time. Which is the Crypto Master for Major Gains? BlockDAG stands as an unmissable opportunity for crypto enthusiasts, proving itself the best crypto presale in the industry, especially with the new bonus unchained system triggering major whale activity. The unveiling of 150% and 170% bonuses in the initial two stages, with higher rewards locked in mystery, has driven the interest of the crypto market to unprecedented heights. While Bittensor price target and Chainlink price prediction present a bullish future for these projects, the answer to which crypto to invest in lies truly in BlockDAG. Its explosive growth and gamified engagement make it an unavoidable factor for those aiming for major portfolio expansion in the crypto market.

Competition in the crypto market now includes tokens like Lunex Network (LNEX) and Pepe (PEPE) as they gain in price. While PEPE is an already established crypto that is now showing green price charts, LNEX is a presale star that could disrupt the DeFi market. Some experts hint at a potential 900% surge in the value of this DeFi coin in 2025. Meanwhile, the well-known analyst Bluntz has made a bullish price prediction for Dogecoin (DOGE) . This has excited many investors for this meme coin. Lunex Network price increases 200%, more jumps coming According to IBS Intelligence , the DeFi market could be worth $48B by 2031, Lunex Network (LNEX) aims to capitalize on this growth. To do this, it will launch a unique non-custodial crypto exchange that connects all isolated blockchains. On it, people will be able to trade many crypto coins across all of these blockchains at the lowest possible costs. The LNEX native token will power this platform. Those who hold it will get governance voting rights, staking rewards, and more. People are also excited about LNEX since Lunex Network will use a percentage of its revenue to buy back LNEX tokens off the open market. Afterward, these DeFi coins will be given to all LNEX stakers. Currently, one LNEX costs just $0.0036, a 200% increase from its starting price of $0.0012, however this DeFi coin price will rise on a three-day price. A Tier-1 crypto exchange listing is also expected to come for LNEX soon. This could push the price to $0.0216 or a 555% rise from its current value.

CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Pepe has jumped over 130% in the past 30 days. In other words, its value moved between $0.0000087 and $0.0000203 in just a few short weeks. Market analyst Vegeta also made a bullish Pepe price prediction. According to his X post , this meme coin could soon see a price surge to $0.000032. This may make Pepe one of the tokens to watch. TradingView data supports this statement. Currently, the Pepe crypto is valued above its 10-day EMA ($0.0000202) and its 20-day EMA ($0.000019). This suggests that the current uptrend may continue. Bluntz: The price of Dogecoin may see an upward move As one of the top meme coins, Dogecoinis also experiencing price growth. On the one-month chart, the Dogecoin price increased nearly 180%, as per CoinMarketCap . During that period, its value soared from $0.15 to $0.43. The technical analysis of Dogecoin also shows bullish signs. TradingView shows this meme coin being valued above its 20-day EMA ($0.38) and its 30-day EMA ($0.34). This suggests that the Dogecoin crypto could continue this bullish trend. Meanwhile, crypto expert Bluntz remains bullish for this meme coin. In his X post , he said the Dogecoin crypto may see a violent upside move if it breaks its three-week range. This Dogecoin price prediction has excited many traders. What may come for Lunex Network, Pepe & Dogecoin? Thanks to tokens like Lunex Network, Pepe, and Dogecoin, there may be good opportunities for growth in the crypto space. Experts think they all may see big price gains. However, they are focusing on one right now—Lunex Network. Since this DeFi coin will have a smaller market cap than its peers, its value may rise faster with less money. Therefore, they predict a potential 900% surge for LNEX in 2025.

What is it, and who will pay for it?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openais-new-chatbot-could-cost-200-a-month/,"Recently, Open AI launched a more sophisticated version of the o1reasoning model called the o1 pro mode. The chatbot was unveiled on Thursday and is priced at $200 per month. However, the community is uncertain about how to interpret it. The company’s new ChatGPT Pro plan provides access to “o1 pro mode,” which uses additional computing power to provide the most comprehensive and reliable responses to the most challenging queries related to science, math, and coding. A former chief officer at Open AI, Bob McGrew, considered o1 pro mode to be an example of “intelligence overhang,” which refers to the inability of users (and potentially the model’s creators) to derive value from any “extra intelligence” as a result of the inherent limitations of a simple, text-based interface. ChatGPT is the sole method of interaction with o1 pro mode, as is the case with OpenAI’s other models. Bob McGrew noted that ChatGPT is not flawless. He added that it is accurate that $200 establishes lofty expectations. Additionally, ChatGPT Pro is not an easy endeavor, as evidenced by its initial reception on social media. Here is how the new open AI assistant has been weighed According to reports , o1 pro mode will be the world’s most expensive chatbot subscription as the $200 monthly fee will translate to $2400 yearly. The service, however, comes with other benefits, like the removal of rate limits and unlimited access to OpenAI’s other models. British computer scientist Simon Willison asked, “Have OpenAI shared any concrete examples of prompts that fail in regular o1 but succeed in o1-pro?” On the contrary, failures have already been documented. Sudoku is a challenge for o1 pro mode, and it is impeded by an optical illusion comedy that is readily apparent to any human. An AI engineer, Tibor Blaho, wrote on X , “o1 and o1-pro both failed here, probably still because of the vision limitations (the same with Sudoku puzzles).” Tibor Blaho also noted that both o1 and o1-pro failed in terms of visual capabilities. o1 and o1-pro both failed here, probably still because of the vision limitations (the same with Sudoku puzzles) https://t.co/mAVK7WxBrq pic.twitter.com/O9boSv7ZGt — Tibor Blaho (@btibor91) December 5, 2024 o1-pro code failed to understand/read the puzzle properly. According to OpenAI’s internal benchmarks, the standard o1 performs only marginally better than the o1 pro mode on coding and math problems. In order to demonstrate the consistency of the o1 pro mode, OpenAI conducted a more stringent evaluation of the same benchmarks. The model was only deemed to have solved a question if it correctly identified the answer four out of four times. However, the enhancements were not substantial in these assessments. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was compelled to reiterate that ChatGPT Pro is not suitable for the majority of individuals, despite his previous assertion that OpenAI was progressing toward intelligence that was “too cheap to meter.” He said, “Most users will be very happy with the o1 in the [ChatGPT] Plus tier!” Bob McGrew said that improved reliability may be the most important unlock for o1 pro, especially for the medical field. Views regarding the cost Ameet Talwalkar, an associate professor of machine learning at Carnegie Mellon and a venture partner at Amplify Partners, said “It seems like a big risk to me to raise the price tenfold, ” he added, “I think we’ll have a much better sense in just a few weeks as to the appetite for this functionality.” Guy Van den Broeck, a computer scientist at UCLA, said, “I don’t know if the price point makes sense and if pricey reasoning models will be the norm.” Prospective consumers are not provided with a significant amount of information when the o1 pro mode is described as the most effective at resolving “the hardest problems.” It is difficult to rationalize paying more in the absence of specific examples of the model’s purportedly enhanced capabilities, which include the ability to “think longer” and exhibit “intelligence.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",News|ChatGPT|Open AI,EN,0,0,TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-07 16:04:45

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 16:08:48

Two powerhouses, Lightchain AI (LCAI) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), are vying for attention, each carving its mark on the blockchain landscape in very different ways. LCAI, with its groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), seeks to revolutionize blockchain through a fusion with artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, SHIB continues to ride the memecoin wave but also aims to break into utility-driven projects like Shibarium. 🚀 Lightchain AI Presale is Live! Secure your tokens and join the next-gen AI-powered blockchain movement today 👉 Lightchain AI Presale But between the calculated, tech-forward approach of LCAI and the community-driven, wild-card nature of SHIB, which blockchain is better equipped to reshape the future of DeFi? Let's break it down. Why Start with Lightchain AI? Before we get into the grit of comparing LCAI with SHIB, it’s essential to highlight why Lightchain AI is already making waves. Designed for the next era of decentralized systems, LCAI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI)—a revolutionary consensus model that rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations. Essentially, LCAI isn’t just a blockchain; it’s a scalable, privacy-focused AI innovation platform, all powered by its signature Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Think of it as blockchain meeting AI to create something extraordinary. Joining the Lightchain ecosystem now means locking in discounted tokens during the presale and gaining access to cutting-edge features that integrate AI with decentralized governance. Don’t miss out on the $0.003/token price before it climbs. Join the Presale . 👾 Okay, now that we’re primed with LCAI’s strengths, it’s time to see how SHIB stacks up. SHIB's Journey from Memecoin to Utility Player Ever since Shiba Inu (SHIB) emerged into the crypto space as the ""Dogecoin Killer,"" it has experienced meteoric popularity. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, SHIB leveraged its memetic appeal and a vibrant community to rise through the ranks of cryptocurrency. However, it hasn’t stopped there—Shiba Inu has actively worked to distance itself from being ""just another memecoin."" Projects like Shibarium, SHIB's layer-2 solution, are designed to make the coin more scalable and functional for real-world applications. Combined with its ShibaSwap DEX, SHIB is taking steps to be more than just a speculation tool—it’s attempting to become a bona fide player in the DeFi world. SHIB vs. LCAI—Philosophy and Focus Utility and Technology SHIB: Rooted in meme culture, SHIB's primary appeal lies in its brand and strong community support. While developments like Shibarium could enhance utility, the project still relies heavily on its memetic identity. LCAI: Technology-oriented, LCAI is built for scalability, AI integration, and true decentralized applications. The unique PoI model and AIVM directly enable complex AI tasks, offering real utility within AI-driven ecosystems. Consensus Mechanism SHIB: Built on Ethereum, SHIB uses Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS). While PoS is environmentally friendly and offers decent scaling, it’s not tailored for AI-powered applications or data processing. LCAI: The Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism doesn’t just secure the blockchain; it rewards valuable AI tasks like model training and optimization. It’s the first consensus model of its kind, making LCAI not just a blockchain but an enabler of AI innovation. Community vs. Ecosystem SHIB: The SHIB community undeniably moves markets, but beyond fan enthusiasm, it’s still building the tools (like Shibarium) that could offer lasting utility. LCAI: With a growing global developer community and features like decentralized governance, LCAI invites its users to build and interact within an intelligent blockchain ecosystem. It merges innovation with its community mechanism—one doesn’t exist without the other. Applications in Decentralized Finance Both SHIB and LCAI are aiming to stake (pun intended) their claim in the DeFi landscape. However, their approaches, focuses, and ultimate capabilities differ significantly. Lightchain AI’s DeFi Contributions Scalable AI for Financial Models: LCAI's AIVM allows institutions to create decentralized applications with tailored financial algorithms using intelligent computations. Transparent Governance: Through decentralized governance, Lightchain Protocol empowers token holders with a vote, blending AI and blockchain for smarter decision-making. Efficiency in Lending and Borrowing Protocols: By training AI models to analyze financial risk in real-time, LCAI simplifies DeFi processes like asset lending and portfolio management. SHIB’s DeFi Contributions ShibaSwap: SHIB’s decentralized exchange allows users to swap tokens seamlessly while participating in yield farming and staking. It’s a good first step into DeFi, but the platform competes with more mature DEX platforms like Uniswap. Shibarium Impact: With lower gas fees and faster transactions than Ethereum base-layer solutions, Shibarium seeks to supercharge SHIB’s utility in DeFi. Still, it remains in development stages. Game-Changing Features to Watch Feature LCAI SHIB Consensus Model Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) AI Integration Built-in with AIVM for executing complex AI tasks None Ecosystem Focus Scalable AI frameworks + decentralized applications Community-first with ongoing steps toward utility DeFi Contribution Transparent governance, dynamic lending, and predictive AI ShibaSwap, yield farming, and Shibarium (under development) Current Price $0.001125/LCAI (Presale Pricing) Market-driven price LCAI and SHIB—Can They Coexist? The most exciting part? LCAI and SHIB aren’t necessarily direct competitors. One could argue that SHIB appeals to the emotional, community-driven side of blockchain while LCAI caters to those ready to integrate intelligent systems into decentralized applications. For investors and enthusiasts alike, the opportunity to explore, align, and diversify across both ecosystems could be the ultimate win. 🔗 Lightchain AI Presale 🌐 Lightchain Website 📄 Lightchain Whitepaper 📢 Follow Us on Twitter/X 💬 Join the Telegram Community Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The meme personality is facing serious backlash after her newly launched cryptocurrency, Hawk, took a nosedive from a $490 million market cap to just $60 million in mere hours. The crypto community, including YouTuber “Coffeezilla” (whose real name is Stephen Findeisen), is accusing Welch of running a “pump and dump” scheme, where hype drives the price up, only for insiders to cash out and leave investors hanging. Welch denied any wrongdoing. In a social media post, she claimed that her team “tried to stop snipers,” bad actors who artificially inflate prices by buying large amounts early, creating an illusion of demand.

How to stay safe from rug pulls A community note on Welch’s X post indicated that Welch’s team had been “selling their token since launch.” At last check Saturday, the Hawk Tuah coin was down over 7%. Just minutes earlier, it was up by 0.45%. Source: CoinMarketCap What’s at stake and did Hawk Tuah Girl profit? Sniping entices ordinary investors to buy in on a token at a high price, thinking they’re catching a rising trend. After snipers sell their holdings, the token’s price falls off a cliff, leaving late investors holding nearly worthless assets. Hawk launched on the Solana blockchain, and while meme coins are usually seen as low-risk fun, this one has sparked accusations of rug pulling , a cryptocurrency scam in which developers withdraw liquidity or suddenly abandon a project, resulting in the token’s price plummeting. In a YouTube video posted Dec. 5, Coffeezilla — who has made a name for scrutinizing the legitimacy of coins backed by influencers (i.e., Andrew Tate ) — noted that Welch, who made a name by pretending to spit in a viral video , claimed the coin was meant to unite fans and tackle impersonators. Unfortunately, it seems the only thing united was the confusion. A recorded back-and-forth between Coffeezilla and Welch’s legal representative, which currently has over 2.7 million views on YouTube, reveals what appears to be a convoluted payment structure for Welch and the Hawk Tuah-inspired coin. Welch, according to Coffeezilla citing comments from her reps, was paid roughly $125,000 in advance from an unnamed company to market the Hawk Tuah token. She was subsequently meant to receive 50% of net proceeds after “payments of costs to third parties,” Coffeezilla adds. Details regarding the third parties remains unclear. Crypto.news has asked Welch to comment, but has not heard back. “I think this whole situation is terrible and she should feel bad,” Coffeezilla concludes. “[Welch] got in bed with these people who clearly saw dollar signs. She saw dollar signs and they did this and people have been hurt.” See Coffeezilla’s exposé before. Read more: Stablecoins on shaky ground?

OpenAI has notably not set any timeline for the development of AGI. Reevaluating the AGI clause It is no secret that OpenAI has been pursuing the AGI milestone, an ambitious level in AI technology. AGI is described as an autonomous system that can outperform humans at economically valuable tasks. Under the current contractual agreement, Microsoft’s access would be voided to the advanced AGI model when it’s developed. The clause that prevents Microsoft from accessing OpenAI’s AGI was initially included to prevent the commercial misuse of the model. According to its quarterly filings , Microsoft has invested about $13 billion in the startup. It also contributed another $750 million in a recent raise, which pushed OpenAI’s valuation to over $150 billion. However, there are concerns that if Microsoft is unable to access AGI, it may reduce or even stop investing. OpenAI is considering removing the provision to allow Microsoft access to AGI once it is available. The timeline for AGI remains vague. However, the Sam Altman-led firm no longer defines AGI as a single point. Instead, it considers AGI to be a continuous process. Altman mentioned, “We’ve also said that our intention is to treat AGI as a mile marker along the way. We’ve left ourselves some flexibility because we don’t know what will happen.” Investment implications of OpenAI’s shift from non-profit status OpenAI started accepting external funding in 2019 to cover costs for developing AI, with Microsoft leading the way with $1 billion. In exchange, Microsoft got licenses to some of the startup’s pre-AGI technologies. Then, OpenAI made the strategic decision to go from being a non-profit research lab to a for-profit organization. This transition was intended to attract the sizeable capital it would need to develop its products. Altman acknowledged that the organization’s initial structure did not anticipate the vast resources needed for product development, saying “When we started, we had no idea we were going to be a product company or that the capital we needed would turn out to be so huge, if we knew those things, we would have picked a different structure.” OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit model has drawn a lot of criticism, including from Elon Musk, one of the project’s early backers. Elon Musk has since moved on to establish a competing AI startup, xAI. Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of deviating from the AI startup’s original mission. He accused Altman, who stands to receive a direct equity stake in the startup, of “deceit of Shakespearean proportions.” The AI industry is resource-intensive, and OpenAI’s contemplation of removing the AGI clause from its agreement with Microsoft could be a pivotal moment in the technology’s evolution. However, questions will remain about how it balances the need for investment with ethical principles.

Interestingly, the government department also acknowledged BTC as “digital gold.” US Treasury Highlights Bitcoin’s Rapid Growth In its 2024 Q4 report , the US Treasury stated that Bitcoin and other digital assets have rapidly grown from a small base. According to the US Department, the primary use case for BTC, which they also referred to as “digital gold,” seems to be a store of value in the DeFi world. Like the US Treasury, Fed Chair Jerome Powell also recently likened Bitcoin to gold as he compared both assets. Jerome Powell said that BTC is a speculative asset that has a closer correlation to gold than the US dollar. Meanwhile, the US department said that speculative interest seems to have played a prominent role in the growth of Bitcoin and other digital tokens thus far. Whatever it might be, BTC has undoubtedly witnessed massive growth. In 2015, the flagship crypto had a market cap of $6.4 million. In 2019, it grew to $194 billion. Now, Bitcoin boasts a market cap of $2.3 trillion. The Bitcoin price isn’t showing signs of stopping anytime soon, as it recently crossed the $100,000 milestone. Bitcoin’s success is already driving institutional FOMO as more companies are looking to adopt the flagship crypto as an asset on their balance sheet. Recently, manufacturer Worksport announced that it would adopt Bitcoin and XRP for its corporate treasury. Stablecoins Are Also In Focus The US Treasury report also highlighted stablecoins as another category of digital assets that have witnessed rapid growth. The report stated that stablecoin growth has resulted in a modest increase in demand for short-dated treasuries. Fiat-backed stablecoins are said to have a significant portion of their collateral in the form of treasury bills and treasury-backed repo transactions. The US Treasury estimates that $120 billion in total stablecoin collateral is directly invested in Treasuries. Over the near term, the US department expects continued growth in stablecoin markets along with the overall size of the digital asset market. They also predict that the rapid growth of Bitcoin and other digital assets and massive volatility might lead to future hedging needs and fight-to-quality demand for Treasuries.

According to the data, Binance Labs transferred 30 million GMT (GMT) tokens from its investment wallets to Binance two days ago. The dollar equivalent of this amount is measured at $7.29 million. Today, the company moved 400,000 Axie Infinity (AXS) tokens to Binance, equivalent to a total of $3.72 million. Binance Labs, one of the first project investors of GMT, received a total of 75 million GMT as compensation for the investment. This corresponds to approximately $15 million at current prices. The company was also an early investor in Axie Infinity, receiving 11.8 million AXS tokens in return for its investment, currently worth around $100 million. Although there has been a recent rise in the altcoin market, it cannot be said that Binance Labs has sold its tokens at the peak price. AXS climbed to $ 165 for a while, and at the time of writing this article, it is traded at $ 9.44. Related News: There is a Development in Coinbase Lawsuit: Previously Unknown Documents Released The GMT price had climbed to a peak of $4.11, and at the time of writing this article, it is hovering at $0.24. The reason for the failure to sell at the peak value may be a token lockup agreement the projects have made with Binance Labs, but the details of the agreements are unknown. *This is not investment advice.

As this new crypto exchange builds momentum, it’s attracting attention from PEPEand KAS traders seeking fresh opportunities. With plans to bring advanced features to the market, Lunex could become a significant player, challenging existing platforms and drawing interest from diverse trading communities. Its early success highlights the growing demand for innovative platforms and ranks it among the most exciting crypto projects this year. Lunex Network Piques Interest From Retailers and Institutions Lunex Network is gaining traction as a crypto exchange that enables seamless and powerful decentralized finance. True to its non-custodial nature, Lunex Network allows users to hold their assets while removing the risks associated with dealing with a centralized exchange. Staking on Lunex Network offers rates as high as 18% APY, enabling portfolios to grow with excellent passive income potential. There’s also a Lunex debit card currently in the works. Users can experience unparalleled convenience, making spending cryptocurrencies on daily transactions a smooth process. One of Lunex Network's key strengths is its interoperability, as it supports over 40 blockchains, simplifying multi-chain trading. The portfolio tracker also efficiently tracked everything in detail, arming the user with the knowledge needed to navigate the volatility of crypto markets. Security is the utmost priority in the Lunex Network. User assets are completely secured in smart contracts and high-end encryption technologies that allow speedy and seamless transactions. Giving the stage to the diversity of features aggregated on one platform empowers traders with the complete package they need under one roof. PEPE Initiates Bullish Momentum On Crypot Indytsry PEPE’s success in Q4 stood out, prompting a creation of 21% of the network’s addresses between November and December. After surging 150% in November, PEPE seems to have hit a growth ceiling. The meme coin registered 8% in the past week as BTC crossed $100,000. Prior to this, PEPE struggled with resistance at the $0.000023 price point. Currently, PEPE is trading above its 50-day and 200-day averages. With an increase in active addresses, transactions over $100,000 surged 137% within the last week. Per technical analysis, there is a “buy” signal for PEPE despite contrary signals from the Momentum Indicator and the Commodity Channel Index. KAS Maintains An Upward Trend Kaspa (KAS) has been gaining traction due to its unique GhostDAG protocol, which ensures scalability while maintaining high security. In recent weeks, KAS has seen a notable uptick in trading volumes, reflecting increased market interest. With 18 green days in the last 30 days, KAS increased by 48.5%. Technical charts show KAS establishing firm support at lower levels while gradually creating higher lows, indicative of bullish sentiment. Momentum, from its innovative proof-of-work architecture, has driven adoption among miners and developers. If this trend continues, Kaspacould challenge its recent highs. Conclusion The more profitable way to capitalize on Lunex Network is via its presale. After generating $4.5 million in a few weeks, analysts have highlighted LNEX’s 33x potential after its launch. With tokens going for as low as $0.0038, it’s no wonder that crypto whales are leaving KASand PEPE for Lunex Network.

New DeFi Crypto Draws Whales,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/ethereums-2025-projection-looks-insanely-bullish-new-defi-crypto-draws-whales,"The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, is once again on a strong bullish trajectory. ETH's impressive output during this final quarter of 2024 has its 2025 projection from both crypto analysts and technical indicators looking insanely bullish. Similarly, a new DeFi crypto token called Lunex Network is drawing the attention of institutional investors with the exceptional achievements of its ongoing crypto presale. Here's why you should consider joining the whales in this ongoing crypto presale: Lunex Network: decentralized trading for users It is remarkable that, like every other day, new crypto projects are up and running today in the crypto space, but not all get recognized by the community of crypto enthusiasts. However, this new DeFi crypto trading platform, Lunex Network, has changed the narrative. Unlike its overlooked counterparts, Lunex Network is fast gaining recognition in the crypto industry for its innovative and unique features, which includes streamlining users' trading experience with advanced tools and resources. The key appeal of Lunex Network lies in its decentralized nature, where the orders and trades are automatically executed via smart contracts. This setup assures investors that their crypto assets are secure on the platform. They can store, buy, swap, and stake crypto from their mobile or desktop apps. Crypto whales are gravitating towards Lunex Network because it enables them to amass wealth and achieve their investment goals with its dynamic portfolio tracker, all within a single app. Ethereum (ETH) poised for significant price increases in 2025 Ethereum (ETH) has awakened from its long slumber, increasing by 59.71% within a month, with significant increases recorded in its trading volume and market cap as well. Following its recent bullish performance, ETH is poised to influence an altcoin season. In line with the ETH price prediction from top crypto experts during the past week, ETH has surpassed the crucial $4,000 level. Notably, Bitcoin's dominance dropped from 61.1% to 54.9%, while ETH's dominance increased as it surged above the $4,000 level. Once again, crypto experts have highlighted strong bullish patterns on the ETH trading chart— the cup-and-handle pattern, among others. They forecast a significant dominance and price increase for ETH to $7,346 in the first two quarters of 2025, with a test of the $10,000 level before the year runs out. Whales hop on Lunex Network’s ongoing presale Just like ETH, Lunex Network is poised for potential substantial price gains in 2025. By the end of the year, Lunex Network will have been better established in the crypto space. The platform is already getting significant recognition with its ongoing presale. Investing in $LNEX tokens unlocks a variety of enhanced benefits within the Lunexecosystem. Token holders enjoy reduced transaction fees and gain access to premium features, including liquidity mining opportunities and node leasing privileges. Currently, the tokens are selling for just $0.0038, and whales are jumping on the presale. Being seasoned investors, these whales recognize Lunex Network's potential for impressive returns as it prepares for its official launch in 2025. Conclusion The ETH price prediction suggests the token is aiming for unprecedented heights both in price and dominance in 2025. Meanwhile, Lunex Network is gaining recognition for its innovative platform features and the potential returns from its official token launch.

Grok made its public appearance in 2023, courtesy of Musk’s xAI, and was seamlessly woven into the fabric of X, previously known as Twitter. However, access to the chatbot was conditioned upon users securing an X premium subscription. On Friday, several users observed the modification, which enables non-premium subscribers to transmit up to ten messages to Grok every two hours. Grok is a “humorous AI assistant,” that was introduced by xAI last year. However, it was exclusively accessible to premium subscribers for a price starting at $8 a month or $84 a year. Musk’s xAI initiated the testing of a free variant of the AI tool in specific regions like New Zealand last month. Making Grok more accessible is expected to potentially enable it to compete with the free chatbot images that are already available. Everything there is to know about Grok Grok is renowned for its conversational capabilities, but it also functions as a versatile AI assistant. It can help users in the research and explanation of trending topics, provide coding support, and freely manage customer inquiries for business users. The AI chatbot is also a generative AI model that is trained on tens of thousands of GPUs using the data available on X . Although xAI has not yet released a formal statement certifying Grok’s availability for all users, many users have shared their subscription-free experiences with Grok. However, since this feature is accessible to all users, it is subject to certain restrictions. Non-premium users can interact with the AI tool by asking up to 10 questions every two hours, but according to the chatbot’s standards, they are limited to three image analyses and four images generated each day. Subscribers of X’s Premium and Premium+ plans, priced at $7 and $14 a month, respectively, get extended access, including the option to ask up to 50 questions every day. Grok, in comparison to its competitors The decision to make Grok AI freely accessible has intensified competition among chatbots, including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. ChatGPT 4, the most recent version, enables users to pose 10 inquiries every five hours, although both are conversational AIs. In contrast, Grok users who are not paying subscribers are permitted to pose ten inquiries to the chatbot every two hours. Although ChatGPT’s conversation style is predominantly formal, Grok AI is more inclined toward an informal style, as users have noted. 🚨Breaking: Grok free tier is now available worldwide . It is very limited: Can analyze 3 images a day Can do 10 messages per 2 hours including images X has also removed Grok 2 mini. You can now only make queries to grok 2. pic.twitter.com/pHWsaLgewk — ‏̤̮ (@blankspeaker) December 6, 2024 Additionally, several users have asserted that the tool addresses inquiries that ChatGPT fails to address. Additionally, Grok can access real-time data, whereas ChatGPT primarily utilizes pre-trained data. Musk has hinted that his AI tool may undergo additional developments, such as the capacity to process documents in formats such as PDFs and Word files. These attributes could assist Grok in distinguishing itself in a more competitive market. What could be Musk’s goal in the AI landscape with this shift? This update is timely, as xAI, Musk’s AI-focused venture, has recently received $6 billion in funding, resulting in a valuation of over $40 billion. A portion of these funds are being allocated to the expansion of xAI’s supercomputer facility in Memphis, Tennessee. Colossus, a potent supercomputer, is housed at the facility and is essential to Musk’s AI ambitions as he endeavors to compete with OpenAI. Moreover, Musk has intensified his legal dispute with OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, in the context of this expansion. He has now incorporated Microsoft into the court proceedings, accusing both entities of engaging in monopolistic practices within the AI sector.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 16:52:00

You should avoid dealing with this firm and beware of scams.” The FCA was concerned that Pump.fun was targeting UK residents while it was not authorized to do business in the country. Therefore, the regulator warned users against using the platform because of the risks involved.

UK-based users are asked to withdraw coins deposited via a link provided, but Pump.fun hasn’t made any public comment on the FCA’s warning through its official X account or Telegram channel. Controversies Continue to Pile up for Pump.fun Pump.fun, since its launch in January of 2024, has found itself in the middle of various controversies: May 2024: Livestreaming dangerous stunts, such as self-harm and threats toward animals, sparked outrage. In October 2024, child sexual abuse material was discovered on the platform, indicating some weakness in its moderation policies. In November 2024, despite these controversies, 62% of all Solana transactions came from Pump.fun, according to analytics platform Dune Analytics. These incidents have sparked serious questions over the operations and ethical standards of the platform.

Billionaire Israel “Izzy” Englander, CEO of Millennium Management, has sold off 68% of the firm’s Walmart (WMRT) position – 8.1 million shares worth about $745 million – according to its latest filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to data compiled by TickerTracker, Millennium has also significantly decreased its holdings of bluechip stocks Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN). In total, the shares sold by Millennium Management in Q3 amount to more than $20 billion. Meanwhile, Englander has reportedly increased the firm’s exposure to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBTC) as well as Microsoft (MSFT) and Spotify (SPOT). Englander is also shifting his focus in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, selling 95% of the firm’s shares in Rivian (RIVN) to get into the electric air flying taxi company Archer Aviation (ACHR), a favorite of ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood. Englander acquired 3,247,428 shares of the company, while Wood has been accumulating ACHR since August of 2023. ACHR is down 53% from its all-time high of $18.49 but up over 204% in the last month alone. Millenium Management has recorded 162% gains over the last four years. Other billionaire portfolio shakeups reported recently include Bill Ackman’s recent accumulation of asset manager Brookfield Corporation and apparel giant Nike, and Ken Fisher’s $800,000,000 bet on the US banking industry with his purchase of JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

Evrloot officially launches on Polkadot Evrloot, a blockchain RPG built on Polkadot’s Moonbeam network , has transitioned from closed beta to full launch as of Thursday. Built by a 13-member team at Chainfood Studio, Evrloot began as a passion project by Polkadot fans. In its beta phase, the game recorded over 1.5 million onchain transactions and peaked at 1000 monthly active users. Tobi “Deckard” Amann, CEO of Chainfood Studio, said of the game’s mechanics: “Through their in-game actions, players shape the story and forge the lore of this world. As RPG enthusiasts, creating a canvas like this has always been our dream — and with Evrloot, we’ve found an exciting and ethical opportunity to bring our vision fully onchain.” The free-to-play medieval fantasy game uses the ERC-6220 composable NFT standard to tokenize in-game characters and save files, items and achievements. One interesting stat: NFT trading volumes are making a comeback, climbing roughly 260% from $30 million to $108 million since early November. At its peak in February 2023, NFT weekly trading volumes reached about $632 million. Also of note: Illuvium is collaborating with Casio G-SHOCK to release an NFT card collection.

This level has proven challenging for DOGE in recent weeks, but the price action suggests the meme coin could be primed for a parabolic move. Bitcoin trader and investor Coinvo recently shared a technical analysis on X, emphasizing that DOGE has started a monthly breakout, signaling the potential for explosive growth. Coinvo’s analysis highlights that Dogecoin’s current setup aligns with historical patterns that have previously led to significant rallies. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Keep Buying – Price Holds Above Crucial Mark However, the bullish scenario hinges on the ability of DOGE bulls to reclaim and hold the $0.43 level as support. A successful breakout above this resistance could open the doors for a massive rally, drawing renewed interest from investors and potentially driving the price to new highs. Failure to reclaim this level may result in the loss of upward momentum. Such a scenario would create ideal conditions for a correction, as traders and investors could take profits or hesitate to enter the market without confirmation of strength. Positive Outlook For Dogecoin After weeks of relentless “only up” price action, Dogecoin has entered a consolidation phase, trading sideways for over ten days below the $0.44 resistance level. Despite this pause, the meme coin exhibits remarkable resilience, showing little to no signs of weakness. This stability amidst market uncertainty suggests that Dogecoin may be preparing for its next significant move. Top analyst Coinvo recently shared a compelling technical analysis on X, pointing out that Dogecoin appears to have initiated a parabolic rally on the monthly chart. Coinvo highlighted that such consolidations often act as a foundation for further upward momentum, allowing the market to catch its breath before resuming its rally. Historically, Dogecoin has demonstrated an ability to consolidate before launching into massive price surges, and this time seems no different. This phase could be a necessary pause to fuel the next leg up, potentially propelling DOGE to new all-time highs. The current price action indicates strong support, with buyers stepping in to maintain the price above key levels. If Dogecoin manages to break above the $0.44 resistance, it could signal the start of a fresh bullish wave, likely bringing significant attention back to the meme coin. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week? However, market participants should remain cautious, as resistance at $0.44 has proven formidable. A confirmed breakout above this level would bolster the bullish narrative, but failure to do so could extend the consolidation phase. For now, Dogecoin remains one of the most closely watched assets in the market, with its next move potentially shaping its trajectory for the coming months. Is DOGE Ready For ATH? Dogecoin appears poised to break above key resistance levels at $0.44 and $0.48, signaling a potential continuation of the rally that began on November 5. After reaching a local high of $0.48 on November 23, DOGE entered a consolidation phase on November 12, maintaining a steady range. This consolidation has set the stage for the next decisive move. If DOGE successfully breaks above the $0.44 resistance and reclaims the $0.48 level while holding these as support, a massive breakout is likely to follow. Such a move would reaffirm bullish momentum and could propel the price into uncharted territory, drawing significant attention from traders and investors. However, failure to breach these critical levels could signal trouble for DOGE. A rejection at $0.44 or $0.48 would likely trigger a correction, weakening demand and pushing the price to lower levels. This would prolong the consolidation phase or potentially lead to a bearish trend as the market digests the lack of momentum.

This has stirred up a growing concern from the crypto market, which is questioning the company’s transparency. According to several blockchain analytics platforms, including Lookonchain, Tether’s minting activities occurred on the Ethereum and Tron networks. The world’s largest stablecoin issuer’s latest move predates earlier mints of December 3 and December 5, each day witnessing a liquidity bump of $1 billion. Tether minted 2B $USDT again 6 hours ago! #Tether has minted 19B $USDT on #Ethereum and #Tron since Nov 6! https://t.co/mRlyzWmCSj pic.twitter.com/D3OmnyXVxc — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 7, 2024 The crypto community has raised questions about the adequacy of Tether’s reserves amid its rapid minting activity. Critics warn that issuing large volumes of USDT without transparent proof of backing could erode trust and shake market confidence, especially if the company fails to provide sufficient evidence of its reserve holdings. USDT stablecoin liquidity market dynamics The ongoing crypto market bull run has caused a significant uptick in trading activity. When the market experiences periods of asset price surges, like the recent Bitcoin rally, demand for stablecoins across blockchain networks also rises. This, like in Tether’s case, may fuel the need for stablecoin issuers to mint more coins to stabilize trading volumes. Market observers believe Tether’s $2 billion in newly issued USDT is beneficial to the crypto market, as the boosted liquidity helps facilitate transactions and intensifies buying pressure. However, the crypto community remains divided on the implications of Tether’s activity. Some argue that the increased liquidity supports market efficiency, while others warn that excessive minting without transparency erodes the market’s trust. Sounds like Tether is prepping for a big party, but remember: trustless systems thrive on transparency. Let’s hope they keep the community informed as $USDT grows. Too much minting without clarity can lead to uncertainties, just like bad coffee! $OSAI #bitcoin — Satoshi AI🧠💡 (@open_satoshi_ai) December 7, 2024 The growing concerns revolve around the potential for over-supply if the minting process is not carefully managed. The rapid increase in USDT issuance could, if unchecked, create market imbalances and negatively affect the stablecoin’s long-term stability and sustainability. Tether responds to transparency concerns Tether has constantly faced heavy criticism for its reserve procedures. However, Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino has asserted the company’s commitment to backing its coins with secure assets like US Treasury bills. Just to correct the statement: we're still discussing with the regulator about our concerns that I expressed in our interview, that would pose severe risks to stablecoins regulated in EU. Uninsured cash deposits are not a good idea. We should learn from what happened with… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖🍐 (@paoloardoino) April 11, 2024 Through a post made on X, Ardiono urged stablecoin companies to learn from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. He called for stablecoin issuers to keep 100% of their reserves in low-risk assets to reduce the dangers associated with uninsured cash deposits. “ Stablecoins should keep reserves primarily in treasury bills to avoid exposure to bank failures ,” Ardoino wrote. Tether faces allegations of drug trafficking ties In other news, unsealed court records have revealed Tether’s alleged involvement in a separate case tied to drug trafficking operations in the United States, Mexico, and Colombia. Federal authorities are seeking the forfeiture of over $5 million in Tether stored across three crypto accounts linked to money laundering . Investigations suggest that more than $15 million worth of crypto flowed through one Binance account associated with suspected drug proceeds between 2020 and 2023. The case began in August 2020 with a tip-off about an individual, identified as “D.C.,” involved in drug trafficking. Authorities discovered a network of front businesses and residential safe houses allegedly used to launder money, including a trucking company in Milwaukee. Speaking to independent media company 404 Media, a Tether spokesperson stated that the transactions in question occurred on the “secondary market,” meaning they were not conducted through entities directly sourcing USDT from Tether. The spokesperson highlighted the stablecoin company’s use of blockchain tracing tools and partnerships with law enforcement to combat illicit activities. “Every action is online, every transaction traceable, and every asset can be seized,” they emphasized.

The 12 Bitcoin ETFs recorded positive inflows throughout the week, driven by optimism about a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump, who recently appointed pro-crypto former federal regulator Paul Atkins as SEC chair, succeeding the anti-crypto Gary Gensler. The highest inflows of the week, totaling $766 million, were recorded on Dec. 5, alongside a 50% surge in daily ETF trading volume, as Bitcoin soared past the elusive $100K mark to a new all-time high of $103,679—a milestone widely celebrated by the crypto community. However, inflows into spot BTC ETF offerings dipped to $376.59 million on Friday, Dec. 6, as Bitcoin, the flagship crypto asset, dropped below $97,000, with the market experiencing liquidations exceeding half a billion dollars in a single day.

BlackRock’s IBIT, dominating inflows for the sixth consecutive day, led the lot with $257.03 million on Friday, Dec. 6, while only four out of the twelve funds managed to attract capital per data from SoSoValue. Inflows into the remaining ETFs are as follows: Fidelity’s FBTC: $120.17 million. ARK and 21Shares’ ARKB: $24.9 million. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust: $6.75 million. Grayscale’s GBTC was the sole outlier of the day, recording outflows of $32.3 million and extending its streak to four out of five days of the week, with a total of $303.5 million exiting the fund. The remaining seven BTC ETFs saw zero flows. Despite a late-week dip in inflows, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings of 1.1 million tokens, amassing over 1.104 million tokens within a year of their launch. Experts predict that U.S. institutional interest in Bitcoin through ETFs and corporate treasuries will keep growing, driving the broader digital asset ecosystem toward global adoption. Hex Trust CEO Alessio Quaglini suggests this trend could ignite competition among nation-states to acquire Bitcoin. Similarly, Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO of Mercuryo, told crypto.news that digital assets are evolving from speculative investments into transformative technology with widespread adoption. Bitcoin might climb to $200K by 2025 Weekly inflows into Bitcoin ETFs also helped push Bitcoin beyond the $100,000 mark last week, with experts projecting even greater heights for the leading cryptocurrency. In a recent note , Geoff Kendrick, the global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, predicted that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. “We would turn even more bullish if BTC saw more rapid uptake by US retirement funds, global sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), or a potential US strategic reserve fund,” he added. Similar projections have been made by analysts at Bitwise, citing increasing institutional demand and dwindling Bitcoin supply, amplified by the popularity of Bitcoin ETFs, as the key drivers. Despite the bullish projections, some industry experts have urged caution. Mike Novogratz, head of digital crypto bank Galaxy Digital, has warned of potential market corrections amid Bitcoin’s surge. According to him, a lot of market participants are “levered to the gills,” and as such, volatility is expected. Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder, recently echoed similar concerns, urging investors to keep their expectations in check, pointing to the 2021 bull market as a cautionary tale. “Bitcoin’s brief surge past $100,000 may not be sustainable in the short term,” Burniske explained, adding that inflated expectations in 2021 saw Bitcoin peak at $70,000 instead of the anticipated $100,000.

Remarkably, it also acknowledged Bitcoin as a digital gold. It noted the trends in digit asset growth and usage which has undergone a rapid growth from very low levels. It noted that growth has come both from native crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as stablecoins. A Store Of Value In The World Of Defi According to the US Department, the primary use case for BTC, which they also referred to as “digital gold,” seems to be a store of value in the DeFi world. It underscored that the speculative interest seems to have played a prominent role in the growth of digital tokens thus far. Recently, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell also likened Bitcoin to gold as he compared both assets. Jerome Powell said that BTC is a speculative asset that has a closer correlation to gold than the US dollar. The report also noted Bitcoin’s market cap over the years. In 2015, the flagship crypto had a market cap of $6.4 million. In 2019, it grew to $194 billion. Currently, Bitcoin boasts a market cap of $2.3 trillion. The Bitcoin price is not showing signs of stopping anytime soon, as it recently crossed the $100,000 milestone. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s success is driving institutional FOMO as more companies are looking to embrace it as an asset on their balance sheet. Stablecoin Growth The US Treasury report also highlighted stablecoins as another category of digital assets that have seen rapid growth. The report stated that stablecoin growth has resulted in a modest increase in demand for short-dated treasuries. Fiat-backed stablecoins are said to have a significant portion of their collateral in the form of treasury bills and treasury-backed repo transactions. The US Treasury estimates that $120 billion in total stablecoin collateral is directly invested in Treasuries. It also noted that Stablecoins play an integral role intermediating transactions in digital asset markets. Over 80% of all crypto transactions now use a stablecoin as one leg of the transaction. Over the near term, the US department expects continued growth in stablecoin markets along with the overall size of the digital asset market. “The High Beta Assets” The report also mentioned that in recent years, institutional sponsorship of Bitcoin citing instances of BlackRock ETF and MicroStrategy, has been growing and crypto assets have behaved like “high beta” assets. Further, they also predict that the rapid growth of Bitcoin and other digital assets and massive volatility might lead to future hedging needs and fight-to-quality demand for Treasuries.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 17:16:21

Whale Acquire $288 Million Worth XRP During the price correction, a crypto whale saw the price drop as an ideal buying opportunity and purchased a significant 120 million XRP tokens worth $288 million.

Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.55 and has experienced an impressive price surge of over 8% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 10%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Besides XRP’s impressive performance, data shows that other whales and institutions have also accumulated significant XRP tokens, in addition to the $288 million acquisition, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . XRP Price Prediction for December 8 According to expert technical analysis, XRP has recently broken out from a strong resistance level, which it had been facing after breaching the descending trendline.

As the petition to set Roger Ver free from bogus tax fraud charges a la the U.S. justice system gains momentum, Bitcoin’s Johnny Appleseed is a trending topic on a couple other fronts as well: the Polymarket and Kalshi betting websites. In an email to followers from the Free Roger Now Campaign sent on December 7, the organization announced: “We’re excited to share some breaking news in our journey to secure justice for Roger Ver! Roger is now a trending topic on Polymarket and Kalshi, two of the most prominent prediction markets, showcasing the global momentum surrounding his case.” As of December 8 at 12:32 am (JST) bettors on Polymarket believe there is a 42% chance that Donald Trump will pardon Roger within the first 100 days of his presidency. Kalshi bettors see a 31% chance. These markets are still quite young, having just started up this month, and are currently trending bets. Bets for Ver on Polymarket. Source: Polymarket.com. Casting lots for Bitcoin Jesus As H.L. Mencken once said: “A good politician is quite as unthinkable as an honest burglar.” Nonetheless, people are banking on Trump setting two Bitcoin luminaries free during his presidency — Ross Ulbricht and Roger Ver. Trump has promised to free Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht on “day one,” and Ver, a supporter of Ulbricht, wants to hold him to it. Ross is currently serving a double life sentence plus 40 years for his role in the Bitcoin-centric darknet marketplace for drugs. For his part, Roger is facing charges from the U.S. Department of Justice for alleged tax fraud, with the United States government claiming Ver “caused a loss to the IRS of at least $48 million,” by underreporting the value of his bitcoin holdings, and then selling later. However, critics of the IRS shakedown and Ver himself emphasize that he made every effort to comply with the law before renouncing his U.S. citizenship in 2014, and wasn’t even a citizen when he made the sale of BTC in question. Many believe he is being targeted for his consistent advocacy of free markets, and criticism of the state. Ver could face an unbelievable 109 years in prison if convicted. Bets for Ver and Ulbricht on the Kalshi prediction market. Source: Kalshi.com. Trump breaks promises, Bitcoiners hold out hope regardless For those who remember when Donald Trump was gunning for the White House in 2016, his repeated push to investigate and “lock up” democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for corruption turned out to be a massive nothing-burger. In fact, shortly after being installed as president, Trump honored the Clintons at a congressional luncheon and before that admitted to supporters chanting “Lock her up”: “That plays great before the election – now we don’t care, right?” Still, hoping against hope for some kind of bureaucratic crack in the wall, or the corruption of politics to be leveraged so that they actually do some good accidentally, bitcoiners of all cloths are signing petitions for both Ross and Roger . Aside from an outright jailbreak, this is what advocates of freedom have got right now, it seems. The Free Roger Now Campaign sees the listings on Polymarket and Kalshi as something much bigger than just betting, however. “These listings are more than just a milestone—they’re an opportunity to amplify Roger’s story and draw attention to the unjust charges he’s facing,” the email notes. “As the global conversation grows louder, so does the chance of securing justice.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|BTC|Kalshi|Polymarket|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-07 17:25:38

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 17:34:00

This surge followed a slight dip in Bitcoin’s value, creating a rush among investors to switch to altcoins. Should Bitcoin’s price face further corrections in the coming week, it’s possible that the prices of CRV, Hedera, and JasmyCoin could double. Altcoin Season Index Skyrockets Above Trendline Analyzing the altcoin season index chart, the metric has been skyrocketing over the last two weeks. The indicator is currently at 86, signalling that the altcoin season has kicked off. A reading of 75 signals the beginning of altcoin season. If this value approaches 100, it will further confirm that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting they may continue to do so. Curve Dao (CRV) Price Analysis The long wick and tail on CRV’s candlestick indicate selling pressure at higher prices and buying interest during dips. After witnessing a strong surge, the price of CRV faced resistance around $1.34. As of writing, CRV price trades at $1.2, surging over 1.1% in the last 24 hours. If CRV price maintains a price of $1, the CRV/USDT pair might aim for the high of $1.6, which sellers will likely staunchly defend. A sharp decline from this level could lead the bears to drive the price down to $0.9, potentially establishing a trading range. On the other hand, if buyers overcome the $1.6 resistance, the pair could surge to $2.5 and possibly extend to $3.5. However, if sellers manage to pull the price below $0.9, they could regain control. Hedera (HBAR) Price Analysis HBAR price has experienced a pullback during a strong uptrend, signaling that traders are taking profits near the $0.4 mark. The pullback is currently finding support within the range $0.27 and $0.32. Bulls will attempt to drive the price up to $0.4, where they are expected to encounter significant resistance from sellers. Should the price drop and breach the $0.27 level, it could indicate the beginning of a sharp correction. In this scenario, the HBAR/USDT pair might fall to the 200-day EMA at $0.17. Following a significant pullback, the market might enter a consolidation phase as both buyers and sellers prepare for the next significant move. JasmyCoin (JASMY) Price Analysis Though Jasmy coin price made a bearish pressure below immediate Fib channels, it is poised to recover as buying pressure intensifies around the dip. There is slight resistance at $0.06, but if this level is breached, the JASMY/USDT pair could climb towards the crucial resistance of $0.077, where sellers are likely to strongly contest further gains. The first indication of a weakening trend will be if the price breaks below and closes beneath the EMA trend lines. This would imply that the bulls are losing control, potentially leading the pair to drop to $0.033.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|CRV|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-07 17:38:03

Next year, it will range between $13.57 and $14.91, with an average price of $14.20. In 2030, it will range between $94.25 and $114.83, with an average price of $97.71. Aptos has aggressively attracted capital into its ecosystem with its total value locked (TVL) rising above $1 billion. Aptos is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain with a mature ecosystem comprising a variety of decentralized decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Aptos network continues to build decentralized applications and tools for developers. But how about APT’s performance? How high will it go? Is APT a good investment? Let’s explore these questions in our Cryptopolitan price predictions from 2024 to 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Aptos Ticker APT Current price $14.56 Market cap $7.80B Trading volume $514.28M Circulating supply 535.65M All-time high $19.90 on Jan 30, 2023 All-time low $3.09 on Dec 30, 2022 24-hour high $15.29 24-hour low $14.45 Aptos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 9.59% 50-day SMA $11.01 200-day SMA $8.83 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 75 (Greed) Green days 20/30 (67%) Aptos price analysis At press time, Aptos traded at $14.56, a 0.24% rise in 24 hours, with its trading volume dropping by 27.45%. The price chart shows Aptos could be heading for a retest after a daily breakout. Aptos 1-day chart price analysis APT/USD chart. Source: TradingView Aptos was range-bound in the third quarter of 2024, oscillating between $4.63 and $7.40, but broke out upwards on September 21, rising above $10 and $14 into the last quarter. The William Alligator is feeding, signaling rising volatility, while the relative strength index is now in neutral territory after reversing from overbought territory when it reached $14.75. The MACD indicator registers positive momentum. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis Aptos/ USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart closely mirrors the daily chart with rising volatility and a neutral RSI at 67.42. It also registers positive momentum in the time frame. If Apto’s price corrects, watch the $12 level on the chart at the channel’s lower trendline. The cryptocurrency could find resistance near a range of narrow consolidation. Investors should monitor the $15 level upon an upside revival. A rally into this area would likely face resistance from an earlier high at the flattening 200-day EMA.

Our analysis shows a bullish market sentiment, while the Fear and Greed Index shows greed among investors. The chart however shows APT’s positive momentum is slowing. Why is Aptos up? Aptos has been on a bullish run since October rising from as low as $7 to the current highs at $14. The wider crypto market shared a similar sentiment despite getting in the party later in November. Is Aptos a good investment? APTOS’s design prioritizes scalability, reliability, and upgradeability. It is notable for using the MOVE programming language, developed by Facebook and now META. While the current trend is bearish, predictions paint a different narrative. Will Aptos reach $10? Yes, Aptos rose above $10 this year. The move came as the market recovered from previous highs. Will Aptos reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Aptos will reach the $100 mark in 2030. Will Aptos reach $1000?

McAfee says hackers are increasingly deploying a group of malicious financial apps containing “SpyLoan” malware, posing a serious threat with more than eight million active installations around the world. The apps are on Google Play and use the names, logos, brand colors and interfaces of well-known financial institutions. Once installed, users are asked for sensitive personal information and documents. “Users are prompted to provide sensitive legal identification documents and personal information, banking accounts, employee information along with device data that is exfiltrated from the victim’s device.” The privacy terms of the predatory loan apps are extensive and require users to allow access to data such as text messages, call logs and contact addresses. The information is sometimes used as a tool to enforce repayment of loans, according to McAfee. “Users have reported alarming experiences, such as: – Receiving threatening calls and death threats for delayed payments. – Having personal photos and IDs misused to intimidate them. – The app accesses their contacts to send harassing messages to friends and family.” The firm says users of the predatory loans are experiencing rampant cases of privacy violations. “Personal information is exploited for blackmail or sold to third parties. This might include sextortion with victims’ pictures that can be exfiltrated or created with AI.” The predatory loans offered by the malicious apps are expensive while the loan terms lack transparency. “Hidden Fees and High Interest Rates: Users receive less than the promised loan amount but are required to repay the full amount plus exorbitant fees within a short period. Unauthorized Charges: Some apps initiate unauthorized transactions or charge hidden fees.” To stay safe, McAfee recommends people carefully monitor their phone’s permissions, verify app legitimacy and report suspicious activity to authorities or app stores. The predatory loan apps are most prevalent in Africa, South America and Southeast Asia with India, Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Kenya, Colombia, Vietnam, Chile and Nigeria being the worst hit.

The XRP price resurgence has gained traction as the asset maintains a diverse distribution of tokens across institutional custodians, exchanges, and individual accounts. As of press time, XRP was valued at $2.52, rallying by over 5% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the Ripple -affiliated digital asset has gained over 33%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Looking at the asset’s distribution, out of the maximum supply of 100 billion XRP, approximately 57 billion XRP is in circulation. Ripple’s escrow accounts hold a substantial 38.04 billion XRP, gradually released to ensure liquidity control and supply management. Notably, 13.18 million XRP has been permanently burned, reducing the total available supply to 99.99 billion XRP. XRP’s top holders For specific holders, as of December 2024, Ripple remains the largest custodian of XRP, holding a significant share of the cryptocurrency’s supply. According to data retrieved by Finbold on December 7 from XRP Scan , among the top ten holders, Ripple’s escrow accounts collectively hold 5 billion XRP, distributed across accounts labeled Ripple (11), Ripple (10), and Ripple (28). Additionally, exchanges Uphold and Binance rank ninth and tenth, respectively. Uphold holds approximately 1.84 billion XRP, while Binance follows closely with 1.83 billion XRP. Other notable entities include Bithumb (1.39 billion XRP), UPbit (1.22 billion XRP), and Coincheck (623.4 million XRP). XRP top ten holders. Source: XRP Scan Despite XRP’s distribution across a diverse pool of holders, its concentration in a few key entities, particularly Ripple, raises concerns about control and decentralization. Such concerns have previously led to inquiries into XRP’s authenticity, with financial educator and analyst Rajat Soni labeling the asset a ‘scam’ due to alleged centralization, which could enable price manipulation. However, it’s worth noting that despite a few entities holding a significant portion of XRP, Ripple does not control the XRP Ledger. Changes to the ledger require validator consensus rather than unilateral decisions. The total XRP supply, capped at 100 billion since its pre-mining phase, remains unchanged. What’s Next for XRP? XRP is riding strong bullish momentum, supported by a favorable technical setup. According to a cryptocurrency analyst with the pseudonym Cryptoinsightuk in an X post on December 7, the asset could soar to an ambitious $5.26 by December 11. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analyst highlighted that XRP faced resistance at the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels during its previous range-bound phase, often key zones for price reversals. Once it broke through, XRP surged to the 4.236 Fibonacci extension in just three days. Now, in a similar position, XRP is testing the same retracement levels. If history repeats itself, a breakthrough could trigger another rapid rally to the $5.26 target. While this projection may seem optimistic, XRP’s explosive rally of almost 340% over the past month suggests it’s not entirely out of reach. However, the possibility of XRP entering overbought territory, signaling a potential pullback, remains a key area to monitor in the short term. At the same time, XRP is backed by strong fundamentals, including ongoing post-election momentum and the nomination of a pro-crypto official to replace the outgoing Gary Gensler as the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).

From counterterrorism to trade and holding back China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific, these two giants have stood side by side. Their partnership has only grown stronger over the years, especially after India was tagged as a “Major Defense Partner” of the United States in 2016. But when it comes to Bitcoin, they don’t see eye to eye. America might go through with the idea of launching a national Bitcoin reserve soon, but India wouldn’t even flirt with it. And the reasons for this gap are all about politics, economics, and to be honest, plain common sense. Bilateral bonds are stronger than ever The friendship dates back to India’s independence from the British in 1947. Over the years, the two nations have found common ground on global security, economic ties, and shared democratic values. Gallup polls show just how much Americans love India. In 2023, 70% of Americans had a favorable view of India. That’s not a fluke either. Over the past decade, these numbers have consistently hovered between 70% and 77%. Indians feel the same way about America. After the fall of Afghanistan in 2021, a Morning Consult poll revealed that 79% of Indians viewed the U.S. favorably—higher than any other major country surveyed. The numbers are equally strong in trade. The U.S. became India’s largest trading partner in 2021, while India is the U.S.’s seventh-largest. American exports to India totaled $25.7 billion in 2017, with imports hitting $48.6 billion. India sends gems, textiles, IT services, and coffee to the U.S., while America ships over aircraft, fertilizers, and computer hardware. These are the building blocks of a healthy partnership. Even defense ties are rock solid. The Quad—an alliance between India, the U.S., Japan, and Australia—is a prime example of their shared security goals. The U.S. Senate has even bent over backward to accommodate India’s purchase of Russian S-400 missiles to avoid sanctions. Senators from both parties urged President Biden to waive penalties, pointing out how critical India is for U.S. dominance in South Asia and the Indian Ocean. India’s cold shoulder to Bitcoin Now let’s talk Bitcoin. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is dead set against crypto and keeps warning about the risks of financial instability, scams, and misuse for illegal activities. If Bitcoin can’t even buy you a chai in Mumbai, how can it back a national reserve? The ambiguity around crypto laws in India doesn’t help either. For years, the government has danced around banning private cryptos altogether. Proposed legislation often leans toward heavy restrictions, creating massive uncertainty for investors. But let’s say India does try to give Bitcoin a shot. The volatility alone could wreck its economy. Bitcoin’s value is a rollercoaster, and any country holding it in reserves risks losing billions overnight. For a nation with 1.4 billion people relying on stable economic conditions, that’s a gamble not worth taking. Even if volatility wasn’t an issue, Bitcoin would still complicate India’s monetary policy. The RBI uses its reserves to manage inflation and currency value. Bitcoin, being decentralized and detached from India’s economic performance, would throw a wrench into this system. No central authority controls Bitcoin, which sounds great for anarchists but is a nightmare for governments. Strategic autonomy and geopolitical realities Now India isn’t a country that likes being told what to do. Its foreign policy revolves around strategic autonomy—making its own choices while balancing relations with global powers. This was clear during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the U.S. and its allies condemned Russia, India abstained from a UN vote against the invasion. The reason? Seventy percent of India’s arms come from Russia. For comparison, only 14% come from the U.S., and 5% from Israel. India wasn’t about to alienate its biggest weapons supplier, no matter what anyone said. Plus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vlad Putin are close friends on a “personal level,” as we’ve reported before. The same logic applies to Bitcoin. India doesn’t want its monetary policy dictated by a decentralized asset it can’t control. Allowing Bitcoin into its reserves could also trigger capital flight, where investors move their money out of India to avoid regulations or taxes. This would sap liquidity from the Indian economy, making it even harder to manage financial stability. Technological issues add to the difficulty. Holding Bitcoin requires a robust infrastructure to prevent hacking and theft. Remember the Mt. Gox disaster? Billions in Bitcoin vanished due to poor security. India isn’t ready for that level of risk. Unlike the U.S., which has established crypto exchanges and institutional support, India is still playing catch-up. Public distrust and economic inequalities Let’s not forget the people. Cryptocurrencies have an image problem in India. Trust in Bitcoin as a stable asset is low, and it would take years of education and outreach to change that. For a country focused on eradicating poverty and improving financial literacy, Bitcoin isn’t even on the priority list. Keep in mind India’s population is insanely large. Then there’s the issue of financial inclusion. Millions of Indians are unbanked or underbanked, meaning they don’t have access to traditional financial systems. Introducing Bitcoin, which requires internet access and a certain level of technical know-how, would only widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots. India is already working to bring more people into the banking system. Pushing Bitcoin into the mix would only complicate things. While president Trump might see Bitcoin as a futuristic reserve asset, Modi sees it as a liability. For the strict leader, stability and control are non-negotiable.

Noteworthy, Tether had printed 1 billion USDT a day before and another 1 billion two days before that. This summed up its total USDT mints on Ethereum and Tron in 30 days to 19 billion. Ultimately, this underscores Tether’s dominance in the crypto sector, especially in providing liquidity to the crypto market. Minting is a strategy to inject liquidity into the digital asset industry, as it involves creating tokens. However, the move has ignited some debates about transparency and potential systemic risks. Tether to Meet Liquidity Demands With More Mints Theoretically, liquidity in the market facilitates smoother transactions while helping traders hedge against volatility. This addition of more USDT can stabilize prices and even narrow spreads during high trading volumes. Bitcoin is currently trading at $99,734.93 but is also in high volatility. Increased USDT liquidity could serve as the balance in the market, depending on how it is deployed. On the other hand, it could make price fluctuations worse than they already are. Crypto Community Concerned About Tether’s Potential Over-supply of Liquidity The concern of netizens at the moment is the problem of over-supply. Amidst the demonstration of its utility, evident in its ability to meet liquidity demands, there are fears that it may need to be more effectively managed. On X, the user articulated this concern in a post on Saturday. “Sounds like Tether is prepping for a big party, but remember: trustless systems thrive on transparency. Let’s hope they keep the community informed as $USDT grows. Too much minting without clarity can lead to uncertainties, just like bad coffee!” Satoshi AI wrote on X. Tether Asked to Substantiate Reserves, Again Tether must provide full transparency, with which market confidence may be maintained. As part of being transparent, the stablecoin issuer must substantiate its reserve. This request has come up in the past , but Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino addressed it, saying that the company is well-focused on strong backing. He believes stablecoin reserves should primarily be in highly secure assets like the United States Treasury bills. This is aimed at mitigating risks from uninsured cash deposits. While Tether helps to allay crypto enthusiasts’ concerns and fears, it is worth noting that the stablecoin issuer still stands tall as the primary source of liquidity in both centralized and decentralized markets.

Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, citing unnamed sources, says the SEC has notified at least two of the five SOL ETF applicants that their filings will be rejected. Terrett also says the current SEC administration has no plans to green-light any of the other applications. The financial firms VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital and Bitwise have all filed to offer SOL ETFs, and crypto asset manager Grayscale also recently applied to convert its Solana Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, predicts the firms will reapply with the new SEC regime next year. “This was [Gensler’s] parting gift I guess.” After Donald Trump’s election victory last month, Gensler announced he would step down in January, on the president-elect’s inauguration day. The SEC chair’s term was set to run until 2026. Under Gensler’s leadership, the securities watchdog launched high-profile enforcement actions against many crypto firms, including industry giants Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Uniswap Labs and Consensys. Trump picked former SEC Commissioner and current Patomak Partners chief executive Paul Atkins to head the regulatory agency. In 2022, while at Patomak, Atkins penned a letter noting that as Americans are becoming more familiar with crypto assets, they may become interested in purchasing them for their retirement plans.

The Trump administration has repeatedly emphasized its dedication to making everyday Americans more prosperous. From pledging to restore economic strength on the campaign trail to appointing forward-thinking advisors, the White House seems poised to usher in a new era of financial freedom. But if President Trump truly wants to supercharge wealth creation for average citizens—and establish the U.S. as the world’s leading “ Bitcoin Superpower ”—his administration must embrace a bold, transformative policy: eliminate capital gains taxes on Bitcoin. This global map shows how various countries tax (or don’t tax) Bitcoin after one year. Many green jurisdictions, including those in parts of Europe, the Caribbean, and Asia, have chosen to exempt long-term Bitcoin holdings from capital gains tax. The Winds of Change: Lessons from Abroad The Czech Republic recently made headlines when its Parliament overwhelmingly voted to exempt capital gains from Bitcoin and other crypto-asset sales from personal income tax—provided they’re held for more than three years and meet certain income thresholds. This is not an isolated event. Countries like Switzerland, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, El Salvador, Hong Kong, and parts of the Caribbean have long recognized that zero or minimal capital gains taxation on Bitcoin can help spur adoption, financial innovation, and consumer confidence. As John F. Kennedy famously said, “ A rising tide lifts all boats. ” If we apply that logic to economic growth through Bitcoin, the tide is global—and it’s rising fast. In a sea awash with global liquidity and debt, America’s economic ship must navigate these digital currents. These nations’ policy choices—and their citizens’ increasing prosperity—send a powerful signal: The U.S. can and should leverage Bitcoin as a tool for growth, not burden it with outdated taxation models. Trump’s Own Words: A Path to Prosperity President Trump himself has indicated a willingness to rethink Bitcoin taxation. “ They have them paying tax on crypto, and I don’t think that’s right, ” he said in a recent interview, echoing the frustrations of millions of Americans who find it absurd to pay capital gains taxes after using Bitcoin to purchase something as small as a cup of coffee. “ Bitcoin is money, and you have to pay capital gains tax if you use it to buy a coffee? ” he asked rhetorically, highlighting how current laws discourage everyday transactions. He added, “ Maybe we get rid of taxes on crypto and replace it with tariffs. ” This sentiment isn’t just rhetorical flourish. Trump, who spoke at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville , proclaimed his vision for America to become the world’s “ Bitcoin Superpower. ” He’s also pledged to “ Make Bitcoin in America, ” turning the U.S. into a leading hub of Bitcoin innovation. Moreover, he appointed former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his 'White House A.I. & Crypto Czar' on December 5—a move widely seen as a step toward implementing forward-looking crypto policies. The BITCOIN Act of 2024: A Strategic Reserve for the People The U.S. has already taken monumental steps in this direction. The BITCOIN Act of 2024 mandates that all Bitcoin held by any federal agency be transferred to the Treasury to be held in a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Over five years, the Treasury must purchase one million Bitcoins, holding them in trust for the United States. This government-level accumulation shows a long-term vision for incorporating Bitcoin into national financial strategy. But why stop there? Eliminating capital gains tax on Bitcoin would create a positive feedback loop between national policy and personal prosperity. As the federal government invests and holds Bitcoin, private citizens could do the same without facing punitive tax obligations. Serving the Everyday American For everyday Americans, the cost of living and the sting of inflation were focal points of President Trump’s reelection campaign. Traditional strategies—interest rate manipulations, quantitative easing—often amount to rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship when confronted with truly systemic economic challenges. Bitcoin offers a life raft—dare we say, a digital Noah’s Ark—for Americans trying to preserve and grow their wealth against the erosive forces of inflation. Removing capital gains taxes on Bitcoin would allow citizens to transact, invest, and save in a stable, finite asset without the drain of federal taxes on every incremental gain. The ripple effect here is clear: More people adopting Bitcoin as a store of value and medium of exchange means stronger demand, which could further buttress the U.S. Treasury’s strategic holdings. It’s a virtuous cycle, a positive feedback loop. As Bitcoin’s value grows, so does the nation’s wealth base—helping pay down national debt, bolstering the dollar’s hegemony in global trade, and genuinely making Americans richer and more secure. Why America Needs Bitcoin Bitcoin is no longer a niche experiment reserved for a small band of enthusiasts. It has evolved into a mainstream, urgent priority for everyday Americans—especially the rising generation that will shape our nation’s future economy. This is not some ideological plea; it’s a practical, data-backed reality. According to the Stand With Crypto Alliance , a non-profit dedicated to transparent blockchain policies, more than 52 million Americans now own some form of cryptocurrency. Nearly nine in ten Americans believe the financial system needs updating, and 45% say they would not support candidates who stand in the way of crypto innovation. These numbers represent a sweeping, cross-partisan groundswell: Stand With Crypto’s research shows that 18% of Republicans, 22% of Democrats, and 22% of Independents hold crypto. This cuts through the usual tribal politics and points to a fundamental truth—Bitcoin is now a national policy talking point, not a side note on a fringe agenda. The demand for America to lead is clear. 53% of Americans want crypto companies to be U.S.-based, ensuring that technological innovation and the wealth it generates remain on home soil. Among Fortune 500 executives, 73% prefer U.S.-based partners for their crypto and Web3 initiatives, signaling a corporate desire to keep America at the forefront of global financial progress. Failing to act now risks a replay of past mistakes. America once led the world in advanced manufacturing, yet today 92% of the most sophisticated semiconductor production sits in Taiwan and South Korea. We cannot afford to cede the future financial landscape to other regions. Bitcoin isn’t just another investment class; it is the digital backbone of a rapidly evolving monetary system. If the U.S. wants to preserve its economic hegemony, maintain innovation leadership, and ensure everyday Americans have access to a stable, growth-oriented financial future, it must embrace Bitcoin wholeheartedly. In doing so, the nation can secure its place as the global Bitcoin superpower—uplifting our citizens, strengthening our economic base, and safeguarding our strategic interests in the 21st-century digital economy. America, Charting the Course By aligning with global best practices and enacting forward-thinking policies, the U.S. can position itself as a beacon of financial liberty and technical innovation. Eliminating capital gains tax on Bitcoin would signal to investors, entrepreneurs, and everyday citizens that America is serious about leading in the 21st century’s digital economy. It’s not just about being “Bitcoin-friendly”; it’s about ensuring that average Americans have the tools they need to navigate turbulent economic waters. The complexity and inefficiency of taxing every digital transaction is an unnecessary burden on innovation and everyday life. Americans deserve better—they deserve the freedom to transact in a digital world without punitive oversight. In essence, this is America’s chance to do what it has always done best: innovate, adapt, and lead. Removing capital gains taxes on Bitcoin wouldn’t just fulfill a campaign promise; it would set the stage for long-term prosperity, empower citizens to secure their financial futures, and cement the United States as the world’s foremost Bitcoin champion. A rising tide, indeed, lifts all boats—and what better vessel to embark upon than a Bitcoin Ark, captained by a visionary administration determined to truly Make America Great Again?

Coinbase will add support for Moo Deng, Algorand, The Sandbox, and Mog Coin perpetual futures on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced. “The opening of our MOODENG-PERP, ALGO-PERP, SAND-PERP, and 1000MOG-PERP markets will begin on or after 9:30 am UTC 12 DEC 2024,” it noted in an X post. MOG Coin, a meme token launched on Ethereum’s layer-1 blockchain, gained significant attention after Coinbase announced on Dec. 3, 2024, that it would be added to their listing roadmap. Following this news, the token’s value surged by over 20%, bringing its market cap close to $1 billion. MOG is now ranked among the top 150 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Coinbase’s move to add MOG to its listing roadmap follows similar actions for other meme tokens like Moo Deng (MOODENG), which saw a dramatic 80% surge when it was listed. Algorand claims itself as an energy-efficient, quantum-secure, single-layer blockchain with instant finality, consistently high throughput and cheap fees. Since December 1st, the Algorand (ALGO) network has seen its number of active addresses soar by 300 %, jumping from 123,000 to over 427,000. This exponential increase, fueled by heightened adoption and growing blockchain use, has propelled the ALGO price to a peak of $0.6133.

Then, the small Central American nation gave the cryptocurrency legal tender status and established a treasury that now holds almost six thousand BTC. When the world’s largest digital asset by market capitalization hit the highly anticipated milestone , it pushed the value of El Salvador’s BTC portfolio beyond $600 million, a staggering 123.67% return on its $269.7 million investment. Bitcoin’s Historic Breakthrough On December 5, President Bukele took to X to showcase the national crypto holdings, revealing an unrealized profit of $333.6 million. https://t.co/QVvFbQ7woa pic.twitter.com/WiOAYg6Ztx — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 5, 2024 The post sparked a wave of reactions online, with users praising Bukele’s foresight in adopting Bitcoin. Billionaire Elon Musk, who has been chosen by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to co-head the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), called the achievement “impressive,” while others hailed the move as “legendary” with potential long-term benefits for El Salvador. However, since attaining an all-time high (ATH) price of $103,679, Bitcoin has retreated to around the $98,000 level, reducing the value of El Salvador’s stash to a still remarkable $556.4 million. The country has been buying one BTC each day since 2022. In that time, it has amassed a total of 5,942 BTC, with President Bukele promising to keep adding on to the number until Bitcoin becomes “unaffordable with fiat currencies.” Despite the achievement, not all Salvadorians are reaping the rewards. A recent Associated Press report revealed that many cashed out a $30 BTC bonus offered by the government when digital wallets were introduced, opting for immediate cash over potential long-term gains. Further, critics such as El Salvador’s former Central Bank head Carlos Acevedo noted that while the profits were impressive, they remain unrealized until the Bitcoin is sold. President Bukele has blamed his political opponents for dissuading citizens from embracing crypto, claiming it deprived many of them of significant financial gains. On Facebook, he wrote: “Not only was the opposition terribly wrong with Bitcoin, but, unlike other issues (where they were also wrong), this time their opposition did affect many.” BTC Continues to Ride the “Trump Pump” While Bitcoin is 5% off its ATH, its recent meteoric rise has come against a backdrop of global events, including Donald Trump’s election victory in November. The pro-crypto president has pledged policies aimed at retaining and expanding the U.S. government’s BTC holdings, fueling optimism in the virtual currency market. The nudge past $100,000 was seemingly provided by Trump’s selection of crypto advocate Paul Atkins as the next Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair to replace the much-maligned Gary Gensler.
