Deal Gives Justin Sun’s Father Control of Public Firm Via $100M Token Deal,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/17/tron-inc-deal-gives-justin-suns-father-control-of-public-firm-via-100m-token-deal,"A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing posted Monday night outlines the relationship between Tron DAO, Justin Sun, and SRM Entertainment, a Nevada company in the process of changing its name to Tron Inc. The filing details a $100 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, paid entirely in TRX TRX tokens, that gives Sun’s father, Weike Sun, board control and positions Tron-aligned advisors in key governance roles. Weike was named chairman, while Zhihong Liu, also known as Steve Liu, a strategic adviser to Tron DAO and the CEO of stablecoin issuer Techteryx, and Zi Yang, a senior executive at Tronscan, joined the board’s audit, compensation, and nominating committees, according to the filing. The deal was structured as a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal. An investment vehicle owned by Weike purchased 100,000 shares of SRM Series B preferred Stock via TRX tokens, convertible into 200 million common shares, and received 220 million warrants at a strike price of $0.50. Despite the appearance of alignment, Tron DAO has no direct investment, governance rights, or formal role in the SRM deal, said Liu. ""Tron DAO is not really any part of the deal for SRM. It’s more of the senior Sun's transaction."" The DAO itself is not mentioned in the 8K filing either. Its influence appears to be indirect, reflected through the backgrounds of newly appointed board members tied to the Tron ecosystem. According to the Financial Times , the renamed firm plans to buy and hold up to $210 million worth of TRX, similar to how MicroStrategy built a bitcoin-based corporate treasury. The deal was arranged by Dominari Securities, a brokerage affiliated with Dominari Holdings, whose advisory board includes Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and is located within Trump Tower in Manhattan. Dominari Securities was paid $50,000 for the counsel for the transaction, according to the 8K filing. SRM, the listed Tron entity, is down 15%, trading at $7.73 as the market closed in New York. The TRX token is down 2.5%, trading at $0.27.",Markets|Justin Sun|Tron|TRX|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-17 22:28:33

This allows the nation’s highest court the opportunity to determine whether the president has the authority to implement some of his most severe trade policies in history. The two companies responsible are Learning Resources Inc. and hand2mind Inc. They have asked the Supreme Court to look over their case quickly. This court has recently let cases with equal (or less) far-reaching political and economic importance be reviewed quickly. “Whether the President has authority to impose tariffs…is of such imperative importance that it warrants review now,” the toy companies said in their Tuesday filing to the Supreme Court. The toy companies argue their case based on JPMorgan’s analysis The toy companies had already won a victory before US District Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington, but the decision was narrow in scope. However, Trump filed an appeal, and now the businesses want to skip that fight and go straight to the United States Supreme Court. Their argument in their petition to the court is based on an analysis by JPMorgan that shows that the round of Trump tariffs at issue would hike taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year. This is the largest tax increase in recent memory by a long shot and caused prices to surge by adding 2% to the Consumer Price Index. Due to the high tariffs, the nation’s overall average effective tariff rate has gone from 2.5% to around 27% since the start of the year. This is more than a tenfold rise and the highest for the US in over a century. Before its summer break starts at the end of this month, the companies want the Supreme Court to decide if it will take this case. This would allow for possible arguments in the fall. Another case of tariff in the waiting All of the challengers to Trump’s tariffs are arguing that the administration’s claims for the tariffs, including a national emergency caused by illegal immigration and flows of illegal drugs from overseas, were unauthorized because they did not directly address the stated emergency. A three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade (CIT) sided with a group of small companies in May when they said Trump didn’t have the power to carry out his “Liberation Day” duties under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA). The Trump administration appealed that decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. The court allowed Trump to keep the tariffs in place while it figures out if the president has the legal power to do so. The oral arguments are set to begin on July 31. Trump’s administration is ready to defend itself Legal experts have known for a long time that the Supreme Court would finally rule on whether Trump’s reasons for raising tariffs are legal. This could mean the “major questions doctrine” will be a problem for the Trump administration. This doctrine says that federal agencies can’t act on “vast economic and political significance” issues unless Congress explicitly permits them to do so. However, Trump’s lawyers are set to use Nixon as an example to show that his global tariffs will finally be upheld in court. As part of a set of economic measures called the “Nixon shock” about fifty years ago, the 37th president placed 10% duties on goods without consulting anyone else. These duties were challenged in court in a way that is similar to how Trump’s 2025 tariffs have been challenged.

Integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI has emerged as a top contender for exponential growth, with a 12,900% ROI forecast making it a standout. Experts are calling it a must-buy for those aiming to make strategic investment moves. Here’s why Ruvi AI is dominating conversations and why its trajectory has investors rushing to secure their stake. Why Analysts Are Bullish on Ruvi AI Unlike speculative tokens that rise and fall on hype alone, Ruvi AI grounds its value in real-world utility and structured growth . Tackling critical challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance , Ruvi AI uses AI-powered solutions to provide scalable, in-demand technologies. The project’s presale model offers an even more attractive proposition. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2 , the token’s post-presale price is set to climb to $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x return for early investors. Analysts forecast far higher returns post-listing, with a potential valuation of $1 per token equating to an incredible 12,900% gain for early adopters. This structured roadmap gives Ruvi AI a huge edge over projects relying on unpredictable market conditions. Presale Success Underlines Ruvi AI’s Momentum With over $1.8 million raised thus far, Ruvi AI’s presale has been a testament to the trust and confidence investors have in the project. Over 1,600 holders are already on board, solidifying Ruvi AI as one of the fastest-growing cryptos before its public debut. The presale’s price-fixed model ensures a predictable and secure investment opportunity. Early buyers lock in the lower Phase 2 price and benefit from the guaranteed increase to $0.07 per token after the presale ends. This stability, combined with significant flexibility via scalable investments, makes Ruvi AI an ideal choice for smart investors. VIP Investment Tiers Maximize Growth Potential Ruvi AI sweetens the deal with VIP investment tiers , offering significant bonuses for those who want to maximize their returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers are tailored to reward larger investments with higher bonuses, allowing participants to unlock exponential returns during Ruvi AI’s early growth phases. Transparency and Security Drive Investor Trust Ruvi AI isn’t just about potential gains; it’s also about building trust and security for its community. The project is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a leading blockchain security firm, ensuring the infrastructure is entirely reliable and secure. This audit reassures investors that their funds are protected and the project adheres to high operational standards. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , a globally recognized trading platform, to provide post-presale liquidity . This collaboration ensures that Ruvi AI tokens will have seamless accessibility and trading options once the presale concludes, giving investors confidence in their ability to trade effectively. Real-World Applications Ensure Sustainable Demand Beyond its presale success, Ruvi AI distinguishes itself with broad adoption potential across three major industries. Marketing Ruvi AI empowers businesses with AI-driven tools that enhance ad targeting, engagement, and ROI. These capabilities are essential for modern organizations seeking to optimize their campaigns. Entertainment With blockchain-secured payments and AI-enhanced content recommendations, Ruvi AI improves how creators monetize while providing personalized user experiences. Finance Ruvi AI strengthens financial operations by offering fraud detection tools and operational transparency, helping the finance sector evolve with innovative solutions. These utility-driven applications ensure Ruvi AI’s token demand will remain strong, supported by sustainable market relevance rather than fleeting hype. Why Ruvi AI Is the Opportunity of 2025 While the crypto market is crowded, few projects offer the combination of structured growth , real-world utility , and transparency that Ruvi AI delivers. With its 12,900% ROI forecast and affordable starting price of $0.015 , Ruvi AI creates a compelling narrative for investors chasing exponential rewards. Backed by over $1.8 million raised , 1,600+ holders , a CyberScope audit , and a WEEX Exchange partnership , Ruvi AI is uniquely positioned to rise as a leader in blockchain and AI innovation.

According to analysts, the popular altcoin saw a dramatic 700% surge earlier last year. Now, its price is positioned to exit a seven-month consolidation phase, which could set it up for its next bullish move. XRP Gets Ready For Major Bullish Move A recently published technical chart by market expert ‘Crypto Michael’ on X (formerly Twitter) reveals that XRP has been consolidating for seven months following a staggering 700% price rally, which was triggered by a breakout from a multi-year Symmetrical Triangle pattern. The chart, based on a 3-month candlestick, shows that XRP had been in a major price compression within the triangle pattern for seven years. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance True to form, XRP finally broke above the upper trendline of the pennant in late 2024, igniting one of its most powerful quarterly rallies to date. This breakout led to a price surge of about 700%, pushing the cryptocurrency from around $0.6 to over $2. Since the dramatic breakout, XRP has entered a stabilization phase, trading sideways in what appears to be a healthy consolidation range. The chart highlights this consolidation area with a white circle, indicating a well-defined post-breakout phase. Notably, XRP’s $2.15 price at the time of the analysis is above prior resistance levels, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is maintaining strength while waiting for its next bullish catalyst. Crypto Michael points out that XRP’s consolidation is ending just as Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, approaches a critical juncture: the “8-year line.” This correlation suggests that a broader shift in market sentiment may be underway. Historically, leading altcoins like XRP have followed Bitcoin’s lead during broader market rallies. If BTC successfully breaks through this long-standing line, Crypto Michael believes it could serve as a macro trigger that ignites a fresh bullish move for XRP. Analyst Says The Altcoin Is Set To Explode Against BTC A fresh analysis by Egrag Crypto, a crypto analyst on X, suggests that the XRP/BTC pair could be on the edge of a major breakout. The pair has followed a consistent cycle for over a decade, with lows in 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2024—each succeeded by strong rallies. These lows align with a rising trendline, signaling possible long-term strength. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Structure Remains Bullish: Analyst Releases 3 New Targets Now, XRP/BTC is approaching a key resistance level that has blocked past rallies since 2015. This time, however, Egrag Crypto suggests that the setup looks different and slightly more favorable for a breakout. If the pair breaks above this multi-year ceiling, it could mark a major turning point, effectively leading XRP into an explosive bullish phase. The analyst’s chart outlines two potential paths: a green breakout zone if XRP pushes higher and a red rejection zone if it fails to break this key resistance again.

Unlike previous speculative comments, Claver has now associated this projection with a specific timeframe, approximately two years. In a recently shared video on X , Claver outlined his argument for why a higher XRP price is essential for the network to efficiently support large-scale institutional transactions. His perspective builds on earlier technical insights from Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, who once explained that the number of XRP tokens needed for a transaction is inversely proportional to the asset’s price. For example, transferring $1 million at a token value of $1 would require 1 million XRP. If the token were priced at $10, only 100,000 units would be needed for the same transaction. According to Claver, this relationship illustrates how increasing the token’s price could enhance the XRP Ledger’s transactional efficiency. Does XRP need to be a certain price to move large amounts of money? pic.twitter.com/tbqBbvST4y — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) May 27, 2025 Increased Valuation as a Path to Liquidity Efficiency Claver further elaborated that at current prices, roughly $2 per token, XRP lacks the liquidity required to process transactions involving trillions of dollars. Based on his analysis, a valuation of $10,000 per token would provide the liquidity needed to handle institutional-scale transfers, implying a theoretical market cap of more than $500 trillion. Despite the astronomical figure, Claver maintains that such a valuation is technically necessary for XRP to fulfill its role in large-scale cross-border financial operations. He emphasized that the XRP Ledger’s design allows it to scale its liquidity capabilities in tandem with price increases, making the token more effective at higher valuations. Skepticism and Market Criticism Unsurprisingly, the claim has been met with significant criticism from various financial commentators. One major point of contention is the implication that XRP could achieve a total market capitalization vastly exceeding the size of the current global economy. Critics argue that this renders the prediction implausible, regardless of the underlying logic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Among the skeptics is Alex Caraco, former CEO of an Australian stock market firm, who questioned the practicality of such predictions. He expressed concern that retail investors may be misled by exaggerated price targets, especially those tied to short timelines. Others in the cryptocurrency space have echoed this sentiment, pointing out that even with the development of futures markets and institutional adoption, a $10,000 valuation within two years would require extraordinary demand and systemic changes in global finance. While Claver’s projection remains speculative, it reflects a broader discussion within the XRP community about the token’s long-term potential and the infrastructure required to support institutional-scale transactions.

However, Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, has failed both as a safe haven anda FOMO asset. As is often the case, its underwhelming performance has spilled over to other crypto majors. Even so, its upside potential is significant. As the markets eye the ongoing conflicts, a recovery is still likely. Bitcoin price fails as a safe haven amid the geopolitical tensions The initial attack by Israeli forces on Iranian nuclear sites late last week yielded the expected moves; Brent crude oil price surged by about 7%, gold price rallied by 1.5%, and stocks dropped worldwide. Interestingly, Bitcoin, which is usually referred to as digital gold, failed to live up to its position as a safe haven. In fact, the leading cryptocurrency dropped to a one-week low on Friday; extending losses recorded in the previous two sessions. Like gold, Bitcoin’s tight supply boosts its status as a store of value. However, the rebound of the US dollar in the wake of the Israel-Iran conflict has capped its upward momentum. Even so, it bears high upside potential amid the persistent uncertainties. At a crypto fear & greed index of 50, the traders appear indecisive. However, a bullish undertone is observable. Data released by SoSoValue showed that US BTC spot ETFs had daily total net inflows of $412.20 million as of 16th June. With no outflows, the top 6 ETFs recorded inflows with BlackRock’s IBIT leading with inflows of $266.60 million. Besides, as highlighted by CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s trading volume rose by 25.87% over the past 24 hours. A surge in trading volume usually points to increased investor interest. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView In the short term, Bitcoin price is likely to trade within the range of between $106,309 and $101,370 as the markets continue to weigh in on the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict. Notably, the bullish golden-cross pattern that has been in place for close to two months now confirms a continuation of the uptrend. With the attraction of more buyers, the bulls will be looking to retest Monday’s high of $108,900. Bearish pattern shapes Ripple price path as XRP lawsuit drags on As the Ripple Labs – SEC lawsuit drags on and the broader crypto market remains in a neutral mode, Ripple price is still under pressure. A look at its daily chart shows the altcoin still trading below the descending trendline. At the time of press, the crypto major was trading below the 25 and 50-day EMAs that appear to be converging around $2.24. Amid the traders’ indecisiveness, the range between $2.10 and $2.27 is worth watching. Even with the possible recovery, it will likely face resistance at May’s level of $2.39.

With the indecisiveness in the broader crypto market, $156 remains a pivot worth watching. This makes the range between $140 and $167 worth watching.

Qubetics (TICS) has captured serious attention in this emerging class, especially in its final presale stage. With its aim to solve cross-border friction for professionals, businesses, and Web3 platforms, Qubetics is quickly gaining traction as one of the best 100x crypto assets of the year. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) and Aptos (APT) also show strength, posting healthy daily gains amid renewed momentum in the altcoin market. Though distinct in scope, these three projects form a compelling trio for investors seeking utility, scalability, and near-term upside. Qubetics Final Presale: Redefining Cross-Border Transactions with Real-World Utility Qubetics has officially entered its final public crypto presale phase, offering a fixed $0.3370 price for its remaining 10 million $TICS tokens. The platform has already raised over $18 million, selling more than 516 million tokens to 28,000+ holders. With a sharp supply cut—from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion—the tokenomics now favor scarcity-driven growth, positioning $TICS as a best 100x crypto prospect. At its core, Qubetics tackles one of blockchain’s most pressing challenges: costly, slow, and fragmented cross-border transfers. Its solution? A high-speed, low-fee infrastructure capable of handling near-instant settlements across borders. Whether you’re a DeFi trader or a business accepting international payments, the platform offers a smoother experience than legacy remittance platforms. A major differentiator is its proprietary QubeQode smart contract suite, designed for compliance-heavy use cases in global finance. These features make Qubetics a true contender for real-world enterprise and institutional adoption, especially for those entering Web3 with concrete objectives. Combined with its community-first distribution model (38.55% of tokens allocated to the public), Qubetics’ structure favors transparency, governance, and long-term user value. It could be the best 100x crypto you’ll encounter in a presale this year. Stellar (XLM) Sees a Modest Rally Amid Layer-1 Ecosystem Growth Stellar (XLM) is back in the green, currently trading at $0.2625 with a 24-hour volume of over $228 million—up 1.56%. Long known for its focus on low-cost payments and partnerships with global financial institutions, Stellar continues to gain traction, particularly in emerging markets. Stellar is proving resilient amid broader market fluctuations. Its new integrations with fintech platforms and digital ID systems are helping the network evolve into a real-time payments layer for global infrastructure. Stellar also benefits from its close alignment with CBDC development in various nations, which adds legitimacy to its long-term vision. Although price movement remains modest, it offers lower volatility and slow-but-steady adoption—a contrast to more speculative plays. Still, Stellar may lag behind platforms like Qubetics when looking for the best 100x crypto multiplier for users with higher risk tolerance and ambition. However, its stability and institutional utility make it a solid complementary asset. Aptos (APT) Gains Over 4% As Developers Embrace Move Language Aptos (APT) has surged 4.23%, trading today at $4.67, backed by growing developer interest in its Move programming language and sub-second transaction finality. This Layer-1 chain has been building a name by combining scalability with developer-friendly infrastructure. Recent ecosystem reports show Aptos expanding its DeFi footprint, with increasing dApp deployments and TVL (Total Value Locked) growth. Its low-latency execution model also opens the door to gaming, social dApps, and financial instruments that require high performance. Moreover, strategic partnerships with major infrastructure players like Google Cloud are solidifying Aptos’ Web2-to-Web3 gateway reputation. While still early in its journey, Aptos holds potential for exponential growth and could soon be considered among the best 100x crypto options, particularly for tech-forward investors. However, its current valuation may already price in some of that future potential. In comparison, Qubetics still offers raw asymmetric upside with presale access and lower entry points. Final Thoughts In today’s market, smart people prioritize real-world use cases and early entry opportunities. While Stellar provides tested reliability and Aptos delivers technical promise, Qubetics solves a high-value problem—cross-border remittances—while empowering developers and businesses through native tools. As the presale closes in, Qubetics offers a scarce combination: limited token supply, active user base, enterprise relevance, and built-in 20% listing upside. If you want to enter the next best 100x crypto before the market catches on, $TICS may be your front-runner. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics a strong candidate for the best 100x crypto in 2025? Qubetics combines low-cost global transfers, a proprietary dev suite, and a reduced total token supply to deliver utility and scarcity—ideal traits for exponential growth. When will Qubetics list on public exchanges? The $TICS token is expected to list shortly after the presale ends. Early buyers at $0.3370 are projected to see an initial 20% gain on listing at $0.40. Is Qubetics safe for beginners in crypto? Yes. It features a non-custodial wallet, intuitive dApp interactions, and a transparent governance system, making it one of the best 100x crypto options for new users. How do Stellar and Aptos compare to Qubetics? Stellar is established but slower-moving; Aptos is innovative but already well-valued. Qubetics, being in presale, offers the best raw upside and entry point. How much can I make if Qubetics hits $10 or $15? If you invest $1,000 at $0.3370, you’d receive ~2,967 TICS tokens. At $10, that’s $29,670. At $15, it’s over $44,500, highlighting why it’s seen as a best 100x crypto play.

Since the meme coin hit a local top in mid-May, a 30% drop has put this key level back in question, with $0.168 firmly in the spotlight as a potential tipping point. According to popular X analyst Ali Charts, this level aligns with the lower boundary of a crucial symmetrical triangle—a breakdown from which could trigger a 30% retracement. #Dogecoin $DOGE must hold above $0.168 to avoid a 30% price drop! pic.twitter.com/PDhqo7fpcK — Ali (@ali_charts) June 15, 2025 Below $0.168 lies a dangerous “gap area”—a price range with sparse previous buying activity, creating little historical support to limit downside. Dogecoin Price Analysis: A Breakdown Here Could Get Ugly Zooming out, the symmetrical triangle noted by Martinez contributes to a wider 4-year cup-and-handle pattern, with its lower support crossing the handle. DOGE / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. This creates a potential confluence zone between the make-or-break support and the upper resistance of the descending channel forming the handle—a potential breakout set up. A confirmed breakout would set a technical target around $0.75—a staggering 350% gain from current levels in line with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. However, this bullish case only holds if the $0.168 support does, and momentum indicators don’t inspire confidence. The golden cross from May has proven to be short-lived as the MACD line widens its gap below the signal line after a death cross to start June—a sign of a prevailing longer-term downtrend. The RSI also lends to weakening buy pressure, continuing its decline below the neutral line to its current position at 42. If DOGE posts a weekly candle close below $0.168, the next major Dogecoin price support zone sits around $0.90, last tested during mid-2024. From there, all eyes turn to the June 15 US spot Dogecoin ETF decision, which could offer the external catalyst DOGE needs, opening the doors to inflows from traditional investment markets if approved. Leading Meme Coins are Suffering – Here’s a Better Strategy When it comes to large meme coins like DOGE, timing is everything. Those who entered late from the mid-April market bottom and didn’t sell in mid-May face unrealised losses. Meanwhile, newer meme coins making the rounds like Aura are posting 46x gains in a single day. That’s where Snorter ($SNORT) steps in. Its purpose-built trading bot is engineered to spot early momentum, helping investors get in before the crowd—where the real gains are made. While trading bots are not a new concept, Snorter has been designed specifically for sniping with limit orders, MEV-resistant token swaps, copy trading, and even rug-pull protection. It’s one thing to get in first, it’s another thing to know when to sell—Snorter Bot can help. Snorter Bot vs. other trading bots. The project is off to a strong start— $SNORT has already raised over $1 million in its first three weeks of presale , likely driven by its high 287% APY on staking to rewards early investors.

Per a Telegram post from the official account of the Krasnoyarsk Krai Prosecutor’s Office , the “open-air” facility was located in the town of Nazarovo, some 240 km west of Krasnoyarsk, in Central Siberia. The office said it had obtained a court order allowing bailiffs to raid the facility. The farm reportedly mined coins worth around 4.6 million rubles ($58,672) per month for its operators. Crypto Mining Farm ‘Used Scores of Transformers and Generators’ Prosecutors explained that the operators had fenced off the facility with barbed wire. However, its location was nothing if not conspicuous. They wrote: “The farm was right out in the open air in the town’s industrial hub district.” U.S. President Donald Trump kicked off his time at the Group of Seven summit on Monday by suggesting that Russia and maybe even China should be part of the organization. https://t.co/CHLXxUr0Qn — PBS News (@NewsHour) June 16, 2025 Officially, the site was registered as a “non-residential building” under the name of a management company. However, when investigators conducted their raid, they found several transformers on the premises. They also discovered power generators, cooling equipment, and crypto mining rigs. The management firm, prosecutors said, leased the property to a crypto mining firm, along with a “non-existent building.” The miner had reportedly connected their rigs to the city’s power grid. Prosecutors said they received a tip-off from an energy provider. The latter reported that it had detected a high probability of emergency power outages at the facility. When they investigated, the prosecutors discovered that the company had not obtained permission to operate power-receiving units or use state-owned land. They also found that the miners were not complying with fire safety requirements, which constituted a public safety risk. An illegal crypto mining farm in Nazarovo, Russia. (Source: Krasnoyarsk Krai Prosecutor’s Office) Operator Ignored Prosecutors’ Warnings The office said it initially wrote to the firm to ask it to desist, adding that the operator “ignored” this request. The prosecution service responded by petitioning a district court, which responded by banning all activity at the facility “until the violations are rectified.” In February this year, a staffer at a Krasnoyarsk Krai energy provider was discovered taking bribes worth $7,380 from illegal crypto miners. The staffer agreed to turn a blind eye to the miners’ operations and their illegal connections to the grid. The same miners stole electricity worth about 9.4 million rubles ($119,592) from the Krasnoyarsk Krai energy system, investigators found. According to the Federal Tax Service’s registry of crypto miners, Krasnoyarsk Krai is one of Russia’s top three crypto mining regions, along with the Irkutsk region and the Republic of Tatarstan.

But in every cycle, there are exceptions, projects that move independently, refusing to follow the crowd. Right now, four altcoins are drawing attention for doing exactly that. While the broader market hesitates, Near Protocol (NEAR), Hyperliquid (HYPE), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are showing unusual resilience. However, amidst these altcoins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is turning heads with massive presale buzz, drawing meme coin believers chasing 35x to 100x gains. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Built To Perform When The Market Doesn’t The FloppyPepe (FPPE) altcoin is quickly gaining recognition as one of the most promising crypto plays for outsized gains. Early buyers have already taken advantage of the 80% bonus through the FLOPPY80 code, nearly doubling their holdings. The presale isn’t over yet; there’s still a brief window to get in at $0.00000035 before launch pricing jumps to $0.01. The boldest prediction? Analysts are floating a $1 target for FloppyPepe (FPPE) alongside the Bitcoin dominance, creating a staggering leap from its current level. FloppyPepe (FPPE) continues to rise alongside Near Protocol (NEAR), Fartcoin (FART), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) due to its ability to address gaps left by other altcoins. This gives it a unique edge in a crowded space. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Only Meme Coin Using AI And Scarcity For Real Gains Through its AI tools, Meme-o-Matic , FloppyX , and FloppyAI , FloppyPepe (FPPE) empowers users to instantly generate viral-ready memes, AI-driven video content, and real-time market insights, transforming it from a simple altcoin into an AI-powered platform that reinforces engagement and platform utility. In addition, Floppynomics gives FloppyPepe (FPPE) a unique counter-cycle strength as Bitcoin dominance surges. The altcoins are designed so that holders receive extra rewards from transactions, while the overall circulating supply gradually decreases. This built-in scarcity and reward structure favors early adopters, while the Solidproof audit guarantees security, making now a strategic time to accumulate before broader demand kicks in. Near Protocol (NEAR): Holding Steady While The Rest Look Shaky Near Protocol (NEAR) has recently stabilized between $2.22 and $2.30, recovering from a sharp 12.8% drop tied to broader war tensions. Despite the Bitcoin dominance peak, Near Protocol’s (NEAR) core metrics remain strong; 46 million monthly users place it as the second most-used Layer-1 protocol. As one crypto analyst recently put it, “ Grab Near Protocol (NEAR) while the price is still cheap. ” With this level of usage, Near Protocol (NEAR) remains one of the few altcoins showing strength where it matters. Hyperliquid (HYPE): A Rising Star With Price Action To Prove Hyperliquid (HYPE) recently surged to a new all-time high of $44.69, edging past its previous peak of $43.96. As Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is breaking away from the pack , showing rare counter-cycle strength. The Hyperliquid (HYPE) price rally points to rising transactional activity and deeper liquidity within the Hyperliquid (HYPE) ecosystem. Momentum indicators like MACD and RSI are also trending upward on the 4-hour chart, with some analysts now eyeing a potential push toward $100. Fartcoin (FART): Big Listing, Big Gains, Bigger Potential Fartcoin (FART) jumped nearly 40% in the past week and is now trading at $1.32 , following its Coinbase listing that went live on Thursday, a move known to attract fresh investor inflow. Amidst rising Bitcoin dominance, a Fartcoin (FART) is currently outperforming major meme coins , and with bullish technical signals and growing visibility, Fartcoin (FART) is quickly becoming a standout in the altcoin arena. Buy Now Or Regret Later: FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) 80% Bonus Is Almost Gone Near Protocol (NEAR), Hyperliquid (HYPE), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are showing rare counter-trend strength as Bitcoin dominance reaches its peak. Meanwhile, FloppyPepe (FPPE), the new AI altcoin, stands out not just for its ultra-low entry price but also for strong backing from influential crypto voices and, notably, the ongoing Presale promo. Right now, early early buyers still have a rare chance to scoop up FloppyPepe (FPPE) at just $0.00000035 and get an instant 80% bonus using the promo code FLOPPY80 . But don’t get too comfortable; this offer could vanish before the next stage even kicks in. Miss it, and be ready to chase green candles.

In a message to staff on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy praised generative AI as a game-changer but made clear that efficiency gains from these tools will likely shrink the company’s corporate head count over time. Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used in “virtually every corner of the company.” He noted that Amazon has more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications under way, and that this number represents only “a small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” This push follows Amazon’s pledge to invest roughly $100 billion in AI technologies during the current fiscal year. But for the company’s roughly 1.5 million employees, the message was a sobering one. Jassy warned that as AI changes how work gets done, the firm will need “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” He added, “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Amazon CEO urged employees to gain expertise on AI tools “Be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams.” Amazon has already cut staff in parts of its business it doesn’t consider essential. Earlier this year, the devices and services team lost about 100 jobs, and the books department saw a similar reduction. Overall, CNBC reports that the company has cut around 27,000 positions since 2022 and is preparing for more. Shares of Amazon have fallen about 2.5% so far this year. The Seattle-based company is pouring much of its planned $100 billion investment into AI infrastructure as it races rivals Google and Microsoft to lead the AI boom and to fuel growth at its lucrative cloud arm, Amazon Web Services. Last year, Jassy said he wanted to “eliminate bureaucracy” by creating a flatter organizational structure with fewer layers of middle management. In two major rounds of cuts in 2023, Amazon shed 27,000 roles, and this year Amazon Web Services trimmed hundreds more. Across the tech sector, leaders have generally chosen to highlight efficiency gains over the prospect of job losses from AI. In May, Microsoft reduced its global workforce by 3%. State filings in Washington indicate that many of those affected were software engineers. CEO Satya Nadella has publicly noted that perhaps “20-30% of the code that is inside of our repos today…are probably all written by software,” though the comFpany insists these cuts were not driven by AI. In April, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke told employees seeking more headcount or resources that they should explain why they “cannot get what they want done using AI.” Meanwhile, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn announced plans to replace contract workers with AI as part of the company’s new “AI-first” strategy .

The GENIUS Act passed the Senate in a final vote of 68 to 30. As a result, the GENIUS Act will now proceed to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to gain bipartisan support. Furthermore, the Donald Trump administration has laid significant emphasis on the importance of crypto assets and the digital currency market to the long term sustainability of the economy. “With the GENIUS Act, we’re bringing clarity to a sector that’s been clouded by uncertainty and proving that bipartisan, principled leadership can still deliver real results for the American people. This did not happen by accident,” Tim Scott noted . Stablecoins Market Ready to Bloom Via the GENIUS Act The monumental final vote for the GENIUS Act by the Senate is a major step toward clear stablecoins regulation in the United States. Once passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and stamped by Trump, the comprehensive stablecoin legislation will play a crucial role in the mainstream adoption of the digital dollar. According to Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, the GENIUS Act is a win-win situation for the private sector, the treasury, and consumers. Moreover, Bessent believes that the stablecoins market could reach $3.7 trillion by the end of this decade. “A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for US Treasuries, which back stablecoins. This newfound demand could lower government borrowing costs and help rein in the national debt,” Bessent noted . Already, JPMorgan has spearheaded the development of stablecoins by traditional financial institutions.

Two global internet monitors, Kentinc and NetBlocks, told NBC News that traffic plunged at about 5:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday. The abrupt cut left many Iranians struggling to send messages, browse news sites or post updates beyond Iran’s borders, the firms said. Iran’s communications minister said the slowdown was a deliberate government measure, not the result of damaged cables or power cuts. Spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said leaders limited access to counter what they described as Israeli cyberattacks against Iran’s digital infrastructure. Iran has shut down or slowed the internet during protests in the past. For example, in November 2019, it cut off all access for six days while security forces broke up protests across the country, a crackdown that left more than 100 people dead. After Israel’s strikes on Iran last week, the government had already slowed connections but stopped short of a full shutdown. Reports suggest that services like virtual private networks were hit hardest by the cutbacks. Many Iranians rely on VPNs to reach news outlets, social media and other foreign sites blocked inside the country. Major western apps blocked inside Iran Amir Rashidi, director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, told NBC News that certain Western apps stopped working. He said WhatsApp, Instagram, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store were among those blocked inside Iran. A WhatsApp spokesperson said its parent, Meta, has been locked in a “cat-and-mouse game” with Iran as officials target the company’s internet links. Meanwhile, Iran’s own National Information Network, a closed loop of government-approved sites, stayed online for most users. Data from Cloudflare, an internet services firm, showed on Tuesday that two of the country’s leading mobile carriers were effectively cut off from global networks, further isolating users who rely on phones for calls and data. Some people online urged Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite service to step in. Musk wrote on X last Friday, “The beams are on,” hinting that Starlink could help Iranians bypass the blackout. Iran’s authorities have banned Starlink terminals, and the state-run Saed News Agency warned that using them might guide Israeli strikes. Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit that supports internet access in closed societies, estimates that 30,000 to 40,000 Starlink dishes are already in Iran, based on network scans and conversations with local distributors. Iran alleges broad Israeli cyber offensive On Tuesday, Iran’s National Cybersecurity Command accused Israel of a wide cyberwarfare campaign to disrupt public services, but it did not say which systems were hit. Shargh Daily reported that the cyber police agency, known as FATA, said the government had imposed disruptions after the attacks and would restore normal service soon. A hacker group calling itself Predatory Sparrow claimed on X and Telegram to have launched a destructive cyberattack on Bank Sepah, a national bank under U.S. sanctions for ties to Iran’s military. As a result, some ATMs failed on Tuesday, a local source said. The group’s membership and any links to official agencies remain unknown.

Despite the uncertainty, ETH remains resilient above the $2,500 level, signaling ongoing strength among bulls. However, Ethereum now trades just below a critical resistance level at $2,675 — a zone that has acted as a barrier several times over the past few weeks. A breakout above this mark could trigger renewed upside momentum and set the stage for a rally toward $3,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Market participants remain divided on Ethereum’s short-term direction, but the technical landscape offers a potentially bullish clue. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum is on the verge of completing a golden cross — a chart pattern where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. Historically, this signal has preceded strong upward trends in ETH, with the last golden cross resulting in a 35% surge over the following weeks. As Ethereum hovers in a tight range, traders are closely watching this setup. If bulls manage to reclaim $2,675 and the golden cross confirms, Ethereum could enter a powerful breakout phase, potentially sparking broader optimism across the altcoin market. Ethereum Prepares For A Breakout As Bulls Hold Support Ethereum is facing a decisive moment as it continues to trade within a range that has persisted for more than six weeks. The current price structure reflects growing indecision among market participants, largely driven by geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. This macro backdrop has injected volatility across financial markets, and Ethereum has not been immune. While price action remains contained, ETH bulls are showing resilience by defending the $2,500 level — a crucial zone that has repeatedly served as support during the past month. However, to regain momentum, Ethereum must break above the $2,750–$2,800 resistance area, which has proven to be a major barrier since early May. This range remains the threshold separating consolidation from a full bullish breakout. A reclaim of this level would likely trigger a wave of buying, as it would mark the end of the current sideways phase and possibly initiate a fresh trend toward the $3,000 mark. Adding to the bullish thesis, Ted Pillows highlights that a golden cross is approaching on Ethereum’s moving averages. This occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average — a technical signal often associated with trend reversals and sustained upward moves. The last time this setup formed, Ethereum surged over 35% in just a few weeks. With ETH hovering just beneath key resistance and macro conditions remaining uncertain, the coming days may determine whether the golden cross will serve as a launchpad for a major rally. If bulls hold $2,500 and reclaim $2,800, Ethereum could be preparing for a significant breakout, potentially igniting momentum across the altcoin sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Ethereum Holds Support But Struggles With Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is showing resilience as it continues to trade above the $2,500 mark, but price action on the 4-hour chart reveals persistent difficulty in breaking through the $2,675–$2,700 resistance zone. This area, highlighted on the chart, has acted as a rejection zone multiple times since early June, capping bullish attempts to break out of the current range. Price recently tapped this resistance area again but failed to sustain momentum, resulting in a pullback toward the 200 EMA and 200 SMA, currently acting as near-term support around $2,575. ETH now hovers slightly above that level, and bulls must defend this zone to avoid slipping into lower support near $2,500. The pattern shows continued consolidation between a clearly defined support and resistance band, with the 50 and 100 moving averages flattening — a sign of market indecision. Volume has also declined slightly, reinforcing the idea that the market is waiting for a catalyst. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation – Details If ETH can reclaim $2,675 with conviction and follow through above $2,700, a rally toward the $2,850–$3,000 zone could develop. Until then, this tight range may continue. Holding the current support is crucial to avoid testing lower levels near $2,400, which could shift sentiment bearish.

If this scenario plays out, holders of 5,000 or 10,000 XRP could realize notable returns. Market Overview and Current Price Action XRP has experienced a moderate price increase of just over 3% since the beginning of the week. Despite this upward movement, the asset continues to trade below the $2.20 price level, a threshold it has hovered near for several months without a clear breakout. The broader cryptocurrency market remains largely range-bound, influenced in part by geopolitical events, including heightened instability in the Middle East. This prolonged consolidation phase has limited XRP’s momentum, although some market observers remain optimistic about a potential rally. Historical comparisons to XRP’s significant performance in 2017 continue to fuel expectations of a similar pattern repeating. Forecasts Supporting a $1 Trillion Market Cap Several market analysts have recently expressed optimism about XRP’s long-term potential. Analyst EGRAG has pointed to technical indicators that, in their view, suggest a market structure capable of supporting a major valuation increase. Specifically, EGRAG referenced a chart pattern that they believe could eventually lead XRP to a market capitalization near $1 trillion. Other perspectives have emphasized the importance of utility and adoption. For example, Omni’s founder, Austin King, argued that XRP would need to significantly improve its presence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and strengthen interoperability to reach such a valuation. Similarly, a prior analysis from xAI’s Grok explored the level of capital inflow required for XRP to attain a $1 trillion market cap. In addition, XRP advocate Edoardo Farina has encouraged investors to accumulate between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP, emphasizing the rarity of such holdings. He noted that fewer than 4% of XRP wallets contain over 10,000 tokens, and described such a holding as increasingly difficult to achieve. Farina also asserted that many future success stories in the space may begin with bold moves to secure large XRP positions early.

Using the current circulating supply of approximately 58.88 billion tokens, XRP’s price would need to rise to about $16.90 per coin to reach this valuation. Based on this projected price: An investor holding 5,000 XRP would see their portfolio valued at $84,500 An investor holding 10,000 XRP would have holdings worth $169,000 At the current market price of approximately $2.20, acquiring 5,000 XRP would require an investment of $10,950, while purchasing 10,000 XRP would cost about $21,900. This represents a potential gain of more than 670% if XRP reaches $16.90. While the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, the possibility of a $1 trillion valuation has become a frequent subject of analysis. Achieving such a milestone would require substantial progress in adoption, use cases, and investor confidence. However, if the necessary conditions align, long-term holders of XRP could see significant returns on their investment.

Bank of America sees gold going up to $4,000 an ounce over the next 12 months, a gain of more than 17% from the current level, reports Reuters. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs expects the precious metal to surge to $3,700 by the end of this year, lifted by strong demand from central banks. The firm also sees gold soaring to $4,000 by June 2026. Gold is trading at $3,395 at time of writing, up about 30% year-to-date. The precious metal is slightly down from the all-time high of $3,500 reached in April. Daniel Pavilonis, a senior market strategist at the brokerage firm RJO Futures, tells Reuters that escalating fears of a broader Middle East conflict are pushing gold prices higher. “Israel knocking out Iranian targets is causing a little bit of geopolitical scare in the market. Prices will stay elevated in the anticipation of what is to come, the retaliation by Iran.” On Friday, Israel fired airstrikes at Iran, killing a number of the Islamic Republic’s senior military personnel and destroying strategic military targets. The value of gold surged following the breakout of the conflict before giving up most of its gains on Monday.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, ETH is trading above $2500 as the U.S. Senate passes the GENIUS Act with bipartisan support. While the Senate was busy passing the GENIUS Act, Vivek Raman, founder of Ethereum advocacy firm Etherealize, was even busier, making the rounds on Wall Street to explain why ETH is suddenly at the center of institutional finance. Of course, Ethereum is nothing new. It's almost a decade old. But finally, in its almost 10 years of existence, Wall Street is starting to pay attention, and they really want to talk about it. “It’s an amazing job… running around from bank to bank, buy side to buy side, telling them what Ethereum tokenization means, how L2s work, and why it all flows through ether,” he told CoinDesk during an interview in between meetings from the lobby of Wall Street's Brookfield Place. As founder of Etherealize, Raman leads the firm’s efforts to educate Wall Street on ETH as neutral collateral and to help institutions tokenize assets and build on Ethereum. Raman says that Ethereum’s core value proposition, its role as the settlement and collateral layer behind stablecoins and tokenized assets, is finally resonating with institutional investors. “Every action is powered by ether,” he said. “Eventually, it’s going to be viewed as just as pristine as bitcoin. It'll be the neutral asset for the whole ecosystem.” The turning point, Raman says, was regulatory clarity. “Ethereum’s potential hasn’t been allowed until now,” he said, pointing to the GENIUS Act and broader U.S. policy momentum. “For years we didn’t know if it was a security or a commodity."" That’s why, despite the headlines around the ETH ETF, Raman says the real unlock for Ethereum came from regulatory clarity, not a ticker symbol. “The ETH ETF cleared the way by signaling that ether is a commodity, but it still wasn’t explicit,” Raman said. “With clear market structure, the utility of Ethereum gets completely unleashed. Now ETH permeates everything: every tokenized asset transfer, every stablecoin transfer, every Layer 2, they all flow through ETH.” And while Circle’s IPO and the rise of tokenized treasuries have brought new visibility to the sector, Raman says savvy investors will want more than equity exposure to stablecoin brands. Circle may get the IPO, but Ethereum gets the flows,” he said. “ETH is what secures this whole ecosystem, and it’s the only neutral, non-censorable collateral that can route value between all these tokenized assets.” VanEck's Solana ETF Comes Closer to Listing with DTCC Entry VanEck's proposed Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) has been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website under the ticker symbol VSOL, a procedural step that typically signals readiness for electronic clearing and settlement. VanEck’s DTCC listing comes amid growing institutional interest in Solana, following the blockbuster success of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs. However, just like with those ETFs, Canada has beaten the U.S. in the race to get listed. Four Canadian issuers, Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ, launched their Solana ETFs in April, following approval from the Ontario Securities Commission. OKX Continues European Expansion with Regulated Launch in Germany and Poland OKX has officially launched regulated crypto exchanges in Germany and Poland, marking a strategic expansion into two of Europe’s most active digital asset markets. The company now offers spot trading, staking, automated trading bots, and over 60 crypto-Euro pairs to users in both countries, supported by localized platforms with Euro onramps.

46242870,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=748637,1750208228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46242870.jpeg,Mass sell-off triggers Binance Alpha meltdown,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-binance-alphas-reform-restore-trust/,"Crypto users, influencers, and new traders were psyched about using Binance Alpha to unlock benefits, but the $ZKJ and $KOGE tokens experienced dramatic price swings that triggered mass liquidations. Some traders saw their investment go to waste, while others watched Alpha whales cycle trades between two Alpha tokens with minimal price exposure to farm points. These victims posted screenshots, angry threads, and questions on social media asking questions about whether the program was ever truly fair, and some critics even said Binance waited too long to act. Binance raised deeper concerns about its governance, transparency, and commitment to user protection when it tried closing loopholes and reducing system gaming by ruling that trades between Alpha tokens would no longer count toward Alpha Points. Why wasn’t it built into the system if the rule change was necessary to prevent abuse? Mass sell-off triggers Binance Alpha meltdown Large Alpha holders (whales) pulled their liquidity out of the market, creating a shortage of available funds that caused prices to drop quickly and tokens like $ZKJ and $KOGE to crash. Meanwhile, many traders used borrowed or leveraged money to trade these tokens on the blockchain. So, when prices started falling, it triggered automatic sell orders (liquidations), further pushing prices down in a quick and uncontrollable chain reaction. Users who invested or farmed points in these tokens began losing money and started selling their holdings or stopping their trading activities altogether, making it even harder for remaining traders to buy or sell tokens without facing large losses. Reports show that more than 100,000 users have left the Binance Alpha ecosystem in just a short period as they feel burned by the sudden and severe losses. Binance stops point farming between tokens Binance introduced a new rule that stops users from earning Alpha Points when they trade one Alpha token for another on June 17. Before this change, traders could swap tokens like $ZKJ for $KOGE and keep earning points even if they were simply moving money back and forth between these tokens without adding real value to the market. Some users say the change will stop traders from using clever tricks to game the system because they mislead other traders and the market about the tokens’ popularity and value. However, some say this new rule is too late and doesn’t deal with the design problems that reward high trading volume or the overwhelming influence of large holders or whales who still control much of the market and can manipulate prices. The new rule might reduce some of the most obvious abuses like wash trading , but it won’t fully fix the core challenges that have led to the recent crashes and community backlash. The crypto community criticizes Binance Many users felt betrayed by the system because the rewards they invested their time, money, and effort into earning were now devalued and made more difficult to earn. Some users said Binance should give back the points or rewards they lost because the new rules weren’t clearly explained before they made decisions to trade or hold tokens. In contrast, others wanted the company to explain how the new system worked to prevent similar sudden changes in the future. The backlash showed that many users lost trust in the Alpha brand as they believed the changes were designed to protect big players or the company’s image rather than create a fair and open environment for all users. Some people even said Binance only made those changes to avoid negative headlines and keep investors happy instead of dealing with the Alpha Points program’s issues with fairness and transparency. Some crypto community members think other big exchanges will follow Binance’s example and change their to reduce the risks of manipulation and abuse. Others think the platforms will continue with the traditional systems. Binance can set a new example for the crypto industry by building a fairer, more stable system that works well. However, if users react negatively or the new setup fails to bring in enough people and trading activity, other exchanges might not want to follow its lead. Binance should approach its community members and consult them for ideas about changing the incentive system because users are likelier to believe that the platform cares about their experience and wants to build a fair system that benefits everyone when they feel heard.

The Spanish lender’s act of offering its wealthy clients the opportunity to invest up to 7% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies is the latest evidence that some mainstream banks are starting to open up to a sector that was once dismissed due to its risks. However, regulators continue to caution about the dangers of cryptocurrencies, warning that investors should be prepared to lose all their money possibly. Earlier this year, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) reported that 95% of banks in the EU do not participate in crypto activities. BBVA’s reveals efforts to make its “wealth clients” embrace cryptocurrencies In a statement, Meyer mentioned that they began advising their private clients on Bitcoin in September of last year. Due to the riskier profile accompanying cryptocurrencies, he revealed that BBVA will allow the clients to invest as high as 7% of their portfolios in crypto. What has driven this sudden shift is that cryptocurrency prices have soared recently, and Bitcoin hit its highest record in May. That comes after a rebound from the lows recorded in 2022 as a clutch of major exchanges, including FTX, went under and left millions of investors out of pocket. They were aided in the recovery by support from US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. While private banks often facilitate crypto purchases at clients’ request, they still rarely go so far as to recommend investing in digital assets actively. Meyer mentioned at an event that BBVA was one of the first major global banks to recommend that wealthy clients invest in cryptocurrencies. He noted that the bank has fulfilled client requests to purchase them since 2021. BBVA advises clients to invest between 3-7% in Bitcoin and Ether, but Meyer indicated they plan to include more cryptocurrencies later this year. Meyer stated that clients have generally responded well to this advice and dismissed fears about the assets being too risky. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, adding 3% can really improve performance,” Meyer explained. Based on his argument, investing 3% does not involve taking a significant risk. ESMA raises concerns about the dangers associated with crypto Earlier, the European Union’s securities watchdog warned that issues in the cryptocurrency industry could threaten the stability of financial markets in the future as the sector expands and its links to more traditional financial markets deepen. This call for caution from the ESMA follows US economic policies that irritate global markets as US authorities struggle to remove barriers between the crypto and traditional banking sectors. In a speech to the European Parliament that was shared on the watchdog’s website, Natasha Cazenave, the executive director of ESMA, revealed that E U financial markets face significant pressure due to wider political and geopolitical events. Additionally, stock markets have been crashing since US President Donald Trump announced a blizzard of new tariffs. This also caused a significant drop in crypto prices. However, asset prices in various markets regained some of those losses. Following these concerns, Crypto-asset markets are still quite small. To address this, Cazenave mentioned that in today’s market conditions, even problems in these small markets can lead to wider issues in their financial system. She also noted that the risks to financial stability from crypto are not significant at this time. Still, ESMA raises alarms about the dangers of crypto and states that this sector requires ongoing careful observation.

XRP Wallets With 1 Million+ Tokens Have Set A New Record In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed the latest trend in a couple of indicators related to the XRP network. The first metric of relevance is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us, among other things, the number of wallets that belong to a particular coin range. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Plummet $61 Billion—Warning Sign For Bitcoin? In the context of the current topic, the range of interest is above 1 million coins (with the upper bound being infinity). This cutoff for the range converts to about $2.2 million at the current exchange rate, which is quite significant. Naturally, the only investors who would qualify for this threshold would be the big-money ones. Such holders are popularly known as the sharks and whales. Generally, the influence of any entity on the network goes up the more coins that they hold, so this cohort, with its large holdings, can carry some degree of power. As such, the behavior of the sharks and whales can be worth keeping an eye on. If nothing else, it can at least inform us about what the sentiment may be like among these humongous investors. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of these 1 million+ holders over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Supply Distribution has recently registered an uptick for sharks and whales, implying more wallets carrying above a million coins have popped up on the network. This could be an indication that some new big-money investors have potentially joined the chain. Following the increase, the network now has 2,708 wallets of this size, which is a new record. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data of the second relevant metric: Daily Active Addresses. This indicator measures the unique total number of wallets that are becoming involved in some kind of transaction activity on the network every day, whether as a sender or receiver. Since the smaller entities like retail massively outweigh the large investors in terms of number, this metric essentially represents the amount of activity that the entities on the smaller end of the network are participating in. From the graph, it’s visible that the XRP Daily Active Addresses have recently observed a large spike. Over the past week, the metric has averaged a value of 295,000 addresses daily, which is a drastic jump over the 35,000 to 40,000 figure witnessed during the last three months.

It now remains to be seen what effect, if any, these changes in network metrics would have on the cryptocurrency’s price. XRP Price XRP shot up beyond the $2.33 mark yesterday, but it seems bullish momentum has already faded as the coin has dropped back to $2.20.

The securities regulatory agency requested the members of the public to comment on the proposed rule changes to list both spot ETFs in the coming four weeks. When Will the SEC Approve Spot Solana ETFs According to James Seyffart, a Bloomberg’s ETF analyst, the delay by the U.S. SEC on spot Solana and XRP ETFs on Tuesday was not a surprise. Furthermore, the agency has been postponing other altcoins spot ETF applications in the recent past. However, as Coinpedia reported , the U.S. SEC has actively engaged the fund managers seeking to offer spot Solana ETFs in the past two weeks. Consequently, the odds of spot Solana ETF approval before the end of the year have significantly risen. “I wouldn’t be completely shocked if we see approvals for Solana ETFs in the next month or so. But I also wouldn’t be surprised if we have to wait until the final deadline in October. Timeline is unknown,” Seyffart noted . Market Impact The continued delay on the final decision for the altcoins spot ETFs will further delay the highly anticipated 2025 altseason. Moreover, the traditional crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to the altcoins was disrupted by the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States last year. However, the U.S. SEC will eventually approve the spot Solana and XRP ETFs, especially after Canada approved its first spot SOL ETF. Additionally, the demand for Solana by institutional investors has significantly increased in the past year, led by SOL Strategies.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 01:03:16

Speaking on the Uncapped podcast , which he co-hosts with his brother Jack Altman, the CEO described Meta’s approach as extreme. “It’s insane,” Altman said, referring to the staggering financial offers aimed at poaching top talent. Altman said that Meta had tried to recruit several key staff members from OpenAI, but none had accepted the offers. He noted that the company had targeted many individuals, but so far, none of their top talent had taken the bait. He admitted that Meta is aggressively courting top talent from OpenAI, probably because of OpenAI’s paramount role in the AI domain . Its ChatGPT product and research breakthroughs have positioned the company at the heart of the global AI race. Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Altman’s comments. Yet, insiders throughout the tech world admit that the company’s talent poaching tactics are only getting more intense. Zuckerberg heads personal AI hiring blitz Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, is said to be playing an active role in the talent battle, overseeing attempts to hire top researchers and engineers for Meta’s new “superintelligence” division. This new team is a part of Meta’s larger effort to win the general-purpose AI race and to be a direct competitor to companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. One of Meta’s most aggressive steps came last week when it said it would invest $14.3 billion in Scale AI, which provides data labeling and training services for machine learning. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang joined Meta’s AI team as part of the investment in a move that saw a considerable overlap of resources and talent. Meta has also hired leaders from other AI research centers. One of the most high-profile hires is Jack Rae, previously a principal researcher at Google DeepMind. According to Bloomberg , Rae’s move indicates Meta’s commitment to attracting top AI executives, even if it has to outspend rivals. According to Altman, Meta’s aggressive approach is driven by its competitive rivalry with OpenAI. He mentioned that he had heard Meta regards OpenAI as its biggest competitor. OpenAI’s culture beats the billion-dollar bait, Altman says Despite Meta’s exceptionally high offers, Altman expressed confidence that OpenAI could retain its core team. He questioned whether money alone was enough to distract people from meaningful work. He acknowledged that he respected many aspects of Meta but did not believe the company excelled at innovation. Altman said that OpenAI’s mission-driven culture plays a major role in why employees choose to stay, even when presented with large financial offers. He added that there is a cultural risk in turning AI jobs into roles driven purely by compensation, emphasizing that this is not how true innovation happens. Altman also veiled a dig at Meta’s approach, implying that OpenAI can access insights that Meta cannot. He underscored the company’s commitment to open research, responsible development, and thoughtful scaling of AI technologies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The company also revealed its plans to pivot to trading cards. In May 2025, GameStop bought Bitcoin worth around $500 million, and it plans to continue with that strategy. GameStop is following the investment strategy of MicroStrategy, which now owns billions of dollars’ worth of BTC, making it the largest corporate crypto holder. The decision by GameStop to purchase more BTC shows the growing acceptance of crypto in investment circles. While it has led to some losses in the short term, it could pay off in the long term as has been with MicroStrategy. Disappointed by recent losses, GameStop investors have been looking for a way to grow their portfolio out of meme stocks. One of their strategies has been to purchase the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale tokens, which analysts’ forecast could rise 30x or more. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Next-Gen DeFi Project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been touted by analysts as the most innovative DeFi project of 2025. It offers massive earning opportunities for its users, while also supporting the long-term growth of MUTM tokens. On the Mutuum Finance protocol, users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders will deposit their funds into the protocol for a chance to earn passive income via interest payments. The interest rate is dynamically set by the pool utilization rate. As the number of borrowers in a communal pool grows, so does the utilization rate, and thus the interest rate. This rising interest rate pushes borrowers to pay back their loans, while incentivizing more lenders to deposit their assets to benefit from the higher rates. The process leads to a self-balancing loop that ensures optimal capital utilization. To protect lenders assets in the pools, all loans will have to be overcollateralized. The actual level of collateralization will be set by protocol parameters. That will ensure the liquidators have enough of a moat in which to respond in case of price fluctuations. More stable assets that have low volatility, and high liquidity will have smaller overcollateralization requirements, due to their inherent stability. Additionally, the protocol will implement a reserve factor, which is a portion of the interest collected from borrowers. These funds will go into a common pool, and will be used to maintain the stability of the ecosystem. More stable assets like stablecoins will get a reserve factor of as low as 10%, while more volatile assets, like meme coins, will be assigned a reserve factor of up to 35%. Mutuum Finance will also vet all new tokens added to the platform. This will ensure that users are not exposed to dangers such as price manipulation, and infinite minting exploit. Overall, that will guarantee the stability and growth of the ecosystem in the long term. MUTM Token Presale Details Mutuum Finance is currently in phase 5 of the token presale. So far over $10.7 million has been raised from the ongoing presale. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The analysts are optimistic about the future of MUTM tokens, projecting that their price will go up by 2,550% when they go live. This optimistic forecast has been a major driver of the presale, which has seen over 38% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 sold barely two weeks after they launched. Based on the analysts’ forecast, a $2,100 investment in the presale at the current price of $0.03 could grow to $53,550. That is a massive opportunity to grow your crypto portfolio in the long term. Besides the gains in the initial phases of the token launch, analysts expect the token price to continue rising in the long term. A major reason for this rise will be the buy-back program which the team will launch. They will use protocol profits to support the price of MUTM tokens on the open market, which will boost their profile on major exchanges. With the tokens expected to list on several top-tier crypto exchanges, this could lead to a massive boost in participation numbers as traders try to capitalize on the opportunity for more gains. Bottom Line Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are currently on sale for a 50% discount on the planned listing price of $0.06. At this price you stand to make double what those who wait until the tokens go live. This is a rare opportunity in the crypto sector to join a project while it is on the ground floor, and continue to grow your earning long after it goes live.

The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Optis’ case must be tried a refresh in Texas after concluding that the instructions to the jury in the earlier trial were flawed. This decision marks the second time that a nine-figure patent ruling in favor of Optis has been reversed in this case. The uncertainty around the Optis-Apple case stirs up debates in the tech ecosystem Optis and its affiliates sued Apple in 2019 in federal court in Marshall, Texas, accusing the tech giant of infringing its patent rights in the technology behind the LTE wireless standard with its iPhones and other products. In 2020, a jury ruled that the iPhone maker would have to pay Optis $506 million for infringing its patents. In 2021, US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap ordered a retrial on damages, postulating that the amount may not have necessarily covered the duty of Optis to license the essential patents fairly and reasonably. Later that same year, a different jury awarded Optis $300 million in damages after the retrial. The Federal Circuit reversed this award, and the case was remanded for another trial on infringement and related damages. A three-judge panel said Gilstrap erred in consolidating all the patents into a single question for the jury. The appeals court held that the district court’s single-infringement question deprived the iPhone maker of its right to a unanimous verdict concerning each legal claim against it. In a separate ruling last month, a UK court found that Apple owes Optis $502 million for infringing their UK wireless patents. Apple has announced its intention to appeal this decision. A spokesperson for Optis stated that the company is very confident that the court will set a fair payment for the important Optis patents that allow millions of Apple devices to connect at high speeds. The case is known as Optis Cellular Technology LLC v. Apple Inc., US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 22-1925. When asked to comment on the Federal Circuit ruling, neither an attorney nor spokespeople for Apple responded immediately for comments. Optis demands appropriate compensation in Apple’s case London’s High Court in 2023 ruled that Apple should pay Optis $56.43 million plus interest to cover past and future sales over a specific period. The tech firm was accused of using 4G patents in devices, including iPhones and iPads. However, Optis argued that the amount was far too low, and it challenged the ruling in an appeal that was heard in February and March. Later, the court of appeals said the iPhone maker should pay an undivided $502 million, excluding interest, from 2023 to 2027. The payment was associated with a worldwide license for using Optis’ patents. In a statement, an Apple spokesperson said it was disappointed and would appeal the decision. A spokesperson for Optis, however, welcomed the ruling, saying it “categorically corrected” a previous decision it says was “plainly flawed” and had gone far in the right direction to recognize the true worth of its patents on Apple devices. The spokesman also said they will continue seeking fair compensation for Optis’ intellectual property, which connects millions of devices worldwide with high-speed connectivity.

33767162,[object Object],1750212050,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Texas Bitcoin Reserve Law Triggers Sunday—Silence Means Yes,https://bitcoinist.com/texas-bitcoin-reserve-law-triggers-sunday/,"Texas is now within a single, silent procedural heartbeat of creating the nation’s largest government-run stash of bitcoin. Senate Bill 21, the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act, was dispatched to Gov. Greg Abbott on June 1 after clearing both chambers by wide margins. Texas Bitcoin Reserve Set To Become Law Under Article IV, Section 14 of the Texas Constitution, the governor has twenty days after final adjournment to sign or veto a bill; failing to do either renders the measure law automatically. Because the 89th Legislature adjourned sine die on June 2, the deadline falls on Sunday, June 22. Legislative reference staff have already flagged that date as the last day the governor may act before “no-signature” enactment applies. The countdown was publicised early Tuesday by the policy-watch account @Bitcoin_Laws, which reminded followers: “The deadline for Governor Abbott to sign (or veto) Bitcoin Reserve Bill SB 21 is this Sunday, June 22. If he does neither, it will automatically become law according to the Texas Constitution.” Dennis Porter, chief executive of the Satoshi Act Fund and a lead strategist behind similar bills nationwide , framed the stakes more broadly: “Earlier this year, New Hampshire and Arizona became the 1st and 2nd states to pass ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ legislation into law. Texas is poised to be the third… Do not sleep on the states.” The eight-page statute creates a “special fund outside the state treasury” called the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, controlled by the Comptroller of Public Accounts. SB 21 allows the State Treasurer to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a large market cap, specifically those with a 12-month average of at least $500 billion. The comptroller gains explicit authority to hire qualified custodians using cold-storage technology, contract for independent audits, employ derivatives for hedging and—if cash-flow exigencies arise—liquidate coins temporarily to shore up the general treasury, with a statutory obligation to replace funds quickly. A five-member advisory committee (the comptroller plus four appointees) will recommend allocation and risk-management policies and must publish a biennial reserve report every even-numbered year. Originally filed on February 12 by Sen. Charles Schwertner, SB 21 received unanimous Senate approval on March 6, survived a handful of House amendments in May, and won final passage in a late-night conference report adopted by the House 110–25 and the Senate 23–8 on May 30. It was enrolled and transmitted to the governor the following day. The bill was designated a session priority by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and carried in the House by Rep. Giovanni Capriglione. Schwertner has cast the reserve as “a hedge against inflation” and a way to cement Texas’s reputation as “the crypto capital.” Comptroller Glenn Hegar, whose office will run the programme, told a Senate committee that “pioneering a strategic bitcoin reserve is a natural step for Texas,” adding that the measure “takes a measured approach to managing a potentially volatile asset, a critical requirement when investing taxpayer dollars.”Abbott himself has not opined publicly, but his press secretary Andrew Mahaleris said in late May that the governor “looks forward to reviewing this proposal.” If SB 21 clears the constitutional clock on Sunday, Texas will join New Hampshire —whose HB 302 authorises up to five percent of certain public funds to be invested in assets exceeding $500 billion in market cap—and Arizona , where HB 2749 redirects proceeds from unclaimed property into bitcoin, both enacted in early May.

According to a June 16 report by Bloomberg, Cantor Fitzgerald analysts have upgraded their outlook on Solana. The firm highlighted Solana’s growing role in financial applications, thanks to its fast transaction speeds and cost efficiency. Meanwhile, Stellar is gaining more attention for its consistent performance, recording a daily trading volume of over $82.6 million. These signs suggest strong market confidence in utility-driven tokens. Amid this movement, Qubetics ($TICS) is attracting attention with its unique offering and rapidly closing presale. Qubetics is stepping in to solve a major problem: the lack of seamless communication between different blockchains. While Solana and Stellar are proving their value in payments and finance, Qubetics is taking a broader approach by building a unified Web3 experience across networks. With just one presale stage left before listing, it’s shaping up to be one of the top cryptos to invest in today. Qubetics Brings Real-World Use Through Interoperability Qubetics is the first Web3 aggregator designed to link major blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and more—within a single platform. The aim is simple: enable users and businesses to manage their crypto activities without switching between wallets or platforms. For example, a freelance designer working with clients across borders could receive payments in various tokens—such as ETH or SOL—and manage them all within one Qubetics interface. At the same time, a retail business accepting stablecoins from customers can process and reconcile payments across chains quickly. For logistics firms, this application means real-time token tracking and settlement without delays or manual processes. By enabling smoother communication between chains, Qubetics positions itself as a practical solution in everyday operations. This application alone makes it one of the top cryptos to invest in today for anyone looking at long-term utility. Final Stage Alert: Qubetics Presale Offers Rare ROI Opportunity – Top Cryptos to Invest in Today The Qubetics presale has now reached its 37th and final phase, priced at $0.3370. Over 516 million $TICS tokens have been purchased by more than 28,000 token holders, and the total funds raised have already surpassed $18 million. With just 10 million tokens left, this final stage offers a short window before the token lists at $0.40, locking in an instant 20% return for buyers at the current price. Following a major tokenomics revision, Qubetics has reduced its total supply from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion. This move creates scarcity and increases potential long-term value. In addition, by allocating 38.55% of the supply to public participants, the project is shifting toward a more decentralized and user-governed model. Market analysts are already projecting strong growth for $TICS, with estimated future values between $5 and $10. Based on these figures, a $20,000 investment today at $0.3370 would yield 59,347 tokens. At a $5 valuation, that turns into $296,735, and at $10, over $590,000. With listing coming soon, strong demand, and only one stage remaining, the Qubetics presale has become a leading pick among the top cryptos to invest in today . This opportunity is limited, and the momentum is building quickly. For those seeking the best crypto presale of 2025, this could be the right moment to act. Solana Gains Institutional Momentum with Financial Use Case Focus Solana is gaining renewed attention in 2025, not only for its speed and efficiency but also for its growing role in enterprise finance. As highlighted by Bloomberg, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald now rate Solana as “Overweight,” which means they believe it has strong growth potential. The reason is clear—Solana supports up to 65,000 transactions per second and maintains very low transaction fees. These features are attracting traditional financial companies exploring blockchain-based infrastructure. Solana’s ability to handle large transaction volumes without congestion makes it an appealing alternative for financial systems looking to upgrade. This development sets Solana apart as a serious contender among today’s top cryptocurrencies. It’s no longer just a fast blockchain—it’s becoming a bridge between digital assets and mainstream finance, adding real-world use to its technical strength. Stellar Maintains Steady Performance and Real-World Adoption Stellar (XLM), ranked #16 by market cap, has seen its price retreat to $0.2586 after a 5.47% weekly drop, despite maintaining solid fundamentals. With 31.21 billion XLM in circulation out of a 50 billion max supply, XLM holds a market cap of $8.07 billion—just over 62% of its $13 billion unlocked market potential and $12.93 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV). Trading volume in the past 24 hours hit $230.67 million, reflecting a strong 2.85% volume-to-market cap ratio, signaling continued investor interest. Although momentum has cooled, Stellar’s 77% profile score and consistent ecosystem activity keep it firmly on analysts’ watchlists. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss the Chance to Join This Best Crypto Presale Together, Solana, Stellar, and Qubetics represent different strengths in today’s digital asset market. Solana is gaining ground with institutional users due to its speed and enterprise capabilities. Stellar remains dependable with solid trading volume and real-world application in international payments. And then there’s Qubetics—offering a fresh, real-world solution for Web3 adoption with a closing presale that’s drawing widespread attention. With the final stage of its presale nearly over and the listing price already fixed at 20% higher, Qubetics stands out as a clear opportunity. The fundamentals are strong, the demand is rising, and the supply is running low. For those looking to secure value early, this is the time to join this best crypto presale and make a strategic move in 2025’s growing market. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics considered one of the top cryptos to invest in today?

This drop comes shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF application. The new review deadline has now been pushed to November 2025, adding more uncertainty to the market. XRP Price Analysis: What’s Happening? Looking at XRP’s daily price chart, the market currently shows weak momentum in both directions. The price action remains choppy and range-bound, stuck between $2.10 and $2.35 for now. Unless the price breaks out of this range, traders expect XRP to continue moving sideways in the short term. Important support levels to watch are between $2.10 and $2.05. If XRP falls below this range with confirmation, the next support lies between $1.95 and $1.91, followed by $1.80. On the bullish front, resistance is seen around $2.32 to $2.36. A clear move above this could open the door for a rally towards $2.44 and $2.60. What’s Next for XRP? Despite the recent dip, XRP has been in an uptrend since April’s low. There’s still hope for a fifth wave rally that could push XRP prices above $5 in the long run, but for that to happen, XRP needs to hold support levels and break above recent highs. In the short term, unless XRP can climb past $2.33 and form a clear bullish pattern, the price is expected to remain range-bound, with traders keeping a close watch on whether the market finds a stable support zone soon. Conclusion The SEC’s decision delay has clearly shaken the market, and while long-term bullish hopes remain alive, XRP is currently struggling for momentum. Until a clearer move happens, traders can expect more sideways price action in the coming days.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 02:34:44

Meanwhile, Lightchain AI is rapidly emerging as a pure price buzz machine, capturing intense market attention with its presale momentum. Having raised $20.9 million at a fixed price of $0.007, Lightchain AI’s combination of intelligent infrastructure and strong buyer interest is setting it apart from traditional scaling narratives. While Polygon and Avalanche refine their technical roadmaps, Lightchain AI is commanding buzz and action from investors eager for the next big breakout, positioning itself as a major player in the evolving crypto landscape. Polygon and Avalanche Focus on Layer Expansion and Scalability Polygon and Avalanche are both resolving blockchain scalability differently but very creatively. Polygon’s AggLayer is a permissionless interoperability protocol, written with a zero-knowledge core, which will consolidate the fragmented blockchain market into a single cohesive ecosystem. Compatible with Proof Aggegration ＆ State Verification AggLayer can realize secure cross-chain communication, asset transfer, and shared liquidity among multitudinous chains by aggregating proofs and verifying state chains. With such an architecture it is possible to achieve near seamless interoperation of heterogenous chains, offering a user experience that can be considered as though there is a single chain. Avalanche, on the contrary, uses a subnet design that enables developers to roll their own, application-specific blockchains. With the Avalanche9000, the cost and complexity of rolling out these subnets have decreased, resulting in a boom of Layer 1 networks in its ecosystem. Features like Interchain Messaging (ICM) and Interchain Token Transfers (ICTT) deliver native, safe communication and asset transfer across subnets, removing the need for external bridges and solidifying Cosmos’ commitment to interoperability. They’re both trying to solve the “scalability trilemma” with modular networks, which they hope we be able to interoperate while also achieving the same security and decentralization. Our AggLayer for Polygon emphasizes the consolidation of chains instead of sharding between chains using zero-knowledge proofs, while Avalanche subnets are composable, sovereign networks with native cross-subnet capabilities. Lightchain AI Generates Intense Buzz Across Price Charts Lightchain AI is generating intense buzz across price charts as aggressive buying activity pushes its Bonus Round into the spotlight. With token pricing fixed at $0.007 and over $20.9 million raised, momentum is building fast ahead of the mainnet launch. What sets Lightchain AI apart is its AI-integrated Layer 1 chain, powered by decentralized validator and contributor nodes that execute real-time AI tasks through the proprietary AIVM. The complete removal of the original 5% team allocation—and its reallocation to grants and ecosystem incentives—has only amplified investor confidence. As buyers track volume spikes and chart activity, Lightchain AI’s quiet but forceful rise is commanding attention. It’s not just hype—it’s infrastructure-backed movement with massive growth signals pulsing beneath the surface. Market Buzz- Lightchain AI Takes Industry by Storm Lightchain AI is making waves in the industry with its Bonus Round and highly anticipated mainnet launch just around the corner. With token pricing locked at an accessible $0.007 and a staggering $20.9 million already raised, excitement is at an all-time high. Traders and developers are rushing to join the action, drawn by its cutting-edge AI-integrated Layer 1 design, open-source code, and decentralized node structure.

Additionally, rising stablecoin inflows to exchanges indicate growing buy-side liquidity, reinforcing the market’s bullish sentiment. Bitcoin Whales Foreseeing Major Rally Ahead? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin whales recorded one of the largest BTC outflows from Binance this month. The chart below shows that nearly 4,500 BTC were withdrawn on June 16. Bitcoin whales are defined as wallet addresses with significant BTC holdings. Past data suggests that such large withdrawals from whales have typically preceded price rallies, as they reflect a reduction in BTC exchange reserves, leaving fewer coins readily available for trading. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Beyond this large-scale withdrawal, on-chain data also reveals dwindling BTC inflows to exchanges from both whales and retail investors. This combination of major outflows and low deposits could be laying the groundwork for a Bitcoin “supply crunch.” For the uninitiated, a Bitcoin supply crunch occurs when the available BTC on exchanges declines sharply, reducing the immediate supply for buyers. This happens when long-term holders or whales withdraw BTC to cold storage, creating upward pressure on price as demand outpaces liquid supply. Stablecoin Inflows Witness Sharp Increase In parallel with Bitcoin’s exchange exodus, stablecoin inflows to Binance have surged in recent days. Notably, over $400 million in stablecoins flowed in on both June 13 and 15. Historically, such significant stablecoin inflows have been linked to buy-side liquidity preparation. In other words, large investors appear ready to deploy capital into crypto assets like BTC, reflecting renewed risk appetite. Taha concluded: The aggressive Bitcoin withdrawals and concurrent stablecoin deposits create a supply-demand asymmetry. With fewer BTC available on exchanges and growing liquidity to fuel buys, the stage is set for a potential price breakout. Meanwhile, additional exchange data supports the case for further upside in BTC. For example, the coin has been experiencing consistently negative funding rates on Binance – often a precursor to short squeezes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000 At the same time, Bitcoin’s long-term holder Realized Cap recently surpassed $20 billion, underscoring rising confidence among seasoned investors. In addition, despite the ongoing BTC rally, retail participation remains relatively low, suggesting further room for growth. However, short-term holders are showing signs of caution, increasing their selling amid recent price corrections. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,575, down 1.0% in the past 24 hours.

The global crypto market cap has dropped by 4.47% to $3.18 trillion, with top assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all sliding in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,954, down over 2%, while Ethereum has fallen to $2,522 after a 2.66% dip. XRP has been hit even harder, plunging over 9% to $2.16 as traders react to both market volatility and delays in its ETF decision. Altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin are also under pressure, with Cardano sliding 3.5% and Dogecoin shedding over 2%. The Fear & Greed Index now stands at 48. Geopolitical Tensions Adding to the Pressure Adding fuel to the fire is the latest escalation in the Iran-Israel conflict. Reports confirmed that Iran has showcased its hyper-ballistic missiles, capable of targeting Tel Aviv and bypassing Israel’s Iron Dome. In response, Israel bombed Iran’s state-run broadcast station in a bold move aimed at silencing propaganda. Meanwhile, the U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly left a G7 summit in Canada to return to Washington, sparking rumors of an imminent U.S. intervention. Trump warned citizens to immediately evacuate Tehran, posting on Truth Social that Iran “should have signed the deal” and hinted at the possibility of severe military action. Polymarket odds of U.S. involvement surged to 70%, raising concerns on Wall Street and in crypto markets alike. Price Prediction: Could Bitcoin Drop to $100K? If tensions continue to rise and the U.S. signals direct involvement, Bitcoin could test the psychological $100,000 support level in the coming sessions.

Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sponsored the bill, called the passage a defining moment for US financial infrastructure. “The prospect of faster and cheaper payments will have far-reaching implications for our financial system,” he said on the Senate floor. “Stablecoins are a paradigm-shifting development that can bring our payment system into the 21st century.” The GENIUS Act, short for “Guaranteeing Essential National Infrastructure Using Stablecoins,” seeks to regulate dollar-backed digital tokens often used to transfer funds across blockchain networks. The bill would require stablecoins to be fully backed by liquid assets like US dollars or Treasury bills and mandate monthly public disclosures of those reserves. It also limits stablecoin issuance to licensed institutions and bars current federal officials from launching their own tokens. Concerns Over Foreign Money and Ethical Gaps Nearly Stopped the GENIUS Act But the road to Tuesday’s vote was anything but smooth. In May, the bill stalled after Democrats raised concerns about national security risks and ethics loopholes. Revelations that an Abu Dhabi firm planned to invest in Binance using stablecoins issued by a Trump-linked company heightened those fears, prompting calls for stricter guardrails. Weeks of closed-door negotiations followed. Key changes included stricter ethics disclosures for officials holding stablecoins, added protections for bank customers in the event of bankruptcy, and a Treasury mandate to oversee suspicious activity. These revisions helped win back enough Democrats to push the bill through. Senate Vote Draws Praise for Safeguards, But Concerns Linger Over Loopholes Even so, critics remained. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a longtime crypto skeptic, warned that the bill still falls short. “This is a bill that was written by the industry,” she said, adding that it “will supercharge the profitability of Donald Trump’s crypto corruption while it undercuts consumer protection.” Supporters of the legislation, however, argued that leaving the sector unregulated would only increase risk. Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who helped draft the bill, called the digital asset space a “wild West.” She said consumers remain exposed and companies still lack regulatory clarity. While she acknowledged concerns about Trump’s crypto ties, she argued those should not derail efforts to bring order to the industry. Liat Shetret, vice president of global policy and regulation at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, called the Senate vote “a pivotal step in shaping the country’s digital asset future.” She added, “It’s clear that robust consumer protections and market integrity safeguards were central to driving approval, and the GENIUS Act benefited from strong nonpartisan support.” The House is expected to take up the legislation in the coming weeks. While some industry advocates have urged rapid passage, others, including the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, are pressing for key changes to address potential risks to financial stability. The final shape of the bill may still shift before it lands on the president’s desk.

The bipartisan support signals Ohio’s push to become a cryptocurrency and blockchain technology leader. The bill, introduced by Republican Representative Steve Demetriou, is part of a growing national trend to protect the rights of digital asset holders. It now heads to the full Ohio House of Representatives for debate and a vote. Before the vote, Demetriou said it was a historic day for the state, adding that they were laying a foundation to support new technologies and provide Ohioans with greater financial control. He acknowledged committee members for coming out to take a vote for the bill. The unanimous vote represents the increasing political consensus surrounding the importance of delivering straightforward legal safeguards for digital asset users at the state level. Ohio moves to protect self-custody and mining The bill protecting self-custody mining may be problematic for those discussing financial sovereignty or DeFi, where advocates argue that self-custody is endemic to the crypto ecosystem. The bill would also protect the rights of the residents and companies there to run blockchain nodes and mine for virtual currencies. Those activities are essential to operating decentralized systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which verify transactions and secure the network. In protecting those rights in statute, the hope is that Ohio can lure businesses building a blockchain infrastructure and avoid the sort of regulatory crackdown that has recently materialized in other states. HB 116 also brings in a $200 exclusion from state capital gains tax on the gains resulting from transactions of digital assets. The amendment is intended to relieve small crypto users targeted by the tax man – traders who make low-worth purchases or peer-to-peer transfers. Supporters say the exemption will help spur everyday use of digital currencies, allowing residents to easily use Bitcoin and digital assets like it, like payments, tipping, and other low-cost transactions without tax complexity. Ohio’s initiative aims to spur adoption and pilot responsible crypto integration in the consumer capacity, supporting this small tax break. The move is also in line with national conversations around making tax treatment of digital assets easier and lifting regulatory barriers for users. Supporters of cryptocurrencies hail an advance in the House HB 116 still needs approval from the full state legislature and the governor’s signature, but its unanimous committee vote shows strong bipartisan support for crypto policy in Ohio. If passed, it could position the state as one of the most crypto-friendly in the country. The legislation is widely viewed as a strong signal that Ohio was trying to set itself up as a leader in the digital economy. The states that move early will likely be in the best position to gain from the next wave of innovation. Still, not everyone is fully convinced. Critics warn the bill could create regulatory gaps and raise concerns about consumer protection. Others worried that the measure could be at odds with local environmental or energy priorities, negating the ability to regulate mining.

As dilemmas mount, can Solana rise to the occasion and dethrone the altcoin king? This article dives into Ethereum's struggles and explores whether Solana or other contenders are poised for a breakthrough. Discover which cryptocurrencies are positioned for growth in this dynamic market. Ethereum Price Outlook: Mixed Short-Term Gains Versus Longer-Term Losses Over the past month, Ethereum climbed by approximately 3.9%, while its performance over the last six months declined nearly 29.1%. Price movements oscillated between approximately $1,900 and $2,962, with recent gains suggesting some resilience amidst longer-term weakness. Market sentiment has shown slight improvements, leading to renewed buying interest despite a prolonged period of downward pressure. Volatility has been significant, highlighting recovery efforts that contrast with the broader six-month decline. While a modest monthly rise is visible, it is overshadowed by the substantial drop over the previous half year. Ethereum's fluctuations reflect a balance between cautious optimism and entrenched bearish trends. Current price levels range from $1,923.57 to $2,961.91. Immediate resistance appears around $3,395.40, with a farther barrier near $4,433.74. Key support levels are at $1,318.72 and an additional deeper support near $280.38. Bulls show some strength with a positive monthly return and a momentum indicator near 46.24. However, a negative awesome oscillator and a weekly decline of roughly 4% indicate selling pressure. The relative strength index at about 51.85 leaves the trend unclear, suggesting a balanced market. Traders should monitor key levels for potential entry points while managing risk with tight stop-loss orders in this uncertain environment. Solana Price Trends: Past Declines and a Consolidative Current Range SOL experienced a 5.84% weekly drop and an 8.60% decline over the past month. Over the last six months, the coin fell by 26.61%, marking a period of sustained downward movement. The price trajectory over these timeframes indicates a consistent bearish influence that has kept momentum subdued, with gradual but steady declines reflecting persistent market pressure. SOL is currently trading between $136.17 and $182.20, with immediate resistance at $207.90 and support at $115.84. The indicators, including an Awesome Oscillator at -12.94 and an RSI at 45.58, suggest that bearish sentiment outweighs bullish forces at this time. There is no clear trend, as price remains confined within these key levels. A move above $207.90 could test higher resistance, while a drop toward $115.84 may signal further downside risk. Careful positioning and attention to these technical levels are essential for trading strategies. Conclusion ETH remains a significant player but faces challenges. Its competitors, like SOL , offer faster and cheaper transactions. Interest in SOL has grown, and some believe it could someday surpass ETH. However, ETH's established presence and ongoing upgrades keep it in a strong position. The competition will likely continue, with both coins having their strengths and followers.

Recent comments attributed to U.S. Vice President Vance regarding the potential for further action by the Trump Administration against the Iran Nuclear Program have resurfaced, highlighting a significant source of Geopolitical Risk that could influence the Cryptocurrency Market . According to reports citing Arab TV via JinSe Finance, VP Vance suggested that President Donald Trump might be considering renewed or escalated measures concerning Iran’s nuclear activities. While the specifics of any potential ‘further action’ remain unclear, the mere possibility introduces uncertainty into the global landscape. Understanding Geopolitical Risk and Its Market Impact What exactly is Geopolitical Risk ? It refers to the potential for political events or instability in one country or region to negatively impact the interests of another country or global markets. This can include: Military conflicts or threats Sanctions and trade disputes Political instability or regime change Terrorism Historically, markets react sharply to perceived increases in geopolitical tension. Traditional assets like oil often see price spikes, while ‘safe haven’ assets like gold or certain government bonds might appreciate. Stock markets, conversely, often experience declines due to increased uncertainty and potential disruption to trade and economic activity. How Could the Iran Nuclear Program Situation Affect the Cryptocurrency Market? The connection between geopolitical events concerning the Iran Nuclear Program and the Cryptocurrency Market might not be immediately obvious, but it’s a crucial one in today’s interconnected financial world. Here’s why: Increased Market Volatility: Geopolitical uncertainty is a major driver of Market Volatility across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. News suggesting potential conflict or significant policy shifts can lead to rapid price swings as investors react to perceived risks. Investor Sentiment: Heightened global tensions can negatively impact overall investor sentiment, leading to a broader risk-off environment where investors pull back from speculative assets, which often includes cryptocurrencies. Safe Haven Narrative (Debated): Some proponents argue that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can act as a digital safe haven during times of political or economic turmoil, independent of traditional financial systems. However, this narrative is heavily debated, and crypto markets often correlate with traditional risk assets like stocks during periods of stress. Sanctions and Financial Systems: While not directly stated in Vance’s reported comments, ‘further action’ could potentially involve stricter financial sanctions against Iran. Discussions around sanctions sometimes touch upon the use of cryptocurrencies to bypass traditional financial channels, although this is a complex and controversial topic with significant regulatory scrutiny. The potential for action from the Trump Administration regarding the Iran Nuclear Program adds another layer of complexity to the existing global political landscape. Investors in the Cryptocurrency Market should remain aware that such developments contribute to the overall macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop that influences asset prices. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For those navigating the often-turbulent waters of the Cryptocurrency Market , paying attention to geopolitical signals like the reported comments from VP Vance is important. While it’s impossible to predict market movements based on one statement, understanding the potential sources of Market Volatility is key to informed decision-making. Consider these points: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of major geopolitical developments, particularly those involving significant global powers and regions prone to instability. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand how potential increases in Market Volatility due to geopolitical events fit within your personal investment strategy and risk tolerance. Diversification: Geopolitical risk underscores the importance of a diversified portfolio, although diversification within crypto or across different asset classes is a personal choice. The reported comments serve as a reminder that external political factors, even those seemingly distant from the blockchain world, can contribute to the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency prices. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating Uncertainty VP Vance’s reported remarks about the Trump Administration potentially taking ‘further action’ on the Iran Nuclear Program highlight an ongoing source of Geopolitical Risk . This risk contributes to global uncertainty and can be a significant factor driving Market Volatility , including within the sensitive Cryptocurrency Market . While the direct impact is complex and debated, staying informed about such developments is essential for investors seeking to understand the broader forces influencing digital asset prices. Geopolitical tensions add another layer to the already complex analysis required when investing in cryptocurrencies.

In March 2025, for example, Tether froze $27 million worth of USDT on the Russian-linked exchange Garantex following the EU’s 16th package of sanctions.

Currently, a notable trend is emerging: a surprising level of restraint despite brewing geopolitical events that have historically triggered significant reactions in the crypto market . This calm stands in stark contrast to past episodes, raising questions about the market’s evolving maturity and future trajectory. While the immediate reaction has been muted, some analysts warn that this tranquility might be temporary, hinting at potential increases in market volatility ahead. How Have Bitcoin Traders Reacted to Geopolitical Events Historically? Historically, the Bitcoin price has often been sensitive to global uncertainties. Geopolitical tensions, economic crises, or significant political shifts have frequently led to pronounced movements in the crypto market . This reaction was often attributed to Bitcoin’s nascent nature and its perception as a risk-on asset or, paradoxically, a potential safe haven in times of traditional market instability, leading to unpredictable swings. Consider past instances: Sudden Shocks: Events like unexpected military conflicts or major economic policy shifts in key global economies have often caused sharp sell-offs or rapid price pumps as traders reacted swiftly to perceived threats or opportunities. Amplified Volatility: In less mature market phases, even relatively minor geopolitical news could be amplified, leading to significant market volatility . A 5% downtrend, for example, was often accompanied by aggressive short selling, panic-driven spot selling, and rapid price swings. Herd Mentality: Early on, the crypto market was more susceptible to herd behavior, where fear or greed spread quickly through social media and forums, prompting coordinated (or uncoordinated) buying or selling frenzies among Bitcoin traders . This historical context makes the current restraint observed among Bitcoin traders particularly noteworthy. Why Are Bitcoin Traders Showing Restraint Now? Despite a backdrop of ongoing global tensions, including regional conflicts and economic uncertainties, the typical panic response from Bitcoin traders appears subdued. As reported by Cointelegraph, pseudonymous analyst “Skew” highlighted this unusual calm. Even with a recent correction of around 3% in the Bitcoin price , the widespread panic seen in previous downtrends has not materialized. Several factors could be contributing to this altered behavior: Market Maturity: The crypto market is significantly larger and more established than it was during earlier geopolitical events. Increased institutional participation and a broader understanding of Bitcoin among retail investors may lead to more measured responses rather than impulsive reactions. Desensitization: Perhaps Bitcoin traders are becoming somewhat desensitized to the constant stream of global news. Unless an event directly and immediately impacts financial markets or infrastructure, it might not trigger the same level of alarm it once did. Focus on Fundamentals: Traders might be placing greater emphasis on Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals, such as network growth, adoption rates, and upcoming protocol developments, rather than reacting solely to external macro events. Holding Strong (HODLing): A significant portion of the market consists of long-term holders who are less likely to sell based on short-term geopolitical news, preferring to ride out periods of uncertainty. This collective restraint suggests a potential shift in how the crypto market processes external shocks. There has been no major movement yet, indicating a ‘wait and see’ approach from many participants. Could Market Volatility Be On the Horizon? While the current calm is notable, analyst Skew’s warning about a potential increase in market volatility soon cannot be ignored. Restraint does not equate to stagnation, and several factors could disrupt the current equilibrium. Potential triggers for increased volatility include: Escalation of Geopolitical Events: Should global tensions escalate significantly or impact major economic powers more directly, the current restraint could break, leading to rapid price movements. Unexpected Economic Data: Surprise inflation reports, changes in interest rate policies from major central banks, or signs of recession could quickly shift market sentiment and increase market volatility . Regulatory Developments: New regulations (positive or negative) concerning cryptocurrencies in major jurisdictions can have a profound impact on the crypto market . Large Whale Movements: Significant buying or selling activity from large holders (whales) can independently trigger volatility, especially in a market that is currently exhibiting low momentum. The lack of aggressive selling currently observed doesn’t mean the market is immune to future shocks. It might simply mean traders are waiting for a clearer signal or a more significant catalyst before making major moves. The current low volatility could be the calm before a storm, potentially setting the stage for a sharp move once a direction is established. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Traders Given the current environment of restraint coupled with the warning of potential future market volatility , how should Bitcoin traders navigate these waters? Here are some actionable insights: Strategy Description Benefit/Purpose Stay Informed Keep track of both geopolitical developments and on-chain analytics. Understand potential catalysts for volatility and market sentiment. Define Risk Tolerance Determine how much capital you are willing to risk on any single trade or investment. Avoid emotional decisions during periods of high volatility. Use Stop-Loss Orders Implement stop-loss orders to automatically limit potential losses if the Bitcoin price moves against your position. Protect capital during sudden downturns. Consider Diversification Don’t put all your capital into Bitcoin. Explore other assets or strategies. Reduce overall portfolio risk. Avoid Leverage (or Use Cautiously) High leverage can amplify gains but also losses, making it extremely risky during periods of high market volatility . Prevent rapid liquidation of positions. The current restraint offers an opportunity for careful observation and planning. Rather than reacting impulsively to every headline, focusing on a well-defined trading or investment strategy is paramount. Understanding that the lack of immediate panic doesn’t guarantee future stability is key. Conclusion: A Mature Market or Just a Pause? The current behavior of Bitcoin traders , marked by restraint in the face of significant geopolitical events , suggests a potential maturation of the crypto market . Unlike previous periods where even minor tremors caused widespread panic and significant market volatility , the market has absorbed recent pressures with relative calm. The 3% correction, while a price drop, hasn’t triggered the aggressive selling seen historically, particularly when the Bitcoin price experienced larger downturns. However, the warning from analysts like Skew serves as a crucial reminder that this period of low momentum might be temporary. The underlying pressures from geopolitical events and macroeconomic factors haven’t disappeared, and a catalyst could still emerge to trigger increased volatility. For Bitcoin traders , this period is less about complacency and more about strategic positioning, careful risk management, and staying informed about potential shifts that could impact the crypto market dynamics and the future Bitcoin price action.

While digital assets operate on decentralized networks, they are inherently linked to broader geopolitical and economic forces. Recent statements regarding US Iran tensions highlight a potential flashpoint that could significantly influence market sentiment and price movements in the crypto space. What’s Happening: The Core Statement on Airspace Control According to reports, U.S. President Trump made a notable assertion: the United States holds “complete control” over Iran’s airspace. This declaration suggests a significant level of dominance over Iranian defense capabilities, claiming that their systems, despite their numbers, are not effective against U.S. technology and strategy. Such statements, particularly concerning sensitive geopolitical regions and military control, immediately raise the temperature of international relations. Key takeaways from this specific claim include: A direct assertion of U.S. military superiority in a critical operational domain. Implications about the effectiveness of Iran’s air defense infrastructure. Potential escalation of rhetoric in an already tense relationship. While the immediate focus of such a statement is military and political, its ripples extend far beyond borders, impacting global markets, including the burgeoning sector of digital assets. How Do Geopolitical Events Like US Iran Tensions Influence Crypto? It might seem counterintuitive that a statement about airspace control in the Middle East could affect Bitcoin or Ethereum prices. However, global markets are interconnected. Geopolitical events introduce uncertainty, and uncertainty often leads to shifts in investor behavior. Here’s how events like heightened US Iran tensions can matter to crypto: Risk-Off Sentiment: Increased tension can cause investors to move away from perceived ‘riskier’ assets. Historically, cryptocurrencies have been seen as high-risk, high-reward investments. A surge in geopolitical uncertainty can trigger sell-offs as investors seek safety in traditional havens like government bonds or gold. Macroeconomic Stability Concerns: Major international conflicts or standoffs can disrupt trade routes, impact oil prices, and affect global economic forecasts. A deteriorating macroeconomic outlook can dampen enthusiasm for speculative assets. Sanctions and Financial Systems: Tensions can lead to new or intensified sanctions. While crypto is often discussed as a tool to circumvent traditional financial systems and sanctions, increased regulatory scrutiny on crypto exchanges and transactions could arise in response, potentially impacting liquidity and accessibility. Search for Alternatives: Conversely, some proponents argue that crypto, particularly Bitcoin, could serve as a hedge against geopolitical instability and currency devaluation, positioning it as a digital alternative to traditional safe haven assets . We’ll explore this more below. Analyzing the Potential Crypto Market Impact Predicting the exact crypto market impact of geopolitical events is challenging because the market is influenced by numerous factors. However, we can identify potential scenarios based on past reactions and market dynamics. In times of rising tension, we often observe: Increased Volatility: Prices can swing wildly as news develops and market sentiment shifts rapidly. Correlation with Traditional Markets: Crypto sometimes correlates with tech stocks or other risk assets, meaning a downturn in the broader market due to geopolitical fears can drag crypto prices down. Divergent Narratives: The debate intensifies between crypto as a speculative tech asset and crypto as a censorship-resistant, sovereign store of value (a potential safe haven). Consider how different asset classes *might* react: Asset Class Potential Reaction to Geopolitical Tension Why? Gold Typically Rises Historical safe haven, store of value, limited supply. Government Bonds (e.g., US Treasuries) Demand Increases (Yields Fall) Perceived safety, backing by stable governments. Stocks (General) Typically Falls Increased uncertainty impacts corporate earnings and economic outlook. Oil Volatile (Often Rises if Supply Threatened) Middle East is a major production region; tension can disrupt supply. Cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) Volatile (Reaction Varies) Depends on whether ‘risk-off’ or ‘digital safe haven’ narrative dominates; market maturity is a factor. The unique aspect of crypto is its relatively short history compared to gold or bonds, meaning its consistent behavior during various types of crises is still being established. Therefore, assessing the crypto market impact requires careful observation. Is Crypto a True Safe Haven Asset Amidst Geopolitical Risk? The question of whether Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies function as safe haven assets during periods of heightened geopolitical risk is a subject of ongoing debate within the financial community. Arguments for Crypto as a Safe Haven: Decentralization: Not controlled by any single government or central bank, making it resistant to political interference or seizure in the same way traditional assets might be. Border-Agnostic: Can be sent and received globally without reliance on traditional financial intermediaries, potentially useful in regions facing sanctions or capital controls. Scarcity (for some): Assets like Bitcoin have a fixed supply, which proponents argue makes them resistant to inflation and currency debasement caused by economic instability often linked to geopolitical issues. Arguments Against Crypto as a Safe Haven: High Volatility: Crypto markets are notoriously volatile, often experiencing significant price drops that make them seem risky rather than safe during crises. Correlation with Risk Assets: At times, crypto prices move in tandem with tech stocks and other risk-on assets, suggesting it’s not yet acting as an uncorrelated safe haven. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for crypto introduces its own layer of risk. Limited Adoption as Store of Value (Compared to Gold): While growing, its history and widespread acceptance as a primary store of value during crises are limited compared to gold. Ultimately, while some investors may turn to crypto as a hedge against specific types of geopolitical risk (like currency controls), its overall price action during global crises is often characterized by increased market volatility , making its role as a consistent safe haven debatable for many. Navigating Market Volatility Triggered by Geopolitical Risk Statements like the one concerning Iran’s airspace serve as reminders that global events can introduce significant market volatility . For cryptocurrency investors, understanding this connection is crucial. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders: Stay Informed: Pay attention not only to crypto-specific news but also to major global geopolitical developments, especially those involving major powers or critical regions. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how comfortable you are with potential price swings driven by external factors. Diversify (Even Within Crypto): Don’t put all your funds into a single asset. Consider different types of crypto or other asset classes based on your strategy. Consider Long-Term Strategy: Short-term geopolitical noise can be distracting. If you believe in the long-term potential of crypto, temporary volatility might be less concerning. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Sudden news can trigger panic selling or impulsive buying. Stick to a pre-defined strategy rather than reacting emotionally to market swings. Geopolitical events are just one factor, but they can be powerful catalysts for sudden shifts in market dynamics, amplifying existing trends or creating new ones. The Broader Context of Geopolitical Risk and Digital Finance The connection between geopolitical risk and the digital asset space extends beyond immediate price reactions. It touches upon the very narratives surrounding cryptocurrency. For instance, the idea of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ or a tool for financial sovereignty gains traction when trust in traditional institutions or currencies is shaken by political instability or international disputes. Conversely, increased geopolitical tension can also lead to calls for stricter international regulation of crypto to prevent its use in illicit finance or sanctions evasion. The statement about control over Iran’s airspace, while specific, is part of a larger pattern of global power dynamics that investors in decentralized assets cannot afford to ignore. These dynamics shape regulatory approaches, influence mainstream adoption, and ultimately contribute to the overall perception and valuation of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in a Connected World President Trump’s assertion about U.S. control over Iran’s airspace is a significant geopolitical statement. While seemingly distant from the world of blockchain and digital currencies, such events are integral to the complex web of factors influencing global financial markets. They highlight the ever-present reality of geopolitical risk and its potential to trigger significant market volatility . For those invested in or interested in the digital asset space, understanding how developments like rising US Iran tensions can impact the market is crucial. While the debate continues on whether crypto, particularly Bitcoin, truly functions as one of the primary safe haven assets , there is no doubt that these events contribute to the broader economic climate in which cryptocurrencies operate. Staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a clear investment strategy are paramount in navigating a market increasingly susceptible to global headlines.

If they cashed out, the potential windfall from a mere $620 investment during Ethereum’s genesis would represent an eye-watering 8,270x return. A Long Sleep Ends According to blockchain data tracker Lookonchain, the dormant wallet first signaled life by moving a tiny fraction of ETH, just 0.002 coins, less than an hour before the main deposits started. Then, over the past two days, the holder systematically split and transferred the whole stash to Binance across multiple transactions, the largest being nearly 1,000 ETH. Even though this movement of funds has coincided with a period of intense volatility for ETH caused by geopolitical shockwaves from the ongoing military conflict between Israel and Iran, the Ethereum veteran could make as much as $5.2 million from their holding, potentially selling each coin for more than $2,600 as things stand, after buying them for approximately $0.31 a piece in 2014. Ethereum Price Action The Israel-Iran conflict saw the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap plunge dramatically, falling from $2,760 to a low of $2,470 within hours. The more than 10% drop erased ETH’s recent surge to a 15-week high near $2,830. Additionally, over $1 billion in leveraged positions across the market were liquidated, with Binance data revealing concentrated ETH long liquidations between $2,650 and $2,430. Following the retracement, Ethereum has shown a measure of resilience, climbing about 3.2% over the past week to stay head and shoulders above the wider crypto market, which dipped roughly 2.7% in the same period. At press time, the asset was up 3.9% in the last 24 hours, hovering around $2,616, after oscillating between $2,494 and $2,628. Still, the altcoin is down 26.6% across the past 12 months, and more than 46% shy of its all-time high of $4,878 set some three years ago.

The firm plans to allocate a substantial $50 million into Hyperliquid (HYPE) as part of a newly established treasury strategy . This decision, reported by JinSe Finance, positions Eyenovia among a growing list of companies exploring alternatives to traditional cash reserves. Why Would a Biotech Firm Make a Crypto Investment ? It might seem counterintuitive for a company focused on ophthalmic therapeutics like Eyenovia to venture into the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. However, several factors could drive such a decision: Diversification: Companies often seek to diversify their treasury holdings beyond cash and short-term bonds to potentially mitigate risks associated with inflation and currency devaluation. Potential for Growth: Cryptocurrencies, while risky, offer the potential for higher returns compared to low-yield traditional assets, especially in a low-interest-rate environment (though rates have risen recently, the principle of seeking yield persists). Inflation Hedge: Some proponents view certain digital assets as a potential hedge against inflation, similar to gold, although this is a debated topic. Technological Alignment: While not directly related to biotech, embracing innovative financial technologies can sometimes align with a company’s overall forward-thinking ethos. Eyenovia’s specific rationale for choosing Hyperliquid (HYPE) for its treasury strategy is particularly noteworthy. Understanding the Choice: What is Hyperliquid ( HYPE )? Hyperliquid is a relatively new but rapidly growing decentralized perpetual exchange. It aims to provide a high-performance trading experience with low latency and high throughput, often seen as a competitor to centralized exchanges for derivatives trading. The HYPE token is the native asset of the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Investing in HYPE specifically, rather than just Bitcoin or Ethereum, suggests a deeper dive into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space or a belief in the specific growth potential of the Hyperliquid platform and its token. This moves beyond a simple ‘store of value’ argument often used for Bitcoin treasury holdings and leans more towards an investment in a specific protocol or ecosystem. Key aspects of Hyperliquid and its token might include: Focus on perpetual futures trading. Decentralized architecture. Potential utility or staking benefits associated with the HYPE token within the platform. Eyenovia’s allocation of $50 million into this specific asset class represents a significant commitment. The Concept of a Corporate Treasury Strategy in Crypto Traditionally, corporate treasury management focuses on preserving capital, ensuring liquidity, and maximizing yield on short-term assets with minimal risk. Holdings typically include cash, money market funds, and short-term government or corporate bonds. Integrating cryptocurrencies like HYPE into this strategy is a departure from the norm and involves establishing new policies and infrastructure. A corporate crypto treasury strategy requires: Clear Investment Thesis: Defining the goals of the crypto allocation (e.g., diversification, long-term growth, inflation hedge). Asset Selection Criteria: Deciding which specific cryptocurrencies to hold and why. Risk Management Framework: Establishing protocols for volatility, security, custody, and regulatory compliance. Custody Solutions: Securing the digital assets through reputable and secure custodians. Accounting and Reporting: Navigating the complex accounting and tax implications of holding volatile digital assets. Eyenovia embarking on this path highlights a potential shift in how companies view and manage their reserves in the digital age. What Are the Potential Benefits for Eyenovia ? The primary potential benefits for Eyenovia from this $50 million crypto investment could include: Potential Capital Appreciation: If Hyperliquid and the HYPE token perform well, the investment could significantly increase the value of Eyenovia’s treasury holdings. Enhanced Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class (crypto often has low correlation with traditional markets) can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk, depending on market conditions. Signaling Innovation: Making such a move could be perceived by investors and the market as the company being forward-thinking and adaptable. However, it’s crucial to consider the flip side. What Are the Risks and Challenges? Investing in cryptocurrencies, especially specific altcoins like HYPE , comes with significant risks: Extreme Volatility: Crypto markets are known for dramatic price swings, which could lead to substantial losses on the invested capital. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential risks related to compliance and future restrictions. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures to protect against hacking, theft, or loss of private keys. Market Risk: The success of the HYPE investment is tied to the performance of the Hyperliquid platform and the broader crypto market. Public Perception: Such an investment might be viewed critically by some stakeholders who prefer more conservative treasury management. Eyenovia will need to carefully manage these risks as part of its new treasury strategy . Is This a Trend? Corporate Adoption of Crypto Investment While still not mainstream, corporate crypto investment in treasury reserves gained prominence with companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla allocating significant portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin. Eyenovia’s move is interesting because it targets a specific DeFi token ( HYPE ) rather than just Bitcoin or Ethereum. This could indicate a potential evolution in corporate crypto adoption, moving beyond just the largest, most established assets to exploring opportunities within specific sectors of the crypto market, like DeFi or specific protocol tokens. However, it remains to be seen if this becomes a widespread trend or remains limited to a few pioneering companies. Other companies exploring crypto or blockchain technology do so for different reasons, such as integrating blockchain into their operations, offering crypto payments, or launching NFTs, rather than just for treasury purposes. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for Eyenovia and HYPE ? For Eyenovia , this $50 million allocation represents a significant portion of capital being exposed to a high-risk, high-reward asset class. The success of this part of their treasury strategy will depend heavily on the performance of the Hyperliquid platform and the broader crypto market conditions. For Hyperliquid and the HYPE token, receiving a $50 million investment from a publicly traded biotech company is a notable validation. It could potentially attract more attention to the platform and its token, although the price impact will ultimately depend on market dynamics and the structure of the investment. Investors in Eyenovia will likely be watching this treasury move closely, evaluating how it impacts the company’s financial stability and growth prospects alongside its core biotech operations. Conclusion: A Bold Step into Digital Assets Eyenovia ‘s decision to invest $50 million into Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) for its treasury strategy is a bold and unconventional step for a biotech firm. It underscores the increasing, albeit cautious, exploration of digital assets by corporations seeking diversification and potential growth beyond traditional financial instruments. While offering exciting potential benefits, this move also highlights the inherent risks associated with crypto investment , including volatility and regulatory uncertainties. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, such corporate treasury decisions will remain a key area to watch, potentially paving the way for broader adoption or serving as a cautionary tale depending on their outcomes.

The US Senate has officially passed the Genius Act, an important stablecoin bill. With a strong 68-30 vote, the bill will now move to the House, where it’s expected to pass quickly before heading to President Trump’s desk for final approval. This new law could reshape the stablecoin market in the US, with clear rules for companies like Circle’s USDC and other dollar-backed digital assets. While crypto enthusiasts are celebrating this progress, it has sparked fresh debate about what it means for other major players like XRP. There is a worry that the rise of regulated, fast, and reliable stablecoins could reduce the need for XRP in cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. However, according to an industry expert, this could actually boost XRP’s utility by giving banks and businesses more ways to move money while still needing a bridge asset like XRP for certain markets and transactions. People think stablecoins reduce XRP's need. Wrong. $27T in Nostro/Vostro accounts could grow to $50T+ because banks won't trust competitors' coins. XRP becomes the neutral bridge. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) June 17, 2025 Currently, there are approximately $27 trillion in Nostro/Vostro accounts, which banks use to settle cross-border payments. The expert said that this number could shoot past $50 trillion because banks are unlikely to trust each other’s stablecoins. And that is where XRP steps in. XRP: The Neutral Bridge XRP’s role becomes vital as a neutral, decentralized bridge asset. Therefore, instead of being replaced, XRP could be relied on as the only neutral asset that banks can trust. This positions it as a key player in global value transfer. A recent post from the Britto community, dedicated to the co-creator of the XRPL, Arthur Britto, also clarified that the view of stablecoins replacing XRP overlooks the key differences between the two. Stablecoins Hold Value, XRP Moves It While stablecoins are digital versions of fiat (like USD or EUR), meant for holding value, not transferring it across systems. For example, sending money from Japan to Mexico using stablecoins is complex. But with XRP, the transfer happens instantly without needing pre-funded accounts. XRP’s decentralized liquidity and speed make it better suited for global transfers, while stablecoins still rely on centralized control. Therefore, even while stablecoins are gaining momentum and regulatory clarity, they will not replace XRP in what it does best – moving value across borders quickly and efficiently.",News|Ripple (XRP)|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 04:51:02

The token now faces increasing pressure at the $2.20 resistance level, with technical indicators showing a sustained downtrend that has yet to reverse. News Background XRP has come under intensified selling pressure amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty. Ongoing U.S.-China trade friction, mixed central bank policy signals, and the fallout from recent ETF rejections have soured sentiment across risk assets. At the same time, traders are closely watching Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin deployment and regional regulatory milestones in Dubai and Singapore — two markets where Ripple’s infrastructure continues to expand. Still, none of these developments have provided near-term lift, with XRP now down nearly 9% for the week. Market observers point to a descending channel forming on the hourly chart — a bearish continuation signal — as volume surged during key resistance tests. Unless buyers can reclaim the $2.20 level, analysts warn that price action could break further toward the $2.10 zone. Price Action The sharpest pressure came during the 15:00–16:00 hour, when volume more than doubled the daily average, cementing resistance around $2.19. A brief recovery attempt later in the session pushed XRP to $2.179, but sellers quickly regained control. A final high-volume drop at 02:01 pushed the price down to $2.162, confirming a lower low and continuing the downtrend. Support has formed around $2.147, with XRP trading in a narrow range near $2.164 as volatility begins to subside. Technical Analysis Recap XRP declined from $2.254 to $2.164, a 4.5% drop. High-volume resistance zone formed around $2.19 during peak activity at 15:00–16:00. Support identified at $2.147 where buyers stepped in repeatedly. Short-lived recovery reached $2.179 before being rejected. Volume spike at 02:01 coincided with 0.8% price drop to $2.162. Immediate resistance now at $2.175; descending channel pattern signals continued bearish pressure. Selling volume has tapered off, suggesting possible stabilization in the near term.

In his June 16 “Macro Monday” update, Olszewicz laid out a broad-based technical and macroeconomic case for why BTC is holding firm near all-time highs, while warning that the market’s resilience is underpinned by a single, fragile macro factor: liquidity. $150K Bitcoin? Only If Powell Doesn’t Pull The Plug “Crypto clearly doesn’t care. Legacy clearly doesn’t care,” Olszewicz said, referring to the continued rally in risk assets despite no rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. “Both of those are mooning without rates coming down.” The key, according to him, lies in the quiet resurgence of global liquidity. While the Fed has not yet pivoted to easing, and markets are pricing near-zero odds of cuts in the June or July FOMC meetings, US and global liquidity metrics have started to turn upward. Olszewicz specifically pointed to reverse repo operations and the Treasury General Account (TGA) as crucial levers. “When reverse repo drains, it helps liquidity. When TGA spends down, it helps liquidity. Right now, neither is doing much, but both are trending in the right direction,” he said. “And that’s enough to keep risk assets buoyant.” Related Reading: Bitcoin To $140,00 In 50 Days? Bitwise Bets On War Rally The current setup, Olszewicz argued, bears little resemblance to the hard tightening regimes of 2018 or 2022. Globally, rate hike cycles are easing or reversing altogether. “It has been liquidity going up,” he emphasized. “If liquidity falls, if rates go up, then I’d expect crypto to have a hard time.” For Bitcoin, which remains pinned near its all-time high, the structure looks increasingly constructive. The trader noted that BTC has so far resisted any meaningful breakdowns and continues to reclaim key technical levels. “We’re hovering at all-time highs. That’s what you want to see,” he said. “You want to see us just continually fight off these sell-offs. It’s not a good look to lose highs quickly.” From a technical standpoint, Olszewicz identified $97,980 as the key downside level to watch if Bitcoin does falter. But on the upside, he sees clear potential for continuation: “I like $122K as a pit stop, and then eventually we’ll settle in probably somewhere in the $150K range if we really get going.” But that path is far from guaranteed. The wildcard in Olszewicz’s framework is US liquidity—a metric he calculates as the Federal Reserve balance sheet minus the TGA and reverse repo. It’s rising, but only modestly. “We are seeing liquidity start to tick up again back to the top of the range,” he said. “Nothing super impressive just yet, but this is very helpful—especially for alts, obviously for BTC, but this is what alts need.” And that’s the catch. If liquidity stalls or reverses—whether due to an unexpected Fed tightening move, a jump in TGA balances around tax deadlines, or a reactivation of reverse repo drains—then the entire crypto rally could be put at risk. “If this goes to zero,” Olszewicz warned about the reverse repo facility, “there may be liquidity issues and then they may have to reinstate QE.” Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge He also flagged August as a critical juncture, with a possible US debt ceiling crunch looming. “Just pay attention to what’s going on going into August, assuming the debt ceiling isn’t raised,” he said. “Higher the debt, higher the deficit, the more investors move to fixed supply assets. That’s better for crypto.” But none of this guarantees a clean move to $150K. As Olszewicz noted, we’re still waiting on one essential domino to fall: inflation stability. While “true inflation” data from independent trackers is hovering in the low 2s, Fed-preferred metrics like CPI and PCE remain volatile. For Powell to act, the data needs to show three to six months of sustained, flatline 2% inflation. “You do not want 2.3 one month, 2.6 the next month, 2.4, 2.8,” Olszewicz said. “You want a stable 2%.” Until then, the Fed is likely to hold firm. But the longer Bitcoin maintains momentum without a rate cut, the more market psychology begins to shift—toward a scenario where easing becomes a bonus, not a prerequisite. “If we’re doing well without rates coming down, why are we rooting for rates to come down?” Olszewicz asked. The answer, for Bitcoin, may come down to just one macro metric: liquidity. If it holds, $150,000 is still very much in play. But if it snaps—so could the cycle. At press time, BTC traded at $105,325.

XRP XRP fell 3.4% to $2.16, Cardano's ADA ADA lost 4%, and ether ETH dropped 2.5% to just over $2,500. Meanwhile, BNB Chain’s BNB BNB slid 0.5%, Solana’s SOL SOL fell 2.6%, while Hyperliquid’s HYPE HYPE dove more than 8%. Broad risk aversion and rising oil prices, triggered by continued military escalation between Israel and Iran, kept traders cautious. The sell-off came as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to eliminate Iran's supreme leader amid the Middle East clash, calling him an ""easy target."" Bitcoin BTC, which has historically traded as both a risk asset and a hedge depending on context, showed little direction despite global tensions and a weakening dollar. “Bitcoin hasn’t acted as a classic risk-on or risk-off asset lately—even as global tensions flare,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro. On-chain data shows long-term holders remain inactive, indicating no widespread profit-taking despite recent gains. “That positioning could reinforce the current consolidation phase before a potential breakout in Q3,” Kuptsikevich added. But beyond the day’s volatility, the market continues to process what may become a structural pivot toward institutional adoption and regulated stablecoin infrastructure. The U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act on Tuesday, a bipartisan bill that provides banks with a regulatory framework for issuing stablecoins backed by Treasury bills and other high-quality liquid assets. The legislation could precede enterprise adoption and normalize stablecoin payments across traditional industries. “The bill can potentially accelerate adoption by enabling American companies across various industries to incorporate stablecoin payment systems for instant transactions or other processes that we see in the DeFi sector,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a Telegram message. The GENIUS Act is being framed by some banks as the most comprehensive and legislation for stablecoins to date, paving the way for tokenized dollars to transition from crypto exchanges into mainstream corporate infrastructure.

As the dust settles, traders are keen to see if the market will rebound or continue to stumble. Stay tuned to discover which three cryptocurrencies are showing potential for significant moves today. NEAR Protocol: Bearish Trends with Key Support and Resistance Levels The past month NEAR shows a 16.36% price drop, while the half-year period reveals a 60.54% decline. The coin struggled to gain traction recently, with consistent pullbacks pushing its price lower. Over six months, the downward trend continued amid strong selling pressure and negative sentiment among investors. Currently, the trading range is $1.97 to $3.14, with immediate support at $1.51 and a further cushion at $0.34. Resistance is at $3.85, with a higher level at $5.02. Bears dominate the market, as indicators suggest a lack of upward momentum. Traders might consider buying near support levels if stabilization occurs or shorting near resistance if selling continues. Monitoring price reactions at these levels is crucial for spotting potential reversals. Curve DAO Token Market Insights Amid Price Adjustments CRV lost around 10.9% in the past month, while the half-year decline reached nearly 36.8%. The coin has shown a consistent downward movement, with a weekly drop of about 13.3%. Price weakness has been evident, reflecting persistent selling pressure. Over the last six months, a trend of lower highs and lower lows has emerged, signaling a market dominated by bearish sentiment. Currently, CRV trades between $0.5803 and $0.8062. Clear support is near $0.4953, with another level around $0.2694, while resistance is at roughly $0.9471 and near $1.173. Bears dominate the market, and momentum remains low, with an RSI reading of 40.505 indicating oversold conditions. Negative signals from the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator bolster the bearish view. Traders may consider buying if prices stabilize above $0.4953, but caution is advised as dips below this level could lead to further declines. Taking profits at the $0.9471 resistance may be a good strategy if price movement reverses. Stacks Price Movements and Key Support Levels Over the past month, Stacks has dropped nearly 24%, while over the last six months, it has declined almost 68%. The price action indicates a steady fall toward lower ranges, with consistent losses over time. This downward movement has shown that initial high price levels have given way to a current bracket of roughly $0.606 to $0.975. The prolonged slide signals ongoing negative sentiment among traders, reflecting a lack of upward momentum during these periods. STX current trading range places the asset between $0.606 and $0.975, with nearby resistance at $1.21 and a secondary resistance level at $1.58. Support is seen near $0.47, with an even lower point at $0.103. Technical indicators show subdued buying strength, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.148 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.021. The Relative Strength Index reads close to 39, reinforcing a bearish environment. A slight bounce above $0.606 allows for cautious trading ideas aimed at testing resistance, while watching for a break beyond $1.21 for a potential trend change. Immediate support remains at $0.47. Conclusion Tuesday brings hopes of a crypto market rally. NEAR Protocol shows strong potential with its recent upgrades. CRV could see significant movement due to increased DeFi interest. STX remains a key player as it continues to innovate with smart contracts. Keeping a close watch on these coins today is crucial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

SOL price is now consolidating losses and might decline further below the $145 level. SOL price started a fresh decline from the $160 resistance zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $155 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $150 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $152 resistance zone. Solana Price Dips Further Solana price failed to continue higher above the $160 level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace and traded below the $155 support level. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $150 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The pair even traded below the $148 level. A low was formed near $145 and the price recently started a consolidation phase. It tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $158 swing high to the $145 low. Solana is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $150 level. The next major resistance is near the $152 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $158 swing high to the $145 low. The main resistance could be $155. A successful close above the $155 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $160. Any more gains might send the price toward the $165 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $152 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $145 zone. The first major support is near the $142 level. A break below the $142 level might send the price toward the $130 zone. If there is a close below the $130 support, the price could decline toward the $125 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $145 and $142.

News Background Tensions between Israel and Iran escalated over the weekend, prompting a swift risk-off reaction in global markets. Crypto was no exception, with DOGE shedding nearly 8% before stabilizing above a key technical floor. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% and continuing to unwind its balance sheet. These macroeconomic headwinds have weighed heavily on altcoins, especially high-beta assets like dogecoin. Despite this, DOGE found support as buying activity returned near the $0.164 level, forming a potential double bottom pattern that some analysts view as a base for consolidation. With volatility cooling and volume declining, the market appears to be waiting for a clearer signal before its next directional move. Price Action The sharpest sell-off came during the 15:00–16:00 window, where DOGE saw nearly 700 million units traded as price dropped below key support. Buyers stepped in at $0.164, lifting DOGE into a range between $0.168 and $0.171. Late-session trading showed price stabilizing above $0.170, with a bullish push at 01:21 sending DOGE to $0.1719 before fading. Price action since has traced a descending triangle with lower highs forming against flat support. Technical Analysis Recap DOGE fell from $0.176 to $0.164, a 6.7% drop, before finding support. Most intense selling hit during 15:00–16:00 with volume nearing 700M. Support formed at $0.164, followed by consolidation between $0.168–$0.171. Bullish push at 01:21 hit $0.1719 but was quickly rejected. Volume declined sharply in the final hours, with most candles under 3M. Descending triangle pattern formed, with resistance at $0.171 and support at $0.1705.

The newly passed GENIUS Act , focused on stablecoins, is being called a turning point for digital finance. The bill got a 51-23 vote across both parties, making it one of the most significant crypto-related wins in Washington so far. Let’s break down what this means. What Is the GENIUS Act All About? The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) lays the groundwork for how stablecoins should be regulated in the United States. In simple terms, the bill makes sure these coins are backed by real money, like U.S. dollars or liquid assets, and sets rules for how big players operate. Any company issuing stablecoins with a market cap above $50 billion will now need annual audits, and foreign issuers will face tighter rules too. Think of it as putting real-world guardrails on digital dollars. Big Companies Face Limits One surprising part? Tech giants like Meta and Amazon will be subject to restrictions unless they meet specific financial and privacy standards. The bill aims to avoid risks that could come from letting huge corporations control massive digital money systems. In fact, stablecoin users now get top legal protection in case the issuing company goes bankrupt, a concept called super-priority status. That means your funds would be first in line to be recovered. Why This Vote Is a Game Changer This is the first time the Senate has passed meaningful legislation on crypto. Lawmakers have tried before but failed due to disagreements. Things changed this time, especially under President Trump, whose administration has openly supported crypto innovation. Experts say the U.S. is now finally catching up with crypto regulation — and even setting itself up as a global leader in this space. What Happens Next? The House of Representatives now has to decide. They could pass their own stablecoin bill, or simply adopt the GENIUS Act. Either way, time is ticking. President Trump wants a stablecoin bill signed before August, and his advisors have already said they would support this one. With the stablecoin market expected to reach $3.7 trillion by the end of the decade, all eyes are now on the House.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 05:16:12

SUI, meanwhile, has already blown up to a $10B market cap and its parabolic window has already closed. With the market in shambles, analysts are pointing towards newly-launched PayFi presale sensation Remittix as the top candidate to mimic Dogecoin’s 2021 chart. Here’s why. Dogecoin price prediction: Miles away from ATH Dogecoin has fallen by a precipitous 24.8% over the past month, now hovering near the lower bound of a symmetrical triangle pattern trading at $0.17 as of writing. Technical indicators suggest that the memecoin is at risk of breaching key structural support, which could confirm a bearish breakout. Should DOGE close decisively below the support line, downside targets emerge at $0.13 and $0.10 as the floor. Conversely, a move above the upper boundary would invalidate the bearish thesis and potentially trigger a rally toward $0.24. Dogecoin prices are on a disastrous 22.8% run in the past month. Source: TradingView SUI crypto price action finding its footing SUI is exhibiting resilience amid broader market volatility. Based on recent SUI crypto price performances, the next-gen L1 blockchain protocol has found strong support at $2.80, even as it trades around the $2.92 mark as at press time. While a 16.5% dip in the last week is nothing to handwave for SUI crypto holders, it appears as though the worst is over for SUI. The asset has recently reclaimed key technical support levels, drawing speculative interest as traders position for macro-driven inflection points. Elevated trading activity underscores latent buyer demand, and with altcoin sentiment cautiously optimistic, SUI remains a viable candidate for accumulation particularly if broader momentum in Layer 1 tokens continues to stabilize. SUI crypto prices took a 16.5% hit in the last week, but appear to have stabilized. Source: TradingView Presale PayFi sensation Remittix could recreate DOGE’s 2021 run Dogecoin and SUI crypto prices are on the downswing and their potential to come even remotely close to Dogecoin’s legendary 2021 rally have long gone. Instead, the smart money knows that low-cap gems with high upside potential like Remittix (RTX) have a better chance of doing so. Remittix is, after all, aiming to reshape the $190 trillion global payments space with a streamlined crypto-to-fiat transfer system. Remittix simplifies international payments by skipping over traditional banking middlemen, cutting down on fees, and offering stablecoin options to reduce currency risk. Its crypto-to-fiat architecture powered by the blockchain ensures that all transactions are secure, trackable and tamper-proof giving users full control over their funds. The project’s structure also inspires confidence: team tokens are locked for three years, zero trading taxes and substantial RTX staking rewards are all on offer. Conclusion Dogecoin and SUI‘s parabolic windows have already slammed shut. While anywhere between a 2x to a 5x run for both big-cap coins are still possible in the future, investors looking for the rare moonshots will be better served buying into presale blue chips like Remittix, which offer greater upside than tokens that already have seen their peaks. Currently available at just $0.0781 per RTX token , Remittix offers big-time potential ROIs at a much lower entry point and a legitimate shot at 100x and beyond if it captures even just a fraction of the trillion-dollar cross-border payments industry.

According to a CNN report , on June 17, the bill cleared the Senate with strong bipartisan support in a 68-30 vote, with 18 Democrats joining most Republicans. Only two Republicans, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, voted against it. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives, where House Majority Whip Tom Emmer has urged the Financial Services Committee to advance stablecoin legislation by the end of July. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, as it is officially known, establishes the first comprehensive federal framework for the issuance of stablecoins. Under the act, only qualified issuers, such as subsidiaries of insured banks or licensed state entities, can issue payment stablecoins. Smaller issuers may function under state supervision, but those with more than $10 billion in circulation will be subject to federal regulation. You might also like: JPMorgan files for JPMD trademark as GENIUS Act heads to vote — is a stablecoin in the works? Along with stringent consumer protections, the bill mandates monthly public reserve disclosures, annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization of more than $50 billion, and 100% reserve backing in U.S. dollars or short-term Treasuries. It prohibits issuers from marketing stablecoins as “FDIC-insured” or backed by the U.S. government. Supporters say the bill will bring much-needed clarity to the crypto space, strengthen the U.S. dollar’s role in digital finance, and protect consumers. Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN), the bill’s sponsor, called it a pivotal moment for U.S. innovation. “This bill will cement U.S. dollar dominance, protect customers, and drive demand for U.S. Treasuries,” Hagerty said on the Senate floor. The bill faced earlier opposition from some Democrats, who were concerned about Donald Trump’s crypto dealings. However, following weeks of negotiations, a revised version of the bill that included stronger national security, ethics, and anti-money laundering protections won over important Democratic caucus members. If passed by the House, the GENIUS Act would create the first comprehensive federal rules for stablecoins, potentially positioning the U.S. as a leader in the global digital asset economy.

Coinbase is seeking regulatory approval to offer tokenized stock trading to US users, while JPMorgan is piloting its new deposit token, JPMD, on Coinbase’s Base network. Together, these efforts signal growing institutional interest in using blockchain infrastructure for mainstream financial products like equities and dollar-based payments. Coinbase Eyes SEC Green Light to Launch Tokenized Stock Trading in the US Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, is reportedly preparing to take a major step toward bridging traditional financial markets with blockchain technology. The company is seeking regulatory approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer tokenized stock trading to its user base, according to a report published by Reuters on Tuesday. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, said the initiative to launch “tokenized equities” is a “huge priority” for the company. The move, if approved, could enable Coinbase users to buy and sell blockchain-based representations of publicly traded stocks — such as Apple or Tesla — in a fractionalized, 24/7 trading format. Grewal did not disclose whether a formal request had already been submitted to the SEC, but the tone suggests Coinbase is actively engaged in discussions with regulators. Tokenized Equities: A Growing but Restricted Market Tokenized stocks, which mimic real shares but exist on blockchain rails, have gained momentum globally but remain restricted within the US due to securities laws. While companies like Kraken have announced plans to offer tokenized US stock trading to non-residents, US investors have been left out of the innovation wave due to regulatory uncertainty. Coinbase’s push for approval could change that narrative, paving the way for a new asset class to enter the American retail and institutional investment landscape. Should the SEC be amenable, Coinbase would likely receive a “no-action letter,” a formal notice that the agency does not intend to pursue enforcement actions against the firm. Such a letter would not equate to full regulatory endorsement but would provide Coinbase with enough assurance to move forward cautiously. Coinbase’s effort comes at a time when the US crypto regulatory environment appears to be softening. Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, digital asset firms have expressed renewed optimism about policy direction and enforcement leniency. That optimism was bolstered in February, when the SEC dropped its 2023 enforcement action against Coinbase — a lawsuit that had loomed large over the company’s operations and growth plans. With a more receptive political climate and mounting institutional interest in blockchain-based financial products, Coinbase seems poised to push forward aggressively on product diversification and global expansion. While Coinbase eyes tokenized equities in the US, it is also making significant strides abroad. The company is reportedly on track to receive a license to operate across the European Union under the bloc’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, a landmark framework designed to harmonize crypto rules across all 27 EU member states. However, Coinbase is not without its challenges. The firm is currently under scrutiny following reports that cybercriminals bribed some of its customer support agents based outside the United States. This alleged breach reportedly led to phishing attempts targeting user data , raising serious questions about operational security and risk management. COIN Price Movement and Market Outlook Shares of Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) were trading at $253.85 at the time of publication, reflecting a 2.95% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite the dip, the stock has performed strongly in recent months and secured a notable milestone in May by joining the S&P 500 index — the first crypto-native company to do so. Coinbase share price (Source: Google Finance ) The potential launch of tokenized equity trading could provide a new revenue stream for Coinbase, especially as trading volumes in the crypto market remain volatile. It would also bring the firm into more direct competition with fintech players like Robinhood, which already offer traditional equities alongside crypto. If successful, Coinbase’s foray into tokenized stocks could reshape how Americans access and interact with equities. Blockchain-based equities promise near-instant settlement, lower transaction fees, and fractional ownership — all attributes that appeal to younger, tech-savvy investors. Moreover, the move could catalyze wider adoption of tokenized financial instruments, particularly if regulators view Coinbase’s efforts as a compliant blueprint for others in the space. JPMorgan Launches JPMD Deposit Token on Coinbase’s Base Network in Groundbreaking Blockchain Pilot Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase has launched a pilot program for its newly trademarked deposit token, JPMD. The pilot will run on Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer-2 network, Base — a choice that reinforces Base’s growing dominance in the Layer-2 scaling ecosystem. The pilot was confirmed by Naveen Mallela, an executive at Kinexys, JPMorgan’s blockchain division, in a statement to Bloomberg . Mallela revealed that a fixed supply of JPMD tokens will be transferred to Coinbase in the coming days, marking a pivotal step in JPMorgan’s broader strategy to modernize banking infrastructure through blockchain-powered solutions. The transaction will be conducted in US dollars and will take place on the Base network, which was launched by Coinbase in 2023 and has since become the most widely adopted Ethereum Layer-2 solution by total value locked (TVL), according to data from CoinGecko and DefiLlama. With transaction throughput recently nearing 1,000 transactions per second — putting it in competition with high-speed networks like Solana — Base is seen as a highly capable infrastructure for scalable, low-cost institutional settlements. Base’s total value locked (TVL) has more than doubled over the past year (Source: DefiLlama ) Following the pilot phase, JPMorgan plans to offer JPMD to Coinbase’s institutional clients for on-chain transactions and payments, broadening the use case for tokenized bank liabilities in decentralized ecosystems. Deposit Tokens vs. Stablecoins: A Strategic Bet Unlike stablecoins, which are typically issued by fintech or crypto firms and backed by fiat reserves held off-chain, deposit tokens are on-chain representations of actual deposits held at regulated banks. Mallela emphasized that deposit tokens like JPMD present a “superior alternative to stablecoins” from an institutional perspective, largely because they operate within the regulated banking ecosystem and are designed to be scalable. “From an institutional standpoint, deposit tokens are a superior alternative to stablecoins,” Mallela said. “They are more scalable due to their fractional reserve structure and may eventually offer yield.” This possibility of yield generation marks a significant departure from most stablecoins, which generally do not bear interest. Should JPMD eventually offer returns, it could provide a compelling incentive for institutional capital to migrate from stablecoins to bank-issued digital assets. The timing of JPMorgan’s pilot also coincides with a growing debate within the financial sector over the potential disruption posed by yield-bearing stablecoins . NYU professor and financial consultant Austin Campbell recently suggested that the US banking industry is ”panicking” over the growing appeal of stablecoins that offer yield, warning that they could undermine the traditional banking model by draining retail deposits and offering superior alternatives to savings accounts. Campbell’s comments reflect broader concerns among banking executives that decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital asset innovations may erode the monopoly banks have long held over the issuance and utility of fiat-denominated money. Nevertheless, deposit tokens like JPMD represent a potential compromise between decentralization and traditional finance, allowing regulated institutions to harness blockchain innovation without ceding control over monetary infrastructure. A Broader Blockchain Vision JPMorgan’s blockchain ambitions extend well beyond JPMD. The company has invested heavily in its Onyx division, which has already deployed JPM Coin for internal settlements and launched various pilot programs involving tokenized assets, repo transactions, and programmable payments. The introduction of JPMD — now backed by a formal trademark filing that covers a wide range of crypto-related services, including trading, payment processing, and digital wallet integration — further cements JPMorgan’s status as a frontrunner in institutional blockchain adoption. While this specific pilot focuses on USD-denominated transfers, Mallela confirmed that additional currencies are on the roadmap, subject to global regulatory compliance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-18 05:30:00

According to a June 17 press release from Eyenovia, Inc., a U.S.-based ophthalmic technology firm, the company has secured $50 million in private equity financing to accumulate over 1 million Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) tokens. With this move, Eyenovia becomes the first publicly traded U.S. company to hold HYPE in its treasury and operate as a Hyperliquid blockchain validator. The funding deal includes convertible preferred shares and warrants, which could raise up to $150 million if fully exercised. Alongside the announcement, Eyenovia named Hyunsu Jung as chief investment officer and board member to oversee the new digital asset strategy. “We’re pleased to join the growing number of companies adopting cryptocurrency treasury strategies,” said chief executive officer Michael Rowe. “We believe this move supports long-term capital appreciation and shareholder value.” You might also like: Can Hyperliquid rise to $50 in June? Jung called HYPE “the most robust digital asset,” citing Hyperliquid’s rapid growth and leading onchain revenue. HYPE ranks as the 12th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, having surged 380% from its April low to an all-time high of $45.57 on June 16. At press time, HYPE is trading at $40.24, down 11% from its peak. Hyperliquid, a high-speed Layer 1 blockchain optimized for perpetuals trading, has seen a wave of adoption. In the past 30 days, it has accounted for 60% of the total onchain perps volume, according to data from a Dune Analytics dashboard. Monthly perps volume has topped $250 billion, making it a strong competitor to centralized exchanges such as Binance. Eyenovia plans to execute a staking strategy with its HYPE holdings and use Anchorage Digital to secure its assets. In addition, the company will rebrand to “Hyperion DeFi” and change its ticker symbol to HYPD. Eyenovia will keep working on its flagship Optejet eye treatment device, which is expected to receive FDA registration by September, while branching out into cryptocurrency. If other public companies follow Eyenovia’s lead, Hyperliquid could see a sharp increase in token demand and network effects, potentially positioning it as a top 10 blockchain by market capitalization.

Hostilities between Israel and Iran have persisted, entering its sixth day of attacks on each other’s territories, despite a call from U.S. President Donald Trump for Tehran's unconditional surrender and threatening a potential strike against Supreme Leader Khamenei in a series of posts on Truth Social. Meanwhile, in the U.S., investors are gearing up for the Federal Reserve’s policy decision later in the day. Gold edged lower to around $3,380 per ounce on Wednesday, amid escalating geopolitical tensions. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.75% to above 38,600, while the broader Topix Index also added 0.2% to 2,792 on Wednesday. The Japanese yen held around 145.2 per dollar on Wednesday after falling for three straight sessions, as a series of disappointing economic indicators weighed on sentiment. Japan's trade deficit decreased significantly to JPY 637.61 billion in May 2025 from JPY 1,225.17 billion in the same month last year, beating market expectations of a JPY 893 billion gap, as exports fell in May for the first time in eight months amid US tariff pressure, while imports dropped more than expected. Separate data showed, Japan’s core machinery orders—excluding volatile items such as ships and electric power—fell 9.1% month-over-month to ¥919 billion in April 2025, marking a sharp reversal from March’s 13% surge. The Reuters Tankan index for Japanese manufacturers dropped to +6 in June 2025, marking a second consecutive monthly decline after readings of +9 in April and +8 in May. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.11% to around 3,384, while the Shenzhen Component slipped 0.2% to 10,130 on Wednesday, extending losses from the previous session as investors turned cautious ahead of the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai today, and the offshore yuan steadied around 7.18 per dollar on Wednesday, as investors turned their attention to the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai. Three major Chinese financial regulators—the People's Bank of China, the National Financial Regulatory Administration, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission—are jointly organizing the event with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Investors are keenly awaiting significant financial policy announcements. On the monetary policy front, investors are focused on the PBoC's upcoming policy decision. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.09% to 23,713 in early Wednesday trading, extending losses for the second day amid broad-based sector declines. At the Lujiazui Forum, Hong Kong and Shanghai are poised to ink a deal deepening financial cooperation, aiming to strengthen ties and resilience amid rising geopolitical tensions. Hong Kong’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate hit a two-year high of 3.5% in the three months ending May, due to some headwinds including shifts in consumption patterns. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.05% to 81,741 in Wednesday morning trade, recovering losses from the previous session. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.14% to around 8,520 on Wednesday, marking its second straight session of losses. The Australian dollar strengthened to around $0.649 on Wednesday, recouping some losses from the previous session. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Economic Index for Australia edged down 0.1% in May 2025, after a flat reading in the previous month. Domestically, attention turns to Thursday’s labor market data, which could provide fresh momentum to the economy and influence the RBA’s policy outlook. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended lower as investors closely monitored escalating tensions in the Middle East, with the Israel-Iran conflict entering its fifth day. Traders are also monitoring upcoming US housing data and weekly jobless claims, both due ahead of Thursday’s market holiday.

The decision to open public proceedings is a big step toward potential approval, especially in light of the SEC’s shifting posture under the Trump administration and Chair Paul Atkins. Meanwhile, crypto infrastructure company Fairmint is pushing for modernization in private equity markets with a detailed proposal to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. The proposal called for blockchain-based settlement systems, investor self-custody, and the creation of a regulated DeFi sandbox. At the same time, Gemini Trust launched a scathing rebuke of the CFTC, accusing the agency of pursuing false charges based on a discredited whistleblower report. The letter shed some light on the still ongoing tension between regulatory bodies and crypto firms. XRP and Solana ETFs Gain Momentum The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated public comment periods for two proposed crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from asset management firm Franklin Templeton. The firm wants to list the funds on the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s BZX platform. The ETFs in question are the Franklin XRP ETF and the Franklin Solana ETF. The move follows a proposed rule change that was submitted by the Cboe BZX Exchange in March, which the SEC initially delayed in April before taking further action this week. (Source: SEC ) While the SEC has yet to make a decision, the institution of proceedings is a key regulatory step in the process and indicates that the agency is now formally considering public input on the matter. In its notice, the Commission explained that opening the proceedings does not imply any final stance on the ETFs, and instead seeks to encourage feedback from the public and industry stakeholders. Once the notice is published in the Federal Register, the SEC will have 35 additional days to reach a verdict. This then pushes the new deadline into July. Franklin Templeton is not alone in its ambitions. Other firms including Bitwise, ProShares, and 21Shares also filed to launch ETFs tied to altcoins like XRP and Solana. Though the SEC already approved spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, it has not yet done so for other major cryptocurrencies. These filings were made at a time when the SEC is reportedly adopting a more lenient stance toward digital assets under the Trump administration and its appointed chair, Paul Atkins. This includes the withdrawal of several high-profile enforcement actions against crypto companies. Whether this relaxed regulatory climate will pave the way for ETFs tied to tokens like XRP and Solana is still uncertain. However, the interest in these products appears to be growing, particularly with political support mounting. Fairmint Pushes SEC to Modernize Private Equity Meanwhile, crypto-native companies are stepping up efforts to shape the future of digital asset regulation, and transfer agent Fairmint recently submitted a comprehensive proposal to the US SEC’s Crypto Task Force. Addressed to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce, the seven-part proposal advocates for overhauling what Fairmint describes as outdated and inefficient back-end infrastructure used in private securities administration. (Source: Fairmint ) The proposal calls for standardized infrastructure to allow interoperability between transfer agents, the use of blockchain for real-time regulatory visibility, and enabling investor self-custody while still maintaining compliance controls. Fairmint also urged a move away from traditional wealth-based investor accreditation standards, and suggested a knowledge-based approach instead. Another key point includes the creation of a regulated decentralized finance (DeFi) sandbox to encourage more responsible innovation in US markets. The initiative reflects the broader frustration in the private equity space, where large companies continue to rely on spreadsheet software lacking built-in settlement mechanisms. In contrast, public companies have access to more sophisticated, regulated infrastructure. Fairmint’s CEO, Joris Delanoue, criticized the current system by pointing out that billion-dollar cap tables are still being managed in Excel, which leads to inefficiencies and compliance risks. The global private equity market was valued at $5.3 trillion in 2023 and projected to reach $6 trillion by the end of 2024. It represents a massive opportunity for digital transformation. Fairmint’s client list includes many well known players like wallet infrastructure provider Privy and social networking platform Bloom Network. Meanwhile, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force has been actively engaging with the industry, and hosted two recent roundtables to gather input on tokenization and decentralized finance. These discussions align with emerging trends in financial markets, as firms like Robinhood are exploring blockchain technology to tokenize traditional financial instruments. Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev recently stated that tokenizing both public and private equities is a key part of the company’s roadmap, particularly as it expands services to European investors. Tokenized stocks market overview (Source: RWA.xyz ) Gemini Blasts CFTC Over False Charges In other regulation-related news, Gemini Trust accused the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of pursuing baseless charges against the crypto exchange in 2022 to boost the careers of its litigators. In a letter that was sent to CFTC Inspector General Christopher Skinner, Gemini alleged that the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement relied on a flawed whistleblower report to bring false charges related to the company’s proposed Bitcoin futures contract. According to Gemini, the charges were based on a submission from Benjamin Small, the firm’s former operating chief, who was dismissed in 2017 for allegedly concealing losses from a rebate fraud scheme involving several trading entities and executives. Part of Gemini’s letter that was sent to the CFTC The exchange argued that Small was motivated by personal grievance after his termination, and started a malicious campaign against Gemini by submitting a whistleblower report riddled with falsehoods. Gemini claimed that Small’s accusations, including that the exchange failed to disclose the susceptibility of its futures product to market manipulation, were taken at face value by CFTC staff, prompting a multi-year investigation. The agency eventually sued Gemini in June of 2022 for making false or misleading statements during its 2017 application process for launching the Bitcoin futures contract. Gemini settled the case with a $5 million fine in January of 2025, without admitting or denying the charges, saying at the time that it had no viable alternative. Gemini now argues that the Bitcoin futures contract in question ran smoothly for 19 months and was never linked to any manipulation, which completely undermines the CFTC’s original claims. The exchange also accused the Division of Enforcement of selectively weaponizing the Commodity Exchange Act to manufacture a high-profile enforcement action. The letter credited acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham with taking constructive steps to reform the enforcement division. Gemini concluded its letter by urging the CFTC to commit to long-term reforms to prevent future misuse of authority and pledged to support the agency’s efforts to improve its internal practices.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-18 05:37:16

The CME Group's FedWatch tool indicates that the central bank is again likely to hold ground and keep interest rates unchanged in the range of 4.25%-4.50% despite President Donald Trump's repeated demands for lower borrowing costs. The rate decision, therefore, is a foregone conclusion and crypto traders are likely to focus on the interest rate dot plot – the graphical representation that records each Fed official's projections for interest rates. ""With rates expected to stay on hold, traders are focused on the dot‑plot: fewer than two projected cuts would harden the higher‑for‑longer narrative; a dovish surprise would lighten the dollar and could unfreeze crypto's bid. Until then, patience rules,"" crypto trading and market-making firm XBTO said. A hawkish dot plot, suggesting fewer rate cuts, could put pressure on bitcoin and the broader crypto market. BTC's rally has already stalled above $100,000, with geopolitical tensions in the Middle East adding to the trade war-led inflation uncertainty. ""During 2025, expectations for rate cuts have already declined sharply, from an initial 100 basis points to just 50 basis points currently. This revision is driven by a resilient labor market and inflation that, while moderated, remains above the 2% target. A prolonged conflict in the Middle East could further reduce anticipated cuts to just 25 basis points,"" Matteo Greco, senior analyst at Fineqia, said in an email. While the hawkish Fed could breed downside volatility in bitcoin, it will likely worsen the U.S. fiscal situation by adding to the nation's debt servicing costs and thereby strengthening the long-term appeal of assets like gold and bitcoin.",Markets|Bitcoin|Federal Reserve|Markets|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-18 05:37:56

The bill, officially titled the Guaranteed E-Money Innovation and US Dollar Security (GENIUS) Act, received support from both sides of the political aisle — with several Democrats joining Republicans to push it through. It now heads to the House, where expectations are high for swift approval, and eventually to President Trump’s desk for signature. Industry experts are now suggesting portfolio frameworks built around assets that directly support or benefit from the growing stablecoin and payment infrastructure. What This Means for Crypto Portfolios As stablecoins secure a regulatory green light, crypto investors are already adjusting their strategies to tap into this fast-growing sector. On The Paul Barron Network, the analyst advised a fresh portfolio approach centered around assets tied to payment infrastructure and stablecoin ecosystems. In this updated model: Ethereum (ETH) would hold the largest share at 50%, since it remains the primary network for stablecoin transactions and decentralized finance activity. Solana (SOL) follows with 25%, capitalizing on its rapid adoption in retail payment platforms. XRP takes a 10% allocation, with potential to expand its utility in point-of-sale transactions alongside its established banking use case. Layer-2 solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon collectively account for around 9%, providing scalable, low-cost infrastructure for stablecoin-based payments. Stellar (XLM), long a staple for cross-border transfers, is recommended at 2.5%, especially as it gains momentum with PayPal-backed payment integrations. A final portion is reserved for emerging growth chains like Avalanche (AVAX), Sui (SUI), and Aptos (APT), which could capture market share as the payment and stablecoin narrative accelerates. The Payment Boom Is Here Experts say the passing of the GENIUS Act and rising money market yields have sparked a wave of investor interest in payment-focused crypto projects.

Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

With excitement brewing, investors are asking: when will XRP hit its peak, and is now the time to act? Meanwhile, a rising new crypto project is stepping up, tackling payment solutions that XRP has yet to fully solve. Before placing your next bet, here’s the latest insight into XRP’s outlook and a project that may soon rival it in real-world use. XRP Forecast: Could $27 Be Next in Line? Although XRP has remained under $3, many analysts believe it could hit $27 if a spot ETF goes live. The SEC’s new leadership seems more open to crypto, and Polymarket currently places ETF approval odds at 87%. Ripple is also pushing forward, with global deals and a strong U.S. strategy. CEO Brad Garlinghouse says resolving the SEC lawsuit could be the catalyst for a massive price surge. Still, competitors like Circle are gaining speed, posing a real challenge. Reaching $27 would give XRP a $1.9 trillion market cap, a bold target. Even after a 350% gain this year, future growth depends on regulatory progress more than market sentiment. A Utility-First Exchange With Real Use Cases While XRP tackles legal roadblocks, another contender is building quietly an exchange designed to list real crypto projects, especially meme coins, with no fees. It aims to remove the hassle and cost of getting listed, allowing broader participation. The platform includes bridge features for easy swaps across different chains, plus a crypto-to-fiat payment system that simplifies real-world transactions. With over $5 million raised and a working demo exchange about to go live, this project is proving it’s more than hype.

The token has dropped over 3% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.5605, with technical charts showing a neutral-to-bearish trend. Bearish Trend Continues The RSI and Stochastic remain neutral, showing no strong direction on either side. Although it appears to be under pressure, there are a few signs that it might be trying to hold its ground for now. Since May 21, Pi has been stuck in a bearish trap. The pattern, marked by lower highs, indicates that sellers are dominating the market and buyers are struggling to push back. If the bearish trend continues, Pi could retest its all-time low of $0.40 or even fall further. But if the buying interest picks up, it could bounce back toward the $0.65 level. Pi Could Soon Crash to $0.40! Yesterday, on June 17th, the token dropped 11%, hitting a low of $0.5311. This drop began after the team announced that .pi domain auctions would be moved to a separate section from the main mining feature, which failed to excite the users. Over the past two days, Pi has slid from $0.6345 to around $0.5450. We might still see Pi drop to around $0.40, especially if there's no major update on June 28th! @PiCoreTeam @nkokkalis @Chengdiao pic.twitter.com/DSbrChUEzN — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) June 17, 2025 Dr Altcoin warns that Pi coin could crash to $0.40 if there is no major update on June 28th.

According to Piscan.io, 164.49 million PI will be released in June, followed by 249.05 million in July, which is far above the monthly average of 136.61 million. Altcoin Season Is Key to Pi’s Next Breakout Another analyst says that Pi’s price rise depends on a broader shift in the crypto market. For altcoins like Pi to rally, Bitcoin must first break its all-time high, followed by Ethereum gaining strength, which could trigger the altcoin season.

Speaking at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai on Wednesday, People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng said Beijing will establish an international operations centre for e-CNY in the city, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The move is aimed at supporting the digital yuan’s expansion overseas and deepening its role in global transactions. China to Roll Out Yuan Futures as Part of Bid to Reshape Global Currency Order Alongside the digital yuan push, Pan said China would speed up plans to launch yuan futures trading in Shanghai. This, he explained, would give investors new tools to hedge against currency risk. The broader goal, he explained, is to build a “multi-polar international monetary system.” In this system, multiple sovereign currencies would coexist. Moreover, they would provide mutual checks and balances. People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng laid out in the clearest terms yet his vision for the future of a new global currency order after decades of dollar dominance, predicting a more competitive system will take root in the years to come https://t.co/9zChzN9KRR — Bloomberg (@business) June 18, 2025 He added that such a system could reduce reliance on the US dollar and foster greater regional currency leadership. Trump Backs Crypto as Strategic Move to Counter China’s Financial Rise Pan’s remarks come at a time when confidence in the dollar has been shaken by President Donald Trump’s unpredictable foreign and trade policies since returning to office. The instability has led some investors to reduce their dollar holdings. It has also prompted US exporters to look for alternative settlement options, including the yuan. In May, Trump reiterated his support for cryptocurrencies. He framed them as essential to maintaining US leadership in emerging technologies. He said his support stems from a desire to stop China from gaining control over the future of finance, declaring, “I’m a big fan of crypto because I want to keep it away from China.” China Seeks Global Digital Yuan Role as Pan Warns of Politicised Payment Systems China has spent years trying to internationalise the yuan, part of President Xi Jinping’s broader effort to elevate China’s influence in global finance. The digital yuan, already tested through domestic pilot programs, is central to that strategy. Pan said new technologies have revealed flaws in traditional cross-border payment systems. He described them as inefficient and increasingly exposed to geopolitical risk. “Traditional cross-border payment infrastructures can be easily politicised and weaponised, and used as a tool for unilateral sanctions,” he warned, arguing that the current model undermines the global economic and financial order. He also raised the idea of promoting special drawing rights, or SDRs, issued by the International Monetary Fund. He suggested they could serve as a “super-sovereign” alternative. However, he acknowledged that global consensus remains weak. Moreover, SDRs are mostly used during crises and are not a regular tool for international settlement. “The situation where a single sovereign currency dominates cross-border payment is changing gradually,” Pan said, predicting a more competitive and balanced currency landscape in the years ahead.

It also imposes limitations on algorithmic stablecoins and those without full backing. NEW: The GENIUS Act has officially passed the Senate.

As of the time of writing, BTC is priced at approximately $105,756, reflecting a 1% drop in the past 24 hours and a 5.4% decline from its record peak of over $111,000 reached last month. The asset has been consolidating within this band for several weeks, with no clear breakout yet in sight, indicating a moment of uncertainty or possible transition in market direction. A CryptoQuany analyst known as Gaah has offered insights into this phase of the cycle. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge Bitcoin IBCI Suggests Cycle Is Ongoing, Not Exhausted Gaah recently published an analysis on the QuickTake platform, focusing on Bitcoin’s IBCI (Index Bitcoin Cycle Indicators). According to the post, the IBCI surged above 75% earlier this year during Bitcoin’s rally from late 2023 to early 2024, entering what’s known as the “distribution region.” Following the correction in BTC price, the IBCI has now leveled around the 50% mark, traditionally viewed as a neutral zone that often precedes major trend changes. The IBCI’s current position, according to Gaah, may signal a transitional point in the ongoing market cycle. Historically, when the indicator stabilizes in the mid-range, it often reflects the end of a market pullback and the potential beginning of a new upward phase. Gaah noted that over the past decade, Bitcoin’s bullish phases typically concluded only when the IBCI reached and remained in the 100% zone. As this condition has not yet been met, the present consolidation could be laying the groundwork for another leg up, contingent on supportive on-chain metrics and broader ecosystem momentum. The analyst also suggested that the lack of extreme sentiment, whether bullish or bearish, reinforces the view that the market is still evolving rather than nearing a peak. Suppose BTC price manages to push higher while the IBCI trends back toward the 75%–100 % region. In that case, it may indicate a return to the distribution zone and a continuation of the current bull cycle. Exchange Activity Remains Subdued as Retail Interest Stalls In a separate analysis shared on CryptoQuant by another contributor, caueconomy, recent trends in trading activity were examined. Despite Bitcoin trading near historical highs, spot volume across centralized exchanges has dropped to multi-year lows. While the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs has shifted some volume away from exchanges, the data also reflects limited retail engagement, especially with altcoins. This pattern suggests that current market participation is more aligned with institutional players or long-term holders, rather than speculative retail traders. Caueconomy concluded that these subdued volumes are not typical of euphoric market phases. Instead, they indicate a more measured participation in the market, which may delay the formation of a local top. However, should there be a renewed surge in trading activity, especially from retail investors, it could serve as a signal of a maturing cycle or the onset of another significant price move.

While the cryptocurrency market continues its evolution, other tech domains are also seeing substantial growth and strategic shifts. One such story comes from Sword Health , an AI-powered digital health startup that has just announced a major funding round, highlighting the robust investment landscape for promising tech ventures. Sword Health Secures Significant Venture Capital Sword Health has successfully closed a $40 million funding round, pushing its valuation to an impressive $4 billion. This represents a 33% increase from its $3 billion valuation just one year prior. The funding round was spearheaded by returning investor, General Catalyst, indicating strong continued confidence in the company’s trajectory. Despite being cash-flow positive, the company’s CEO and founder, Virgílio Bento, explained his rationale for raising additional capital. The primary drivers were to update the company’s valuation and to build a war chest for potential strategic acquisitions. This move underscores a proactive approach to growth and market positioning, even from a financially healthy standpoint. Digital Health IPO Plans Take a Backseat Originally, Sword Health had considered a potential IPO as early as 2025. However, despite the recent successful public offerings from peers like Hinge Health and Omada, and Sword’s own healthy $240 million annual revenue run rate, Bento is now reconsidering the timeline. He stated that the IPO would happen “much later than everyone expects,” potentially pushing the date out to 2028 or beyond. Bento’s decision stems from an “educational journey” into the world of public companies. After speaking with numerous public company CEOs and bankers, he found compelling reasons *not* to rush into an IPO. He noted that he could easily list ten reasons against going public but struggled to find one compelling reason in favor of it currently. Expanding the Vision for AI Health A core part of Sword Health’s strategy involves expanding the capabilities of its AI care specialist, Phoenix. Initially focused on virtual physical therapy, the company has already grown to include pelvic health and mental health services. Bento’s ambition is for Phoenix to extend remote healthcare support to a much wider array of conditions. Future expansion areas include cardiovascular care, gastroenterological health, and speech therapy, among others. Bento emphasized the need for “lots of different proof points at scale in many different care verticals” before considering an IPO. This focus on deep, multi-vertical expansion via AI health is a key driver behind the delayed public offering. Why Venture Capital Remains Attractive Bento isn’t swayed by typical reasons cited for IPOs, such as brand building or access to capital. He points to successful private companies like Ikea and Lego as examples of strong brands built without going public. He also highlighted that robust startups can still secure substantial private funding, citing Databricks’ massive $10 billion raise as evidence. Furthermore, liquidity for employees and early shareholders, often a major driver for IPOs, is increasingly available through secondary markets for private companies. Bento indicated that Sword Health plans to launch a tender offer next month to provide liquidity options. This demonstrates that the benefits traditionally associated with public markets are becoming accessible in the private sphere. Predicting Future Investment Rounds Looking ahead, Bento is already anticipating the company’s next funding round. He predicts Sword Health will raise more capital next year, projecting a potential $50 million round at a $5 billion valuation. He humorously noted his fondness for the “numerical symmetry” in their funding progression ($30M at $3B, $40M at $4B, predicting $50M at $5B). The latest $40 million round brings Sword Health’s total funding raised to $380 million. Beyond General Catalyst, other investors participating in this round included Khosla Ventures, Comcast Ventures, Lince Capital, Oxy Capital, Armilar, Indico Capital, and Shilling, showcasing broad investor confidence in the company’s mission and growth potential. Sword Health ‘s decision to secure significant venture capital and delay its IPO plans underscores a strategic choice to prioritize deep product expansion and market validation across multiple health verticals before facing public scrutiny. This approach allows them to leverage private funding and flexibility to build a more comprehensive and robust AI health platform, aiming for long-term, sustainable growth.

The allocation depends on the client’s “risk appetite”, says Philippe Meyer, head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland. Speaking at the DigiAssets conference in London, the banker told Reuters that they allow up to 7% of portfolio in crypto for riskier profiles. “With private customers, since September last year, we started advising on bitcoin,” Meyer noted. In March, BBVA received approval from the country’s securities regulator to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading services in Spain. Spanish lending giant BBVA said it won approval to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading, integrating crypto into everyday banking. #BBVA #CryptoTrading https://t.co/ifB7FxuUV8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Notably, the bank has been considering clients’ requests to buy crypto since 2021. Meyer believes that it has become one of the first large global banks to advise wealthy clients to buy Bitcoin. Recently, JPMorgan said that it is finally allowing clients to buy Bitcoin . “We are going to allow you to buy it,” CEO Jamie Dimon said. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” However, it is unusual for lenders to advise clients to buy crypto. 95% of EU Banks Don’t Engage in Crypto: ESMA The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has repeatedly warned about the risks of crypto and said that the sector needed continued close monitoring. Further, the watchdog noted that 95% of EU banks do not engage in crypto activities. “Since 2025, we have been actively monitoring potential risks crypto assets could represent to financial stability,” ESMA noted. According to Meyer, BBVA currently advises clients to add only Bitcoin or Ether, with plans to add other cryptos later this year. Further, introducing 3% of the portfolio to crypto would’t be a huge risk, he added. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, if you introduce 3% you already boost the performance.” Mainstream Crypto Adoption Enables Institutions to Enter the $3.2T Industry According to Gadi Chait, Investment Manager at Xapo Bank, a crypto custodian, crypto’s increased legitimacy in the eyes of policymakers and rising retail adoption, fueled by genuine use cases, rather than price speculation, have encouraged recent adoption among banks. “Traditional finance is slowly waking up to crypto’s call and is vying for a piece of the pie,” he told Cryptonews. Additionally, Bitcoin’s surge to over $100,000 and the promise of pro-crypto policies attracted institutional interest and strengthened Bitcoin’s future, he said. “Globally, positive signals from countries like the UK, Japan, and Switzerland—around licensing and oversight—validate the asset class on a wider scale,” he added. Besides, the adoption of cryptocurrencies has seen remarkable growth in Spain recently. Per a 2024 survey by the European Central Bank (ECB), 9% of the Spanish population owns crypto assets, up from 4% in 2022. Further, Spain reached nearly $80 billion in cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2024, Chainalysis data noted.

The tweet, which reads “XRPL —> SWIFT via Gatehub Confirmed,” points to a functional link that has long been speculated within the digital asset ecosystem. The statement was accompanied by two images: one depicting a technical diagram from a Purdue University research publication showing GateHub as a node in a Ripple credit network, and another showing a partnership announcement between XRPL Labs and GateHub. This development adds clarity to GateHub’s role in enabling interoperability between fiat and cryptocurrency through the XRPL. XRPL —> SWIFT via Gatehub Confirmed. https://t.co/TVjZYKMVng pic.twitter.com/kOpFZ6cRs3 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 16, 2025 GateHub’s Role in XRP Ledger Interoperability GateHub, one of the early gateways built on the XRP Ledger, has expanded its utility by supporting transfers across major networks, including SEPA, SWIFT, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. This infrastructure enables users to send and receive fiat currencies directly through XRPL wallets, providing real-world liquidity pathways. According to the announcement published on GateHub’s website, the collaboration with XRPL Labs (developers of Xumm) facilitates on and off-ramping for 14 assets. This positions XRPL as a central settlement layer that interfaces directly with global financial networks. Ripple CEO Highlights XRPL’s Competitive Edge This update comes shortly after comments made by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse at the 2025 XRPL Apex event in Singapore. During the event, Garlinghouse projected that the XRPL could handle up to 14% of SWIFT’s global transaction volume within the next five years. He argued that the future of cross-border payments depends less on messaging protocols and more on actual liquidity movement. Garlinghouse asserted that XRP is designed to provide exactly this, citing its speed and utility in facilitating real-time settlement. He emphasized that while SWIFT is a messaging layer, XRPL, coupled with XRP, functions as a liquidity and settlement layer. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical Basis and On-Chain Evidence Garlinghouse’s remarks were made during a Q&A session where Ripple CTO David Schwartz was also present. The CEO reiterated that XRP was created to improve upon legacy systems, which are often slow, expensive, and opaque. He noted that XRPL can support real-time gross settlement, foreign exchange, and remittance functionalities on-chain. The new developments involving GateHub now illustrate a tangible connection between the XRP ecosystem and SWIFT-compatible operations. The technical image shared by SMQKE shows GateHub as a node that provides credit links between multiple users, including one directly linked to fiat-denominated values. This reinforces GateHub’s role as an intermediary for fiat-crypto exchange through the XRP Ledger. The other image features a visual from GateHub’s website, confirming live integration with networks such as SWIFT. Ripple’s Long-Term Vision While Ripple continues to expand its enterprise partnerships, including its recent push into stablecoins with RLUSD, this confirmation of live interoperability with SWIFT via GateHub aligns with Ripple’s strategic positioning of XRPL as a central infrastructure for global settlement. SMQKE’s tweet brings focus to this architecture by showcasing both theoretical and applied components of the XRP-based settlement network. The evidence presented corroborates Ripple’s stated ambition to integrate with traditional financial systems while offering an alternative to outdated settlement rails. With both technical infrastructure and active partnerships now in place, the role of XRPL in cross-border finance appears to be strengthening.

As XRP eyes a potential ETF-fueled breakout, a rising project called Pepeto is winning attention with real utility, zero-fee trading, and early investor buzz. Table of Contents XRP forecast: Can the ETF hype push it to $27? Next gen exchange with real utility not just hype Presale: A demo version of exchange + 278% staking reward for early buyers The crypto market is heating up, and XRP holders are watching closely. Many believe the token is gearing up for another run, but the big question remains when will it peak and when should profits be taken? While momentum builds, another crypto project is turning heads by solving problems XRP still struggles with, like day-to-day utility and frictionless global payments. Before checking the new coin out, here’s the latest outlook for XRP and why this rising token deserves attention too. XRP forecast: Can the ETF hype push it to $27? XRP is still under $3, but buzz is building around a possible rally to $27 if a spot ETF gets approved. Analysts are optimistic, and Polymarket now estimates an 87% chance of approval thanks to the new SEC chair’s favorable view on crypto. Ripple is actively expanding partnerships globally, hoping to seal more US deals soon. CEO Brad Garlinghouse thinks the end of the SEC case could send XRP soaring. Still, Circle’s growing network poses stiff competition if Ripple delays. A jump to $27 means a $1.9 trillion market cap, which is ambitious even for XRP. The token is up 350% this year, but future gains rely just as much on regulation as on technical trends. You might also like: Fartcoin, Bonk soar; Pepeto gears up to be leading option for 100x gains Next gen exchange with real utility not just hype As XRP continues navigating legal barriers, another project is gaining real traction. It’s creating a zero-fee exchange that lists memecoins and valuable projects with no red tape, and no massive listing charges. Just straightforward access. To qualify, tokens must provide real use. And thanks to advanced bridge tech, assets move effortlessly between blockchains. For global payments, the platform includes a tool that allows buyers to pay in crypto while sellers get fiat fast, simple, no juggling platforms. With over $5 million raised and a full demo exchange reveal coming soon, this one’s looking ready for real world use, not just speculation. Presale: A demo version of exchange + 278% staking reward for early buyers Pepeto’s presale is still ongoing, already bringing in over $5.3 million and growing fast. It’s got over 70k followers and is trending across social platforms. At just $0.000000134 per token, Pepeto is under the radar and that’s what makes it exciting. Early investors, especially Pepe holders, are taking note. There are even whispers of drama: a former Pepe co-founder allegedly pushed out, returning with Pepeto to finish the vision, adding the missing T (Technology) and O (Optimization) to the original memecoin.

His artificial intelligence startup, xAI , is reportedly making waves in the funding landscape, seeking a substantial new capital infusion. This move highlights the immense financial demands of competing in the rapidly evolving AI sector. Why is xAI Seeking a New Equity Raise ? According to recent reports, Elon Musk ‘s xAI is aiming to secure a significant Equity Raise totaling $4.3 billion. This isn’t the first time the company has sought considerable funds. Earlier reports indicated plans to raise $5 billion in debt funding for the combined entity of X (formerly Twitter) and xAI . This new equity target comes relatively soon after xAI reportedly received a $6 billion cash infusion in December. The need for additional capital appears driven by the high operational costs associated with developing and running advanced AI technologies.

In the first four days, the console sold over 3.5 million units. The stock rose for a fifth straight session, at one point jumping over 10.15%, marking its strongest two-month rally. Investors were convinced by reports that the Switch 2 sold more than 3.5 million units in its first four days, based on figures through June 11. The console went out of stock in several major stores. Nintendo stock price. Source: Google Finance That launch figures far outstripped the original Switch’s roughly 2.7 million sales in its first month back in 2017. Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda noted that, with the US and Japan unable to agree on new tariff measures at the recent Group of Seven summit, money has flowed into industries less exposed to duties. “Funds are moving into the game sector, which is less affected by tariffs,” he said. Other gaming stocks also saw gains. Square Enix added up to 4.7% and Bandai Namco rose as much as 3.9%. Investors have been drawn to the relative safety of games, even as worries about tariffs and geopolitical tensions grow. Japan remains a major player in gaming with Sony and Nintendo Sony commands the market with the PlayStation, while Nintendo’s Switch line remains a global hit among fans of handheld consoles. Popular series from these companies include “Elden Ring” and “Super Mario,” which continue to drive strong interest worldwide. The Switch 2’s launch is Nintendo’s first new console in eight years. By selling over 3.5 million units in just four days, it has already outpaced the original model’s first-month performance. Those early numbers, published by Nintendo on Wednesday, point toward its goal of shifting 15 million units by March 2026, and suggest even higher potential if production can keep pace. Industry watchers see the launch as a turning point. With development costs rising and profit margins tightening across gaming, a hit console can reshape strategies for partners and competitors. A strong Switch 2 could help offset the dominance of major live-service titles and breathe new life into hardware sales. But meeting demand poses a big challenge. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa issued an apology after many customers had to return empty-handed from the lotteries. Nintendo has urged its manufacturing partners to boost the production and struck deals with Japanese online marketplaces like Rakuten, Mercari and LY to curb reseller activity. Most Switch 2 units are built in China by firms such as Foxconn Technology Group. Even as shares have swung on tariff worries, the latest sales figures and the rally in gaming stocks shows that investors are confident about Nintendo pushing the Switch 2 console.

This decision is expected to fuel adoption of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL)—and indirectly boost XRP’s price and utility. Let’s break down how this law changes the game for stablecoins, and what it means for Ripple, RLUSD, and XRP holders. GENIUS Act Brings Regulatory Clarity to the $261 Billion Stablecoin Market The stablecoin market is now valued at $261.5 billion, led by: Tether (USDT) – $155.4B USD Coin (USDC) – $61.4B USDS, BSC-USD, USDE, DAI – Remaining top contenders Passed with a 68-30 vote, the GENIUS Act sets new standards for audits, reserves, and licensing, ending the Wild West era for stablecoins. Senator Bill Hagerty, who backed the bill, called it “a new era of payments,” emphasizing its potential to make transactions faster and cheaper across the financial system. What the GENIUS Act Means for Trust and Transparency Until now, stablecoins faced regulatory uncertainty, deterring institutional adoption. The GENIUS Act changes that by requiring: Full reserve backing Independent audits Strict licensing This means stablecoin issuers must prove they hold enough assets to match what they issue—restoring public and institutional trust. Why RLUSD Could Become a Top Institutional Stablecoin A recent post on X by crypto expert SMQKE explained that RLUSD is designed with GENIUS compliance in mind. This opens the doors for: Banks Asset managers Global corporations to adopt RLUSD, as it meets regulatory requirements they demand before integrating crypto into operations. More RLUSD Usage = More XRP Burned = Higher XRP Price? Here’s where XRP benefits: RLUSD operates exclusively on the XRP Ledger Every RLUSD transaction burns a small amount of XRP This reduces XRP supply over time In economic terms, less supply plus growing demand often leads to higher prices. So, increased RLUSD usage could fuel XRP’s long-term value. XRP Price Trend 1-Year Growth: +441.6% Last 30 Days: -7.5%. Despite a recent dip, long-term sentiment remains bullish, especially with real-world use cases like RLUSD gaining traction. RLUSD vs CBDCs: A New Digital Payments Race? Crypto expert SMQKE also pointed out that regulated stablecoins like RLUSD now have an edge over government CBDCs (central bank digital currencies). With regulatory clarity, RLUSD can: Launch faster Scale globally Compete as a secure, trusted payment solution This puts Ripple and XRP in a stronger position to compete in the evolving digital finance landscape. Bottom Line: The GENIUS Act is a major win for Ripple’s RLUSD, institutional adoption, and XRP holders. As stablecoin rules get clearer, XRP Ledger’s role in compliant digital finance is growing fast. Keep an eye on RLUSD adoption and XRP’s burn rate—this could be the fuel for the next big XRP rally.",News|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP)|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 06:14:34
