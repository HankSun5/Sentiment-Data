Deal Gives Justin Sun’s Father Control of Public Firm Via $100M Token Deal,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/17/tron-inc-deal-gives-justin-suns-father-control-of-public-firm-via-100m-token-deal,"A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing posted Monday night outlines the relationship between Tron DAO, Justin Sun, and SRM Entertainment, a Nevada company in the process of changing its name to Tron Inc. The filing details a $100 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, paid entirely in TRX TRX tokens, that gives Sun’s father, Weike Sun, board control and positions Tron-aligned advisors in key governance roles. Weike was named chairman, while Zhihong Liu, also known as Steve Liu, a strategic adviser to Tron DAO and the CEO of stablecoin issuer Techteryx, and Zi Yang, a senior executive at Tronscan, joined the board’s audit, compensation, and nominating committees, according to the filing. The deal was structured as a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal. An investment vehicle owned by Weike purchased 100,000 shares of SRM Series B preferred Stock via TRX tokens, convertible into 200 million common shares, and received 220 million warrants at a strike price of $0.50. Despite the appearance of alignment, Tron DAO has no direct investment, governance rights, or formal role in the SRM deal, said Liu. ""Tron DAO is not really any part of the deal for SRM. It’s more of the senior Sun's transaction."" The DAO itself is not mentioned in the 8K filing either. Its influence appears to be indirect, reflected through the backgrounds of newly appointed board members tied to the Tron ecosystem. According to the Financial Times , the renamed firm plans to buy and hold up to $210 million worth of TRX, similar to how MicroStrategy built a bitcoin-based corporate treasury. The deal was arranged by Dominari Securities, a brokerage affiliated with Dominari Holdings, whose advisory board includes Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and is located within Trump Tower in Manhattan. Dominari Securities was paid $50,000 for the counsel for the transaction, according to the 8K filing. SRM, the listed Tron entity, is down 15%, trading at $7.73 as the market closed in New York. The TRX token is down 2.5%, trading at $0.27.",Markets|Justin Sun|Tron|TRX|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-17 22:28:33

This allows the nation’s highest court the opportunity to determine whether the president has the authority to implement some of his most severe trade policies in history. The two companies responsible are Learning Resources Inc. and hand2mind Inc. They have asked the Supreme Court to look over their case quickly. This court has recently let cases with equal (or less) far-reaching political and economic importance be reviewed quickly. “Whether the President has authority to impose tariffs…is of such imperative importance that it warrants review now,” the toy companies said in their Tuesday filing to the Supreme Court. The toy companies argue their case based on JPMorgan’s analysis The toy companies had already won a victory before US District Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington, but the decision was narrow in scope. However, Trump filed an appeal, and now the businesses want to skip that fight and go straight to the United States Supreme Court. Their argument in their petition to the court is based on an analysis by JPMorgan that shows that the round of Trump tariffs at issue would hike taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year. This is the largest tax increase in recent memory by a long shot and caused prices to surge by adding 2% to the Consumer Price Index. Due to the high tariffs, the nation’s overall average effective tariff rate has gone from 2.5% to around 27% since the start of the year. This is more than a tenfold rise and the highest for the US in over a century. Before its summer break starts at the end of this month, the companies want the Supreme Court to decide if it will take this case. This would allow for possible arguments in the fall. Another case of tariff in the waiting All of the challengers to Trump’s tariffs are arguing that the administration’s claims for the tariffs, including a national emergency caused by illegal immigration and flows of illegal drugs from overseas, were unauthorized because they did not directly address the stated emergency. A three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade (CIT) sided with a group of small companies in May when they said Trump didn’t have the power to carry out his “Liberation Day” duties under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA). The Trump administration appealed that decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. The court allowed Trump to keep the tariffs in place while it figures out if the president has the legal power to do so. The oral arguments are set to begin on July 31. Trump’s administration is ready to defend itself Legal experts have known for a long time that the Supreme Court would finally rule on whether Trump’s reasons for raising tariffs are legal. This could mean the “major questions doctrine” will be a problem for the Trump administration. This doctrine says that federal agencies can’t act on “vast economic and political significance” issues unless Congress explicitly permits them to do so. However, Trump’s lawyers are set to use Nixon as an example to show that his global tariffs will finally be upheld in court. As part of a set of economic measures called the “Nixon shock” about fifty years ago, the 37th president placed 10% duties on goods without consulting anyone else. These duties were challenged in court in a way that is similar to how Trump’s 2025 tariffs have been challenged.

Integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI has emerged as a top contender for exponential growth, with a 12,900% ROI forecast making it a standout. Experts are calling it a must-buy for those aiming to make strategic investment moves. Here’s why Ruvi AI is dominating conversations and why its trajectory has investors rushing to secure their stake. Why Analysts Are Bullish on Ruvi AI Unlike speculative tokens that rise and fall on hype alone, Ruvi AI grounds its value in real-world utility and structured growth . Tackling critical challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance , Ruvi AI uses AI-powered solutions to provide scalable, in-demand technologies. The project’s presale model offers an even more attractive proposition. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2 , the token’s post-presale price is set to climb to $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x return for early investors. Analysts forecast far higher returns post-listing, with a potential valuation of $1 per token equating to an incredible 12,900% gain for early adopters. This structured roadmap gives Ruvi AI a huge edge over projects relying on unpredictable market conditions. Presale Success Underlines Ruvi AI’s Momentum With over $1.8 million raised thus far, Ruvi AI’s presale has been a testament to the trust and confidence investors have in the project. Over 1,600 holders are already on board, solidifying Ruvi AI as one of the fastest-growing cryptos before its public debut. The presale’s price-fixed model ensures a predictable and secure investment opportunity. Early buyers lock in the lower Phase 2 price and benefit from the guaranteed increase to $0.07 per token after the presale ends. This stability, combined with significant flexibility via scalable investments, makes Ruvi AI an ideal choice for smart investors. VIP Investment Tiers Maximize Growth Potential Ruvi AI sweetens the deal with VIP investment tiers , offering significant bonuses for those who want to maximize their returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers are tailored to reward larger investments with higher bonuses, allowing participants to unlock exponential returns during Ruvi AI’s early growth phases. Transparency and Security Drive Investor Trust Ruvi AI isn’t just about potential gains; it’s also about building trust and security for its community. The project is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a leading blockchain security firm, ensuring the infrastructure is entirely reliable and secure. This audit reassures investors that their funds are protected and the project adheres to high operational standards. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , a globally recognized trading platform, to provide post-presale liquidity . This collaboration ensures that Ruvi AI tokens will have seamless accessibility and trading options once the presale concludes, giving investors confidence in their ability to trade effectively. Real-World Applications Ensure Sustainable Demand Beyond its presale success, Ruvi AI distinguishes itself with broad adoption potential across three major industries. Marketing Ruvi AI empowers businesses with AI-driven tools that enhance ad targeting, engagement, and ROI. These capabilities are essential for modern organizations seeking to optimize their campaigns. Entertainment With blockchain-secured payments and AI-enhanced content recommendations, Ruvi AI improves how creators monetize while providing personalized user experiences. Finance Ruvi AI strengthens financial operations by offering fraud detection tools and operational transparency, helping the finance sector evolve with innovative solutions. These utility-driven applications ensure Ruvi AI’s token demand will remain strong, supported by sustainable market relevance rather than fleeting hype. Why Ruvi AI Is the Opportunity of 2025 While the crypto market is crowded, few projects offer the combination of structured growth , real-world utility , and transparency that Ruvi AI delivers. With its 12,900% ROI forecast and affordable starting price of $0.015 , Ruvi AI creates a compelling narrative for investors chasing exponential rewards. Backed by over $1.8 million raised , 1,600+ holders , a CyberScope audit , and a WEEX Exchange partnership , Ruvi AI is uniquely positioned to rise as a leader in blockchain and AI innovation.

According to analysts, the popular altcoin saw a dramatic 700% surge earlier last year. Now, its price is positioned to exit a seven-month consolidation phase, which could set it up for its next bullish move. XRP Gets Ready For Major Bullish Move A recently published technical chart by market expert ‘Crypto Michael’ on X (formerly Twitter) reveals that XRP has been consolidating for seven months following a staggering 700% price rally, which was triggered by a breakout from a multi-year Symmetrical Triangle pattern. The chart, based on a 3-month candlestick, shows that XRP had been in a major price compression within the triangle pattern for seven years. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance True to form, XRP finally broke above the upper trendline of the pennant in late 2024, igniting one of its most powerful quarterly rallies to date. This breakout led to a price surge of about 700%, pushing the cryptocurrency from around $0.6 to over $2. Since the dramatic breakout, XRP has entered a stabilization phase, trading sideways in what appears to be a healthy consolidation range. The chart highlights this consolidation area with a white circle, indicating a well-defined post-breakout phase. Notably, XRP’s $2.15 price at the time of the analysis is above prior resistance levels, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is maintaining strength while waiting for its next bullish catalyst. Crypto Michael points out that XRP’s consolidation is ending just as Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, approaches a critical juncture: the “8-year line.” This correlation suggests that a broader shift in market sentiment may be underway. Historically, leading altcoins like XRP have followed Bitcoin’s lead during broader market rallies. If BTC successfully breaks through this long-standing line, Crypto Michael believes it could serve as a macro trigger that ignites a fresh bullish move for XRP. Analyst Says The Altcoin Is Set To Explode Against BTC A fresh analysis by Egrag Crypto, a crypto analyst on X, suggests that the XRP/BTC pair could be on the edge of a major breakout. The pair has followed a consistent cycle for over a decade, with lows in 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2024—each succeeded by strong rallies. These lows align with a rising trendline, signaling possible long-term strength. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Structure Remains Bullish: Analyst Releases 3 New Targets Now, XRP/BTC is approaching a key resistance level that has blocked past rallies since 2015. This time, however, Egrag Crypto suggests that the setup looks different and slightly more favorable for a breakout. If the pair breaks above this multi-year ceiling, it could mark a major turning point, effectively leading XRP into an explosive bullish phase. The analyst’s chart outlines two potential paths: a green breakout zone if XRP pushes higher and a red rejection zone if it fails to break this key resistance again.

Unlike previous speculative comments, Claver has now associated this projection with a specific timeframe, approximately two years. In a recently shared video on X , Claver outlined his argument for why a higher XRP price is essential for the network to efficiently support large-scale institutional transactions. His perspective builds on earlier technical insights from Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, who once explained that the number of XRP tokens needed for a transaction is inversely proportional to the asset’s price. For example, transferring $1 million at a token value of $1 would require 1 million XRP. If the token were priced at $10, only 100,000 units would be needed for the same transaction. According to Claver, this relationship illustrates how increasing the token’s price could enhance the XRP Ledger’s transactional efficiency. Does XRP need to be a certain price to move large amounts of money? pic.twitter.com/tbqBbvST4y — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) May 27, 2025 Increased Valuation as a Path to Liquidity Efficiency Claver further elaborated that at current prices, roughly $2 per token, XRP lacks the liquidity required to process transactions involving trillions of dollars. Based on his analysis, a valuation of $10,000 per token would provide the liquidity needed to handle institutional-scale transfers, implying a theoretical market cap of more than $500 trillion. Despite the astronomical figure, Claver maintains that such a valuation is technically necessary for XRP to fulfill its role in large-scale cross-border financial operations. He emphasized that the XRP Ledger’s design allows it to scale its liquidity capabilities in tandem with price increases, making the token more effective at higher valuations. Skepticism and Market Criticism Unsurprisingly, the claim has been met with significant criticism from various financial commentators. One major point of contention is the implication that XRP could achieve a total market capitalization vastly exceeding the size of the current global economy. Critics argue that this renders the prediction implausible, regardless of the underlying logic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Among the skeptics is Alex Caraco, former CEO of an Australian stock market firm, who questioned the practicality of such predictions. He expressed concern that retail investors may be misled by exaggerated price targets, especially those tied to short timelines. Others in the cryptocurrency space have echoed this sentiment, pointing out that even with the development of futures markets and institutional adoption, a $10,000 valuation within two years would require extraordinary demand and systemic changes in global finance. While Claver’s projection remains speculative, it reflects a broader discussion within the XRP community about the token’s long-term potential and the infrastructure required to support institutional-scale transactions.

However, Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, has failed both as a safe haven anda FOMO asset. As is often the case, its underwhelming performance has spilled over to other crypto majors. Even so, its upside potential is significant. As the markets eye the ongoing conflicts, a recovery is still likely. Bitcoin price fails as a safe haven amid the geopolitical tensions The initial attack by Israeli forces on Iranian nuclear sites late last week yielded the expected moves; Brent crude oil price surged by about 7%, gold price rallied by 1.5%, and stocks dropped worldwide. Interestingly, Bitcoin, which is usually referred to as digital gold, failed to live up to its position as a safe haven. In fact, the leading cryptocurrency dropped to a one-week low on Friday; extending losses recorded in the previous two sessions. Like gold, Bitcoin’s tight supply boosts its status as a store of value. However, the rebound of the US dollar in the wake of the Israel-Iran conflict has capped its upward momentum. Even so, it bears high upside potential amid the persistent uncertainties. At a crypto fear & greed index of 50, the traders appear indecisive. However, a bullish undertone is observable. Data released by SoSoValue showed that US BTC spot ETFs had daily total net inflows of $412.20 million as of 16th June. With no outflows, the top 6 ETFs recorded inflows with BlackRock’s IBIT leading with inflows of $266.60 million. Besides, as highlighted by CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s trading volume rose by 25.87% over the past 24 hours. A surge in trading volume usually points to increased investor interest. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView In the short term, Bitcoin price is likely to trade within the range of between $106,309 and $101,370 as the markets continue to weigh in on the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict. Notably, the bullish golden-cross pattern that has been in place for close to two months now confirms a continuation of the uptrend. With the attraction of more buyers, the bulls will be looking to retest Monday’s high of $108,900. Bearish pattern shapes Ripple price path as XRP lawsuit drags on As the Ripple Labs – SEC lawsuit drags on and the broader crypto market remains in a neutral mode, Ripple price is still under pressure. A look at its daily chart shows the altcoin still trading below the descending trendline. At the time of press, the crypto major was trading below the 25 and 50-day EMAs that appear to be converging around $2.24. Amid the traders’ indecisiveness, the range between $2.10 and $2.27 is worth watching. Even with the possible recovery, it will likely face resistance at May’s level of $2.39.

With the indecisiveness in the broader crypto market, $156 remains a pivot worth watching. This makes the range between $140 and $167 worth watching.

Qubetics (TICS) has captured serious attention in this emerging class, especially in its final presale stage. With its aim to solve cross-border friction for professionals, businesses, and Web3 platforms, Qubetics is quickly gaining traction as one of the best 100x crypto assets of the year. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) and Aptos (APT) also show strength, posting healthy daily gains amid renewed momentum in the altcoin market. Though distinct in scope, these three projects form a compelling trio for investors seeking utility, scalability, and near-term upside. Qubetics Final Presale: Redefining Cross-Border Transactions with Real-World Utility Qubetics has officially entered its final public crypto presale phase, offering a fixed $0.3370 price for its remaining 10 million $TICS tokens. The platform has already raised over $18 million, selling more than 516 million tokens to 28,000+ holders. With a sharp supply cut—from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion—the tokenomics now favor scarcity-driven growth, positioning $TICS as a best 100x crypto prospect. At its core, Qubetics tackles one of blockchain’s most pressing challenges: costly, slow, and fragmented cross-border transfers. Its solution? A high-speed, low-fee infrastructure capable of handling near-instant settlements across borders. Whether you’re a DeFi trader or a business accepting international payments, the platform offers a smoother experience than legacy remittance platforms. A major differentiator is its proprietary QubeQode smart contract suite, designed for compliance-heavy use cases in global finance. These features make Qubetics a true contender for real-world enterprise and institutional adoption, especially for those entering Web3 with concrete objectives. Combined with its community-first distribution model (38.55% of tokens allocated to the public), Qubetics’ structure favors transparency, governance, and long-term user value. It could be the best 100x crypto you’ll encounter in a presale this year. Stellar (XLM) Sees a Modest Rally Amid Layer-1 Ecosystem Growth Stellar (XLM) is back in the green, currently trading at $0.2625 with a 24-hour volume of over $228 million—up 1.56%. Long known for its focus on low-cost payments and partnerships with global financial institutions, Stellar continues to gain traction, particularly in emerging markets. Stellar is proving resilient amid broader market fluctuations. Its new integrations with fintech platforms and digital ID systems are helping the network evolve into a real-time payments layer for global infrastructure. Stellar also benefits from its close alignment with CBDC development in various nations, which adds legitimacy to its long-term vision. Although price movement remains modest, it offers lower volatility and slow-but-steady adoption—a contrast to more speculative plays. Still, Stellar may lag behind platforms like Qubetics when looking for the best 100x crypto multiplier for users with higher risk tolerance and ambition. However, its stability and institutional utility make it a solid complementary asset. Aptos (APT) Gains Over 4% As Developers Embrace Move Language Aptos (APT) has surged 4.23%, trading today at $4.67, backed by growing developer interest in its Move programming language and sub-second transaction finality. This Layer-1 chain has been building a name by combining scalability with developer-friendly infrastructure. Recent ecosystem reports show Aptos expanding its DeFi footprint, with increasing dApp deployments and TVL (Total Value Locked) growth. Its low-latency execution model also opens the door to gaming, social dApps, and financial instruments that require high performance. Moreover, strategic partnerships with major infrastructure players like Google Cloud are solidifying Aptos’ Web2-to-Web3 gateway reputation. While still early in its journey, Aptos holds potential for exponential growth and could soon be considered among the best 100x crypto options, particularly for tech-forward investors. However, its current valuation may already price in some of that future potential. In comparison, Qubetics still offers raw asymmetric upside with presale access and lower entry points. Final Thoughts In today’s market, smart people prioritize real-world use cases and early entry opportunities. While Stellar provides tested reliability and Aptos delivers technical promise, Qubetics solves a high-value problem—cross-border remittances—while empowering developers and businesses through native tools. As the presale closes in, Qubetics offers a scarce combination: limited token supply, active user base, enterprise relevance, and built-in 20% listing upside. If you want to enter the next best 100x crypto before the market catches on, $TICS may be your front-runner. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics a strong candidate for the best 100x crypto in 2025? Qubetics combines low-cost global transfers, a proprietary dev suite, and a reduced total token supply to deliver utility and scarcity—ideal traits for exponential growth. When will Qubetics list on public exchanges? The $TICS token is expected to list shortly after the presale ends. Early buyers at $0.3370 are projected to see an initial 20% gain on listing at $0.40. Is Qubetics safe for beginners in crypto? Yes. It features a non-custodial wallet, intuitive dApp interactions, and a transparent governance system, making it one of the best 100x crypto options for new users. How do Stellar and Aptos compare to Qubetics? Stellar is established but slower-moving; Aptos is innovative but already well-valued. Qubetics, being in presale, offers the best raw upside and entry point. How much can I make if Qubetics hits $10 or $15? If you invest $1,000 at $0.3370, you’d receive ~2,967 TICS tokens. At $10, that’s $29,670. At $15, it’s over $44,500, highlighting why it’s seen as a best 100x crypto play.

Since the meme coin hit a local top in mid-May, a 30% drop has put this key level back in question, with $0.168 firmly in the spotlight as a potential tipping point. According to popular X analyst Ali Charts, this level aligns with the lower boundary of a crucial symmetrical triangle—a breakdown from which could trigger a 30% retracement. #Dogecoin $DOGE must hold above $0.168 to avoid a 30% price drop! pic.twitter.com/PDhqo7fpcK — Ali (@ali_charts) June 15, 2025 Below $0.168 lies a dangerous “gap area”—a price range with sparse previous buying activity, creating little historical support to limit downside. Dogecoin Price Analysis: A Breakdown Here Could Get Ugly Zooming out, the symmetrical triangle noted by Martinez contributes to a wider 4-year cup-and-handle pattern, with its lower support crossing the handle. DOGE / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. This creates a potential confluence zone between the make-or-break support and the upper resistance of the descending channel forming the handle—a potential breakout set up. A confirmed breakout would set a technical target around $0.75—a staggering 350% gain from current levels in line with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. However, this bullish case only holds if the $0.168 support does, and momentum indicators don’t inspire confidence. The golden cross from May has proven to be short-lived as the MACD line widens its gap below the signal line after a death cross to start June—a sign of a prevailing longer-term downtrend. The RSI also lends to weakening buy pressure, continuing its decline below the neutral line to its current position at 42. If DOGE posts a weekly candle close below $0.168, the next major Dogecoin price support zone sits around $0.90, last tested during mid-2024. From there, all eyes turn to the June 15 US spot Dogecoin ETF decision, which could offer the external catalyst DOGE needs, opening the doors to inflows from traditional investment markets if approved. Leading Meme Coins are Suffering – Here’s a Better Strategy When it comes to large meme coins like DOGE, timing is everything. Those who entered late from the mid-April market bottom and didn’t sell in mid-May face unrealised losses. Meanwhile, newer meme coins making the rounds like Aura are posting 46x gains in a single day. That’s where Snorter ($SNORT) steps in. Its purpose-built trading bot is engineered to spot early momentum, helping investors get in before the crowd—where the real gains are made. While trading bots are not a new concept, Snorter has been designed specifically for sniping with limit orders, MEV-resistant token swaps, copy trading, and even rug-pull protection. It’s one thing to get in first, it’s another thing to know when to sell—Snorter Bot can help. Snorter Bot vs. other trading bots. The project is off to a strong start— $SNORT has already raised over $1 million in its first three weeks of presale , likely driven by its high 287% APY on staking to rewards early investors.

Per a Telegram post from the official account of the Krasnoyarsk Krai Prosecutor’s Office , the “open-air” facility was located in the town of Nazarovo, some 240 km west of Krasnoyarsk, in Central Siberia. The office said it had obtained a court order allowing bailiffs to raid the facility. The farm reportedly mined coins worth around 4.6 million rubles ($58,672) per month for its operators. Crypto Mining Farm ‘Used Scores of Transformers and Generators’ Prosecutors explained that the operators had fenced off the facility with barbed wire. However, its location was nothing if not conspicuous. They wrote: “The farm was right out in the open air in the town’s industrial hub district.” U.S. President Donald Trump kicked off his time at the Group of Seven summit on Monday by suggesting that Russia and maybe even China should be part of the organization. https://t.co/CHLXxUr0Qn — PBS News (@NewsHour) June 16, 2025 Officially, the site was registered as a “non-residential building” under the name of a management company. However, when investigators conducted their raid, they found several transformers on the premises. They also discovered power generators, cooling equipment, and crypto mining rigs. The management firm, prosecutors said, leased the property to a crypto mining firm, along with a “non-existent building.” The miner had reportedly connected their rigs to the city’s power grid. Prosecutors said they received a tip-off from an energy provider. The latter reported that it had detected a high probability of emergency power outages at the facility. When they investigated, the prosecutors discovered that the company had not obtained permission to operate power-receiving units or use state-owned land. They also found that the miners were not complying with fire safety requirements, which constituted a public safety risk. An illegal crypto mining farm in Nazarovo, Russia. (Source: Krasnoyarsk Krai Prosecutor’s Office) Operator Ignored Prosecutors’ Warnings The office said it initially wrote to the firm to ask it to desist, adding that the operator “ignored” this request. The prosecution service responded by petitioning a district court, which responded by banning all activity at the facility “until the violations are rectified.” In February this year, a staffer at a Krasnoyarsk Krai energy provider was discovered taking bribes worth $7,380 from illegal crypto miners. The staffer agreed to turn a blind eye to the miners’ operations and their illegal connections to the grid. The same miners stole electricity worth about 9.4 million rubles ($119,592) from the Krasnoyarsk Krai energy system, investigators found. According to the Federal Tax Service’s registry of crypto miners, Krasnoyarsk Krai is one of Russia’s top three crypto mining regions, along with the Irkutsk region and the Republic of Tatarstan.

But in every cycle, there are exceptions, projects that move independently, refusing to follow the crowd. Right now, four altcoins are drawing attention for doing exactly that. While the broader market hesitates, Near Protocol (NEAR), Hyperliquid (HYPE), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are showing unusual resilience. However, amidst these altcoins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is turning heads with massive presale buzz, drawing meme coin believers chasing 35x to 100x gains. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Built To Perform When The Market Doesn’t The FloppyPepe (FPPE) altcoin is quickly gaining recognition as one of the most promising crypto plays for outsized gains. Early buyers have already taken advantage of the 80% bonus through the FLOPPY80 code, nearly doubling their holdings. The presale isn’t over yet; there’s still a brief window to get in at $0.00000035 before launch pricing jumps to $0.01. The boldest prediction? Analysts are floating a $1 target for FloppyPepe (FPPE) alongside the Bitcoin dominance, creating a staggering leap from its current level. FloppyPepe (FPPE) continues to rise alongside Near Protocol (NEAR), Fartcoin (FART), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) due to its ability to address gaps left by other altcoins. This gives it a unique edge in a crowded space. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Only Meme Coin Using AI And Scarcity For Real Gains Through its AI tools, Meme-o-Matic , FloppyX , and FloppyAI , FloppyPepe (FPPE) empowers users to instantly generate viral-ready memes, AI-driven video content, and real-time market insights, transforming it from a simple altcoin into an AI-powered platform that reinforces engagement and platform utility. In addition, Floppynomics gives FloppyPepe (FPPE) a unique counter-cycle strength as Bitcoin dominance surges. The altcoins are designed so that holders receive extra rewards from transactions, while the overall circulating supply gradually decreases. This built-in scarcity and reward structure favors early adopters, while the Solidproof audit guarantees security, making now a strategic time to accumulate before broader demand kicks in. Near Protocol (NEAR): Holding Steady While The Rest Look Shaky Near Protocol (NEAR) has recently stabilized between $2.22 and $2.30, recovering from a sharp 12.8% drop tied to broader war tensions. Despite the Bitcoin dominance peak, Near Protocol’s (NEAR) core metrics remain strong; 46 million monthly users place it as the second most-used Layer-1 protocol. As one crypto analyst recently put it, “ Grab Near Protocol (NEAR) while the price is still cheap. ” With this level of usage, Near Protocol (NEAR) remains one of the few altcoins showing strength where it matters. Hyperliquid (HYPE): A Rising Star With Price Action To Prove Hyperliquid (HYPE) recently surged to a new all-time high of $44.69, edging past its previous peak of $43.96. As Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is breaking away from the pack , showing rare counter-cycle strength. The Hyperliquid (HYPE) price rally points to rising transactional activity and deeper liquidity within the Hyperliquid (HYPE) ecosystem. Momentum indicators like MACD and RSI are also trending upward on the 4-hour chart, with some analysts now eyeing a potential push toward $100. Fartcoin (FART): Big Listing, Big Gains, Bigger Potential Fartcoin (FART) jumped nearly 40% in the past week and is now trading at $1.32 , following its Coinbase listing that went live on Thursday, a move known to attract fresh investor inflow. Amidst rising Bitcoin dominance, a Fartcoin (FART) is currently outperforming major meme coins , and with bullish technical signals and growing visibility, Fartcoin (FART) is quickly becoming a standout in the altcoin arena. Buy Now Or Regret Later: FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) 80% Bonus Is Almost Gone Near Protocol (NEAR), Hyperliquid (HYPE), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are showing rare counter-trend strength as Bitcoin dominance reaches its peak. Meanwhile, FloppyPepe (FPPE), the new AI altcoin, stands out not just for its ultra-low entry price but also for strong backing from influential crypto voices and, notably, the ongoing Presale promo. Right now, early early buyers still have a rare chance to scoop up FloppyPepe (FPPE) at just $0.00000035 and get an instant 80% bonus using the promo code FLOPPY80 . But don’t get too comfortable; this offer could vanish before the next stage even kicks in. Miss it, and be ready to chase green candles.

In a message to staff on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy praised generative AI as a game-changer but made clear that efficiency gains from these tools will likely shrink the company’s corporate head count over time. Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used in “virtually every corner of the company.” He noted that Amazon has more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications under way, and that this number represents only “a small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” This push follows Amazon’s pledge to invest roughly $100 billion in AI technologies during the current fiscal year. But for the company’s roughly 1.5 million employees, the message was a sobering one. Jassy warned that as AI changes how work gets done, the firm will need “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” He added, “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Amazon CEO urged employees to gain expertise on AI tools “Be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams.” Amazon has already cut staff in parts of its business it doesn’t consider essential. Earlier this year, the devices and services team lost about 100 jobs, and the books department saw a similar reduction. Overall, CNBC reports that the company has cut around 27,000 positions since 2022 and is preparing for more. Shares of Amazon have fallen about 2.5% so far this year. The Seattle-based company is pouring much of its planned $100 billion investment into AI infrastructure as it races rivals Google and Microsoft to lead the AI boom and to fuel growth at its lucrative cloud arm, Amazon Web Services. Last year, Jassy said he wanted to “eliminate bureaucracy” by creating a flatter organizational structure with fewer layers of middle management. In two major rounds of cuts in 2023, Amazon shed 27,000 roles, and this year Amazon Web Services trimmed hundreds more. Across the tech sector, leaders have generally chosen to highlight efficiency gains over the prospect of job losses from AI. In May, Microsoft reduced its global workforce by 3%. State filings in Washington indicate that many of those affected were software engineers. CEO Satya Nadella has publicly noted that perhaps “20-30% of the code that is inside of our repos today…are probably all written by software,” though the comFpany insists these cuts were not driven by AI. In April, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke told employees seeking more headcount or resources that they should explain why they “cannot get what they want done using AI.” Meanwhile, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn announced plans to replace contract workers with AI as part of the company’s new “AI-first” strategy .

The GENIUS Act passed the Senate in a final vote of 68 to 30. As a result, the GENIUS Act will now proceed to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to gain bipartisan support. Furthermore, the Donald Trump administration has laid significant emphasis on the importance of crypto assets and the digital currency market to the long term sustainability of the economy. “With the GENIUS Act, we’re bringing clarity to a sector that’s been clouded by uncertainty and proving that bipartisan, principled leadership can still deliver real results for the American people. This did not happen by accident,” Tim Scott noted . Stablecoins Market Ready to Bloom Via the GENIUS Act The monumental final vote for the GENIUS Act by the Senate is a major step toward clear stablecoins regulation in the United States. Once passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and stamped by Trump, the comprehensive stablecoin legislation will play a crucial role in the mainstream adoption of the digital dollar. According to Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, the GENIUS Act is a win-win situation for the private sector, the treasury, and consumers. Moreover, Bessent believes that the stablecoins market could reach $3.7 trillion by the end of this decade. “A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for US Treasuries, which back stablecoins. This newfound demand could lower government borrowing costs and help rein in the national debt,” Bessent noted . Already, JPMorgan has spearheaded the development of stablecoins by traditional financial institutions.

Two global internet monitors, Kentinc and NetBlocks, told NBC News that traffic plunged at about 5:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday. The abrupt cut left many Iranians struggling to send messages, browse news sites or post updates beyond Iran’s borders, the firms said. Iran’s communications minister said the slowdown was a deliberate government measure, not the result of damaged cables or power cuts. Spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said leaders limited access to counter what they described as Israeli cyberattacks against Iran’s digital infrastructure. Iran has shut down or slowed the internet during protests in the past. For example, in November 2019, it cut off all access for six days while security forces broke up protests across the country, a crackdown that left more than 100 people dead. After Israel’s strikes on Iran last week, the government had already slowed connections but stopped short of a full shutdown. Reports suggest that services like virtual private networks were hit hardest by the cutbacks. Many Iranians rely on VPNs to reach news outlets, social media and other foreign sites blocked inside the country. Major western apps blocked inside Iran Amir Rashidi, director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, told NBC News that certain Western apps stopped working. He said WhatsApp, Instagram, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store were among those blocked inside Iran. A WhatsApp spokesperson said its parent, Meta, has been locked in a “cat-and-mouse game” with Iran as officials target the company’s internet links. Meanwhile, Iran’s own National Information Network, a closed loop of government-approved sites, stayed online for most users. Data from Cloudflare, an internet services firm, showed on Tuesday that two of the country’s leading mobile carriers were effectively cut off from global networks, further isolating users who rely on phones for calls and data. Some people online urged Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite service to step in. Musk wrote on X last Friday, “The beams are on,” hinting that Starlink could help Iranians bypass the blackout. Iran’s authorities have banned Starlink terminals, and the state-run Saed News Agency warned that using them might guide Israeli strikes. Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit that supports internet access in closed societies, estimates that 30,000 to 40,000 Starlink dishes are already in Iran, based on network scans and conversations with local distributors. Iran alleges broad Israeli cyber offensive On Tuesday, Iran’s National Cybersecurity Command accused Israel of a wide cyberwarfare campaign to disrupt public services, but it did not say which systems were hit. Shargh Daily reported that the cyber police agency, known as FATA, said the government had imposed disruptions after the attacks and would restore normal service soon. A hacker group calling itself Predatory Sparrow claimed on X and Telegram to have launched a destructive cyberattack on Bank Sepah, a national bank under U.S. sanctions for ties to Iran’s military. As a result, some ATMs failed on Tuesday, a local source said. The group’s membership and any links to official agencies remain unknown.

Despite the uncertainty, ETH remains resilient above the $2,500 level, signaling ongoing strength among bulls. However, Ethereum now trades just below a critical resistance level at $2,675 — a zone that has acted as a barrier several times over the past few weeks. A breakout above this mark could trigger renewed upside momentum and set the stage for a rally toward $3,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Market participants remain divided on Ethereum’s short-term direction, but the technical landscape offers a potentially bullish clue. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum is on the verge of completing a golden cross — a chart pattern where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. Historically, this signal has preceded strong upward trends in ETH, with the last golden cross resulting in a 35% surge over the following weeks. As Ethereum hovers in a tight range, traders are closely watching this setup. If bulls manage to reclaim $2,675 and the golden cross confirms, Ethereum could enter a powerful breakout phase, potentially sparking broader optimism across the altcoin market. Ethereum Prepares For A Breakout As Bulls Hold Support Ethereum is facing a decisive moment as it continues to trade within a range that has persisted for more than six weeks. The current price structure reflects growing indecision among market participants, largely driven by geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. This macro backdrop has injected volatility across financial markets, and Ethereum has not been immune. While price action remains contained, ETH bulls are showing resilience by defending the $2,500 level — a crucial zone that has repeatedly served as support during the past month. However, to regain momentum, Ethereum must break above the $2,750–$2,800 resistance area, which has proven to be a major barrier since early May. This range remains the threshold separating consolidation from a full bullish breakout. A reclaim of this level would likely trigger a wave of buying, as it would mark the end of the current sideways phase and possibly initiate a fresh trend toward the $3,000 mark. Adding to the bullish thesis, Ted Pillows highlights that a golden cross is approaching on Ethereum’s moving averages. This occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average — a technical signal often associated with trend reversals and sustained upward moves. The last time this setup formed, Ethereum surged over 35% in just a few weeks. With ETH hovering just beneath key resistance and macro conditions remaining uncertain, the coming days may determine whether the golden cross will serve as a launchpad for a major rally. If bulls hold $2,500 and reclaim $2,800, Ethereum could be preparing for a significant breakout, potentially igniting momentum across the altcoin sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Ethereum Holds Support But Struggles With Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is showing resilience as it continues to trade above the $2,500 mark, but price action on the 4-hour chart reveals persistent difficulty in breaking through the $2,675–$2,700 resistance zone. This area, highlighted on the chart, has acted as a rejection zone multiple times since early June, capping bullish attempts to break out of the current range. Price recently tapped this resistance area again but failed to sustain momentum, resulting in a pullback toward the 200 EMA and 200 SMA, currently acting as near-term support around $2,575. ETH now hovers slightly above that level, and bulls must defend this zone to avoid slipping into lower support near $2,500. The pattern shows continued consolidation between a clearly defined support and resistance band, with the 50 and 100 moving averages flattening — a sign of market indecision. Volume has also declined slightly, reinforcing the idea that the market is waiting for a catalyst. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation – Details If ETH can reclaim $2,675 with conviction and follow through above $2,700, a rally toward the $2,850–$3,000 zone could develop. Until then, this tight range may continue. Holding the current support is crucial to avoid testing lower levels near $2,400, which could shift sentiment bearish.

If this scenario plays out, holders of 5,000 or 10,000 XRP could realize notable returns. Market Overview and Current Price Action XRP has experienced a moderate price increase of just over 3% since the beginning of the week. Despite this upward movement, the asset continues to trade below the $2.20 price level, a threshold it has hovered near for several months without a clear breakout. The broader cryptocurrency market remains largely range-bound, influenced in part by geopolitical events, including heightened instability in the Middle East. This prolonged consolidation phase has limited XRP’s momentum, although some market observers remain optimistic about a potential rally. Historical comparisons to XRP’s significant performance in 2017 continue to fuel expectations of a similar pattern repeating. Forecasts Supporting a $1 Trillion Market Cap Several market analysts have recently expressed optimism about XRP’s long-term potential. Analyst EGRAG has pointed to technical indicators that, in their view, suggest a market structure capable of supporting a major valuation increase. Specifically, EGRAG referenced a chart pattern that they believe could eventually lead XRP to a market capitalization near $1 trillion. Other perspectives have emphasized the importance of utility and adoption. For example, Omni’s founder, Austin King, argued that XRP would need to significantly improve its presence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and strengthen interoperability to reach such a valuation. Similarly, a prior analysis from xAI’s Grok explored the level of capital inflow required for XRP to attain a $1 trillion market cap. In addition, XRP advocate Edoardo Farina has encouraged investors to accumulate between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP, emphasizing the rarity of such holdings. He noted that fewer than 4% of XRP wallets contain over 10,000 tokens, and described such a holding as increasingly difficult to achieve. Farina also asserted that many future success stories in the space may begin with bold moves to secure large XRP positions early.

Using the current circulating supply of approximately 58.88 billion tokens, XRP’s price would need to rise to about $16.90 per coin to reach this valuation. Based on this projected price: An investor holding 5,000 XRP would see their portfolio valued at $84,500 An investor holding 10,000 XRP would have holdings worth $169,000 At the current market price of approximately $2.20, acquiring 5,000 XRP would require an investment of $10,950, while purchasing 10,000 XRP would cost about $21,900. This represents a potential gain of more than 670% if XRP reaches $16.90. While the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, the possibility of a $1 trillion valuation has become a frequent subject of analysis. Achieving such a milestone would require substantial progress in adoption, use cases, and investor confidence. However, if the necessary conditions align, long-term holders of XRP could see significant returns on their investment.

Bank of America sees gold going up to $4,000 an ounce over the next 12 months, a gain of more than 17% from the current level, reports Reuters. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs expects the precious metal to surge to $3,700 by the end of this year, lifted by strong demand from central banks. The firm also sees gold soaring to $4,000 by June 2026. Gold is trading at $3,395 at time of writing, up about 30% year-to-date. The precious metal is slightly down from the all-time high of $3,500 reached in April. Daniel Pavilonis, a senior market strategist at the brokerage firm RJO Futures, tells Reuters that escalating fears of a broader Middle East conflict are pushing gold prices higher. “Israel knocking out Iranian targets is causing a little bit of geopolitical scare in the market. Prices will stay elevated in the anticipation of what is to come, the retaliation by Iran.” On Friday, Israel fired airstrikes at Iran, killing a number of the Islamic Republic’s senior military personnel and destroying strategic military targets. The value of gold surged following the breakout of the conflict before giving up most of its gains on Monday.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, ETH is trading above $2500 as the U.S. Senate passes the GENIUS Act with bipartisan support. While the Senate was busy passing the GENIUS Act, Vivek Raman, founder of Ethereum advocacy firm Etherealize, was even busier, making the rounds on Wall Street to explain why ETH is suddenly at the center of institutional finance. Of course, Ethereum is nothing new. It's almost a decade old. But finally, in its almost 10 years of existence, Wall Street is starting to pay attention, and they really want to talk about it. “It’s an amazing job… running around from bank to bank, buy side to buy side, telling them what Ethereum tokenization means, how L2s work, and why it all flows through ether,” he told CoinDesk during an interview in between meetings from the lobby of Wall Street's Brookfield Place. As founder of Etherealize, Raman leads the firm’s efforts to educate Wall Street on ETH as neutral collateral and to help institutions tokenize assets and build on Ethereum. Raman says that Ethereum’s core value proposition, its role as the settlement and collateral layer behind stablecoins and tokenized assets, is finally resonating with institutional investors. “Every action is powered by ether,” he said. “Eventually, it’s going to be viewed as just as pristine as bitcoin. It'll be the neutral asset for the whole ecosystem.” The turning point, Raman says, was regulatory clarity. “Ethereum’s potential hasn’t been allowed until now,” he said, pointing to the GENIUS Act and broader U.S. policy momentum. “For years we didn’t know if it was a security or a commodity."" That’s why, despite the headlines around the ETH ETF, Raman says the real unlock for Ethereum came from regulatory clarity, not a ticker symbol. “The ETH ETF cleared the way by signaling that ether is a commodity, but it still wasn’t explicit,” Raman said. “With clear market structure, the utility of Ethereum gets completely unleashed. Now ETH permeates everything: every tokenized asset transfer, every stablecoin transfer, every Layer 2, they all flow through ETH.” And while Circle’s IPO and the rise of tokenized treasuries have brought new visibility to the sector, Raman says savvy investors will want more than equity exposure to stablecoin brands. Circle may get the IPO, but Ethereum gets the flows,” he said. “ETH is what secures this whole ecosystem, and it’s the only neutral, non-censorable collateral that can route value between all these tokenized assets.” VanEck's Solana ETF Comes Closer to Listing with DTCC Entry VanEck's proposed Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) has been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website under the ticker symbol VSOL, a procedural step that typically signals readiness for electronic clearing and settlement. VanEck’s DTCC listing comes amid growing institutional interest in Solana, following the blockbuster success of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs. However, just like with those ETFs, Canada has beaten the U.S. in the race to get listed. Four Canadian issuers, Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ, launched their Solana ETFs in April, following approval from the Ontario Securities Commission. OKX Continues European Expansion with Regulated Launch in Germany and Poland OKX has officially launched regulated crypto exchanges in Germany and Poland, marking a strategic expansion into two of Europe’s most active digital asset markets. The company now offers spot trading, staking, automated trading bots, and over 60 crypto-Euro pairs to users in both countries, supported by localized platforms with Euro onramps.

46242870,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=748637,1750208228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46242870.jpeg,Mass sell-off triggers Binance Alpha meltdown,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-binance-alphas-reform-restore-trust/,"Crypto users, influencers, and new traders were psyched about using Binance Alpha to unlock benefits, but the $ZKJ and $KOGE tokens experienced dramatic price swings that triggered mass liquidations. Some traders saw their investment go to waste, while others watched Alpha whales cycle trades between two Alpha tokens with minimal price exposure to farm points. These victims posted screenshots, angry threads, and questions on social media asking questions about whether the program was ever truly fair, and some critics even said Binance waited too long to act. Binance raised deeper concerns about its governance, transparency, and commitment to user protection when it tried closing loopholes and reducing system gaming by ruling that trades between Alpha tokens would no longer count toward Alpha Points. Why wasn’t it built into the system if the rule change was necessary to prevent abuse? Mass sell-off triggers Binance Alpha meltdown Large Alpha holders (whales) pulled their liquidity out of the market, creating a shortage of available funds that caused prices to drop quickly and tokens like $ZKJ and $KOGE to crash. Meanwhile, many traders used borrowed or leveraged money to trade these tokens on the blockchain. So, when prices started falling, it triggered automatic sell orders (liquidations), further pushing prices down in a quick and uncontrollable chain reaction. Users who invested or farmed points in these tokens began losing money and started selling their holdings or stopping their trading activities altogether, making it even harder for remaining traders to buy or sell tokens without facing large losses. Reports show that more than 100,000 users have left the Binance Alpha ecosystem in just a short period as they feel burned by the sudden and severe losses. Binance stops point farming between tokens Binance introduced a new rule that stops users from earning Alpha Points when they trade one Alpha token for another on June 17. Before this change, traders could swap tokens like $ZKJ for $KOGE and keep earning points even if they were simply moving money back and forth between these tokens without adding real value to the market. Some users say the change will stop traders from using clever tricks to game the system because they mislead other traders and the market about the tokens’ popularity and value. However, some say this new rule is too late and doesn’t deal with the design problems that reward high trading volume or the overwhelming influence of large holders or whales who still control much of the market and can manipulate prices. The new rule might reduce some of the most obvious abuses like wash trading , but it won’t fully fix the core challenges that have led to the recent crashes and community backlash. The crypto community criticizes Binance Many users felt betrayed by the system because the rewards they invested their time, money, and effort into earning were now devalued and made more difficult to earn. Some users said Binance should give back the points or rewards they lost because the new rules weren’t clearly explained before they made decisions to trade or hold tokens. In contrast, others wanted the company to explain how the new system worked to prevent similar sudden changes in the future. The backlash showed that many users lost trust in the Alpha brand as they believed the changes were designed to protect big players or the company’s image rather than create a fair and open environment for all users. Some people even said Binance only made those changes to avoid negative headlines and keep investors happy instead of dealing with the Alpha Points program’s issues with fairness and transparency. Some crypto community members think other big exchanges will follow Binance’s example and change their to reduce the risks of manipulation and abuse. Others think the platforms will continue with the traditional systems. Binance can set a new example for the crypto industry by building a fairer, more stable system that works well. However, if users react negatively or the new setup fails to bring in enough people and trading activity, other exchanges might not want to follow its lead. Binance should approach its community members and consult them for ideas about changing the incentive system because users are likelier to believe that the platform cares about their experience and wants to build a fair system that benefits everyone when they feel heard.

The Spanish lender’s act of offering its wealthy clients the opportunity to invest up to 7% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies is the latest evidence that some mainstream banks are starting to open up to a sector that was once dismissed due to its risks. However, regulators continue to caution about the dangers of cryptocurrencies, warning that investors should be prepared to lose all their money possibly. Earlier this year, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) reported that 95% of banks in the EU do not participate in crypto activities. BBVA’s reveals efforts to make its “wealth clients” embrace cryptocurrencies In a statement, Meyer mentioned that they began advising their private clients on Bitcoin in September of last year. Due to the riskier profile accompanying cryptocurrencies, he revealed that BBVA will allow the clients to invest as high as 7% of their portfolios in crypto. What has driven this sudden shift is that cryptocurrency prices have soared recently, and Bitcoin hit its highest record in May. That comes after a rebound from the lows recorded in 2022 as a clutch of major exchanges, including FTX, went under and left millions of investors out of pocket. They were aided in the recovery by support from US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. While private banks often facilitate crypto purchases at clients’ request, they still rarely go so far as to recommend investing in digital assets actively. Meyer mentioned at an event that BBVA was one of the first major global banks to recommend that wealthy clients invest in cryptocurrencies. He noted that the bank has fulfilled client requests to purchase them since 2021. BBVA advises clients to invest between 3-7% in Bitcoin and Ether, but Meyer indicated they plan to include more cryptocurrencies later this year. Meyer stated that clients have generally responded well to this advice and dismissed fears about the assets being too risky. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, adding 3% can really improve performance,” Meyer explained. Based on his argument, investing 3% does not involve taking a significant risk. ESMA raises concerns about the dangers associated with crypto Earlier, the European Union’s securities watchdog warned that issues in the cryptocurrency industry could threaten the stability of financial markets in the future as the sector expands and its links to more traditional financial markets deepen. This call for caution from the ESMA follows US economic policies that irritate global markets as US authorities struggle to remove barriers between the crypto and traditional banking sectors. In a speech to the European Parliament that was shared on the watchdog’s website, Natasha Cazenave, the executive director of ESMA, revealed that E U financial markets face significant pressure due to wider political and geopolitical events. Additionally, stock markets have been crashing since US President Donald Trump announced a blizzard of new tariffs. This also caused a significant drop in crypto prices. However, asset prices in various markets regained some of those losses. Following these concerns, Crypto-asset markets are still quite small. To address this, Cazenave mentioned that in today’s market conditions, even problems in these small markets can lead to wider issues in their financial system. She also noted that the risks to financial stability from crypto are not significant at this time. Still, ESMA raises alarms about the dangers of crypto and states that this sector requires ongoing careful observation.

XRP Wallets With 1 Million+ Tokens Have Set A New Record In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed the latest trend in a couple of indicators related to the XRP network. The first metric of relevance is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us, among other things, the number of wallets that belong to a particular coin range. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Plummet $61 Billion—Warning Sign For Bitcoin? In the context of the current topic, the range of interest is above 1 million coins (with the upper bound being infinity). This cutoff for the range converts to about $2.2 million at the current exchange rate, which is quite significant. Naturally, the only investors who would qualify for this threshold would be the big-money ones. Such holders are popularly known as the sharks and whales. Generally, the influence of any entity on the network goes up the more coins that they hold, so this cohort, with its large holdings, can carry some degree of power. As such, the behavior of the sharks and whales can be worth keeping an eye on. If nothing else, it can at least inform us about what the sentiment may be like among these humongous investors. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of these 1 million+ holders over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Supply Distribution has recently registered an uptick for sharks and whales, implying more wallets carrying above a million coins have popped up on the network. This could be an indication that some new big-money investors have potentially joined the chain. Following the increase, the network now has 2,708 wallets of this size, which is a new record. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data of the second relevant metric: Daily Active Addresses. This indicator measures the unique total number of wallets that are becoming involved in some kind of transaction activity on the network every day, whether as a sender or receiver. Since the smaller entities like retail massively outweigh the large investors in terms of number, this metric essentially represents the amount of activity that the entities on the smaller end of the network are participating in. From the graph, it’s visible that the XRP Daily Active Addresses have recently observed a large spike. Over the past week, the metric has averaged a value of 295,000 addresses daily, which is a drastic jump over the 35,000 to 40,000 figure witnessed during the last three months.

It now remains to be seen what effect, if any, these changes in network metrics would have on the cryptocurrency’s price. XRP Price XRP shot up beyond the $2.33 mark yesterday, but it seems bullish momentum has already faded as the coin has dropped back to $2.20.

The securities regulatory agency requested the members of the public to comment on the proposed rule changes to list both spot ETFs in the coming four weeks. When Will the SEC Approve Spot Solana ETFs According to James Seyffart, a Bloomberg’s ETF analyst, the delay by the U.S. SEC on spot Solana and XRP ETFs on Tuesday was not a surprise. Furthermore, the agency has been postponing other altcoins spot ETF applications in the recent past. However, as Coinpedia reported , the U.S. SEC has actively engaged the fund managers seeking to offer spot Solana ETFs in the past two weeks. Consequently, the odds of spot Solana ETF approval before the end of the year have significantly risen. “I wouldn’t be completely shocked if we see approvals for Solana ETFs in the next month or so. But I also wouldn’t be surprised if we have to wait until the final deadline in October. Timeline is unknown,” Seyffart noted . Market Impact The continued delay on the final decision for the altcoins spot ETFs will further delay the highly anticipated 2025 altseason. Moreover, the traditional crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to the altcoins was disrupted by the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States last year. However, the U.S. SEC will eventually approve the spot Solana and XRP ETFs, especially after Canada approved its first spot SOL ETF. Additionally, the demand for Solana by institutional investors has significantly increased in the past year, led by SOL Strategies.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 01:03:16

Speaking on the Uncapped podcast , which he co-hosts with his brother Jack Altman, the CEO described Meta’s approach as extreme. “It’s insane,” Altman said, referring to the staggering financial offers aimed at poaching top talent. Altman said that Meta had tried to recruit several key staff members from OpenAI, but none had accepted the offers. He noted that the company had targeted many individuals, but so far, none of their top talent had taken the bait. He admitted that Meta is aggressively courting top talent from OpenAI, probably because of OpenAI’s paramount role in the AI domain . Its ChatGPT product and research breakthroughs have positioned the company at the heart of the global AI race. Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Altman’s comments. Yet, insiders throughout the tech world admit that the company’s talent poaching tactics are only getting more intense. Zuckerberg heads personal AI hiring blitz Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, is said to be playing an active role in the talent battle, overseeing attempts to hire top researchers and engineers for Meta’s new “superintelligence” division. This new team is a part of Meta’s larger effort to win the general-purpose AI race and to be a direct competitor to companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. One of Meta’s most aggressive steps came last week when it said it would invest $14.3 billion in Scale AI, which provides data labeling and training services for machine learning. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang joined Meta’s AI team as part of the investment in a move that saw a considerable overlap of resources and talent. Meta has also hired leaders from other AI research centers. One of the most high-profile hires is Jack Rae, previously a principal researcher at Google DeepMind. According to Bloomberg , Rae’s move indicates Meta’s commitment to attracting top AI executives, even if it has to outspend rivals. According to Altman, Meta’s aggressive approach is driven by its competitive rivalry with OpenAI. He mentioned that he had heard Meta regards OpenAI as its biggest competitor. OpenAI’s culture beats the billion-dollar bait, Altman says Despite Meta’s exceptionally high offers, Altman expressed confidence that OpenAI could retain its core team. He questioned whether money alone was enough to distract people from meaningful work. He acknowledged that he respected many aspects of Meta but did not believe the company excelled at innovation. Altman said that OpenAI’s mission-driven culture plays a major role in why employees choose to stay, even when presented with large financial offers. He added that there is a cultural risk in turning AI jobs into roles driven purely by compensation, emphasizing that this is not how true innovation happens. Altman also veiled a dig at Meta’s approach, implying that OpenAI can access insights that Meta cannot. He underscored the company’s commitment to open research, responsible development, and thoughtful scaling of AI technologies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The company also revealed its plans to pivot to trading cards. In May 2025, GameStop bought Bitcoin worth around $500 million, and it plans to continue with that strategy. GameStop is following the investment strategy of MicroStrategy, which now owns billions of dollars’ worth of BTC, making it the largest corporate crypto holder. The decision by GameStop to purchase more BTC shows the growing acceptance of crypto in investment circles. While it has led to some losses in the short term, it could pay off in the long term as has been with MicroStrategy. Disappointed by recent losses, GameStop investors have been looking for a way to grow their portfolio out of meme stocks. One of their strategies has been to purchase the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale tokens, which analysts’ forecast could rise 30x or more. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Next-Gen DeFi Project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been touted by analysts as the most innovative DeFi project of 2025. It offers massive earning opportunities for its users, while also supporting the long-term growth of MUTM tokens. On the Mutuum Finance protocol, users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders will deposit their funds into the protocol for a chance to earn passive income via interest payments. The interest rate is dynamically set by the pool utilization rate. As the number of borrowers in a communal pool grows, so does the utilization rate, and thus the interest rate. This rising interest rate pushes borrowers to pay back their loans, while incentivizing more lenders to deposit their assets to benefit from the higher rates. The process leads to a self-balancing loop that ensures optimal capital utilization. To protect lenders assets in the pools, all loans will have to be overcollateralized. The actual level of collateralization will be set by protocol parameters. That will ensure the liquidators have enough of a moat in which to respond in case of price fluctuations. More stable assets that have low volatility, and high liquidity will have smaller overcollateralization requirements, due to their inherent stability. Additionally, the protocol will implement a reserve factor, which is a portion of the interest collected from borrowers. These funds will go into a common pool, and will be used to maintain the stability of the ecosystem. More stable assets like stablecoins will get a reserve factor of as low as 10%, while more volatile assets, like meme coins, will be assigned a reserve factor of up to 35%. Mutuum Finance will also vet all new tokens added to the platform. This will ensure that users are not exposed to dangers such as price manipulation, and infinite minting exploit. Overall, that will guarantee the stability and growth of the ecosystem in the long term. MUTM Token Presale Details Mutuum Finance is currently in phase 5 of the token presale. So far over $10.7 million has been raised from the ongoing presale. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The analysts are optimistic about the future of MUTM tokens, projecting that their price will go up by 2,550% when they go live. This optimistic forecast has been a major driver of the presale, which has seen over 38% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 sold barely two weeks after they launched. Based on the analysts’ forecast, a $2,100 investment in the presale at the current price of $0.03 could grow to $53,550. That is a massive opportunity to grow your crypto portfolio in the long term. Besides the gains in the initial phases of the token launch, analysts expect the token price to continue rising in the long term. A major reason for this rise will be the buy-back program which the team will launch. They will use protocol profits to support the price of MUTM tokens on the open market, which will boost their profile on major exchanges. With the tokens expected to list on several top-tier crypto exchanges, this could lead to a massive boost in participation numbers as traders try to capitalize on the opportunity for more gains. Bottom Line Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are currently on sale for a 50% discount on the planned listing price of $0.06. At this price you stand to make double what those who wait until the tokens go live. This is a rare opportunity in the crypto sector to join a project while it is on the ground floor, and continue to grow your earning long after it goes live.

The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Optis’ case must be tried a refresh in Texas after concluding that the instructions to the jury in the earlier trial were flawed. This decision marks the second time that a nine-figure patent ruling in favor of Optis has been reversed in this case. The uncertainty around the Optis-Apple case stirs up debates in the tech ecosystem Optis and its affiliates sued Apple in 2019 in federal court in Marshall, Texas, accusing the tech giant of infringing its patent rights in the technology behind the LTE wireless standard with its iPhones and other products. In 2020, a jury ruled that the iPhone maker would have to pay Optis $506 million for infringing its patents. In 2021, US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap ordered a retrial on damages, postulating that the amount may not have necessarily covered the duty of Optis to license the essential patents fairly and reasonably. Later that same year, a different jury awarded Optis $300 million in damages after the retrial. The Federal Circuit reversed this award, and the case was remanded for another trial on infringement and related damages. A three-judge panel said Gilstrap erred in consolidating all the patents into a single question for the jury. The appeals court held that the district court’s single-infringement question deprived the iPhone maker of its right to a unanimous verdict concerning each legal claim against it. In a separate ruling last month, a UK court found that Apple owes Optis $502 million for infringing their UK wireless patents. Apple has announced its intention to appeal this decision. A spokesperson for Optis stated that the company is very confident that the court will set a fair payment for the important Optis patents that allow millions of Apple devices to connect at high speeds. The case is known as Optis Cellular Technology LLC v. Apple Inc., US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 22-1925. When asked to comment on the Federal Circuit ruling, neither an attorney nor spokespeople for Apple responded immediately for comments. Optis demands appropriate compensation in Apple’s case London’s High Court in 2023 ruled that Apple should pay Optis $56.43 million plus interest to cover past and future sales over a specific period. The tech firm was accused of using 4G patents in devices, including iPhones and iPads. However, Optis argued that the amount was far too low, and it challenged the ruling in an appeal that was heard in February and March. Later, the court of appeals said the iPhone maker should pay an undivided $502 million, excluding interest, from 2023 to 2027. The payment was associated with a worldwide license for using Optis’ patents. In a statement, an Apple spokesperson said it was disappointed and would appeal the decision. A spokesperson for Optis, however, welcomed the ruling, saying it “categorically corrected” a previous decision it says was “plainly flawed” and had gone far in the right direction to recognize the true worth of its patents on Apple devices. The spokesman also said they will continue seeking fair compensation for Optis’ intellectual property, which connects millions of devices worldwide with high-speed connectivity.

According to a June 16 report by Bloomberg, Cantor Fitzgerald analysts have upgraded their outlook on Solana. The firm highlighted Solana’s growing role in financial applications, thanks to its fast transaction speeds and cost efficiency. Meanwhile, Stellar is gaining more attention for its consistent performance, recording a daily trading volume of over $82.6 million. These signs suggest strong market confidence in utility-driven tokens. Amid this movement, Qubetics ($TICS) is attracting attention with its unique offering and rapidly closing presale. Qubetics is stepping in to solve a major problem: the lack of seamless communication between different blockchains. While Solana and Stellar are proving their value in payments and finance, Qubetics is taking a broader approach by building a unified Web3 experience across networks. With just one presale stage left before listing, it’s shaping up to be one of the top cryptos to invest in today. Qubetics Brings Real-World Use Through Interoperability Qubetics is the first Web3 aggregator designed to link major blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and more—within a single platform. The aim is simple: enable users and businesses to manage their crypto activities without switching between wallets or platforms. For example, a freelance designer working with clients across borders could receive payments in various tokens—such as ETH or SOL—and manage them all within one Qubetics interface. At the same time, a retail business accepting stablecoins from customers can process and reconcile payments across chains quickly. For logistics firms, this application means real-time token tracking and settlement without delays or manual processes. By enabling smoother communication between chains, Qubetics positions itself as a practical solution in everyday operations. This application alone makes it one of the top cryptos to invest in today for anyone looking at long-term utility. Final Stage Alert: Qubetics Presale Offers Rare ROI Opportunity – Top Cryptos to Invest in Today The Qubetics presale has now reached its 37th and final phase, priced at $0.3370. Over 516 million $TICS tokens have been purchased by more than 28,000 token holders, and the total funds raised have already surpassed $18 million. With just 10 million tokens left, this final stage offers a short window before the token lists at $0.40, locking in an instant 20% return for buyers at the current price. Following a major tokenomics revision, Qubetics has reduced its total supply from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion. This move creates scarcity and increases potential long-term value. In addition, by allocating 38.55% of the supply to public participants, the project is shifting toward a more decentralized and user-governed model. Market analysts are already projecting strong growth for $TICS, with estimated future values between $5 and $10. Based on these figures, a $20,000 investment today at $0.3370 would yield 59,347 tokens. At a $5 valuation, that turns into $296,735, and at $10, over $590,000. With listing coming soon, strong demand, and only one stage remaining, the Qubetics presale has become a leading pick among the top cryptos to invest in today . This opportunity is limited, and the momentum is building quickly. For those seeking the best crypto presale of 2025, this could be the right moment to act. Solana Gains Institutional Momentum with Financial Use Case Focus Solana is gaining renewed attention in 2025, not only for its speed and efficiency but also for its growing role in enterprise finance. As highlighted by Bloomberg, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald now rate Solana as “Overweight,” which means they believe it has strong growth potential. The reason is clear—Solana supports up to 65,000 transactions per second and maintains very low transaction fees. These features are attracting traditional financial companies exploring blockchain-based infrastructure. Solana’s ability to handle large transaction volumes without congestion makes it an appealing alternative for financial systems looking to upgrade. This development sets Solana apart as a serious contender among today’s top cryptocurrencies. It’s no longer just a fast blockchain—it’s becoming a bridge between digital assets and mainstream finance, adding real-world use to its technical strength. Stellar Maintains Steady Performance and Real-World Adoption Stellar (XLM), ranked #16 by market cap, has seen its price retreat to $0.2586 after a 5.47% weekly drop, despite maintaining solid fundamentals. With 31.21 billion XLM in circulation out of a 50 billion max supply, XLM holds a market cap of $8.07 billion—just over 62% of its $13 billion unlocked market potential and $12.93 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV). Trading volume in the past 24 hours hit $230.67 million, reflecting a strong 2.85% volume-to-market cap ratio, signaling continued investor interest. Although momentum has cooled, Stellar’s 77% profile score and consistent ecosystem activity keep it firmly on analysts’ watchlists. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss the Chance to Join This Best Crypto Presale Together, Solana, Stellar, and Qubetics represent different strengths in today’s digital asset market. Solana is gaining ground with institutional users due to its speed and enterprise capabilities. Stellar remains dependable with solid trading volume and real-world application in international payments. And then there’s Qubetics—offering a fresh, real-world solution for Web3 adoption with a closing presale that’s drawing widespread attention. With the final stage of its presale nearly over and the listing price already fixed at 20% higher, Qubetics stands out as a clear opportunity. The fundamentals are strong, the demand is rising, and the supply is running low. For those looking to secure value early, this is the time to join this best crypto presale and make a strategic move in 2025’s growing market. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics considered one of the top cryptos to invest in today? Because it solves interoperability issues and is in its final presale phase with high growth projections. What is the price prediction for $TICS after listing?

What return can participants expect at listing? A 20% increase is expected when the token lists at $0.40, up from the current $0.3370 presale price. Is Stellar still a good choice for 2025? Yes.

This drop comes shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF application. The new review deadline has now been pushed to November 2025, adding more uncertainty to the market. XRP Price Analysis: What’s Happening? Looking at XRP’s daily price chart, the market currently shows weak momentum in both directions. The price action remains choppy and range-bound, stuck between $2.10 and $2.35 for now. Unless the price breaks out of this range, traders expect XRP to continue moving sideways in the short term. Important support levels to watch are between $2.10 and $2.05. If XRP falls below this range with confirmation, the next support lies between $1.95 and $1.91, followed by $1.80. On the bullish front, resistance is seen around $2.32 to $2.36. A clear move above this could open the door for a rally towards $2.44 and $2.60. What’s Next for XRP? Despite the recent dip, XRP has been in an uptrend since April’s low. There’s still hope for a fifth wave rally that could push XRP prices above $5 in the long run, but for that to happen, XRP needs to hold support levels and break above recent highs. In the short term, unless XRP can climb past $2.33 and form a clear bullish pattern, the price is expected to remain range-bound, with traders keeping a close watch on whether the market finds a stable support zone soon. Conclusion The SEC’s decision delay has clearly shaken the market, and while long-term bullish hopes remain alive, XRP is currently struggling for momentum. Until a clearer move happens, traders can expect more sideways price action in the coming days.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 02:34:44

Meanwhile, Lightchain AI is rapidly emerging as a pure price buzz machine, capturing intense market attention with its presale momentum. Having raised $20.9 million at a fixed price of $0.007, Lightchain AI’s combination of intelligent infrastructure and strong buyer interest is setting it apart from traditional scaling narratives. While Polygon and Avalanche refine their technical roadmaps, Lightchain AI is commanding buzz and action from investors eager for the next big breakout, positioning itself as a major player in the evolving crypto landscape. Polygon and Avalanche Focus on Layer Expansion and Scalability Polygon and Avalanche are both resolving blockchain scalability differently but very creatively. Polygon’s AggLayer is a permissionless interoperability protocol, written with a zero-knowledge core, which will consolidate the fragmented blockchain market into a single cohesive ecosystem. Compatible with Proof Aggegration ＆ State Verification AggLayer can realize secure cross-chain communication, asset transfer, and shared liquidity among multitudinous chains by aggregating proofs and verifying state chains. With such an architecture it is possible to achieve near seamless interoperation of heterogenous chains, offering a user experience that can be considered as though there is a single chain. Avalanche, on the contrary, uses a subnet design that enables developers to roll their own, application-specific blockchains. With the Avalanche9000, the cost and complexity of rolling out these subnets have decreased, resulting in a boom of Layer 1 networks in its ecosystem. Features like Interchain Messaging (ICM) and Interchain Token Transfers (ICTT) deliver native, safe communication and asset transfer across subnets, removing the need for external bridges and solidifying Cosmos’ commitment to interoperability. They’re both trying to solve the “scalability trilemma” with modular networks, which they hope we be able to interoperate while also achieving the same security and decentralization. Our AggLayer for Polygon emphasizes the consolidation of chains instead of sharding between chains using zero-knowledge proofs, while Avalanche subnets are composable, sovereign networks with native cross-subnet capabilities. Lightchain AI Generates Intense Buzz Across Price Charts Lightchain AI is generating intense buzz across price charts as aggressive buying activity pushes its Bonus Round into the spotlight. With token pricing fixed at $0.007 and over $20.9 million raised, momentum is building fast ahead of the mainnet launch. What sets Lightchain AI apart is its AI-integrated Layer 1 chain, powered by decentralized validator and contributor nodes that execute real-time AI tasks through the proprietary AIVM. The complete removal of the original 5% team allocation—and its reallocation to grants and ecosystem incentives—has only amplified investor confidence. As buyers track volume spikes and chart activity, Lightchain AI’s quiet but forceful rise is commanding attention. It’s not just hype—it’s infrastructure-backed movement with massive growth signals pulsing beneath the surface. Market Buzz- Lightchain AI Takes Industry by Storm Lightchain AI is making waves in the industry with its Bonus Round and highly anticipated mainnet launch just around the corner. With token pricing locked at an accessible $0.007 and a staggering $20.9 million already raised, excitement is at an all-time high. Traders and developers are rushing to join the action, drawn by its cutting-edge AI-integrated Layer 1 design, open-source code, and decentralized node structure.

Additionally, rising stablecoin inflows to exchanges indicate growing buy-side liquidity, reinforcing the market’s bullish sentiment. Bitcoin Whales Foreseeing Major Rally Ahead? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin whales recorded one of the largest BTC outflows from Binance this month. The chart below shows that nearly 4,500 BTC were withdrawn on June 16. Bitcoin whales are defined as wallet addresses with significant BTC holdings. Past data suggests that such large withdrawals from whales have typically preceded price rallies, as they reflect a reduction in BTC exchange reserves, leaving fewer coins readily available for trading. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Beyond this large-scale withdrawal, on-chain data also reveals dwindling BTC inflows to exchanges from both whales and retail investors. This combination of major outflows and low deposits could be laying the groundwork for a Bitcoin “supply crunch.” For the uninitiated, a Bitcoin supply crunch occurs when the available BTC on exchanges declines sharply, reducing the immediate supply for buyers. This happens when long-term holders or whales withdraw BTC to cold storage, creating upward pressure on price as demand outpaces liquid supply. Stablecoin Inflows Witness Sharp Increase In parallel with Bitcoin’s exchange exodus, stablecoin inflows to Binance have surged in recent days. Notably, over $400 million in stablecoins flowed in on both June 13 and 15. Historically, such significant stablecoin inflows have been linked to buy-side liquidity preparation. In other words, large investors appear ready to deploy capital into crypto assets like BTC, reflecting renewed risk appetite. Taha concluded: The aggressive Bitcoin withdrawals and concurrent stablecoin deposits create a supply-demand asymmetry. With fewer BTC available on exchanges and growing liquidity to fuel buys, the stage is set for a potential price breakout. Meanwhile, additional exchange data supports the case for further upside in BTC. For example, the coin has been experiencing consistently negative funding rates on Binance – often a precursor to short squeezes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000 At the same time, Bitcoin’s long-term holder Realized Cap recently surpassed $20 billion, underscoring rising confidence among seasoned investors. In addition, despite the ongoing BTC rally, retail participation remains relatively low, suggesting further room for growth. However, short-term holders are showing signs of caution, increasing their selling amid recent price corrections. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,575, down 1.0% in the past 24 hours.

The global crypto market cap has dropped by 4.47% to $3.18 trillion, with top assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all sliding in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,954, down over 2%, while Ethereum has fallen to $2,522 after a 2.66% dip. XRP has been hit even harder, plunging over 9% to $2.16 as traders react to both market volatility and delays in its ETF decision. Altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin are also under pressure, with Cardano sliding 3.5% and Dogecoin shedding over 2%. The Fear & Greed Index now stands at 48. Geopolitical Tensions Adding to the Pressure Adding fuel to the fire is the latest escalation in the Iran-Israel conflict. Reports confirmed that Iran has showcased its hyper-ballistic missiles, capable of targeting Tel Aviv and bypassing Israel’s Iron Dome. In response, Israel bombed Iran’s state-run broadcast station in a bold move aimed at silencing propaganda. Meanwhile, the U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly left a G7 summit in Canada to return to Washington, sparking rumors of an imminent U.S. intervention. Trump warned citizens to immediately evacuate Tehran, posting on Truth Social that Iran “should have signed the deal” and hinted at the possibility of severe military action. Polymarket odds of U.S. involvement surged to 70%, raising concerns on Wall Street and in crypto markets alike. Price Prediction: Could Bitcoin Drop to $100K? If tensions continue to rise and the U.S. signals direct involvement, Bitcoin could test the psychological $100,000 support level in the coming sessions. A break below that could open the door for a sharper drop toward the $92,000–$95,000 zone, a region traders have been eyeing as a possible pullback target.

The vote, which cleared the chamber 68 to 30, marks the first time the Senate has advanced a regulatory framework specifically for stablecoins, a fast-growing corner of the digital asset industry. Backed by 18 Democrats and most Republicans, the bill moves next to the House of Representatives, where lawmakers have been working on a similar framework. If the House passes a reconciled version, the legislation will head to President Donald Trump’s desk, aligning with the administration’s push to formalize crypto policy before the August recess. The U.S. Senate has passed the GENIUS Act — landmark stablecoin legislation that provides regulatory clarity, enhances consumer protection, and extends U.S. dollar dominance online. Thanks to President Trump for his leadership on crypto & @SenatorHagerty for authoring the bill. — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) June 17, 2025 Senate Bill Demands Monthly Disclosures and Hard Asset Backing for Stablecoin Issuers Rep. Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sponsored the bill, called the passage a defining moment for US financial infrastructure. “The prospect of faster and cheaper payments will have far-reaching implications for our financial system,” he said on the Senate floor. “Stablecoins are a paradigm-shifting development that can bring our payment system into the 21st century.” The GENIUS Act, short for “Guaranteeing Essential National Infrastructure Using Stablecoins,” seeks to regulate dollar-backed digital tokens often used to transfer funds across blockchain networks. The bill would require stablecoins to be fully backed by liquid assets like US dollars or Treasury bills and mandate monthly public disclosures of those reserves. It also limits stablecoin issuance to licensed institutions and bars current federal officials from launching their own tokens. Concerns Over Foreign Money and Ethical Gaps Nearly Stopped the GENIUS Act But the road to Tuesday’s vote was anything but smooth. In May, the bill stalled after Democrats raised concerns about national security risks and ethics loopholes. Revelations that an Abu Dhabi firm planned to invest in Binance using stablecoins issued by a Trump-linked company heightened those fears, prompting calls for stricter guardrails. Weeks of closed-door negotiations followed. Key changes included stricter ethics disclosures for officials holding stablecoins, added protections for bank customers in the event of bankruptcy, and a Treasury mandate to oversee suspicious activity. These revisions helped win back enough Democrats to push the bill through. Senate Vote Draws Praise for Safeguards, But Concerns Linger Over Loopholes Even so, critics remained. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a longtime crypto skeptic, warned that the bill still falls short. “This is a bill that was written by the industry,” she said, adding that it “will supercharge the profitability of Donald Trump’s crypto corruption while it undercuts consumer protection.” Supporters of the legislation, however, argued that leaving the sector unregulated would only increase risk. Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who helped draft the bill, called the digital asset space a “wild West.” She said consumers remain exposed and companies still lack regulatory clarity. While she acknowledged concerns about Trump’s crypto ties, she argued those should not derail efforts to bring order to the industry. Liat Shetret, vice president of global policy and regulation at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, called the Senate vote “a pivotal step in shaping the country’s digital asset future.” She added, “It’s clear that robust consumer protections and market integrity safeguards were central to driving approval, and the GENIUS Act benefited from strong nonpartisan support.” The House is expected to take up the legislation in the coming weeks. While some industry advocates have urged rapid passage, others, including the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, are pressing for key changes to address potential risks to financial stability. The final shape of the bill may still shift before it lands on the president’s desk.

The bipartisan support signals Ohio’s push to become a cryptocurrency and blockchain technology leader. The bill, introduced by Republican Representative Steve Demetriou, is part of a growing national trend to protect the rights of digital asset holders. It now heads to the full Ohio House of Representatives for debate and a vote. Before the vote, Demetriou said it was a historic day for the state, adding that they were laying a foundation to support new technologies and provide Ohioans with greater financial control. He acknowledged committee members for coming out to take a vote for the bill. The unanimous vote represents the increasing political consensus surrounding the importance of delivering straightforward legal safeguards for digital asset users at the state level. Ohio moves to protect self-custody and mining The bill protecting self-custody mining may be problematic for those discussing financial sovereignty or DeFi, where advocates argue that self-custody is endemic to the crypto ecosystem. The bill would also protect the rights of the residents and companies there to run blockchain nodes and mine for virtual currencies. Those activities are essential to operating decentralized systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which verify transactions and secure the network. In protecting those rights in statute, the hope is that Ohio can lure businesses building a blockchain infrastructure and avoid the sort of regulatory crackdown that has recently materialized in other states. HB 116 also brings in a $200 exclusion from state capital gains tax on the gains resulting from transactions of digital assets. The amendment is intended to relieve small crypto users targeted by the tax man – traders who make low-worth purchases or peer-to-peer transfers. Supporters say the exemption will help spur everyday use of digital currencies, allowing residents to easily use Bitcoin and digital assets like it, like payments, tipping, and other low-cost transactions without tax complexity. Ohio’s initiative aims to spur adoption and pilot responsible crypto integration in the consumer capacity, supporting this small tax break. The move is also in line with national conversations around making tax treatment of digital assets easier and lifting regulatory barriers for users. Supporters of cryptocurrencies hail an advance in the House HB 116 still needs approval from the full state legislature and the governor’s signature, but its unanimous committee vote shows strong bipartisan support for crypto policy in Ohio. If passed, it could position the state as one of the most crypto-friendly in the country. The legislation is widely viewed as a strong signal that Ohio was trying to set itself up as a leader in the digital economy. The states that move early will likely be in the best position to gain from the next wave of innovation. Still, not everyone is fully convinced. Critics warn the bill could create regulatory gaps and raise concerns about consumer protection. Others worried that the measure could be at odds with local environmental or energy priorities, negating the ability to regulate mining.

As dilemmas mount, can Solana rise to the occasion and dethrone the altcoin king? This article dives into Ethereum's struggles and explores whether Solana or other contenders are poised for a breakthrough. Discover which cryptocurrencies are positioned for growth in this dynamic market. Ethereum Price Outlook: Mixed Short-Term Gains Versus Longer-Term Losses Over the past month, Ethereum climbed by approximately 3.9%, while its performance over the last six months declined nearly 29.1%. Price movements oscillated between approximately $1,900 and $2,962, with recent gains suggesting some resilience amidst longer-term weakness. Market sentiment has shown slight improvements, leading to renewed buying interest despite a prolonged period of downward pressure. Volatility has been significant, highlighting recovery efforts that contrast with the broader six-month decline. While a modest monthly rise is visible, it is overshadowed by the substantial drop over the previous half year. Ethereum's fluctuations reflect a balance between cautious optimism and entrenched bearish trends. Current price levels range from $1,923.57 to $2,961.91. Immediate resistance appears around $3,395.40, with a farther barrier near $4,433.74. Key support levels are at $1,318.72 and an additional deeper support near $280.38. Bulls show some strength with a positive monthly return and a momentum indicator near 46.24. However, a negative awesome oscillator and a weekly decline of roughly 4% indicate selling pressure. The relative strength index at about 51.85 leaves the trend unclear, suggesting a balanced market. Traders should monitor key levels for potential entry points while managing risk with tight stop-loss orders in this uncertain environment. Solana Price Trends: Past Declines and a Consolidative Current Range SOL experienced a 5.84% weekly drop and an 8.60% decline over the past month. Over the last six months, the coin fell by 26.61%, marking a period of sustained downward movement. The price trajectory over these timeframes indicates a consistent bearish influence that has kept momentum subdued, with gradual but steady declines reflecting persistent market pressure. SOL is currently trading between $136.17 and $182.20, with immediate resistance at $207.90 and support at $115.84. The indicators, including an Awesome Oscillator at -12.94 and an RSI at 45.58, suggest that bearish sentiment outweighs bullish forces at this time. There is no clear trend, as price remains confined within these key levels. A move above $207.90 could test higher resistance, while a drop toward $115.84 may signal further downside risk. Careful positioning and attention to these technical levels are essential for trading strategies. Conclusion ETH remains a significant player but faces challenges. Its competitors, like SOL , offer faster and cheaper transactions. Interest in SOL has grown, and some believe it could someday surpass ETH. However, ETH's established presence and ongoing upgrades keep it in a strong position. The competition will likely continue, with both coins having their strengths and followers.

Recent comments attributed to U.S. Vice President Vance regarding the potential for further action by the Trump Administration against the Iran Nuclear Program have resurfaced, highlighting a significant source of Geopolitical Risk that could influence the Cryptocurrency Market . According to reports citing Arab TV via JinSe Finance, VP Vance suggested that President Donald Trump might be considering renewed or escalated measures concerning Iran’s nuclear activities. While the specifics of any potential ‘further action’ remain unclear, the mere possibility introduces uncertainty into the global landscape. Understanding Geopolitical Risk and Its Market Impact What exactly is Geopolitical Risk ? It refers to the potential for political events or instability in one country or region to negatively impact the interests of another country or global markets. This can include: Military conflicts or threats Sanctions and trade disputes Political instability or regime change Terrorism Historically, markets react sharply to perceived increases in geopolitical tension. Traditional assets like oil often see price spikes, while ‘safe haven’ assets like gold or certain government bonds might appreciate. Stock markets, conversely, often experience declines due to increased uncertainty and potential disruption to trade and economic activity. How Could the Iran Nuclear Program Situation Affect the Cryptocurrency Market? The connection between geopolitical events concerning the Iran Nuclear Program and the Cryptocurrency Market might not be immediately obvious, but it’s a crucial one in today’s interconnected financial world. Here’s why: Increased Market Volatility: Geopolitical uncertainty is a major driver of Market Volatility across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. News suggesting potential conflict or significant policy shifts can lead to rapid price swings as investors react to perceived risks. Investor Sentiment: Heightened global tensions can negatively impact overall investor sentiment, leading to a broader risk-off environment where investors pull back from speculative assets, which often includes cryptocurrencies. Safe Haven Narrative (Debated): Some proponents argue that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can act as a digital safe haven during times of political or economic turmoil, independent of traditional financial systems. However, this narrative is heavily debated, and crypto markets often correlate with traditional risk assets like stocks during periods of stress. Sanctions and Financial Systems: While not directly stated in Vance’s reported comments, ‘further action’ could potentially involve stricter financial sanctions against Iran. Discussions around sanctions sometimes touch upon the use of cryptocurrencies to bypass traditional financial channels, although this is a complex and controversial topic with significant regulatory scrutiny. The potential for action from the Trump Administration regarding the Iran Nuclear Program adds another layer of complexity to the existing global political landscape. Investors in the Cryptocurrency Market should remain aware that such developments contribute to the overall macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop that influences asset prices. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For those navigating the often-turbulent waters of the Cryptocurrency Market , paying attention to geopolitical signals like the reported comments from VP Vance is important. While it’s impossible to predict market movements based on one statement, understanding the potential sources of Market Volatility is key to informed decision-making. Consider these points: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of major geopolitical developments, particularly those involving significant global powers and regions prone to instability. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand how potential increases in Market Volatility due to geopolitical events fit within your personal investment strategy and risk tolerance. Diversification: Geopolitical risk underscores the importance of a diversified portfolio, although diversification within crypto or across different asset classes is a personal choice. The reported comments serve as a reminder that external political factors, even those seemingly distant from the blockchain world, can contribute to the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency prices. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating Uncertainty VP Vance’s reported remarks about the Trump Administration potentially taking ‘further action’ on the Iran Nuclear Program highlight an ongoing source of Geopolitical Risk . This risk contributes to global uncertainty and can be a significant factor driving Market Volatility , including within the sensitive Cryptocurrency Market . While the direct impact is complex and debated, staying informed about such developments is essential for investors seeking to understand the broader forces influencing digital asset prices. Geopolitical tensions add another layer to the already complex analysis required when investing in cryptocurrencies.

Currently, a notable trend is emerging: a surprising level of restraint despite brewing geopolitical events that have historically triggered significant reactions in the crypto market . This calm stands in stark contrast to past episodes, raising questions about the market’s evolving maturity and future trajectory. While the immediate reaction has been muted, some analysts warn that this tranquility might be temporary, hinting at potential increases in market volatility ahead. How Have Bitcoin Traders Reacted to Geopolitical Events Historically? Historically, the Bitcoin price has often been sensitive to global uncertainties. Geopolitical tensions, economic crises, or significant political shifts have frequently led to pronounced movements in the crypto market . This reaction was often attributed to Bitcoin’s nascent nature and its perception as a risk-on asset or, paradoxically, a potential safe haven in times of traditional market instability, leading to unpredictable swings. Consider past instances: Sudden Shocks: Events like unexpected military conflicts or major economic policy shifts in key global economies have often caused sharp sell-offs or rapid price pumps as traders reacted swiftly to perceived threats or opportunities. Amplified Volatility: In less mature market phases, even relatively minor geopolitical news could be amplified, leading to significant market volatility . A 5% downtrend, for example, was often accompanied by aggressive short selling, panic-driven spot selling, and rapid price swings. Herd Mentality: Early on, the crypto market was more susceptible to herd behavior, where fear or greed spread quickly through social media and forums, prompting coordinated (or uncoordinated) buying or selling frenzies among Bitcoin traders . This historical context makes the current restraint observed among Bitcoin traders particularly noteworthy. Why Are Bitcoin Traders Showing Restraint Now? Despite a backdrop of ongoing global tensions, including regional conflicts and economic uncertainties, the typical panic response from Bitcoin traders appears subdued. As reported by Cointelegraph, pseudonymous analyst “Skew” highlighted this unusual calm. Even with a recent correction of around 3% in the Bitcoin price , the widespread panic seen in previous downtrends has not materialized. Several factors could be contributing to this altered behavior: Market Maturity: The crypto market is significantly larger and more established than it was during earlier geopolitical events. Increased institutional participation and a broader understanding of Bitcoin among retail investors may lead to more measured responses rather than impulsive reactions. Desensitization: Perhaps Bitcoin traders are becoming somewhat desensitized to the constant stream of global news. Unless an event directly and immediately impacts financial markets or infrastructure, it might not trigger the same level of alarm it once did. Focus on Fundamentals: Traders might be placing greater emphasis on Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals, such as network growth, adoption rates, and upcoming protocol developments, rather than reacting solely to external macro events. Holding Strong (HODLing): A significant portion of the market consists of long-term holders who are less likely to sell based on short-term geopolitical news, preferring to ride out periods of uncertainty. This collective restraint suggests a potential shift in how the crypto market processes external shocks. There has been no major movement yet, indicating a ‘wait and see’ approach from many participants. Could Market Volatility Be On the Horizon? While the current calm is notable, analyst Skew’s warning about a potential increase in market volatility soon cannot be ignored. Restraint does not equate to stagnation, and several factors could disrupt the current equilibrium. Potential triggers for increased volatility include: Escalation of Geopolitical Events: Should global tensions escalate significantly or impact major economic powers more directly, the current restraint could break, leading to rapid price movements. Unexpected Economic Data: Surprise inflation reports, changes in interest rate policies from major central banks, or signs of recession could quickly shift market sentiment and increase market volatility . Regulatory Developments: New regulations (positive or negative) concerning cryptocurrencies in major jurisdictions can have a profound impact on the crypto market . Large Whale Movements: Significant buying or selling activity from large holders (whales) can independently trigger volatility, especially in a market that is currently exhibiting low momentum. The lack of aggressive selling currently observed doesn’t mean the market is immune to future shocks. It might simply mean traders are waiting for a clearer signal or a more significant catalyst before making major moves. The current low volatility could be the calm before a storm, potentially setting the stage for a sharp move once a direction is established. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Traders Given the current environment of restraint coupled with the warning of potential future market volatility , how should Bitcoin traders navigate these waters? Here are some actionable insights: Strategy Description Benefit/Purpose Stay Informed Keep track of both geopolitical developments and on-chain analytics. Understand potential catalysts for volatility and market sentiment. Define Risk Tolerance Determine how much capital you are willing to risk on any single trade or investment. Avoid emotional decisions during periods of high volatility. Use Stop-Loss Orders Implement stop-loss orders to automatically limit potential losses if the Bitcoin price moves against your position. Protect capital during sudden downturns. Consider Diversification Don’t put all your capital into Bitcoin. Explore other assets or strategies. Reduce overall portfolio risk. Avoid Leverage (or Use Cautiously) High leverage can amplify gains but also losses, making it extremely risky during periods of high market volatility . Prevent rapid liquidation of positions. The current restraint offers an opportunity for careful observation and planning. Rather than reacting impulsively to every headline, focusing on a well-defined trading or investment strategy is paramount. Understanding that the lack of immediate panic doesn’t guarantee future stability is key. Conclusion: A Mature Market or Just a Pause? The current behavior of Bitcoin traders , marked by restraint in the face of significant geopolitical events , suggests a potential maturation of the crypto market . Unlike previous periods where even minor tremors caused widespread panic and significant market volatility , the market has absorbed recent pressures with relative calm. The 3% correction, while a price drop, hasn’t triggered the aggressive selling seen historically, particularly when the Bitcoin price experienced larger downturns. However, the warning from analysts like Skew serves as a crucial reminder that this period of low momentum might be temporary. The underlying pressures from geopolitical events and macroeconomic factors haven’t disappeared, and a catalyst could still emerge to trigger increased volatility. For Bitcoin traders , this period is less about complacency and more about strategic positioning, careful risk management, and staying informed about potential shifts that could impact the crypto market dynamics and the future Bitcoin price action.

While digital assets operate on decentralized networks, they are inherently linked to broader geopolitical and economic forces. Recent statements regarding US Iran tensions highlight a potential flashpoint that could significantly influence market sentiment and price movements in the crypto space. What’s Happening: The Core Statement on Airspace Control According to reports, U.S. President Trump made a notable assertion: the United States holds “complete control” over Iran’s airspace. This declaration suggests a significant level of dominance over Iranian defense capabilities, claiming that their systems, despite their numbers, are not effective against U.S. technology and strategy. Such statements, particularly concerning sensitive geopolitical regions and military control, immediately raise the temperature of international relations. Key takeaways from this specific claim include: A direct assertion of U.S. military superiority in a critical operational domain. Implications about the effectiveness of Iran’s air defense infrastructure. Potential escalation of rhetoric in an already tense relationship. While the immediate focus of such a statement is military and political, its ripples extend far beyond borders, impacting global markets, including the burgeoning sector of digital assets. How Do Geopolitical Events Like US Iran Tensions Influence Crypto? It might seem counterintuitive that a statement about airspace control in the Middle East could affect Bitcoin or Ethereum prices. However, global markets are interconnected. Geopolitical events introduce uncertainty, and uncertainty often leads to shifts in investor behavior. Here’s how events like heightened US Iran tensions can matter to crypto: Risk-Off Sentiment: Increased tension can cause investors to move away from perceived ‘riskier’ assets. Historically, cryptocurrencies have been seen as high-risk, high-reward investments. A surge in geopolitical uncertainty can trigger sell-offs as investors seek safety in traditional havens like government bonds or gold. Macroeconomic Stability Concerns: Major international conflicts or standoffs can disrupt trade routes, impact oil prices, and affect global economic forecasts. A deteriorating macroeconomic outlook can dampen enthusiasm for speculative assets. Sanctions and Financial Systems: Tensions can lead to new or intensified sanctions. While crypto is often discussed as a tool to circumvent traditional financial systems and sanctions, increased regulatory scrutiny on crypto exchanges and transactions could arise in response, potentially impacting liquidity and accessibility. Search for Alternatives: Conversely, some proponents argue that crypto, particularly Bitcoin, could serve as a hedge against geopolitical instability and currency devaluation, positioning it as a digital alternative to traditional safe haven assets . We’ll explore this more below. Analyzing the Potential Crypto Market Impact Predicting the exact crypto market impact of geopolitical events is challenging because the market is influenced by numerous factors. However, we can identify potential scenarios based on past reactions and market dynamics. In times of rising tension, we often observe: Increased Volatility: Prices can swing wildly as news develops and market sentiment shifts rapidly. Correlation with Traditional Markets: Crypto sometimes correlates with tech stocks or other risk assets, meaning a downturn in the broader market due to geopolitical fears can drag crypto prices down. Divergent Narratives: The debate intensifies between crypto as a speculative tech asset and crypto as a censorship-resistant, sovereign store of value (a potential safe haven). Consider how different asset classes *might* react: Asset Class Potential Reaction to Geopolitical Tension Why? Gold Typically Rises Historical safe haven, store of value, limited supply. Government Bonds (e.g., US Treasuries) Demand Increases (Yields Fall) Perceived safety, backing by stable governments. Stocks (General) Typically Falls Increased uncertainty impacts corporate earnings and economic outlook. Oil Volatile (Often Rises if Supply Threatened) Middle East is a major production region; tension can disrupt supply. Cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) Volatile (Reaction Varies) Depends on whether ‘risk-off’ or ‘digital safe haven’ narrative dominates; market maturity is a factor. The unique aspect of crypto is its relatively short history compared to gold or bonds, meaning its consistent behavior during various types of crises is still being established. Therefore, assessing the crypto market impact requires careful observation. Is Crypto a True Safe Haven Asset Amidst Geopolitical Risk? The question of whether Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies function as safe haven assets during periods of heightened geopolitical risk is a subject of ongoing debate within the financial community. Arguments for Crypto as a Safe Haven: Decentralization: Not controlled by any single government or central bank, making it resistant to political interference or seizure in the same way traditional assets might be. Border-Agnostic: Can be sent and received globally without reliance on traditional financial intermediaries, potentially useful in regions facing sanctions or capital controls. Scarcity (for some): Assets like Bitcoin have a fixed supply, which proponents argue makes them resistant to inflation and currency debasement caused by economic instability often linked to geopolitical issues. Arguments Against Crypto as a Safe Haven: High Volatility: Crypto markets are notoriously volatile, often experiencing significant price drops that make them seem risky rather than safe during crises. Correlation with Risk Assets: At times, crypto prices move in tandem with tech stocks and other risk-on assets, suggesting it’s not yet acting as an uncorrelated safe haven. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for crypto introduces its own layer of risk. Limited Adoption as Store of Value (Compared to Gold): While growing, its history and widespread acceptance as a primary store of value during crises are limited compared to gold. Ultimately, while some investors may turn to crypto as a hedge against specific types of geopolitical risk (like currency controls), its overall price action during global crises is often characterized by increased market volatility , making its role as a consistent safe haven debatable for many. Navigating Market Volatility Triggered by Geopolitical Risk Statements like the one concerning Iran’s airspace serve as reminders that global events can introduce significant market volatility . For cryptocurrency investors, understanding this connection is crucial. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders: Stay Informed: Pay attention not only to crypto-specific news but also to major global geopolitical developments, especially those involving major powers or critical regions. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how comfortable you are with potential price swings driven by external factors. Diversify (Even Within Crypto): Don’t put all your funds into a single asset. Consider different types of crypto or other asset classes based on your strategy. Consider Long-Term Strategy: Short-term geopolitical noise can be distracting. If you believe in the long-term potential of crypto, temporary volatility might be less concerning. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Sudden news can trigger panic selling or impulsive buying. Stick to a pre-defined strategy rather than reacting emotionally to market swings. Geopolitical events are just one factor, but they can be powerful catalysts for sudden shifts in market dynamics, amplifying existing trends or creating new ones. The Broader Context of Geopolitical Risk and Digital Finance The connection between geopolitical risk and the digital asset space extends beyond immediate price reactions. It touches upon the very narratives surrounding cryptocurrency. For instance, the idea of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ or a tool for financial sovereignty gains traction when trust in traditional institutions or currencies is shaken by political instability or international disputes. Conversely, increased geopolitical tension can also lead to calls for stricter international regulation of crypto to prevent its use in illicit finance or sanctions evasion. The statement about control over Iran’s airspace, while specific, is part of a larger pattern of global power dynamics that investors in decentralized assets cannot afford to ignore. These dynamics shape regulatory approaches, influence mainstream adoption, and ultimately contribute to the overall perception and valuation of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in a Connected World President Trump’s assertion about U.S. control over Iran’s airspace is a significant geopolitical statement. While seemingly distant from the world of blockchain and digital currencies, such events are integral to the complex web of factors influencing global financial markets. They highlight the ever-present reality of geopolitical risk and its potential to trigger significant market volatility . For those invested in or interested in the digital asset space, understanding how developments like rising US Iran tensions can impact the market is crucial. While the debate continues on whether crypto, particularly Bitcoin, truly functions as one of the primary safe haven assets , there is no doubt that these events contribute to the broader economic climate in which cryptocurrencies operate. Staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a clear investment strategy are paramount in navigating a market increasingly susceptible to global headlines.

If they cashed out, the potential windfall from a mere $620 investment during Ethereum’s genesis would represent an eye-watering 8,270x return. A Long Sleep Ends According to blockchain data tracker Lookonchain, the dormant wallet first signaled life by moving a tiny fraction of ETH, just 0.002 coins, less than an hour before the main deposits started. Then, over the past two days, the holder systematically split and transferred the whole stash to Binance across multiple transactions, the largest being nearly 1,000 ETH. Even though this movement of funds has coincided with a period of intense volatility for ETH caused by geopolitical shockwaves from the ongoing military conflict between Israel and Iran, the Ethereum veteran could make as much as $5.2 million from their holding, potentially selling each coin for more than $2,600 as things stand, after buying them for approximately $0.31 a piece in 2014. Ethereum Price Action The Israel-Iran conflict saw the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap plunge dramatically, falling from $2,760 to a low of $2,470 within hours. The more than 10% drop erased ETH’s recent surge to a 15-week high near $2,830. Additionally, over $1 billion in leveraged positions across the market were liquidated, with Binance data revealing concentrated ETH long liquidations between $2,650 and $2,430. Following the retracement, Ethereum has shown a measure of resilience, climbing about 3.2% over the past week to stay head and shoulders above the wider crypto market, which dipped roughly 2.7% in the same period. At press time, the asset was up 3.9% in the last 24 hours, hovering around $2,616, after oscillating between $2,494 and $2,628. Still, the altcoin is down 26.6% across the past 12 months, and more than 46% shy of its all-time high of $4,878 set some three years ago.

The firm plans to allocate a substantial $50 million into Hyperliquid (HYPE) as part of a newly established treasury strategy . This decision, reported by JinSe Finance, positions Eyenovia among a growing list of companies exploring alternatives to traditional cash reserves. Why Would a Biotech Firm Make a Crypto Investment ? It might seem counterintuitive for a company focused on ophthalmic therapeutics like Eyenovia to venture into the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. However, several factors could drive such a decision: Diversification: Companies often seek to diversify their treasury holdings beyond cash and short-term bonds to potentially mitigate risks associated with inflation and currency devaluation. Potential for Growth: Cryptocurrencies, while risky, offer the potential for higher returns compared to low-yield traditional assets, especially in a low-interest-rate environment (though rates have risen recently, the principle of seeking yield persists). Inflation Hedge: Some proponents view certain digital assets as a potential hedge against inflation, similar to gold, although this is a debated topic. Technological Alignment: While not directly related to biotech, embracing innovative financial technologies can sometimes align with a company’s overall forward-thinking ethos. Eyenovia’s specific rationale for choosing Hyperliquid (HYPE) for its treasury strategy is particularly noteworthy. Understanding the Choice: What is Hyperliquid ( HYPE )? Hyperliquid is a relatively new but rapidly growing decentralized perpetual exchange. It aims to provide a high-performance trading experience with low latency and high throughput, often seen as a competitor to centralized exchanges for derivatives trading. The HYPE token is the native asset of the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Investing in HYPE specifically, rather than just Bitcoin or Ethereum, suggests a deeper dive into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space or a belief in the specific growth potential of the Hyperliquid platform and its token. This moves beyond a simple ‘store of value’ argument often used for Bitcoin treasury holdings and leans more towards an investment in a specific protocol or ecosystem. Key aspects of Hyperliquid and its token might include: Focus on perpetual futures trading. Decentralized architecture. Potential utility or staking benefits associated with the HYPE token within the platform. Eyenovia’s allocation of $50 million into this specific asset class represents a significant commitment. The Concept of a Corporate Treasury Strategy in Crypto Traditionally, corporate treasury management focuses on preserving capital, ensuring liquidity, and maximizing yield on short-term assets with minimal risk. Holdings typically include cash, money market funds, and short-term government or corporate bonds. Integrating cryptocurrencies like HYPE into this strategy is a departure from the norm and involves establishing new policies and infrastructure. A corporate crypto treasury strategy requires: Clear Investment Thesis: Defining the goals of the crypto allocation (e.g., diversification, long-term growth, inflation hedge). Asset Selection Criteria: Deciding which specific cryptocurrencies to hold and why. Risk Management Framework: Establishing protocols for volatility, security, custody, and regulatory compliance. Custody Solutions: Securing the digital assets through reputable and secure custodians. Accounting and Reporting: Navigating the complex accounting and tax implications of holding volatile digital assets. Eyenovia embarking on this path highlights a potential shift in how companies view and manage their reserves in the digital age. What Are the Potential Benefits for Eyenovia ? The primary potential benefits for Eyenovia from this $50 million crypto investment could include: Potential Capital Appreciation: If Hyperliquid and the HYPE token perform well, the investment could significantly increase the value of Eyenovia’s treasury holdings. Enhanced Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class (crypto often has low correlation with traditional markets) can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk, depending on market conditions. Signaling Innovation: Making such a move could be perceived by investors and the market as the company being forward-thinking and adaptable. However, it’s crucial to consider the flip side. What Are the Risks and Challenges? Investing in cryptocurrencies, especially specific altcoins like HYPE , comes with significant risks: Extreme Volatility: Crypto markets are known for dramatic price swings, which could lead to substantial losses on the invested capital. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential risks related to compliance and future restrictions. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures to protect against hacking, theft, or loss of private keys. Market Risk: The success of the HYPE investment is tied to the performance of the Hyperliquid platform and the broader crypto market. Public Perception: Such an investment might be viewed critically by some stakeholders who prefer more conservative treasury management. Eyenovia will need to carefully manage these risks as part of its new treasury strategy . Is This a Trend? Corporate Adoption of Crypto Investment While still not mainstream, corporate crypto investment in treasury reserves gained prominence with companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla allocating significant portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin. Eyenovia’s move is interesting because it targets a specific DeFi token ( HYPE ) rather than just Bitcoin or Ethereum. This could indicate a potential evolution in corporate crypto adoption, moving beyond just the largest, most established assets to exploring opportunities within specific sectors of the crypto market, like DeFi or specific protocol tokens. However, it remains to be seen if this becomes a widespread trend or remains limited to a few pioneering companies. Other companies exploring crypto or blockchain technology do so for different reasons, such as integrating blockchain into their operations, offering crypto payments, or launching NFTs, rather than just for treasury purposes. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for Eyenovia and HYPE ? For Eyenovia , this $50 million allocation represents a significant portion of capital being exposed to a high-risk, high-reward asset class. The success of this part of their treasury strategy will depend heavily on the performance of the Hyperliquid platform and the broader crypto market conditions. For Hyperliquid and the HYPE token, receiving a $50 million investment from a publicly traded biotech company is a notable validation. It could potentially attract more attention to the platform and its token, although the price impact will ultimately depend on market dynamics and the structure of the investment. Investors in Eyenovia will likely be watching this treasury move closely, evaluating how it impacts the company’s financial stability and growth prospects alongside its core biotech operations. Conclusion: A Bold Step into Digital Assets Eyenovia ‘s decision to invest $50 million into Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) for its treasury strategy is a bold and unconventional step for a biotech firm. It underscores the increasing, albeit cautious, exploration of digital assets by corporations seeking diversification and potential growth beyond traditional financial instruments. While offering exciting potential benefits, this move also highlights the inherent risks associated with crypto investment , including volatility and regulatory uncertainties. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, such corporate treasury decisions will remain a key area to watch, potentially paving the way for broader adoption or serving as a cautionary tale depending on their outcomes.

The US Senate has officially passed the Genius Act, an important stablecoin bill. With a strong 68-30 vote, the bill will now move to the House, where it’s expected to pass quickly before heading to President Trump’s desk for final approval. This new law could reshape the stablecoin market in the US, with clear rules for companies like Circle’s USDC and other dollar-backed digital assets. While crypto enthusiasts are celebrating this progress, it has sparked fresh debate about what it means for other major players like XRP. There is a worry that the rise of regulated, fast, and reliable stablecoins could reduce the need for XRP in cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. However, according to an industry expert, this could actually boost XRP’s utility by giving banks and businesses more ways to move money while still needing a bridge asset like XRP for certain markets and transactions. People think stablecoins reduce XRP's need. Wrong. $27T in Nostro/Vostro accounts could grow to $50T+ because banks won't trust competitors' coins. XRP becomes the neutral bridge. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) June 17, 2025 Currently, there are approximately $27 trillion in Nostro/Vostro accounts, which banks use to settle cross-border payments. The expert said that this number could shoot past $50 trillion because banks are unlikely to trust each other’s stablecoins. And that is where XRP steps in. XRP: The Neutral Bridge XRP’s role becomes vital as a neutral, decentralized bridge asset. Therefore, instead of being replaced, XRP could be relied on as the only neutral asset that banks can trust. This positions it as a key player in global value transfer. A recent post from the Britto community, dedicated to the co-creator of the XRPL, Arthur Britto, also clarified that the view of stablecoins replacing XRP overlooks the key differences between the two. Stablecoins Hold Value, XRP Moves It While stablecoins are digital versions of fiat (like USD or EUR), meant for holding value, not transferring it across systems. For example, sending money from Japan to Mexico using stablecoins is complex. But with XRP, the transfer happens instantly without needing pre-funded accounts. XRP’s decentralized liquidity and speed make it better suited for global transfers, while stablecoins still rely on centralized control. Therefore, even while stablecoins are gaining momentum and regulatory clarity, they will not replace XRP in what it does best – moving value across borders quickly and efficiently.",News|Ripple (XRP)|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 04:51:02

The token now faces increasing pressure at the $2.20 resistance level, with technical indicators showing a sustained downtrend that has yet to reverse. News Background XRP has come under intensified selling pressure amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty. Ongoing U.S.-China trade friction, mixed central bank policy signals, and the fallout from recent ETF rejections have soured sentiment across risk assets. At the same time, traders are closely watching Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin deployment and regional regulatory milestones in Dubai and Singapore — two markets where Ripple’s infrastructure continues to expand. Still, none of these developments have provided near-term lift, with XRP now down nearly 9% for the week. Market observers point to a descending channel forming on the hourly chart — a bearish continuation signal — as volume surged during key resistance tests. Unless buyers can reclaim the $2.20 level, analysts warn that price action could break further toward the $2.10 zone. Price Action The sharpest pressure came during the 15:00–16:00 hour, when volume more than doubled the daily average, cementing resistance around $2.19. A brief recovery attempt later in the session pushed XRP to $2.179, but sellers quickly regained control. A final high-volume drop at 02:01 pushed the price down to $2.162, confirming a lower low and continuing the downtrend. Support has formed around $2.147, with XRP trading in a narrow range near $2.164 as volatility begins to subside. Technical Analysis Recap XRP declined from $2.254 to $2.164, a 4.5% drop. High-volume resistance zone formed around $2.19 during peak activity at 15:00–16:00. Support identified at $2.147 where buyers stepped in repeatedly. Short-lived recovery reached $2.179 before being rejected. Volume spike at 02:01 coincided with 0.8% price drop to $2.162. Immediate resistance now at $2.175; descending channel pattern signals continued bearish pressure. Selling volume has tapered off, suggesting possible stabilization in the near term.

46254252,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=773145,1750222807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46254252.jpeg,"$150,000 Bitcoin Is In Play—Unless This One Macro Metric Snaps",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/150000-bitcoin-unless-this-one-macro-metric-snaps/,"Bitcoin may be gearing up for a renewed surge, but according to trader Josh Olszewicz, the bullish setup is walking a macroeconomic tightrope—and one wrong move could send everything tumbling. In his June 16 “Macro Monday” update, Olszewicz laid out a broad-based technical and macroeconomic case for why BTC is holding firm near all-time highs, while warning that the market’s resilience is underpinned by a single, fragile macro factor: liquidity. $150K Bitcoin? Only If Powell Doesn’t Pull The Plug “Crypto clearly doesn’t care. Legacy clearly doesn’t care,” Olszewicz said, referring to the continued rally in risk assets despite no rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. “Both of those are mooning without rates coming down.” The key, according to him, lies in the quiet resurgence of global liquidity. While the Fed has not yet pivoted to easing, and markets are pricing near-zero odds of cuts in the June or July FOMC meetings, US and global liquidity metrics have started to turn upward. Olszewicz specifically pointed to reverse repo operations and the Treasury General Account (TGA) as crucial levers. “When reverse repo drains, it helps liquidity. When TGA spends down, it helps liquidity. Right now, neither is doing much, but both are trending in the right direction,” he said. “And that’s enough to keep risk assets buoyant.” Related Reading: Bitcoin To $140,00 In 50 Days? Bitwise Bets On War Rally The current setup, Olszewicz argued, bears little resemblance to the hard tightening regimes of 2018 or 2022. Globally, rate hike cycles are easing or reversing altogether. “It has been liquidity going up,” he emphasized. “If liquidity falls, if rates go up, then I’d expect crypto to have a hard time.” For Bitcoin, which remains pinned near its all-time high, the structure looks increasingly constructive. The trader noted that BTC has so far resisted any meaningful breakdowns and continues to reclaim key technical levels. “We’re hovering at all-time highs. That’s what you want to see,” he said. “You want to see us just continually fight off these sell-offs. It’s not a good look to lose highs quickly.” From a technical standpoint, Olszewicz identified $97,980 as the key downside level to watch if Bitcoin does falter. But on the upside, he sees clear potential for continuation: “I like $122K as a pit stop, and then eventually we’ll settle in probably somewhere in the $150K range if we really get going.” But that path is far from guaranteed. The wildcard in Olszewicz’s framework is US liquidity—a metric he calculates as the Federal Reserve balance sheet minus the TGA and reverse repo. It’s rising, but only modestly. “We are seeing liquidity start to tick up again back to the top of the range,” he said. “Nothing super impressive just yet, but this is very helpful—especially for alts, obviously for BTC, but this is what alts need.” And that’s the catch. If liquidity stalls or reverses—whether due to an unexpected Fed tightening move, a jump in TGA balances around tax deadlines, or a reactivation of reverse repo drains—then the entire crypto rally could be put at risk. “If this goes to zero,” Olszewicz warned about the reverse repo facility, “there may be liquidity issues and then they may have to reinstate QE.” Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge He also flagged August as a critical juncture, with a possible US debt ceiling crunch looming. “Just pay attention to what’s going on going into August, assuming the debt ceiling isn’t raised,” he said. “Higher the debt, higher the deficit, the more investors move to fixed supply assets. That’s better for crypto.” But none of this guarantees a clean move to $150K. As Olszewicz noted, we’re still waiting on one essential domino to fall: inflation stability. While “true inflation” data from independent trackers is hovering in the low 2s, Fed-preferred metrics like CPI and PCE remain volatile. For Powell to act, the data needs to show three to six months of sustained, flatline 2% inflation. “You do not want 2.3 one month, 2.6 the next month, 2.4, 2.8,” Olszewicz said. “You want a stable 2%.” Until then, the Fed is likely to hold firm. But the longer Bitcoin maintains momentum without a rate cut, the more market psychology begins to shift—toward a scenario where easing becomes a bonus, not a prerequisite. “If we’re doing well without rates coming down, why are we rooting for rates to come down?” Olszewicz asked. The answer, for Bitcoin, may come down to just one macro metric: liquidity. If it holds, $150,000 is still very much in play. But if it snaps—so could the cycle. At press time, BTC traded at $105,325.

XRP XRP fell 3.4% to $2.16, Cardano's ADA ADA lost 4%, and ether ETH dropped 2.5% to just over $2,500. Meanwhile, BNB Chain’s BNB BNB slid 0.5%, Solana’s SOL SOL fell 2.6%, while Hyperliquid’s HYPE HYPE dove more than 8%. Broad risk aversion and rising oil prices, triggered by continued military escalation between Israel and Iran, kept traders cautious. The sell-off came as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to eliminate Iran's supreme leader amid the Middle East clash, calling him an ""easy target."" Bitcoin BTC, which has historically traded as both a risk asset and a hedge depending on context, showed little direction despite global tensions and a weakening dollar. “Bitcoin hasn’t acted as a classic risk-on or risk-off asset lately—even as global tensions flare,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro. On-chain data shows long-term holders remain inactive, indicating no widespread profit-taking despite recent gains. “That positioning could reinforce the current consolidation phase before a potential breakout in Q3,” Kuptsikevich added. But beyond the day’s volatility, the market continues to process what may become a structural pivot toward institutional adoption and regulated stablecoin infrastructure. The U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act on Tuesday, a bipartisan bill that provides banks with a regulatory framework for issuing stablecoins backed by Treasury bills and other high-quality liquid assets. The legislation could precede enterprise adoption and normalize stablecoin payments across traditional industries. “The bill can potentially accelerate adoption by enabling American companies across various industries to incorporate stablecoin payment systems for instant transactions or other processes that we see in the DeFi sector,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a Telegram message.

Top 3 Crypto To Watch Closely Today,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/waking-up-on-tuesday-is-the-crypto-market-nursing-a-weekend-hangover-or-priming-for-a-rally-top-3-crypto-to-watch-closely-today,"After a weekend of volatility, the crypto market stirs this Tuesday with mixed signals. As the dust settles, traders are keen to see if the market will rebound or continue to stumble. Stay tuned to discover which three cryptocurrencies are showing potential for significant moves today. NEAR Protocol: Bearish Trends with Key Support and Resistance Levels The past month NEAR shows a 16.36% price drop, while the half-year period reveals a 60.54% decline. The coin struggled to gain traction recently, with consistent pullbacks pushing its price lower. Over six months, the downward trend continued amid strong selling pressure and negative sentiment among investors. Currently, the trading range is $1.97 to $3.14, with immediate support at $1.51 and a further cushion at $0.34. Resistance is at $3.85, with a higher level at $5.02. Bears dominate the market, as indicators suggest a lack of upward momentum. Traders might consider buying near support levels if stabilization occurs or shorting near resistance if selling continues. Monitoring price reactions at these levels is crucial for spotting potential reversals. Curve DAO Token Market Insights Amid Price Adjustments CRV lost around 10.9% in the past month, while the half-year decline reached nearly 36.8%. The coin has shown a consistent downward movement, with a weekly drop of about 13.3%. Price weakness has been evident, reflecting persistent selling pressure. Over the last six months, a trend of lower highs and lower lows has emerged, signaling a market dominated by bearish sentiment. Currently, CRV trades between $0.5803 and $0.8062. Clear support is near $0.4953, with another level around $0.2694, while resistance is at roughly $0.9471 and near $1.173. Bears dominate the market, and momentum remains low, with an RSI reading of 40.505 indicating oversold conditions. Negative signals from the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator bolster the bearish view. Traders may consider buying if prices stabilize above $0.4953, but caution is advised as dips below this level could lead to further declines. Taking profits at the $0.9471 resistance may be a good strategy if price movement reverses. Stacks Price Movements and Key Support Levels Over the past month, Stacks has dropped nearly 24%, while over the last six months, it has declined almost 68%. The price action indicates a steady fall toward lower ranges, with consistent losses over time. This downward movement has shown that initial high price levels have given way to a current bracket of roughly $0.606 to $0.975. The prolonged slide signals ongoing negative sentiment among traders, reflecting a lack of upward momentum during these periods. STX current trading range places the asset between $0.606 and $0.975, with nearby resistance at $1.21 and a secondary resistance level at $1.58. Support is seen near $0.47, with an even lower point at $0.103. Technical indicators show subdued buying strength, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.148 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.021. The Relative Strength Index reads close to 39, reinforcing a bearish environment. A slight bounce above $0.606 allows for cautious trading ideas aimed at testing resistance, while watching for a break beyond $1.21 for a potential trend change. Immediate support remains at $0.47. Conclusion Tuesday brings hopes of a crypto market rally. NEAR Protocol shows strong potential with its recent upgrades. CRV could see significant movement due to increased DeFi interest. STX remains a key player as it continues to innovate with smart contracts. Keeping a close watch on these coins today is crucial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

SOL price is now consolidating losses and might decline further below the $145 level. SOL price started a fresh decline from the $160 resistance zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $155 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $150 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $152 resistance zone. Solana Price Dips Further Solana price failed to continue higher above the $160 level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace and traded below the $155 support level. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $150 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The pair even traded below the $148 level. A low was formed near $145 and the price recently started a consolidation phase. It tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $158 swing high to the $145 low. Solana is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $150 level. The next major resistance is near the $152 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $158 swing high to the $145 low. The main resistance could be $155. A successful close above the $155 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $160. Any more gains might send the price toward the $165 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $152 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $145 zone. The first major support is near the $142 level. A break below the $142 level might send the price toward the $130 zone. If there is a close below the $130 support, the price could decline toward the $125 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level.

News Background Tensions between Israel and Iran escalated over the weekend, prompting a swift risk-off reaction in global markets. Crypto was no exception, with DOGE shedding nearly 8% before stabilizing above a key technical floor. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% and continuing to unwind its balance sheet. These macroeconomic headwinds have weighed heavily on altcoins, especially high-beta assets like dogecoin. Despite this, DOGE found support as buying activity returned near the $0.164 level, forming a potential double bottom pattern that some analysts view as a base for consolidation. With volatility cooling and volume declining, the market appears to be waiting for a clearer signal before its next directional move. Price Action The sharpest sell-off came during the 15:00–16:00 window, where DOGE saw nearly 700 million units traded as price dropped below key support. Buyers stepped in at $0.164, lifting DOGE into a range between $0.168 and $0.171. Late-session trading showed price stabilizing above $0.170, with a bullish push at 01:21 sending DOGE to $0.1719 before fading. Price action since has traced a descending triangle with lower highs forming against flat support. Technical Analysis Recap DOGE fell from $0.176 to $0.164, a 6.7% drop, before finding support. Most intense selling hit during 15:00–16:00 with volume nearing 700M. Support formed at $0.164, followed by consolidation between $0.168–$0.171. Bullish push at 01:21 hit $0.1719 but was quickly rejected. Volume declined sharply in the final hours, with most candles under 3M. Descending triangle pattern formed, with resistance at $0.171 and support at $0.1705.

The newly passed GENIUS Act , focused on stablecoins, is being called a turning point for digital finance. The bill got a 51-23 vote across both parties, making it one of the most significant crypto-related wins in Washington so far. Let’s break down what this means. What Is the GENIUS Act All About? The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) lays the groundwork for how stablecoins should be regulated in the United States. In simple terms, the bill makes sure these coins are backed by real money, like U.S. dollars or liquid assets, and sets rules for how big players operate. Any company issuing stablecoins with a market cap above $50 billion will now need annual audits, and foreign issuers will face tighter rules too. Think of it as putting real-world guardrails on digital dollars. Big Companies Face Limits One surprising part? Tech giants like Meta and Amazon will be subject to restrictions unless they meet specific financial and privacy standards. The bill aims to avoid risks that could come from letting huge corporations control massive digital money systems. In fact, stablecoin users now get top legal protection in case the issuing company goes bankrupt, a concept called super-priority status. That means your funds would be first in line to be recovered. Why This Vote Is a Game Changer This is the first time the Senate has passed meaningful legislation on crypto. Lawmakers have tried before but failed due to disagreements. Things changed this time, especially under President Trump, whose administration has openly supported crypto innovation. Experts say the U.S. is now finally catching up with crypto regulation — and even setting itself up as a global leader in this space. What Happens Next? The House of Representatives now has to decide. They could pass their own stablecoin bill, or simply adopt the GENIUS Act. Either way, time is ticking. President Trump wants a stablecoin bill signed before August, and his advisors have already said they would support this one. With the stablecoin market expected to reach $3.7 trillion by the end of the decade, all eyes are now on the House.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 05:16:12

SUI, meanwhile, has already blown up to a $10B market cap and its parabolic window has already closed. With the market in shambles, analysts are pointing towards newly-launched PayFi presale sensation Remittix as the top candidate to mimic Dogecoin’s 2021 chart. Here’s why. Dogecoin price prediction: Miles away from ATH Dogecoin has fallen by a precipitous 24.8% over the past month, now hovering near the lower bound of a symmetrical triangle pattern trading at $0.17 as of writing. Technical indicators suggest that the memecoin is at risk of breaching key structural support, which could confirm a bearish breakout. Should DOGE close decisively below the support line, downside targets emerge at $0.13 and $0.10 as the floor. Conversely, a move above the upper boundary would invalidate the bearish thesis and potentially trigger a rally toward $0.24. Dogecoin prices are on a disastrous 22.8% run in the past month. Source: TradingView SUI crypto price action finding its footing SUI is exhibiting resilience amid broader market volatility. Based on recent SUI crypto price performances, the next-gen L1 blockchain protocol has found strong support at $2.80, even as it trades around the $2.92 mark as at press time. While a 16.5% dip in the last week is nothing to handwave for SUI crypto holders, it appears as though the worst is over for SUI. The asset has recently reclaimed key technical support levels, drawing speculative interest as traders position for macro-driven inflection points. Elevated trading activity underscores latent buyer demand, and with altcoin sentiment cautiously optimistic, SUI remains a viable candidate for accumulation particularly if broader momentum in Layer 1 tokens continues to stabilize. SUI crypto prices took a 16.5% hit in the last week, but appear to have stabilized. Source: TradingView Presale PayFi sensation Remittix could recreate DOGE’s 2021 run Dogecoin and SUI crypto prices are on the downswing and their potential to come even remotely close to Dogecoin’s legendary 2021 rally have long gone. Instead, the smart money knows that low-cap gems with high upside potential like Remittix (RTX) have a better chance of doing so. Remittix is, after all, aiming to reshape the $190 trillion global payments space with a streamlined crypto-to-fiat transfer system. Remittix simplifies international payments by skipping over traditional banking middlemen, cutting down on fees, and offering stablecoin options to reduce currency risk. Its crypto-to-fiat architecture powered by the blockchain ensures that all transactions are secure, trackable and tamper-proof giving users full control over their funds. The project’s structure also inspires confidence: team tokens are locked for three years, zero trading taxes and substantial RTX staking rewards are all on offer. Conclusion Dogecoin and SUI‘s parabolic windows have already slammed shut. While anywhere between a 2x to a 5x run for both big-cap coins are still possible in the future, investors looking for the rare moonshots will be better served buying into presale blue chips like Remittix, which offer greater upside than tokens that already have seen their peaks. Currently available at just $0.0781 per RTX token , Remittix offers big-time potential ROIs at a much lower entry point and a legitimate shot at 100x and beyond if it captures even just a fraction of the trillion-dollar cross-border payments industry.

46255663,https://crypto.news/?p=14389664,1750224522,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/46255663.jpeg,"U.S. Senate passes landmark Genius Act, aiming to bring clarity in stablecoin regulation",https://crypto.news/u-s-senate-passes-genius-act-stablecoin-regulation-2025/,"In a historic vote, the U.S. Senate has passed the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at establishing federal rules for stablecoins. According to a CNN report , on June 17, the bill cleared the Senate with strong bipartisan support in a 68-30 vote, with 18 Democrats joining most Republicans. Only two Republicans, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, voted against it. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives, where House Majority Whip Tom Emmer has urged the Financial Services Committee to advance stablecoin legislation by the end of July. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, as it is officially known, establishes the first comprehensive federal framework for the issuance of stablecoins. Under the act, only qualified issuers, such as subsidiaries of insured banks or licensed state entities, can issue payment stablecoins. Smaller issuers may function under state supervision, but those with more than $10 billion in circulation will be subject to federal regulation. You might also like: JPMorgan files for JPMD trademark as GENIUS Act heads to vote — is a stablecoin in the works? Along with stringent consumer protections, the bill mandates monthly public reserve disclosures, annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization of more than $50 billion, and 100% reserve backing in U.S. dollars or short-term Treasuries. It prohibits issuers from marketing stablecoins as “FDIC-insured” or backed by the U.S. government. Supporters say the bill will bring much-needed clarity to the crypto space, strengthen the U.S. dollar’s role in digital finance, and protect consumers. Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN), the bill’s sponsor, called it a pivotal moment for U.S. innovation. “This bill will cement U.S. dollar dominance, protect customers, and drive demand for U.S. Treasuries,” Hagerty said on the Senate floor. The bill faced earlier opposition from some Democrats, who were concerned about Donald Trump’s crypto dealings. However, following weeks of negotiations, a revised version of the bill that included stronger national security, ethics, and anti-money laundering protections won over important Democratic caucus members. If passed by the House, the GENIUS Act would create the first comprehensive federal rules for stablecoins, potentially positioning the U.S. as a leader in the global digital asset economy.

46255694,https://coinpaper.com/9606/coinbase-and-jp-morgan-push-blockchain-integration-with-tokenized-finance-pilots,1750224600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Coinbase and JPMorgan Push Blockchain Integration with Tokenized Finance Pilots,https://coinpaper.com/9606/coinbase-and-jp-morgan-push-blockchain-integration-with-tokenized-finance-pilots,"Two of the largest players in traditional and crypto finance are making coordinated moves to bring blockchain technology deeper into regulated financial markets. Coinbase is seeking regulatory approval to offer tokenized stock trading to US users, while JPMorgan is piloting its new deposit token, JPMD, on Coinbase’s Base network. Together, these efforts signal growing institutional interest in using blockchain infrastructure for mainstream financial products like equities and dollar-based payments. Coinbase Eyes SEC Green Light to Launch Tokenized Stock Trading in the US Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, is reportedly preparing to take a major step toward bridging traditional financial markets with blockchain technology. The company is seeking regulatory approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer tokenized stock trading to its user base, according to a report published by Reuters on Tuesday. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, said the initiative to launch “tokenized equities” is a “huge priority” for the company. The move, if approved, could enable Coinbase users to buy and sell blockchain-based representations of publicly traded stocks — such as Apple or Tesla — in a fractionalized, 24/7 trading format. Grewal did not disclose whether a formal request had already been submitted to the SEC, but the tone suggests Coinbase is actively engaged in discussions with regulators. Tokenized Equities: A Growing but Restricted Market Tokenized stocks, which mimic real shares but exist on blockchain rails, have gained momentum globally but remain restricted within the US due to securities laws. While companies like Kraken have announced plans to offer tokenized US stock trading to non-residents, US investors have been left out of the innovation wave due to regulatory uncertainty. Coinbase’s push for approval could change that narrative, paving the way for a new asset class to enter the American retail and institutional investment landscape. Should the SEC be amenable, Coinbase would likely receive a “no-action letter,” a formal notice that the agency does not intend to pursue enforcement actions against the firm. Such a letter would not equate to full regulatory endorsement but would provide Coinbase with enough assurance to move forward cautiously. Coinbase’s effort comes at a time when the US crypto regulatory environment appears to be softening. Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, digital asset firms have expressed renewed optimism about policy direction and enforcement leniency. That optimism was bolstered in February, when the SEC dropped its 2023 enforcement action against Coinbase — a lawsuit that had loomed large over the company’s operations and growth plans. With a more receptive political climate and mounting institutional interest in blockchain-based financial products, Coinbase seems poised to push forward aggressively on product diversification and global expansion. While Coinbase eyes tokenized equities in the US, it is also making significant strides abroad. The company is reportedly on track to receive a license to operate across the European Union under the bloc’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, a landmark framework designed to harmonize crypto rules across all 27 EU member states. However, Coinbase is not without its challenges. The firm is currently under scrutiny following reports that cybercriminals bribed some of its customer support agents based outside the United States. This alleged breach reportedly led to phishing attempts targeting user data , raising serious questions about operational security and risk management. COIN Price Movement and Market Outlook Shares of Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) were trading at $253.85 at the time of publication, reflecting a 2.95% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite the dip, the stock has performed strongly in recent months and secured a notable milestone in May by joining the S&P 500 index — the first crypto-native company to do so. Coinbase share price (Source: Google Finance ) The potential launch of tokenized equity trading could provide a new revenue stream for Coinbase, especially as trading volumes in the crypto market remain volatile. It would also bring the firm into more direct competition with fintech players like Robinhood, which already offer traditional equities alongside crypto. If successful, Coinbase’s foray into tokenized stocks could reshape how Americans access and interact with equities. Blockchain-based equities promise near-instant settlement, lower transaction fees, and fractional ownership — all attributes that appeal to younger, tech-savvy investors. Moreover, the move could catalyze wider adoption of tokenized financial instruments, particularly if regulators view Coinbase’s efforts as a compliant blueprint for others in the space. JPMorgan Launches JPMD Deposit Token on Coinbase’s Base Network in Groundbreaking Blockchain Pilot Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase has launched a pilot program for its newly trademarked deposit token, JPMD. The pilot will run on Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer-2 network, Base — a choice that reinforces Base’s growing dominance in the Layer-2 scaling ecosystem. The pilot was confirmed by Naveen Mallela, an executive at Kinexys, JPMorgan’s blockchain division, in a statement to Bloomberg . Mallela revealed that a fixed supply of JPMD tokens will be transferred to Coinbase in the coming days, marking a pivotal step in JPMorgan’s broader strategy to modernize banking infrastructure through blockchain-powered solutions. The transaction will be conducted in US dollars and will take place on the Base network, which was launched by Coinbase in 2023 and has since become the most widely adopted Ethereum Layer-2 solution by total value locked (TVL), according to data from CoinGecko and DefiLlama. With transaction throughput recently nearing 1,000 transactions per second — putting it in competition with high-speed networks like Solana — Base is seen as a highly capable infrastructure for scalable, low-cost institutional settlements. Base’s total value locked (TVL) has more than doubled over the past year (Source: DefiLlama ) Following the pilot phase, JPMorgan plans to offer JPMD to Coinbase’s institutional clients for on-chain transactions and payments, broadening the use case for tokenized bank liabilities in decentralized ecosystems. Deposit Tokens vs. Stablecoins: A Strategic Bet Unlike stablecoins, which are typically issued by fintech or crypto firms and backed by fiat reserves held off-chain, deposit tokens are on-chain representations of actual deposits held at regulated banks. Mallela emphasized that deposit tokens like JPMD present a “superior alternative to stablecoins” from an institutional perspective, largely because they operate within the regulated banking ecosystem and are designed to be scalable. “From an institutional standpoint, deposit tokens are a superior alternative to stablecoins,” Mallela said. “They are more scalable due to their fractional reserve structure and may eventually offer yield.” This possibility of yield generation marks a significant departure from most stablecoins, which generally do not bear interest. Should JPMD eventually offer returns, it could provide a compelling incentive for institutional capital to migrate from stablecoins to bank-issued digital assets. The timing of JPMorgan’s pilot also coincides with a growing debate within the financial sector over the potential disruption posed by yield-bearing stablecoins . NYU professor and financial consultant Austin Campbell recently suggested that the US banking industry is ”panicking” over the growing appeal of stablecoins that offer yield, warning that they could undermine the traditional banking model by draining retail deposits and offering superior alternatives to savings accounts. Campbell’s comments reflect broader concerns among banking executives that decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital asset innovations may erode the monopoly banks have long held over the issuance and utility of fiat-denominated money. Nevertheless, deposit tokens like JPMD represent a potential compromise between decentralization and traditional finance, allowing regulated institutions to harness blockchain innovation without ceding control over monetary infrastructure. A Broader Blockchain Vision JPMorgan’s blockchain ambitions extend well beyond JPMD. The company has invested heavily in its Onyx division, which has already deployed JPM Coin for internal settlements and launched various pilot programs involving tokenized assets, repo transactions, and programmable payments. The introduction of JPMD — now backed by a formal trademark filing that covers a wide range of crypto-related services, including trading, payment processing, and digital wallet integration — further cements JPMorgan’s status as a frontrunner in institutional blockchain adoption.

According to a June 17 press release from Eyenovia, Inc., a U.S.-based ophthalmic technology firm, the company has secured $50 million in private equity financing to accumulate over 1 million Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) tokens. With this move, Eyenovia becomes the first publicly traded U.S. company to hold HYPE in its treasury and operate as a Hyperliquid blockchain validator. The funding deal includes convertible preferred shares and warrants, which could raise up to $150 million if fully exercised. Alongside the announcement, Eyenovia named Hyunsu Jung as chief investment officer and board member to oversee the new digital asset strategy. “We’re pleased to join the growing number of companies adopting cryptocurrency treasury strategies,” said chief executive officer Michael Rowe. “We believe this move supports long-term capital appreciation and shareholder value.” You might also like: Can Hyperliquid rise to $50 in June? Jung called HYPE “the most robust digital asset,” citing Hyperliquid’s rapid growth and leading onchain revenue. HYPE ranks as the 12th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, having surged 380% from its April low to an all-time high of $45.57 on June 16. At press time, HYPE is trading at $40.24, down 11% from its peak. Hyperliquid, a high-speed Layer 1 blockchain optimized for perpetuals trading, has seen a wave of adoption. In the past 30 days, it has accounted for 60% of the total onchain perps volume, according to data from a Dune Analytics dashboard. Monthly perps volume has topped $250 billion, making it a strong competitor to centralized exchanges such as Binance. Eyenovia plans to execute a staking strategy with its HYPE holdings and use Anchorage Digital to secure its assets. In addition, the company will rebrand to “Hyperion DeFi” and change its ticker symbol to HYPD. Eyenovia will keep working on its flagship Optejet eye treatment device, which is expected to receive FDA registration by September, while branching out into cryptocurrency. If other public companies follow Eyenovia’s lead, Hyperliquid could see a sharp increase in token demand and network effects, potentially positioning it as a top 10 blockchain by market capitalization.

Hostilities between Israel and Iran have persisted, entering its sixth day of attacks on each other’s territories, despite a call from U.S. President Donald Trump for Tehran's unconditional surrender and threatening a potential strike against Supreme Leader Khamenei in a series of posts on Truth Social. Meanwhile, in the U.S., investors are gearing up for the Federal Reserve’s policy decision later in the day. Gold edged lower to around $3,380 per ounce on Wednesday, amid escalating geopolitical tensions. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.75% to above 38,600, while the broader Topix Index also added 0.2% to 2,792 on Wednesday. The Japanese yen held around 145.2 per dollar on Wednesday after falling for three straight sessions, as a series of disappointing economic indicators weighed on sentiment. Japan's trade deficit decreased significantly to JPY 637.61 billion in May 2025 from JPY 1,225.17 billion in the same month last year, beating market expectations of a JPY 893 billion gap, as exports fell in May for the first time in eight months amid US tariff pressure, while imports dropped more than expected. Separate data showed, Japan’s core machinery orders—excluding volatile items such as ships and electric power—fell 9.1% month-over-month to ¥919 billion in April 2025, marking a sharp reversal from March’s 13% surge. The Reuters Tankan index for Japanese manufacturers dropped to +6 in June 2025, marking a second consecutive monthly decline after readings of +9 in April and +8 in May. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.11% to around 3,384, while the Shenzhen Component slipped 0.2% to 10,130 on Wednesday, extending losses from the previous session as investors turned cautious ahead of the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai today, and the offshore yuan steadied around 7.18 per dollar on Wednesday, as investors turned their attention to the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai. Three major Chinese financial regulators—the People's Bank of China, the National Financial Regulatory Administration, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission—are jointly organizing the event with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Investors are keenly awaiting significant financial policy announcements. On the monetary policy front, investors are focused on the PBoC's upcoming policy decision. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.09% to 23,713 in early Wednesday trading, extending losses for the second day amid broad-based sector declines. At the Lujiazui Forum, Hong Kong and Shanghai are poised to ink a deal deepening financial cooperation, aiming to strengthen ties and resilience amid rising geopolitical tensions. Hong Kong’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate hit a two-year high of 3.5% in the three months ending May, due to some headwinds including shifts in consumption patterns. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.05% to 81,741 in Wednesday morning trade, recovering losses from the previous session. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.14% to around 8,520 on Wednesday, marking its second straight session of losses. The Australian dollar strengthened to around $0.649 on Wednesday, recouping some losses from the previous session. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Economic Index for Australia edged down 0.1% in May 2025, after a flat reading in the previous month. Domestically, attention turns to Thursday’s labor market data, which could provide fresh momentum to the economy and influence the RBA’s policy outlook. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended lower as investors closely monitored escalating tensions in the Middle East, with the Israel-Iran conflict entering its fifth day. Traders are also monitoring upcoming US housing data and weekly jobless claims, both due ahead of Thursday’s market holiday. U.S. stock futures were little changed on Wednesday as investors braced for the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision: Dow +0.03% ; S&P 500 +0.12% ; Nasdaq +0.18% .

The decision to open public proceedings is a big step toward potential approval, especially in light of the SEC’s shifting posture under the Trump administration and Chair Paul Atkins. Meanwhile, crypto infrastructure company Fairmint is pushing for modernization in private equity markets with a detailed proposal to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. The proposal called for blockchain-based settlement systems, investor self-custody, and the creation of a regulated DeFi sandbox. At the same time, Gemini Trust launched a scathing rebuke of the CFTC, accusing the agency of pursuing false charges based on a discredited whistleblower report. The letter shed some light on the still ongoing tension between regulatory bodies and crypto firms. XRP and Solana ETFs Gain Momentum The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated public comment periods for two proposed crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from asset management firm Franklin Templeton. The firm wants to list the funds on the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s BZX platform. The ETFs in question are the Franklin XRP ETF and the Franklin Solana ETF. The move follows a proposed rule change that was submitted by the Cboe BZX Exchange in March, which the SEC initially delayed in April before taking further action this week. (Source: SEC ) While the SEC has yet to make a decision, the institution of proceedings is a key regulatory step in the process and indicates that the agency is now formally considering public input on the matter. In its notice, the Commission explained that opening the proceedings does not imply any final stance on the ETFs, and instead seeks to encourage feedback from the public and industry stakeholders. Once the notice is published in the Federal Register, the SEC will have 35 additional days to reach a verdict. This then pushes the new deadline into July. Franklin Templeton is not alone in its ambitions. Other firms including Bitwise, ProShares, and 21Shares also filed to launch ETFs tied to altcoins like XRP and Solana. Though the SEC already approved spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, it has not yet done so for other major cryptocurrencies. These filings were made at a time when the SEC is reportedly adopting a more lenient stance toward digital assets under the Trump administration and its appointed chair, Paul Atkins. This includes the withdrawal of several high-profile enforcement actions against crypto companies. Whether this relaxed regulatory climate will pave the way for ETFs tied to tokens like XRP and Solana is still uncertain. However, the interest in these products appears to be growing, particularly with political support mounting. Fairmint Pushes SEC to Modernize Private Equity Meanwhile, crypto-native companies are stepping up efforts to shape the future of digital asset regulation, and transfer agent Fairmint recently submitted a comprehensive proposal to the US SEC’s Crypto Task Force. Addressed to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce, the seven-part proposal advocates for overhauling what Fairmint describes as outdated and inefficient back-end infrastructure used in private securities administration. (Source: Fairmint ) The proposal calls for standardized infrastructure to allow interoperability between transfer agents, the use of blockchain for real-time regulatory visibility, and enabling investor self-custody while still maintaining compliance controls. Fairmint also urged a move away from traditional wealth-based investor accreditation standards, and suggested a knowledge-based approach instead. Another key point includes the creation of a regulated decentralized finance (DeFi) sandbox to encourage more responsible innovation in US markets. The initiative reflects the broader frustration in the private equity space, where large companies continue to rely on spreadsheet software lacking built-in settlement mechanisms. In contrast, public companies have access to more sophisticated, regulated infrastructure. Fairmint’s CEO, Joris Delanoue, criticized the current system by pointing out that billion-dollar cap tables are still being managed in Excel, which leads to inefficiencies and compliance risks. The global private equity market was valued at $5.3 trillion in 2023 and projected to reach $6 trillion by the end of 2024. It represents a massive opportunity for digital transformation. Fairmint’s client list includes many well known players like wallet infrastructure provider Privy and social networking platform Bloom Network. Meanwhile, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force has been actively engaging with the industry, and hosted two recent roundtables to gather input on tokenization and decentralized finance. These discussions align with emerging trends in financial markets, as firms like Robinhood are exploring blockchain technology to tokenize traditional financial instruments. Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev recently stated that tokenizing both public and private equities is a key part of the company’s roadmap, particularly as it expands services to European investors. Tokenized stocks market overview (Source: RWA.xyz ) Gemini Blasts CFTC Over False Charges In other regulation-related news, Gemini Trust accused the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of pursuing baseless charges against the crypto exchange in 2022 to boost the careers of its litigators. In a letter that was sent to CFTC Inspector General Christopher Skinner, Gemini alleged that the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement relied on a flawed whistleblower report to bring false charges related to the company’s proposed Bitcoin futures contract. According to Gemini, the charges were based on a submission from Benjamin Small, the firm’s former operating chief, who was dismissed in 2017 for allegedly concealing losses from a rebate fraud scheme involving several trading entities and executives. Part of Gemini’s letter that was sent to the CFTC The exchange argued that Small was motivated by personal grievance after his termination, and started a malicious campaign against Gemini by submitting a whistleblower report riddled with falsehoods. Gemini claimed that Small’s accusations, including that the exchange failed to disclose the susceptibility of its futures product to market manipulation, were taken at face value by CFTC staff, prompting a multi-year investigation. The agency eventually sued Gemini in June of 2022 for making false or misleading statements during its 2017 application process for launching the Bitcoin futures contract. Gemini settled the case with a $5 million fine in January of 2025, without admitting or denying the charges, saying at the time that it had no viable alternative. Gemini now argues that the Bitcoin futures contract in question ran smoothly for 19 months and was never linked to any manipulation, which completely undermines the CFTC’s original claims. The exchange also accused the Division of Enforcement of selectively weaponizing the Commodity Exchange Act to manufacture a high-profile enforcement action. The letter credited acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham with taking constructive steps to reform the enforcement division. Gemini concluded its letter by urging the CFTC to commit to long-term reforms to prevent future misuse of authority and pledged to support the agency’s efforts to improve its internal practices.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-18 05:37:16

The CME Group's FedWatch tool indicates that the central bank is again likely to hold ground and keep interest rates unchanged in the range of 4.25%-4.50% despite President Donald Trump's repeated demands for lower borrowing costs. The rate decision, therefore, is a foregone conclusion and crypto traders are likely to focus on the interest rate dot plot – the graphical representation that records each Fed official's projections for interest rates. ""With rates expected to stay on hold, traders are focused on the dot‑plot: fewer than two projected cuts would harden the higher‑for‑longer narrative; a dovish surprise would lighten the dollar and could unfreeze crypto's bid. Until then, patience rules,"" crypto trading and market-making firm XBTO said. A hawkish dot plot, suggesting fewer rate cuts, could put pressure on bitcoin and the broader crypto market. BTC's rally has already stalled above $100,000, with geopolitical tensions in the Middle East adding to the trade war-led inflation uncertainty. ""During 2025, expectations for rate cuts have already declined sharply, from an initial 100 basis points to just 50 basis points currently. This revision is driven by a resilient labor market and inflation that, while moderated, remains above the 2% target. A prolonged conflict in the Middle East could further reduce anticipated cuts to just 25 basis points,"" Matteo Greco, senior analyst at Fineqia, said in an email. While the hawkish Fed could breed downside volatility in bitcoin, it will likely worsen the U.S. fiscal situation by adding to the nation's debt servicing costs and thereby strengthening the long-term appeal of assets like gold and bitcoin.",Markets|Bitcoin|Federal Reserve|Markets|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-18 05:37:56

The bill, officially titled the Guaranteed E-Money Innovation and US Dollar Security (GENIUS) Act, received support from both sides of the political aisle — with several Democrats joining Republicans to push it through. It now heads to the House, where expectations are high for swift approval, and eventually to President Trump’s desk for signature. Industry experts are now suggesting portfolio frameworks built around assets that directly support or benefit from the growing stablecoin and payment infrastructure. What This Means for Crypto Portfolios As stablecoins secure a regulatory green light, crypto investors are already adjusting their strategies to tap into this fast-growing sector. On The Paul Barron Network, the analyst advised a fresh portfolio approach centered around assets tied to payment infrastructure and stablecoin ecosystems. In this updated model: Ethereum (ETH) would hold the largest share at 50%, since it remains the primary network for stablecoin transactions and decentralized finance activity. Solana (SOL) follows with 25%, capitalizing on its rapid adoption in retail payment platforms. XRP takes a 10% allocation, with potential to expand its utility in point-of-sale transactions alongside its established banking use case. Layer-2 solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon collectively account for around 9%, providing scalable, low-cost infrastructure for stablecoin-based payments. Stellar (XLM), long a staple for cross-border transfers, is recommended at 2.5%, especially as it gains momentum with PayPal-backed payment integrations. A final portion is reserved for emerging growth chains like Avalanche (AVAX), Sui (SUI), and Aptos (APT), which could capture market share as the payment and stablecoin narrative accelerates. The Payment Boom Is Here Experts say the passing of the GENIUS Act and rising money market yields have sparked a wave of investor interest in payment-focused crypto projects.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970.

With excitement brewing, investors are asking: when will XRP hit its peak, and is now the time to act? Meanwhile, a rising new crypto project is stepping up, tackling payment solutions that XRP has yet to fully solve. Before placing your next bet, here’s the latest insight into XRP’s outlook and a project that may soon rival it in real-world use. XRP Forecast: Could $27 Be Next in Line? Although XRP has remained under $3, many analysts believe it could hit $27 if a spot ETF goes live. The SEC’s new leadership seems more open to crypto, and Polymarket currently places ETF approval odds at 87%. Ripple is also pushing forward, with global deals and a strong U.S. strategy. CEO Brad Garlinghouse says resolving the SEC lawsuit could be the catalyst for a massive price surge. Still, competitors like Circle are gaining speed, posing a real challenge. Reaching $27 would give XRP a $1.9 trillion market cap, a bold target. Even after a 350% gain this year, future growth depends on regulatory progress more than market sentiment. A Utility-First Exchange With Real Use Cases While XRP tackles legal roadblocks, another contender is building quietly an exchange designed to list real crypto projects, especially meme coins, with no fees. It aims to remove the hassle and cost of getting listed, allowing broader participation. The platform includes bridge features for easy swaps across different chains, plus a crypto-to-fiat payment system that simplifies real-world transactions. With over $5 million raised and a working demo exchange about to go live, this project is proving it’s more than hype.

The token has dropped over 3% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.5605, with technical charts showing a neutral-to-bearish trend. Bearish Trend Continues The RSI and Stochastic remain neutral, showing no strong direction on either side. Although it appears to be under pressure, there are a few signs that it might be trying to hold its ground for now. Since May 21, Pi has been stuck in a bearish trap. The pattern, marked by lower highs, indicates that sellers are dominating the market and buyers are struggling to push back. If the bearish trend continues, Pi could retest its all-time low of $0.40 or even fall further. But if the buying interest picks up, it could bounce back toward the $0.65 level. Pi Could Soon Crash to $0.40! Yesterday, on June 17th, the token dropped 11%, hitting a low of $0.5311. This drop began after the team announced that .pi domain auctions would be moved to a separate section from the main mining feature, which failed to excite the users. Over the past two days, Pi has slid from $0.6345 to around $0.5450. We might still see Pi drop to around $0.40, especially if there's no major update on June 28th! @PiCoreTeam @nkokkalis @Chengdiao pic.twitter.com/DSbrChUEzN — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) June 17, 2025 Dr Altcoin warns that Pi coin could crash to $0.40 if there is no major update on June 28th.

According to Piscan.io, 164.49 million PI will be released in June, followed by 249.05 million in July, which is far above the monthly average of 136.61 million. Altcoin Season Is Key to Pi’s Next Breakout Another analyst says that Pi’s price rise depends on a broader shift in the crypto market. For altcoins like Pi to rally, Bitcoin must first break its all-time high, followed by Ethereum gaining strength, which could trigger the altcoin season.

Speaking at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai on Wednesday, People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng said Beijing will establish an international operations centre for e-CNY in the city, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The move is aimed at supporting the digital yuan’s expansion overseas and deepening its role in global transactions. China to Roll Out Yuan Futures as Part of Bid to Reshape Global Currency Order Alongside the digital yuan push, Pan said China would speed up plans to launch yuan futures trading in Shanghai. This, he explained, would give investors new tools to hedge against currency risk. The broader goal, he explained, is to build a “multi-polar international monetary system.” In this system, multiple sovereign currencies would coexist. Moreover, they would provide mutual checks and balances. People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng laid out in the clearest terms yet his vision for the future of a new global currency order after decades of dollar dominance, predicting a more competitive system will take root in the years to come https://t.co/9zChzN9KRR — Bloomberg (@business) June 18, 2025 He added that such a system could reduce reliance on the US dollar and foster greater regional currency leadership. Trump Backs Crypto as Strategic Move to Counter China’s Financial Rise Pan’s remarks come at a time when confidence in the dollar has been shaken by President Donald Trump’s unpredictable foreign and trade policies since returning to office. The instability has led some investors to reduce their dollar holdings. It has also prompted US exporters to look for alternative settlement options, including the yuan. In May, Trump reiterated his support for cryptocurrencies. He framed them as essential to maintaining US leadership in emerging technologies. He said his support stems from a desire to stop China from gaining control over the future of finance, declaring, “I’m a big fan of crypto because I want to keep it away from China.” China Seeks Global Digital Yuan Role as Pan Warns of Politicised Payment Systems China has spent years trying to internationalise the yuan, part of President Xi Jinping’s broader effort to elevate China’s influence in global finance. The digital yuan, already tested through domestic pilot programs, is central to that strategy. Pan said new technologies have revealed flaws in traditional cross-border payment systems. He described them as inefficient and increasingly exposed to geopolitical risk. “Traditional cross-border payment infrastructures can be easily politicised and weaponised, and used as a tool for unilateral sanctions,” he warned, arguing that the current model undermines the global economic and financial order. He also raised the idea of promoting special drawing rights, or SDRs, issued by the International Monetary Fund. He suggested they could serve as a “super-sovereign” alternative. However, he acknowledged that global consensus remains weak. Moreover, SDRs are mostly used during crises and are not a regular tool for international settlement. “The situation where a single sovereign currency dominates cross-border payment is changing gradually,” Pan said, predicting a more competitive and balanced currency landscape in the years ahead.

It also imposes limitations on algorithmic stablecoins and those without full backing. NEW: The GENIUS Act has officially passed the Senate.

As of the time of writing, BTC is priced at approximately $105,756, reflecting a 1% drop in the past 24 hours and a 5.4% decline from its record peak of over $111,000 reached last month. The asset has been consolidating within this band for several weeks, with no clear breakout yet in sight, indicating a moment of uncertainty or possible transition in market direction. A CryptoQuany analyst known as Gaah has offered insights into this phase of the cycle. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge Bitcoin IBCI Suggests Cycle Is Ongoing, Not Exhausted Gaah recently published an analysis on the QuickTake platform, focusing on Bitcoin’s IBCI (Index Bitcoin Cycle Indicators). According to the post, the IBCI surged above 75% earlier this year during Bitcoin’s rally from late 2023 to early 2024, entering what’s known as the “distribution region.” Following the correction in BTC price, the IBCI has now leveled around the 50% mark, traditionally viewed as a neutral zone that often precedes major trend changes. The IBCI’s current position, according to Gaah, may signal a transitional point in the ongoing market cycle. Historically, when the indicator stabilizes in the mid-range, it often reflects the end of a market pullback and the potential beginning of a new upward phase. Gaah noted that over the past decade, Bitcoin’s bullish phases typically concluded only when the IBCI reached and remained in the 100% zone. As this condition has not yet been met, the present consolidation could be laying the groundwork for another leg up, contingent on supportive on-chain metrics and broader ecosystem momentum. The analyst also suggested that the lack of extreme sentiment, whether bullish or bearish, reinforces the view that the market is still evolving rather than nearing a peak. Suppose BTC price manages to push higher while the IBCI trends back toward the 75%–100 % region. In that case, it may indicate a return to the distribution zone and a continuation of the current bull cycle. Exchange Activity Remains Subdued as Retail Interest Stalls In a separate analysis shared on CryptoQuant by another contributor, caueconomy, recent trends in trading activity were examined. Despite Bitcoin trading near historical highs, spot volume across centralized exchanges has dropped to multi-year lows. While the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs has shifted some volume away from exchanges, the data also reflects limited retail engagement, especially with altcoins. This pattern suggests that current market participation is more aligned with institutional players or long-term holders, rather than speculative retail traders. Caueconomy concluded that these subdued volumes are not typical of euphoric market phases. Instead, they indicate a more measured participation in the market, which may delay the formation of a local top. However, should there be a renewed surge in trading activity, especially from retail investors, it could serve as a signal of a maturing cycle or the onset of another significant price move.

While the cryptocurrency market continues its evolution, other tech domains are also seeing substantial growth and strategic shifts. One such story comes from Sword Health , an AI-powered digital health startup that has just announced a major funding round, highlighting the robust investment landscape for promising tech ventures. Sword Health Secures Significant Venture Capital Sword Health has successfully closed a $40 million funding round, pushing its valuation to an impressive $4 billion. This represents a 33% increase from its $3 billion valuation just one year prior. The funding round was spearheaded by returning investor, General Catalyst, indicating strong continued confidence in the company’s trajectory. Despite being cash-flow positive, the company’s CEO and founder, Virgílio Bento, explained his rationale for raising additional capital. The primary drivers were to update the company’s valuation and to build a war chest for potential strategic acquisitions. This move underscores a proactive approach to growth and market positioning, even from a financially healthy standpoint. Digital Health IPO Plans Take a Backseat Originally, Sword Health had considered a potential IPO as early as 2025. However, despite the recent successful public offerings from peers like Hinge Health and Omada, and Sword’s own healthy $240 million annual revenue run rate, Bento is now reconsidering the timeline. He stated that the IPO would happen “much later than everyone expects,” potentially pushing the date out to 2028 or beyond. Bento’s decision stems from an “educational journey” into the world of public companies. After speaking with numerous public company CEOs and bankers, he found compelling reasons *not* to rush into an IPO. He noted that he could easily list ten reasons against going public but struggled to find one compelling reason in favor of it currently. Expanding the Vision for AI Health A core part of Sword Health’s strategy involves expanding the capabilities of its AI care specialist, Phoenix. Initially focused on virtual physical therapy, the company has already grown to include pelvic health and mental health services. Bento’s ambition is for Phoenix to extend remote healthcare support to a much wider array of conditions. Future expansion areas include cardiovascular care, gastroenterological health, and speech therapy, among others. Bento emphasized the need for “lots of different proof points at scale in many different care verticals” before considering an IPO. This focus on deep, multi-vertical expansion via AI health is a key driver behind the delayed public offering. Why Venture Capital Remains Attractive Bento isn’t swayed by typical reasons cited for IPOs, such as brand building or access to capital. He points to successful private companies like Ikea and Lego as examples of strong brands built without going public. He also highlighted that robust startups can still secure substantial private funding, citing Databricks’ massive $10 billion raise as evidence. Furthermore, liquidity for employees and early shareholders, often a major driver for IPOs, is increasingly available through secondary markets for private companies. Bento indicated that Sword Health plans to launch a tender offer next month to provide liquidity options. This demonstrates that the benefits traditionally associated with public markets are becoming accessible in the private sphere. Predicting Future Investment Rounds Looking ahead, Bento is already anticipating the company’s next funding round. He predicts Sword Health will raise more capital next year, projecting a potential $50 million round at a $5 billion valuation. He humorously noted his fondness for the “numerical symmetry” in their funding progression ($30M at $3B, $40M at $4B, predicting $50M at $5B). The latest $40 million round brings Sword Health’s total funding raised to $380 million. Beyond General Catalyst, other investors participating in this round included Khosla Ventures, Comcast Ventures, Lince Capital, Oxy Capital, Armilar, Indico Capital, and Shilling, showcasing broad investor confidence in the company’s mission and growth potential. Sword Health ‘s decision to secure significant venture capital and delay its IPO plans underscores a strategic choice to prioritize deep product expansion and market validation across multiple health verticals before facing public scrutiny. This approach allows them to leverage private funding and flexibility to build a more comprehensive and robust AI health platform, aiming for long-term, sustainable growth.

The allocation depends on the client’s “risk appetite”, says Philippe Meyer, head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland. Speaking at the DigiAssets conference in London, the banker told Reuters that they allow up to 7% of portfolio in crypto for riskier profiles. “With private customers, since September last year, we started advising on bitcoin,” Meyer noted. In March, BBVA received approval from the country’s securities regulator to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading services in Spain. Spanish lending giant BBVA said it won approval to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading, integrating crypto into everyday banking. #BBVA #CryptoTrading https://t.co/ifB7FxuUV8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Notably, the bank has been considering clients’ requests to buy crypto since 2021. Meyer believes that it has become one of the first large global banks to advise wealthy clients to buy Bitcoin. Recently, JPMorgan said that it is finally allowing clients to buy Bitcoin . “We are going to allow you to buy it,” CEO Jamie Dimon said. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” However, it is unusual for lenders to advise clients to buy crypto. 95% of EU Banks Don’t Engage in Crypto: ESMA The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has repeatedly warned about the risks of crypto and said that the sector needed continued close monitoring. Further, the watchdog noted that 95% of EU banks do not engage in crypto activities. “Since 2025, we have been actively monitoring potential risks crypto assets could represent to financial stability,” ESMA noted. According to Meyer, BBVA currently advises clients to add only Bitcoin or Ether, with plans to add other cryptos later this year. Further, introducing 3% of the portfolio to crypto would’t be a huge risk, he added. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, if you introduce 3% you already boost the performance.” Mainstream Crypto Adoption Enables Institutions to Enter the $3.2T Industry According to Gadi Chait, Investment Manager at Xapo Bank, a crypto custodian, crypto’s increased legitimacy in the eyes of policymakers and rising retail adoption, fueled by genuine use cases, rather than price speculation, have encouraged recent adoption among banks. “Traditional finance is slowly waking up to crypto’s call and is vying for a piece of the pie,” he told Cryptonews. Additionally, Bitcoin’s surge to over $100,000 and the promise of pro-crypto policies attracted institutional interest and strengthened Bitcoin’s future, he said. “Globally, positive signals from countries like the UK, Japan, and Switzerland—around licensing and oversight—validate the asset class on a wider scale,” he added. Besides, the adoption of cryptocurrencies has seen remarkable growth in Spain recently. Per a 2024 survey by the European Central Bank (ECB), 9% of the Spanish population owns crypto assets, up from 4% in 2022. Further, Spain reached nearly $80 billion in cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2024, Chainalysis data noted.

The tweet, which reads “XRPL —> SWIFT via Gatehub Confirmed,” points to a functional link that has long been speculated within the digital asset ecosystem. The statement was accompanied by two images: one depicting a technical diagram from a Purdue University research publication showing GateHub as a node in a Ripple credit network, and another showing a partnership announcement between XRPL Labs and GateHub. This development adds clarity to GateHub’s role in enabling interoperability between fiat and cryptocurrency through the XRPL. XRPL —> SWIFT via Gatehub Confirmed. https://t.co/TVjZYKMVng pic.twitter.com/kOpFZ6cRs3 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 16, 2025 GateHub’s Role in XRP Ledger Interoperability GateHub, one of the early gateways built on the XRP Ledger, has expanded its utility by supporting transfers across major networks, including SEPA, SWIFT, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. This infrastructure enables users to send and receive fiat currencies directly through XRPL wallets, providing real-world liquidity pathways. According to the announcement published on GateHub’s website, the collaboration with XRPL Labs (developers of Xumm) facilitates on and off-ramping for 14 assets. This positions XRPL as a central settlement layer that interfaces directly with global financial networks. Ripple CEO Highlights XRPL’s Competitive Edge This update comes shortly after comments made by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse at the 2025 XRPL Apex event in Singapore. During the event, Garlinghouse projected that the XRPL could handle up to 14% of SWIFT’s global transaction volume within the next five years. He argued that the future of cross-border payments depends less on messaging protocols and more on actual liquidity movement. Garlinghouse asserted that XRP is designed to provide exactly this, citing its speed and utility in facilitating real-time settlement. He emphasized that while SWIFT is a messaging layer, XRPL, coupled with XRP, functions as a liquidity and settlement layer. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical Basis and On-Chain Evidence Garlinghouse’s remarks were made during a Q&A session where Ripple CTO David Schwartz was also present. The CEO reiterated that XRP was created to improve upon legacy systems, which are often slow, expensive, and opaque. He noted that XRPL can support real-time gross settlement, foreign exchange, and remittance functionalities on-chain. The new developments involving GateHub now illustrate a tangible connection between the XRP ecosystem and SWIFT-compatible operations. The technical image shared by SMQKE shows GateHub as a node that provides credit links between multiple users, including one directly linked to fiat-denominated values. This reinforces GateHub’s role as an intermediary for fiat-crypto exchange through the XRP Ledger. The other image features a visual from GateHub’s website, confirming live integration with networks such as SWIFT. Ripple’s Long-Term Vision While Ripple continues to expand its enterprise partnerships, including its recent push into stablecoins with RLUSD, this confirmation of live interoperability with SWIFT via GateHub aligns with Ripple’s strategic positioning of XRPL as a central infrastructure for global settlement. SMQKE’s tweet brings focus to this architecture by showcasing both theoretical and applied components of the XRP-based settlement network. The evidence presented corroborates Ripple’s stated ambition to integrate with traditional financial systems while offering an alternative to outdated settlement rails. With both technical infrastructure and active partnerships now in place, the role of XRPL in cross-border finance appears to be strengthening.

As XRP eyes a potential ETF-fueled breakout, a rising project called Pepeto is winning attention with real utility, zero-fee trading, and early investor buzz. Table of Contents XRP forecast: Can the ETF hype push it to $27? Next gen exchange with real utility not just hype Presale: A demo version of exchange + 278% staking reward for early buyers The crypto market is heating up, and XRP holders are watching closely. Many believe the token is gearing up for another run, but the big question remains when will it peak and when should profits be taken? While momentum builds, another crypto project is turning heads by solving problems XRP still struggles with, like day-to-day utility and frictionless global payments. Before checking the new coin out, here’s the latest outlook for XRP and why this rising token deserves attention too. XRP forecast: Can the ETF hype push it to $27? XRP is still under $3, but buzz is building around a possible rally to $27 if a spot ETF gets approved. Analysts are optimistic, and Polymarket now estimates an 87% chance of approval thanks to the new SEC chair’s favorable view on crypto. Ripple is actively expanding partnerships globally, hoping to seal more US deals soon. CEO Brad Garlinghouse thinks the end of the SEC case could send XRP soaring. Still, Circle’s growing network poses stiff competition if Ripple delays. A jump to $27 means a $1.9 trillion market cap, which is ambitious even for XRP. The token is up 350% this year, but future gains rely just as much on regulation as on technical trends. You might also like: Fartcoin, Bonk soar; Pepeto gears up to be leading option for 100x gains Next gen exchange with real utility not just hype As XRP continues navigating legal barriers, another project is gaining real traction. It’s creating a zero-fee exchange that lists memecoins and valuable projects with no red tape, and no massive listing charges. Just straightforward access. To qualify, tokens must provide real use. And thanks to advanced bridge tech, assets move effortlessly between blockchains. For global payments, the platform includes a tool that allows buyers to pay in crypto while sellers get fiat fast, simple, no juggling platforms.

Presale: A demo version of exchange + 278% staking reward for early buyers Pepeto’s presale is still ongoing, already bringing in over $5.3 million and growing fast. It’s got over 70k followers and is trending across social platforms. At just $0.000000134 per token, Pepeto is under the radar and that’s what makes it exciting. Early investors, especially Pepe holders, are taking note. There are even whispers of drama: a former Pepe co-founder allegedly pushed out, returning with Pepeto to finish the vision, adding the missing T (Technology) and O (Optimization) to the original memecoin.

His artificial intelligence startup, xAI , is reportedly making waves in the funding landscape, seeking a substantial new capital infusion. This move highlights the immense financial demands of competing in the rapidly evolving AI sector. Why is xAI Seeking a New Equity Raise ? According to recent reports, Elon Musk ‘s xAI is aiming to secure a significant Equity Raise totaling $4.3 billion. This isn’t the first time the company has sought considerable funds. Earlier reports indicated plans to raise $5 billion in debt funding for the combined entity of X (formerly Twitter) and xAI . This new equity target comes relatively soon after xAI reportedly received a $6 billion cash infusion in December. The need for additional capital appears driven by the high operational costs associated with developing and running advanced AI technologies.

In the first four days, the console sold over 3.5 million units. The stock rose for a fifth straight session, at one point jumping over 10.15%, marking its strongest two-month rally. Investors were convinced by reports that the Switch 2 sold more than 3.5 million units in its first four days, based on figures through June 11. The console went out of stock in several major stores. Nintendo stock price. Source: Google Finance That launch figures far outstripped the original Switch’s roughly 2.7 million sales in its first month back in 2017. Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda noted that, with the US and Japan unable to agree on new tariff measures at the recent Group of Seven summit, money has flowed into industries less exposed to duties. “Funds are moving into the game sector, which is less affected by tariffs,” he said. Other gaming stocks also saw gains. Square Enix added up to 4.7% and Bandai Namco rose as much as 3.9%. Investors have been drawn to the relative safety of games, even as worries about tariffs and geopolitical tensions grow. Japan remains a major player in gaming with Sony and Nintendo Sony commands the market with the PlayStation, while Nintendo’s Switch line remains a global hit among fans of handheld consoles. Popular series from these companies include “Elden Ring” and “Super Mario,” which continue to drive strong interest worldwide. The Switch 2’s launch is Nintendo’s first new console in eight years. By selling over 3.5 million units in just four days, it has already outpaced the original model’s first-month performance. Those early numbers, published by Nintendo on Wednesday, point toward its goal of shifting 15 million units by March 2026, and suggest even higher potential if production can keep pace. Industry watchers see the launch as a turning point. With development costs rising and profit margins tightening across gaming, a hit console can reshape strategies for partners and competitors. A strong Switch 2 could help offset the dominance of major live-service titles and breathe new life into hardware sales. But meeting demand poses a big challenge. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa issued an apology after many customers had to return empty-handed from the lotteries. Nintendo has urged its manufacturing partners to boost the production and struck deals with Japanese online marketplaces like Rakuten, Mercari and LY to curb reseller activity. Most Switch 2 units are built in China by firms such as Foxconn Technology Group. Even as shares have swung on tariff worries, the latest sales figures and the rally in gaming stocks shows that investors are confident about Nintendo pushing the Switch 2 console.

This decision is expected to fuel adoption of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL)—and indirectly boost XRP’s price and utility. Let’s break down how this law changes the game for stablecoins, and what it means for Ripple, RLUSD, and XRP holders. GENIUS Act Brings Regulatory Clarity to the $261 Billion Stablecoin Market The stablecoin market is now valued at $261.5 billion, led by: Tether (USDT) – $155.4B USD Coin (USDC) – $61.4B USDS, BSC-USD, USDE, DAI – Remaining top contenders Passed with a 68-30 vote, the GENIUS Act sets new standards for audits, reserves, and licensing, ending the Wild West era for stablecoins. Senator Bill Hagerty, who backed the bill, called it “a new era of payments,” emphasizing its potential to make transactions faster and cheaper across the financial system. What the GENIUS Act Means for Trust and Transparency Until now, stablecoins faced regulatory uncertainty, deterring institutional adoption. The GENIUS Act changes that by requiring: Full reserve backing Independent audits Strict licensing This means stablecoin issuers must prove they hold enough assets to match what they issue—restoring public and institutional trust. Why RLUSD Could Become a Top Institutional Stablecoin A recent post on X by crypto expert SMQKE explained that RLUSD is designed with GENIUS compliance in mind. This opens the doors for: Banks Asset managers Global corporations to adopt RLUSD, as it meets regulatory requirements they demand before integrating crypto into operations. More RLUSD Usage = More XRP Burned = Higher XRP Price? Here’s where XRP benefits: RLUSD operates exclusively on the XRP Ledger Every RLUSD transaction burns a small amount of XRP This reduces XRP supply over time In economic terms, less supply plus growing demand often leads to higher prices. So, increased RLUSD usage could fuel XRP’s long-term value. XRP Price Trend 1-Year Growth: +441.6% Last 30 Days: -7.5%. Despite a recent dip, long-term sentiment remains bullish, especially with real-world use cases like RLUSD gaining traction. RLUSD vs CBDCs: A New Digital Payments Race? Crypto expert SMQKE also pointed out that regulated stablecoins like RLUSD now have an edge over government CBDCs (central bank digital currencies). With regulatory clarity, RLUSD can: Launch faster Scale globally Compete as a secure, trusted payment solution This puts Ripple and XRP in a stronger position to compete in the evolving digital finance landscape. Bottom Line: The GENIUS Act is a major win for Ripple’s RLUSD, institutional adoption, and XRP holders. As stablecoin rules get clearer, XRP Ledger’s role in compliant digital finance is growing fast. Keep an eye on RLUSD adoption and XRP’s burn rate—this could be the fuel for the next big XRP rally.",News|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP)|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 06:14:34

With the total market cap falling by 1.83% to $3.28 trillion and trading volumes dropping 7.63% to $123.25 billion, investor confidence appears shaken. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently stands at 48, marking a “Neutral” sentiment, suggesting that investors are indecisive and are confused between being cautious and holding confidence. This shift in sentiments is being shaped by broader macroeconomic and geopolitical triggers. Renewed Trump tariff threats, escalating tension in the Israel-Iran conflict, and fresh debates surrounding the US stablecoin regulation bill have added pressure to an already fragile market. Talking about market share, Bitcoin’s dominance now sits at 64%, while Ethereum holds 9.3%. The Altcoin Season Index reads just 23/100, confirming that altcoins are far from leading the market narrative. Liquidations Spike as Leverage Traders Face the Heat? According to CoinGlass , in the past 24 hours, over 105,830 traders were liquidated, wiping out a massive $319.18 million in positions. ETH traders suffered the most, with $100.83M in liquidations, followed by BTC with $82.89M. This indicates a major shift in trader sentiment, possibly due to surprise market moves and increased volatility. The largest individual liquidation occurred on Binance’s ETH/USDT pair, valued at $4.23M. These figures highlight the risks of high leverage in choppy market conditions and point to a growing disconnect between trader expectations and market direction. Fear & Greed Index Reflects Market Uncertainty The Fear & Greed Index has dipped from the Greed zone earlier this month, sliding to a neutral score of 48. This decline comes in tandem with Bitcoin’s price retracing from highs above $111k to lows near $105k over the past two weeks. Notably, the index briefly dipped below the neutral threshold around June 5. Further, coinciding with the sharpest drop in Bitcoin price, and again showed hesitation around June 13–15, reflecting investor hesitation to commit in either direction. Even though BTC volume remained relatively stable, the sentiment remained constrained in the Neutral zone. The sentiment swing, combined with heightened liquidation pressure, paints a picture of a market waiting for a decisive catalyst. Wondering how BTC price could close the year? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 FAQs What does a Fear & Greed Index of 48 indicate? A reading of 48 reflects a neutral sentiment, meaning investors are neither overly fearful nor greedy. Why were there massive liquidations recently? The spike in liquidations stems from high-leverage positions being wiped out during sudden price swings, as geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty shattered the market confidence.

The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, ahead of an increase in Phase 6 to $0.035. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when the presale started, Mutuum Finance will officially go live at $0.06, giving current buyers a minimum 100% return on investment. Analysts are beginning to flag it as a potential next big cryptocurrency. For those closely following crypto news today and asking what crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming more than a whisper, it’s emerging as a legitimate coin for leading the 2025 bull run. Mutuum Finance presale picks up steam, raises over $10.7M as investor excitement builds Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as a standout project in the altcoin space, drawing attention from investors ahead of its official 2025 launch. With each phase of the presale selling out faster than expected, momentum around the project is accelerating. Following the rapid sell-off of Phase 4, the presale is currently on Phase 5 with tokens being sold at a price of $0.03 with early adopters able to enjoy a potential gain of 16.67% when they raise the price in the next phase. The project has so far gathered the interest of more than 12,100 investors and raised more than $10.7 million which evidence that the community supports and believes in its vision. The direction is clear, and the innovative features hold great potential that Mutuum Finance is setting itself up to be one of the most promising altcoin investments in the next few years moving into 2025. Smart tokenomics set Mutuum apart Mutuum finance is intended to be sustainable and not affected by fluctuations in the prices of a mainly hyped crypto project. Its Buy-and-Distribute model will periodically buy tokens in the market and then redistributes them to stakers. This encourages long-term holding, minimizes the volatility of the price, and promotes the value of the token, providing long-term loyal investors with a significant advantage in the long run. Stablecoin launch and CertiK audit add institutional credibility Mutuum Finance is creating an entire ecosystem. The much-anticipated launch of a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum is one of the most important pillars of this vision. It is designed to survive market turbulence and provides a stable alternative to the failed algorithmic stablecoins which have destabilised prior DeFi ecosystems. Security has also been front and center. Mutuum Finance has undergone a comprehensive smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry’s most trusted cybersecurity firms. This stamp of approval not only validates the platform’s codebase but also signals a strong commitment to transparency, safety, and investor protection. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a serious coin to lead the next crypto bull run, just as legacy tokens like Ripple (XRP) lose momentum. With over $10.7 million raised and 12,100+ investors already on board, its rapid presale growth, currently in Phase 5 at $0.03, shows no signs of slowing. A 100% ROI is locked in for those who buy now, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, and the next phase increase to $0.035 just around the corner. Add in smart tokenomics, a fully backed USD stablecoin, and a CertiK audit, and Mutuum is clearly more than hype, it’s a project built for long-term dominance. Don’t wait for the headlines.

While much focus is on complex tasks like data analysis or natural language processing, researchers are also finding surprising insights by observing AIs tackle simpler challenges – like playing classic video games. This intersection of AI and gaming provides a unique testbed, revealing unexpected aspects of AI behavior , sometimes with amusing results that resonate even within the tech and crypto community interested in cutting-edge technology. How Do AI Models Tackle Retro Games? AI companies are locked in a race for industry dominance, pushing the boundaries of what large language models can do. But sometimes, the most revealing tests happen not in simulated boardrooms, but in virtual Pokémon gyms. Google DeepMind and Anthropic are both studying how their latest AI models, specifically Google’s DeepMind Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic’s Claude, navigate early Pokémon games. This isn’t just for fun; it’s a form of AI benchmarking, albeit an unconventional one. Traditional AI benchmarking often involves standardized datasets and metrics, which some argue lack real-world context. Testing AI in games , however, offers a dynamic environment where models must reason, plan, and adapt over extended periods. This approach provides qualitative insights into their decision-making processes. For months, independent developers have even streamed these AI playthroughs on Twitch (‘Gemini Plays Pokémon’ and ‘Claude Plays Pokémon’), allowing anyone to watch the AI’s ‘reasoning’ – a natural language output explaining its thought process – in real time. This transparency offers a window into the inner workings of these advanced AI models . Google Gemini’s Unexpected Panic Response A recent report from Google DeepMind revealed a fascinating, and slightly unsettling, observation about Google Gemini 2.5 Pro’s performance in Pokémon. The report notes that when the AI’s Pokémon are close to fainting in battle, the model appears to enter a state of ‘panic’. This ‘panic’ state leads to a ‘qualitatively observable degradation in the model’s reasoning capability’. The AI might suddenly stop using effective strategies or tools it previously employed. While AI doesn’t experience emotion like humans, its actions under stress mimic poor, hasty decision-making. This behavior has been consistent enough that even viewers on the Twitch stream have noticed and commented on it. Other Curious AI Behavior in Games It’s not just Google Gemini exhibiting strange quirks. Claude has also shown peculiar AI behavior in its Pokémon journey. In one instance, Claude observed that losing all its Pokémon (‘whiting out’) sends the player back to a Pokémon Center. When stuck in Mt. Moon cave, the AI incorrectly hypothesized that intentionally losing would transport it to the nearest Pokémon Center in the next town, rather than the one it last visited. Viewers watched as the AI essentially attempted to ‘game over’ itself to escape the cave, demonstrating a flawed understanding of the game’s mechanics despite recognizing a pattern. Where AI Models Excel (and Fall Short) Despite these moments of confusion or ‘panic’, it’s important to note that these AI models are still remarkably capable in certain areas. While they take hundreds of hours to complete a game a child finishes much faster, their strength lies in specific problem-solving. The Google DeepMind report highlights that Gemini 2.5 Pro shows impressive accuracy in solving certain in-game puzzles. With some human guidance, the AI created ‘agentic tools’ – specific instances of Gemini 2.5 Pro focused on particular tasks – to efficiently solve complex boulder puzzles required to progress through areas like Victory Road. The AI was able to solve these puzzles ‘one-shot’ after being prompted with basic rules and verification methods. Google theorizes that future iterations of Google Gemini might even be capable of creating these specialized tools without human intervention, suggesting a path towards more autonomous problem-solving within dynamic environments. This highlights the potential for AI in games not just as players, but as developers of strategies or tools within the game world. In conclusion, watching advanced AI models like Google Gemini and Claude play Pokémon offers a unique and often surprising glimpse into their capabilities and limitations. The observation of ‘panic’ behavior in Gemini under stress, or Claude’s misguided attempt to ‘white out’ for strategic movement, underscores that even sophisticated AI can exhibit unexpected frailties when faced with novel or stressful situations. Conversely, their ability to solve complex puzzles and potentially develop specialized tools points towards their significant potential. This blend of impressive skill and peculiar vulnerability makes studying AI in games a valuable endeavor for understanding the frontier of artificial intelligence and AI behavior .

Global uncertainty, especially around U.S.-China trade issues and unclear signals from central banks, has rattled investors. Plus, the recent rejection of multiple ETF applications has added to the negative sentiment around risk assets like crypto. Analyst BullnChill flagged the unusual combo of heavy volume and a price drop, which often signals an important shift in market sentiment. Experts believe the move may be driven by broader macro volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and overall pressure across the crypto market. Now, investors are watching closely to see if this is just noise, or the start of something bigger for XRP. Even with Ripple working on its RLUSD stablecoin and expanding in places like Dubai and Singapore, those developments haven’t sparked much optimism, at least for now. What Next For XRP Price?

Many are now asking the big question: Is altcoin season finally here? However, according to analyst Lark Davis , the real opportunity lies in spotting the strongest performers early. The analyst has shared 7 coins he thinks could explode this summer: Solana (SOL) Solana already had a strong cycle and is currently down around 49% from its January highs. However, the SOL/BTC chart shows signs that Solana could be gearing up for a strong recovery. There is ETF hype around Solana, and the SEC is reviewing its filings, with the PolyMarket even showing a 90% chance of approval. The current cooldown in volume may be the calm before the storm, making it a good time to position ahead of a breakout. It is currently down 3% in the last 24 hours, trading at $147.47. Litecoin (LTC) Next up is Litecoin. With ETF talks around LTC, big exchange listings and a clean regulatory profile, it could attract institutional interest. Its relatively low market cap under $10 billion makes it appealing compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. It is currently trading at $84.94, down 1% in the past day. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum has underperformed this cycle, but still has a bullish chart setup up. With strong ETF inflows, and staking upgrades, ETH could breakout soon. The ETH/BTC ratio is also holding firm, pointing towards a possible upside. With growing developer activity, SEC support for DeFi, AI use cases, and a plan to scale Ethereum 10x, ETH could witness a strong summer rally. It is currently trading at $2529.76, down 2%. Pepe (PEPE) For those seeking higher volatility and meme-driven momentum, Davis points to Pepe (PEPE) as Ethereum’s “meme beta.” It often moves quickly when Ethereum and other altcoins rally. With a large community, PEPE remains a popular choice. It is down 3% in the past day. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Virtuals Protocol is Davis’ top pick in the AI category. While many AI tokens have pumped and crashed, VIRTUAL has continued to build steadily. Its solid tokenomics, real-world use case focused on AI agents, and integration with the Base chain give it strong long-term potential. VIRTUAL could be a strategic choice for those seeking exposure to both the AI trend and the growing Base ecosystem. It is currently priced at $1.69, down 7% in the past day. Plume (PLUME) The sixth token is Plume, which is a new player in the real-world asset (RWA) space. It recently launched its Genesis mainnet and provides access to yield opportunities through its platform, Portal. Despite facing a setback after the passing of a co-founder, Plume is beginning to show bullish signs. It has a current market cap of approximately $200 million and is down 7% in the last 24 hours. Wormhole (WORM) Wormhole is known for its cross-chain interoperability as it helps transfer tokenized assets such as stablecoins and RWAs across multiple blockchains. It already handles over $55.6 billion in value and is integrated with major institutions like Securitize, which is involved in projects tied to BlackRock. Davis considers Wormhole “seriously undervalued” at its current $350 million market cap, and sees strong potential for the future. It is down 1% in the past day.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|LTC|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 07:12:36

Still, timelines for approvals are less certain IMO https://t.co/mwKuYgQuBS — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 17, 2025 Earlier this month, the analyst placed approval odds for both SOL and XRP ETFs at 90% and 85% respectively, citing the SEC’s current view of each asset, existing CFTC oversight of futures, and the strength of the filing institutions. Both SOL and XRP have dropped roughly 4% over the past 24 hours, likely in response to the regulatory decision. Meanwhile, the first XRP ETF recently launched in Canada following approval from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), signaling growing interest and adoption beyond the United States.

46260950,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=170003,1750231242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46260950.jpeg,Shockwave: OpenAI’s $200M DoD Contract Jolts Microsoft Relationship,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-dod-contract-microsoft/,"BitcoinWorld Shockwave: OpenAI’s $200M DoD Contract Jolts Microsoft Relationship In the fast-paced world of technology and government contracts, a recent announcement sent ripples across the industry, particularly affecting the dynamic between two major players. OpenAI revealed it secured a significant contract with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), valued at up to $200 million. For those following the intersection of AI and national security, and even its broader implications for tech markets often mirrored in crypto volatility, this development is crucial. What Does the OpenAI DoD Contract Entail? OpenAI’s agreement with the DoD focuses on leveraging its advanced AI models to develop prototype systems. The stated goal is to assist the agency with administrative tasks and other critical functions. OpenAI provided examples such as: Streamlining healthcare access for service members. Organizing and simplifying data from various defense programs. Enhancing proactive cyber defense capabilities. The company emphasized that all applications developed under this contract must align with OpenAI’s existing usage policies and guidelines. The DoD’s own description of the award was slightly more direct, mentioning the development of “prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains.” This reference to “warfighting” immediately raised questions, given OpenAI’s public stance on the use of its technology. Navigating the Shifting Sands: AI in Military Applications The mention of “warfighting” domains by the DoD highlights a complex and evolving area: the application of AI in military contexts. While OpenAI’s guidelines explicitly prohibit individual users from using its tools for developing or using weapons, the company quietly removed an explicit ban on “military and warfare” from its terms of service in January 2024. This change, preceding the DoD contract announcement, suggests a potential shift or clarification in how OpenAI views governmental and defense-related uses of its technology. The push for advanced AI capabilities within the military is also fueled by geopolitical concerns. Prominent figures in the tech world, such as Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz (an OpenAI investor), have framed the competition in AI development between countries like the U.S. and China as a modern “cold war.” In this climate, it’s perhaps unsurprising that the DoD is keen to integrate cutting-edge AI, including models from leading labs like OpenAI, for a variety of purposes, potentially including those touching upon defense operations. The Elephant in the Room: The Microsoft OpenAI Dynamic Beyond the specifics of the contract, one of the most intriguing aspects of this deal is its potential impact on the relationship between OpenAI and its largest investor, Microsoft. Microsoft has a long-standing, deep relationship with the U.S. government, holding thousands of contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The company has invested heavily and worked for decades to implement the stringent security protocols required for government agencies, particularly the DoD, to use its cloud services like Azure. Microsoft has been actively integrating OpenAI’s models into its own offerings, including the Azure OpenAI Service. In fact, it was only in April that Microsoft announced that its Azure OpenAI Service had received approval from the DoD for use across all classified levels. This positioned Microsoft as the primary channel for the DoD to access OpenAI’s frontier models securely. However, OpenAI’s direct contract with the DoD for up to $200 million signifies the government agency going straight to the source for specific prototype development. While this doesn’t necessarily mean the DoD will abandon Microsoft’s integrated services, it certainly represents OpenAI building its own direct relationship and revenue stream with a major government client that Microsoft might have expected to service primarily through its platform. From Microsoft’s perspective, seeing its key partner secure such a substantial direct deal with one of its most important customers likely feels like a competitive move. OpenAI’s Growing Direct Engagement with AI in Government This DoD contract is part of a larger strategic initiative by OpenAI called “OpenAI for Government.” This program aims to consolidate and expand OpenAI’s direct sales and collaboration efforts with various government agencies. According to OpenAI, this includes existing relationships with entities like the U.S. National Labs, the Air Force Research Laboratory, NASA, NIH, and the Treasury Department. This move signals OpenAI’s increasing ambition to sell its technology directly to large enterprise and government clients, rather than solely relying on partnerships like the one with Microsoft. While partnerships are valuable for scale and integration, direct contracts offer higher margins and greater control over the client relationship and use cases. As AI in government becomes more prevalent, securing these direct channels is strategically important for OpenAI. What This Means Going Forward The $200 million OpenAI DoD contract underscores the critical role advanced AI is expected to play in national security and government operations. It highlights the intense competition not just between nations in developing AI, but also between tech giants vying for lucrative government business. The contract presents both an opportunity for OpenAI to prove its capabilities in sensitive environments and a potential point of friction in its crucial partnership with Microsoft, which has heavily invested in being the bridge between OpenAI and enterprise/government customers. How this dynamic evolves will be a key story to watch in the tech world. To learn more about the latest AI market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping AI features.

It is a system-builder, not just a meme coin.” — Insider source involved in Ethereum Foundation research initiatives As speculation about $AKE’s possible alignment with the Ethereum Foundation grows, the cryptocurrency world is in a frenzy of activity. Although there hasn’t been an official announcement yet, insider information and on-chain trends imply that a major partnership might be underway. Many are eagerly anticipating an update to https://snakyway.com/ where their presale is currently held. Under the hood, the scenario appears to be strategic and more than feasible. Why Would Ethereum Choose $AKE? The Ethereum Foundation is renowned for supporting initiatives that have a positive impact on society, the economy, and technology. That’s precisely where $AKE is distinct. On-Chain AI Market-Making The AI Agent, a shrewd, self-governing trading system running on Ethereum, is the brains behind $AKE’s technology. While staying completely decentralized, it replicates institutional-grade market activity, sustains token health, and generates organic purchase pressure. Real Utility Through Gaming $AKE is greater than just a meme. With play-to-earn features and digital asset integration, the token powers a Web3 gaming platform that gives the Ethereum network everyday utility. Ethereum’s overarching goal of long-term, user-driven network participation is supported by these transactions. Structured, Transparent Launch Unlike fly-by-night meme tokens, $AKE has taken the professional route: Published whitepaper Detailed multi-phase roadmap Presale transparency Team backed by high-profile connections in DeFi, exchanges, and crypto analytics The Ethereum Foundation has consistently expressed a preference for well-organized, long-term initiatives, and $AKE is certainly amid them. What Ethereum Foundation Support Could Mean for $AKE If Ethereum Foundation brings $AKE into its ecosystem, the impact would be seismic: Credibility Surge : Instantly positioning $AKE as more than a meme, but a tech-forward asset.

Momentum indicators like BBP and CMF turn negative, signaling weakening accumulation pressure. Bears eye deeper retracement toward $2,480 and $2,400 if the $2,537–$2,540 support fails. By Jainam Mehta Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has come under renewed pressure, dropping below the $2,550 mark after multiple failed attempts to reclaim the $2,620–$2,650 resistance zone. The pullback follows a sharp bearish engulfing candle from the $2,600 level, which now coincides with a key rejection area along a descending trendline. Price action on the 4-hour chart shows ETH slipping below the 20/50/100 EMA cluster, with short-term structure shifting toward bearish mean reversion. ETH price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Indicators confirm the weakening momentum. On the 30-minute chart, ETH is trading beneath the Ichimoku cloud, while Bollinger and Keltner Channels are narrowing — signaling reduced volatility with a bearish tilt. A key Break of Structure (BoS) has also occurred around the $2,525–$2,530 region on the Smart Money Concepts layout, indicating that sellers are targeting lower zones. If current levels fail to hold, the $2,480 demand block remains the next critical level to watch. Momentum signals suggest further losses if $2,537 fails The bearish shift is reinforced by momentum indicators. Bull and Bear Power ((BBP)) has dropped to -38.7, and the Chaikin Money Flow ((CMF)) has turned negative at -0.15, suggesting capital outflows. Directional Movement Index (DMI) confirms this with the -DI line overtaking +DI across both 30-minute and 4-hour charts, while ADX near 31 highlights growing trend strength in favor of sellers. Higher timeframe charts offer broader context. ETH continues to consolidate within a descending wedge and remains capped by the $2,780–$2,820 resistance zone. Price is now situated near the midline of the weekly Fibonacci retracement, with $2,286 representing the 0.382 level and the next major support if breakdowns continue. The long-term structure remains bearish until bulls reclaim control above $2,780. Outlook and previously discussed context Looking ahead, if ETH fails to defend the $2,537–$2,540 region, further declines toward $2,480 and $2,400 are likely. Only a decisive daily close above $2,600 — and later $2,655 — would restore bullish momentum. Until then, short-term risk remains skewed to the downside as market conditions cool. Previously, we noted in earlier ETH coverage that the $2,500–$2,520 range was a key demand reaccumulation zone . That area now risks being converted into supply, signaling a shift in sentiment that traders should monitor closely.

With its spot ETF momentum and ongoing upgrades Ethereum is firmly on the radar for investors searching what to buy before June ends. But the big FOMO is building around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto token under $1 that’s been quietly staging a presale run, popping off with impressive traction. The project is in its phase 5 of its presale and it’s priced at $0.03. Already, more than $10.7 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance, with 12,100 early investors participating so far. Mutuum Finance is fast becoming the best crypto to buy in 2025 for those chasing top tokens only with breakout potential. $10.7M+ Raised: Mutuum Finance Presale Smashes Milestones Mutuum Finance is becoming the leader in DeFi, as the presale has already reached the mark of more than 10.7 million and attracted more than 12,100 investors. The trend is real. MUTM tokens are already at $0.03 currently, but there are more rounds ahead, raising the price to an eighth in the sixth presale round (to $0.035), and the launch prices are projected to be twice that at $0.06. To the interested party aiming at making a smart early entry it translates to as much as 100% of ROI. Demand is on high, and first-mover advantage is turning out to be the name of success. $100,000 MUTM Giveaway: 10 Chances to Win $10K Mutuum Finance is a new protocol eager to reward the first supporters it has on its platform and has opened a $100,000 giveaway . This campaign will be an acknowledgment of the rapidly expanding community in the project as well as gratitude to the initial investors. However, the clock is ticking. Do not lose the opportunity to be one of the winners and at the same time gaining a stake as one of the most discussed new projects in DeFi. Audited, Transparent, and Built for Long-Term Success As most of the DeFi projects cannot seem to meet their own expectations, the Mutuum Finance project is demonstrating its staying power. The project has got its smart contracts audited by Certik, one of the most credible brand names in blockchain security. This audit assures the investors that Mutuum Finance code is sound and transparent. Mutuum Finance is also building a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the USD on Ethereum. Intended to provide stability, liquidity depth, and trust, this stablecoin will be used by both retail and institutional customers, which makes the platform designed by Mutuum not only innovative but also reliable and future-proof. Mutuum Finance’s Dual-Model Lending Platform Mutuum Finance offers a robust and vibrant lending solution in which the cost of the Participants is a blend of the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and the Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In this context, the liquidity providers in the form of USDT will also have a stable and reasonable retention of the profits and the profits will be convenient. Meanwhile, the P2P model provides a user with full control over his or her transactions between lending and borrowing money and provides personalized terms and trustless crypto lending between the two parties. This two-way model makes users certain and independent, and this is why Mutuum Finance will be the best participant in the DeFi lending market. Ethereum is rising, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking the stage as a bigger gainer. It has raised over $10.7M+ with 12,100+ investors and its presale of $0.03 has the potential to hit 100% ROI at the launch and 74x long-term returns. Being supported by a Certik audit, USD-pegged stablecoin, and a $100K giveaway, the MUTM will be one of the greatest altcoins to monitor.

This development, first reported by Reuters, signals a growing confidence among major financial institutions regarding the role of crypto in modern investment strategies. What is BBVA Recommending for High-Net-Worth Crypto Investors? According to reports, since September 2024, BBVA has been guiding its affluent clientele towards including cryptocurrencies in their investment mix. The specific recommendation involves allocating between 3% and 7% of a client’s total portfolio to digital assets. The exact percentage suggested depends primarily on the individual client’s risk appetite and overall financial goals. This tailored approach acknowledges the inherent volatility of the crypto market while recognizing its potential benefits for portfolio diversification. Initially, the focus of this BBVA crypto allocation advice has been on the two largest and most established cryptocurrencies by market capitalization: Bitcoin (BTC): Often referred to as ‘digital gold’, Bitcoin is the pioneer cryptocurrency and remains the dominant force in the market. Its limited supply and first-mover advantage make it a popular choice for institutional investors. Ethereum (ETH): The backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and NFTs, Ethereum’s network functionality and ongoing development make it another key player considered suitable for larger portfolios. The bank reportedly has plans to broaden the scope of its recommendations later this year, potentially including other cryptocurrencies as the market evolves and regulatory clarity improves. Why Are Banks Like BBVA Eyeing High-Net-Worth Crypto Allocations? This move by BBVA is not happening in a vacuum. It reflects several converging trends in the financial world: Client Demand: High-net-worth individuals are increasingly sophisticated investors. Many have expressed interest in cryptocurrencies and are seeking ways to gain exposure through trusted financial advisors rather than navigating the complexities of crypto exchanges themselves. Institutional Crypto Adoption: There’s a clear trend of larger financial players, from asset managers to banks, exploring or entering the crypto space. Offering crypto exposure is becoming a competitive necessity. Portfolio Diversification: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have historically shown low correlation with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds. A small allocation can potentially enhance portfolio returns and reduce overall risk through diversification, a key principle in managing wealth for affluent clients. Potential for High Returns: While volatile, the crypto market has demonstrated the potential for significant returns, which can be attractive to investors looking to grow their wealth over the long term. By providing structured advice on high-net-worth crypto investments, BBVA aims to meet client demand, stay competitive, and potentially capture some of the growth opportunities presented by the digital asset class. Understanding the 3% to 7% Allocation Strategy The suggested range of 3% to 7% is crucial. It indicates a cautious yet meaningful approach. Here’s what that percentage range typically implies in portfolio management: Lower End (3%): Suitable for clients with moderate risk tolerance. It’s enough to provide some exposure to the potential upside of crypto and benefit from diversification effects, without exposing a large portion of the portfolio to significant volatility. Higher End (7%): Recommended for clients with a higher risk tolerance who are comfortable with potentially larger price swings in pursuit of higher returns. It still represents a minority stake in the overall portfolio, ensuring that the majority of assets remain in more traditional, stable investments. This range reflects the current understanding of crypto’s risk profile – high potential reward balanced by high volatility. It’s not a ‘get rich quick’ scheme being recommended, but rather a strategic inclusion for long-term portfolio health, aligning with principles of crypto portfolio diversification . Focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Calculated Start The decision to initially recommend only Bitcoin and Ethereum for Bitcoin Ethereum investment is a pragmatic one. These two assets offer several advantages from an institutional perspective: Liquidity: BTC and ETH are the most liquid cryptocurrencies, meaning they can be bought and sold in large volumes without significantly impacting their price. This is essential for managing larger portfolios. Market Cap & Stability (Relative): While volatile, they are the largest and most established crypto networks, with the longest track records and the most robust infrastructure and community support. Brand Recognition: They are the most well-known cryptocurrencies globally, making them more familiar and potentially less intimidating for traditional investors. Regulatory Scrutiny: While regulations are still evolving, BTC and ETH have been under the regulatory microscope longer than most altcoins, potentially offering slightly more clarity or predictability, although significant uncertainty remains. Starting with these two foundational assets allows BBVA and its clients to dip their toes into the crypto market with relatively more established options before exploring the potentially higher risks and complexities of smaller altcoins. Implications of Institutional Crypto Adoption BBVA’s move is a significant data point in the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption . When a major, established bank in a regulated jurisdiction begins actively advising wealthy clients on crypto allocation, it lends further legitimacy to the asset class. It suggests that crypto is increasingly seen not just as a speculative curiosity, but as a viable, albeit risky, component of a sophisticated investment portfolio. This trend could have several knock-on effects: Encourage other traditional financial institutions to follow suit. Increase the flow of significant capital into the crypto market. Potentially lead to the development of more regulated and accessible crypto investment products. Further integrate the crypto market with the traditional financial system. While challenges like regulatory uncertainty and market volatility persist, actions like BBVA’s demonstrate that the bridge between traditional finance and decentralized digital assets is being built, piece by piece. What Are the Risks and Considerations? It’s crucial to remember that investing in cryptocurrencies, even Bitcoin and Ethereum, carries significant risks. BBVA’s advice is specifically tailored for high-net-worth individuals who typically have greater financial capacity and risk tolerance. Key risks include: Volatility: Crypto prices can experience dramatic swings in short periods. Regulatory Changes: The regulatory landscape is still developing and can impact market dynamics significantly. Security Risks: While BBVA would likely facilitate investment through secure channels, the underlying assets and associated platforms can be targets for hacks or fraud. Market Sentiment: Prices can be heavily influenced by news, social media, and overall market psychology. Any investor considering crypto, regardless of wealth level, must conduct thorough research, understand the technology, and be prepared for the possibility of losing their investment. The 3-7% allocation recommended by BBVA reflects a strategy to manage these risks by limiting exposure relative to the total portfolio. Actionable Insights (Even If You’re Not High-Net-Worth) While BBVA’s specific advice is for a particular client segment, the news offers valuable insights for any investor interested in crypto: Diversification is Key: The principle of using a small allocation in a high-growth, potentially uncorrelated asset class for diversification applies universally. Focus on Established Assets: Starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum is often recommended for new entrants due to their liquidity and track record. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Determine how much volatility you can comfortably handle before investing. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional interest suggests a long-term view of crypto’s potential, rather than short-term speculation. Seek Professional Advice: While not everyone has access to BBVA’s wealth management, consulting with a financial advisor who understands digital assets is prudent. This news underscores that cryptocurrencies are increasingly being viewed through a serious investment lens by traditional financial experts. Summary: BBVA’s Bold Step in Crypto Allocation BBVA’s reported decision to advise high-net-worth clients on allocating 3-7% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum marks a significant moment in the journey of institutional crypto adoption . Since September 2024, this Spanish banking giant has been guiding its wealthiest clients towards strategic exposure to digital assets, acknowledging crypto’s role in modern crypto portfolio diversification . This move is driven by increasing client demand and the growing recognition of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s potential within a balanced investment strategy. While the advice is tailored for those with significant financial resources and a suitable risk profile, it sends a clear signal to the broader market: cryptocurrencies are cementing their place as a legitimate, albeit volatile, asset class worth considering for investment, especially for those seeking exposure to potential high growth and diversification benefits. As BBVA plans to expand its crypto recommendations, this development highlights the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world, paving the way for greater integration and potentially more mainstream access to crypto investments in the future.

In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, the e-CEO of JD CoinChain Technology Liu Peng that the e-commerce platform has registered itself for the government’s stablecoin issuer “sandbox,” becoming one of the three companies in the region to join the initiative. According to Peng, JD.com’s testing phase within the sandbox programme is progressing smoothly. He hinted that the platform may plan to launch stablecoins backed by the Hong Kong dollar and other currencies soon. “As of early June, we have mainly tested the Hong Kong dollar stablecoin, and will test other fiat stablecoins later. Based on market demand, we expect the two stablecoins to be issued at the same time,” said Peng in his interview. He said that the specific schedule for the launch still depends on the newly legalized Stablecoin Ordinance regulation. However, he expects the firm to already obtain a license by the fourth quarter of 2025, and launch a “JD Stablecoin” around the same time. “JD Stablecoin will be issued on the public chain, and anyone can publicly view the issuance volume and other data,” he added.

He added that on-chain fund turnover is also faster compared to regular online transactions. These advantages are believed to attract international trade participants to adopt JD.com’s stablecoin. As for whether the platform will be able to support other types of stablecoins like USD-backed tokens such as Tether ( USDT ) or USD Coin ( USDC ) or even China’s RMB-backed stablecoins, Peng said that it all depends on the supervisory regulations from the issuers.

As reported by Bloomberg on June 17, the pilot will see a fixed amount of JPMD, backed one-for-one by U.S. dollar deposits, transferred from JPMorgan’s wallet to Coinbase. The token will initially be available to institutional clients for transactions, with plans to broaden access and support other currencies pending regulatory approval. The launch marks a significant evolution in JPMorgan’s use of blockchain technology. The bank already operates Kinexys, its in-house platform for digital payments and tokenized assets. Kinexys processes over $2 billion in daily payments and supports tokenized foreign exchange, derivatives, and data validation via its Liink network. The JPMD pilot extends this infrastructure to the public blockchain space for the first time. Unlike stablecoins, deposit tokens are issued by regulated banks and represent a direct claim on deposits. JPMorgan sees them as more secure and scalable for institutional use. You might also like: JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon claims he is not against crypto, but likens Bitcoin to smoking “From an institutional standpoint, deposit tokens are a superior alternative to stablecoins,” said Naveen Mallela, global co-head of Kinexys. He went on to say that deposit tokens might earn interest in the future and be eligible for deposit insurance, two features that are currently unavailable with the majority of stablecoins. The move follows a series of public blockchain milestones for JPMorgan in 2025. In May, the bank completed its first tokenized settlement on a public network, transferring U.S. Treasuries using Chainlink ( LINK ) and Ondo Finance ( ONDO ). In April, Kinexys partnered with Nacha’s Phixius to use blockchain for U.S. account validation in ACH payments. Most recently, JPMorgan began accepting crypto exchange-traded funds shares, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, as collateral for client loans. These changes demonstrate the bank’s increasing dedication to fusing traditional finance with blockchain. While JPMD is intended for wider use, starting with Coinbase and possibly branching out to retail-facing applications, Kinexys will still focus on large corporate flows. The pilot is expected to run for several months. Further developments will depend on regulatory feedback and market demand.

The U.S. Senate has taken a significant stride towards clarity in the digital asset space by passing the GENIUS Act. This isn’t just another piece of potential legislation; it’s a critical move specifically targeting stablecoin regulation , aiming to create a much-needed federal framework for how these increasingly popular digital tokens operate within the American financial system. Understanding the GENIUS Act and US Stablecoin Bill So, what exactly is the GENIUS Act that has just cleared the Senate? At its core, this US stablecoin bill is designed to establish clear rules of the road for stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the U.S. dollar. For years, the lack of specific federal guidelines has created uncertainty for issuers, users, and regulators alike. This bill seeks to bridge that gap. The passage through the Senate marks a major milestone. It signifies a growing recognition among lawmakers of the importance of stablecoins and the necessity of bringing them under a defined regulatory umbrella. The goal is to foster innovation while simultaneously protecting consumers and ensuring financial stability. Why is Federal Stablecoin Regulation Crucial Now? The push for a federal framework isn’t happening in a vacuum. Stablecoins have become a vital part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, facilitating trading, payments, and lending. Their market capitalization has grown substantially, making their stability and oversight a matter of national financial interest. Here’s why establishing this framework is seen as crucial: Investor Protection: Clear rules can help prevent fraud and mismanagement, ensuring that stablecoins are truly backed by the assets they claim to be. Financial Stability: A large, unregulated stablecoin market could potentially pose risks to the broader financial system during times of stress. Innovation and Clarity: A predictable regulatory environment encourages legitimate businesses to build and innovate using stablecoins, rather than operating in a grey area. Global Competitiveness: Establishing a U.S. framework can position the country as a leader in digital asset innovation, rather than falling behind other nations developing their own crypto legislation. The GENIUS Act aims to provide this clarity, potentially defining requirements for reserves, redemption rights, and oversight bodies. The Path Ahead for this Crypto Legislation With the Senate hurdle cleared, the GENIUS Act now moves to the House of Representatives. This is the next critical stage in its journey to becoming law. The House will need to consider and vote on the bill. If passed by the House, it would then head to the President’s desk for signature. The process in the House could involve debates, potential amendments, and committee reviews. While the Senate’s passage is a strong signal, there’s still work to be done to navigate the legislative process in the other chamber. The outcome of the House vote will be closely watched by everyone in the crypto space. Potential Impact of the GENIUS Act If the GENIUS Act successfully becomes law, its impact on the stablecoin market and the broader crypto industry could be significant. It would likely: Legitimize stablecoins within the traditional financial system. Require stablecoin issuers to comply with specific federal standards. Potentially encourage greater institutional adoption due to increased regulatory certainty. Set a precedent for how other forms of digital assets might be regulated in the future. While the specifics of the final bill will determine the exact outcomes, the direction towards a federal framework is clear. Key Aspects of the GENIUS Act’s Senate Passage Let’s quickly summarize the key takeaways from this development: What Happened: The U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act. What it Does: Establishes a federal framework for stablecoin regulation. Focus: Primarily targets dollar-backed stablecoins. Next Steps: Requires a vote in the House of Representatives and potentially the President’s signature. Significance: A major step towards clear crypto legislation in the U.S. Challenges and Criticisms While many see the GENIUS Act as a positive step, not everyone agrees on the details of stablecoin regulation . Some concerns raised about potential regulation include: The risk of over-regulation stifling innovation. Defining exactly what constitutes a ‘stablecoin’ under the law. Ensuring the framework is flexible enough to adapt to technological advancements. The potential for regulatory arbitrage if rules differ significantly from other jurisdictions. These are valid points that will likely be debated as the bill progresses through the House. Actionable Insights for the Reader What does the Senate passage of the GENIUS Act mean for you, whether you’re a crypto investor, user, or just following the space? Firstly, stay informed. This is a developing story, and the details of the bill and its passage through the House will be crucial. Understand which stablecoins you use and how potential federal regulation might affect them. For businesses operating with stablecoins, it’s essential to prepare for potential compliance requirements under a new federal framework . Conclusion: A Defining Moment for US Stablecoin Regulation The Senate’s passage of the GENIUS Act marks a potentially defining moment for US stablecoin bill efforts. It signals a serious commitment by lawmakers to bring regulatory clarity to a vital part of the digital asset market. While the journey through the House and to the President’s desk is not yet complete, this development is a powerful indicator that comprehensive crypto legislation is moving forward in the United States. The creation of a clear federal framework could pave the way for increased adoption, innovation, and stability in the stablecoin space for years to come.

The potential addition of crypto to the balance sheet aims to revive the company’s flagging shares. Eyenovia is joining the trend of buying altcoins as crypto reserves, in a bid to revive a weakening share price. The company chose HYPE for its reserves, setting aside $50M, a relatively small sum for a crypto treasury. The intention was to purchase HYPE and become a large-scale staker, while also rebranding the company. The main idea behind the altcoin treasuries aims to follow the example of Strategy, Metaplanet, Mara Holdings and other BTC treasury companies, whose shares benefitted from the purchases. However, in the case of Eyenovia, skepticism is accelerating on the viability of a treasury strategy. Altcoins remain more unreliable, with limited institutional demand and lower liquidity. Eyenovia itself is inviting warnings, as the company fired 50% of its staff in 2024, following a failed Stage III trial of myopia tech. Eyenovia, which was a digital ophthalmic tech company, will rebrand to Hyperion DeFi, and change its ticker to HYPD. The HYPE treasury will allow the buyer to become one of the top validators for Hyperchain, tapping into the growing trend of perpetual futures DEX trading. Following the announcement, HYPE still traded in its usual range of $40.52, after falling from a local peak of $45.12. HYPE has been one of the trending tokens, though still lagging in terms of mainstream adoption. The involvement of Eyenovia shows the hype for crypto as a booster for regular companies is accelerating. Eyenovia sold shares through PIPE The latest HYPE purchase will happen through inflows from accredited investors, in a private placement of equity (PIPE). The stock purchase agreement will offer convertible non-voting preferred stock, convertible into 154M of common stock. The conversion is subject to limitations set by company investors. The shares will be convertible at a price of $3.25, with the additional option to buy 30.8M common shares at $3.25. If all options are fulfilled, Eyenovia can raise up to $150M, with no guarantees about the sum or the size and value of crypto purchases. Eyenovia (EYEN) bounced from lows near $2, though still down over 86% from peak valuations. | Source: Google Finance In the short term, the price of EYEN climbed to $6.97, rising from lows of $2 in the past month. However, EYEN has erased over 86% of its value for the past 12 months, starting from above $106. Eyenovia is yet another company with no prior ties to crypto that has seen its shares rebound from lows following hints of crypto purchases. Universal Digital was one of the latest companies to announce a similar approach, though again through accumulating BTC. Classover Holdings also drew attention to itself, with a program to purchase SOL for $500M, financed through a recent stock offering. Other similar cases include DeFi Dev Corp with a $100M purchase, and SOL Strategies with a $67M treasury. The effect on stock prices in this case was disparate, with DeFi Dev Corp. rising to a six-month high, while SOL Strategies trading sideways close to its recent lows.

The market remains excited—if that’s the word—as it looks forward to a possible breakout, stirred up by some new data that seems to show the major holders of our favorite cryptocurrency behaving differently and, in a couple of cases, taking profits. After three months of a large-wallet count that could be called dismal, we now have some accumulation trends that look promising. As both short- and long-term players adjust their strategies, Bitcoin arrives at a critical juncture that may well fix its next significant move. Whales and Sharks Return After Months of Decline After a period of steady decline, interest in whale and shark wallets may be coming back. In the last four weeks, the Bitcoin network has added 622 new wallets that hold 10 or more BTC. This is the first significant uptick in the growth of large wallets since early 2024, and it seems to be signaling a renewed interest in peak players accumulating not-too-distant previous highs. Bitcoin has surged as high as $108,947 with traders continuing to await another challenge of last month's $112,000 all-time high. Interestingly, after 3 months straight of declining whale & shark numbers, the $BTC network has 622 more 10+ $BTC wallets in just under 4 weeks. pic.twitter.com/NpKkC5zsj9 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 16, 2025 The 10+ BTC wallets are thought to be held by either experienced market participants or by those with considerable wealth who have held BTC for a long time. If any of these groups is returning to accumulation, it might point to what the next Bitcoin price might be. And if we are using the assumption that the price might be based on the price these groups might value Bitcoin at, then we might also use this assumption in thinking about what price these wallets might push the Bitcoin price to next. The market has accordingly responded. The price of Bitcoin keeps on testing the upper resistance, and if the accumulation continues, it could provide the supply shock necessary to push it past $112,000 and into new territory. BlackRock holds 1 in every 31 Bitcoin to ever exist Launched in January 2024, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has accumulated 666,842 $BTC , accounting for 3.18% of the total supply. Here are some of the largest $BTC holders and how their balances compare to the total… pic.twitter.com/zdJ1lQhnwi — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 16, 2025 Profit-Taking Rotates to Mid-Cycle Buyers In recent days, the behavior of profit-takers has undergone a striking change. For over 12 months, when we looked at who was realizing profits, we mostly saw long-term holders in the mix. However, this week brought a notable shift in that direction. Now, it seems to be dominated by short-term holders realizing profits. On June 16, holders of Bitcoin (BTC) for 6 to 12 months—mid-cycle holders—recorded $904 million in profits. This amount accounted for the second-highest daily realized gains we have seen this year. Unquestionably, the mid-cycle holders dominated the profit-taking we saw that day. In total, all holders with less than 12 months of coin age represented 83% of the day’s realized gains. Long-term holders, in contrast, realized just $324 million in profits on that same day, a steep decline from the $1.2 billion peak seen in late May. This shift indicates that newer market participants, especially those who entered the market in Q4 2024, are now actively distributing their positions. This mid-cycle market behavior has a common redistribution phase. As hands that are early to the market lock in their gains and step aside, more recent entrants tend to increase market influence and contribute to higher short-term volatility that makes the market judgment of value less reliable. These recent entrants, in turn, are trying to lock in their own market gains, which is pushing supply dynamics in the direction of broader shifts. BlackRock Now Controls 1 in Every 31 Bitcoin In the wake of retail profit-taking and changes in on-chain patterns, institutions are still building their Bitcoin stacks. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has added 666,842 BTC since its January 2024 launch—3.18% of all Bitcoin in existence. One in every 31 BTC ever mined is now controlled by BlackRock. This figure has BlackRock at the top of the leaderboard as an institutional and governmental holder, surpassing even MicroStrategy’s much-publicized position of 582,000 BTC. The next competitors are holding: – United States government: 198,012 BTC – Fidelity: 196,264 BTC – China: 190,000 BTC BlackRock’s number is greater than all of these, though. Other significant holders are: Grayscale: 185,234 BTC Block.one (B1): 164,000 BTC Tether: 100,521 BTC United Kingdom: 61,245 BTC BitMEX: 52,020 BTC Institutional ownership is on the rise, reinforcing the notion that Bitcoin is increasingly being considered a macro asset. The supply of Bitcoin being absorbed by traditional financial firms continues apace. Their presence in the market tightens liquidity, making price discovery more sensitive to large inflows or outflows. Looking Ahead Bitcoin’s price momentum, together with whale reaccumulation and a shift in profit-taking among newer holders, signifies that the market is on the cusp of its next major move. The story of the last few months has been about how ETFs are bringing in not just retail, but institutional capital. And how big players like BlackRock are now amassing historic levels of BTC. This landscape is more than primed for further upside; it absolutely requires it as a logical next step. No matter if Bitcoin breaks past the $112,000 barrier or settles into its present range, one thing is beyond dispute: the market formation is shifting, and the forces altering it are larger, more deliberate, and more potent than ever.

And any such phase tends to lead to significant price increases over time. In the last week or so, we’ve seen Ethereum whale wallets, institutional investment vehicles, and even long-term holders returning to the kind of aggressive buying behavior we have not seen in years. Demand for Ethereum has surged to levels only previously seen during the 2017 bull run. And the way in which demand has been returning is quite striking. Soaring spot ETF inflows (the Grayscale one has been way over-hyped), all-time highs in staking, and an increasing balance of long-term holders seem to be leading us into a new phase of on-chain consolidation and investor confidence. Record Inflows Into Spot Ethereum ETFs Ethereum spot ETFs in the US are now quickly becoming a market force. Just last week, net inflows into these funds amounted to 195,320 ETH—the third-largest weekly net inflow on record. Indeed, institutional demand for spot Ethereum is showing up as the kind of serious money that pays real attention to something. And for the moment, what’s capturing that attention is the fact that these ETFs are only recently having been set free to operate after a long regulatory wait. Last week saw 195.32K $ETH flow into US Spot #ETH ETFs – the third-largest weekly net inflow on record. pic.twitter.com/MtTCPqWH8G — glassnode (@glassnode) June 16, 2025 Institutional and retail investors alike now hardly ever miss out on the opportunity to add Ethereum to their investment portfolios—most likely for reasons related to the consensus that Ethereum will continue to serve as a blockchain banking infrastructure for the manifestation of a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). Here are 10 reasons to consider adding Ethereum to your investment portfolio. These inflows also help take liquid ETH out of circulation, adding to the supply constraints that could push prices upward in the near term. ETFs have been all the rage lately, especially among wealth management platforms and retirement account custodians. If this trend continues, it could take ETH out of circulation even faster. Whales Push Accumulation to 7-Year Highs ETFs are drawing institutional investment, while on-chain data show Ethereum’s biggest holders are stacking again—like nothing we’ve seen in years. For that past week, these large wallets consistently added more than 800,000 ETH to their holdings every day, and a most significant spike saw them add over 871,000 ETH in just one day on June 12. That amount alone counts as the biggest single day add we’ve recorded to these whale wallets in 2025, and on a scale of such adds, the biggest since 2017. Wallets containing between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have now collectively exceeded 14.3 million ETH. This increasing concentration among whale wallets could be a sign of long-term positioning. Whales, as a rule, are better informed than most and are also less likely to panic sell. So it could be reasoned that the accumulation of Ethereum in whale wallets is something bullish. For nearly a week, daily whale accumulation has exceeded 800K #ETH , pushing holdings in 1k–10k wallets to >14.3M #ETH . On June 12 alone, #Ethereum whales have added over 871K $ETH – the highest daily net inflow YTD. This scale of buying hasn't been seen since 2017. pic.twitter.com/zCMj9HX6Ft — glassnode (@glassnode) June 17, 2025 This degree of steady accumulation usually mirrors anticipated future rises in price or faith in Ethereum’s ever-growing part within the blockchain setup, especially as it steadily advances as the leading smart contract platform and Layer 1 settlement layer. Ethereum Staking and Long-Term Holder Metrics Hit New Highs Besides activity from ETFs and whales, Ethereum is also notching up fresh all-time highs in core metrics that point to a solid foundation for ongoing growth. Ethereum staking has now hit an all-time high, with more than 35 million ETH locked in the network’s proof-of-stake mechanism. Staking is a much less risky, much more suitable way for individuals and institutions to earn crypto yield than, say, lending their crypto to a centralized exchange and risking margin calls or total collapse. REPORT: #Ethereum surpasses 35 million #ETH staked, a new high. pic.twitter.com/aI710ConFr — CoinEcho (@mycoinecho) June 17, 2025 Also significant is the increase in accumulation addresses—wallets that have never sold. Those addresses now hold a total of 22.8 million ETH, also an all-time high. This group of holders seems to include some of the strongest hands in the market, often associated with long-term conviction and low propensity to react to volatility. An increasing proportion of ETH is now effectively unavailable to the market, whether it’s been staked, is tied up in ETFs, or is simply being held in long-term addresses that show no signs of making the Ethereum they control available. That leaves the supply of liquid Ethereum shrinking precipitously, at the same time that the demand for it appears to be coming from multiple, generally well-heeled classes of investors. Ethereum is developing into a core component of the decentralized finance ecosystem. These metrics may be hinting at another major cycle, but this time with much deeper backing from institutions, much more security through staking, and a base of committed holders that is more robust than ever.

According to crypto researcher Danny Marques, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is entering the final and strongest part of its long-term cycle. If he’s right, the next 12–18 months could take Bitcoin’s price as high as $370,000. So, what’s the reason behind this bold prediction? 7-Year Pattern That’s Still Holding Strong Marques has been tracking Bitcoin’s movement since 2017 and points out something fascinating: Bitcoin has been moving within a perfect rising channel for the past seven years. Each major low, whether it was the 2018 crash, the COVID dip, or the 2022 bear market, touched the lower edge of this channel. Bitcoin $BTC has been advancing through one large supercycle since 2017 and is now breaking into its final leg upward Upside targets: $197K–$370K over next 12–18 months Let me prove it to you Since 2018, price forms a coherent and symmetric structure inside a long-term… pic.twitter.com/cMOfQAWnfl — Danny Marques | Investing Informant (@Invst_Informant) June 17, 2025 And when Bitcoin peaked, like in 2017 at $20K and 2021 at $69K, it hit the upper line of the same channel. This clean pattern has stayed strong for 7 years and has guided Bitcoin through all kinds of market events. The Start of the Final Leg? Meanwhile, in 2024, when Bitcoin broke above its old all-time high of $69K, we saw a clean breakout pattern. According to Marques, every time BTC broke above a major high in the past, a massive rally followed: In 2017, a breakout above $1,200 led to $20K price In 2020, a breakout above $20K led to $69K Now in 2024, a breakout above $69K is already in progress If we see a similar move to the 2020 cycle (a 418% jump), Bitcoin could reach around $288K this time. The chart attached by Marques backs up his view. The “cup” started forming in 2021 and rounded out through the 2022 bear market. The “handle” formed in early 2024 as Bitcoin briefly paused. This pattern points to a price target near $370K, which matches other predictions. Technical Indicator More Bullish Moreover, technical indicators like the monthly RSI show that Bitcoin still has lots of room to run. In past tops, RSI neared 90–98. Now, it’s only around 69 . That means we may still be early in this cycle. Also, a key tool called the TABI indicator shows we are still early in this expansion phase. All signs point toward one thing, Bitcoin may be on its way to a huge price discovery phase, with targets ranging from $197K to $370K.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 07:48:19

While the rate is widely expected to stay the same, what Fed Chair Jerome Powell signals next could shake things up. Right now, Bitcoin’s stuck in a tight range, with short sellers crowding in and big holders quietly buying. With ETF flows looking weak and funding rates negative, most traders are playing it safe. But if Powell hints at cuts, it could trigger a sharp move higher, possibly pushing Bitcoin above $112K. A hawkish tone, on the other hand, might send it sliding back toward $100K.

The official decision is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. EDT, followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. However, this part is largely priced in. The real action lies in the Fed’s dot plot, a chart that shows where each policymaker sees interest rates heading in the coming months and years. If the dot plot signals fewer rate cuts than expected, it could reinforce the “higher for longer” narrative, strengthening the dollar and putting downward pressure on Bitcoin and other risk assets.

XBTO, a crypto trading firm, says traders are bracing for volatility if the dot plot reflects less dovish expectations. According to analyst Matteo Greco from Fineqia, 2025 rate cut expectations have already been slashed from 100 basis points to just 50, and could dip even further to 25 basis points if global tensions continue.

Higher rates increase U.S. debt servicing costs, worsening the fiscal outlook. That dynamic could enhance Bitcoin’s role as a hedge alongside gold, especially as inflation and global uncertainty remain in focus. For now, patience is the name of the game. Until the dot plot and Powell’s comments are revealed, crypto markets are likely to remain cautious, watching for any shift that could either freeze or fire up Bitcoin’s next move.

Asset management giant VanEck has taken a notable step regarding a potential Solana ETF . According to reports, VanEck has registered a proposed spot Solana ETF with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker symbol “VSOL.” This development, while procedural, signals growing institutional interest in offering investment products tied directly to the price of Solana (SOL). What Does DTCC Registration Mean for a Spot Solana ETF? It is crucial to understand the significance, or lack thereof, of a DTCC registration in the context of launching a new financial product like a Spot Solana ETF . The DTCC is a critical piece of market infrastructure, providing clearing and settlement services for securities transactions. Registering a ticker symbol with the DTCC is a necessary administrative step in the process of potentially listing an ETF. It involves setting up the infrastructure for clearing and settling trades should the ETF eventually launch. However, this registration is entirely separate from the regulatory approval process required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. Registering with the DTCC does not mean the ETF is approved for trading, nor does it guarantee that the SEC will eventually approve it for listing on an exchange. Think of it as getting the plumbing ready before the building permits are approved. Why is VanEck Pursuing a SOL ETF? VanEck is a prominent player in the asset management space with a history of being at the forefront of digital asset investment products. They were among the first to file for a Bitcoin ETF and have launched other crypto-related funds. Their move to register a VanEck Solana ETF suggests a belief in Solana’s potential as an investable asset class. Several factors likely contribute to this interest: Solana’s Market Position: Solana (SOL) has emerged as one of the largest and most widely adopted cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and ecosystem activity, particularly in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Investor Demand: There is growing investor demand for regulated and easily accessible ways to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. A SOL ETF could cater to this demand. Diversification: For investors building a diversified digital asset portfolio, Solana represents a distinct blockchain architecture and ecosystem compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum, offering diversification potential. Following the Trend: The successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has opened the door and set a precedent for other single-asset crypto ETFs. Asset managers are now exploring the next potential candidates. Comparing the VanEck Solana ETF Effort to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs The path for a VanEck Solana ETF faces similar, and perhaps unique, hurdles compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The SEC has historically been hesitant to approve spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 marked a significant shift, largely attributed to the market’s maturity and surveillance sharing agreements. Ethereum’s path to a spot ETF is currently being navigated, with the SEC approving 19b-4 filings for several Ethereum ETFs in May 2024, though S-1 registration statements still require approval before trading can begin. Solana, while large, is still considered by some regulators to be potentially more centralized or less seasoned than Bitcoin or Ethereum. A key factor for SEC approval is often whether the underlying asset’s market is deemed sufficiently resistant to manipulation and if there is a regulated market of significant size for the asset. For a Spot Solana ETF , the SEC will scrutinize the spot market for SOL and its correlation with regulated futures markets (if any exist or become significant). What are the Potential Benefits of a Spot SOL ETF? If a SOL ETF were to gain SEC approval and launch, it could offer several advantages for investors: Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making it easy for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Solana through standard brokerage accounts, without needing to set up crypto wallets or navigate complex exchanges. Regulation and Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering investors protections that may not be present when buying SOL directly on unregulated crypto platforms. Liquidity: ETFs typically offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. Familiarity: Many traditional investors are comfortable with the ETF structure, making it a more familiar and less intimidating way to invest in a novel asset like Solana. Challenges and the Road Ahead for a Crypto ETF Like Solana’s Despite the DTCC registration, the path to launching a Crypto ETF for Solana is fraught with challenges. The primary hurdle remains obtaining approval from the SEC. The SEC has not yet classified SOL definitively, and its regulatory stance on altcoins other than Bitcoin and Ethereum is less clear. Concerns about Solana’s network stability, past outages, and its token distribution could also be points of regulatory scrutiny. The timeline for potential SEC approval for a Spot Solana ETF is highly uncertain. It could take months or even years, depending on the SEC’s evolving stance on digital assets and specific concerns related to Solana. The process involves detailed filings, public comment periods, and extensive dialogue between the asset manager and the regulator. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching the development of a potential VanEck Solana ETF : Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from VanEck and the SEC regarding the filing status. Understand the Process: Recognize that DTCC registration is just one early administrative step and not an indicator of impending SEC approval. Assess Solana Itself: Any investment in a Solana ETF is fundamentally an investment in Solana. Understand the technology, ecosystem, risks, and market dynamics of SOL itself. Consider Alternatives (for now): Until a spot ETF is approved, investors can gain exposure to SOL through direct purchase on exchanges or potentially through regulated trusts or futures-based products if available, understanding the differences and risks involved with each method. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto Investment VanEck’s DTCC registration for a proposed Solana ETF is a significant administrative step that highlights the growing institutional interest in bringing regulated investment products for major cryptocurrencies to market. While it does not guarantee SEC approval, it signals that asset managers are actively preparing for a future where a Spot Solana ETF could become a reality. The journey for a SOL ETF will likely be challenging, requiring navigation of regulatory hurdles and demonstrating market maturity to the satisfaction of the SEC. Nevertheless, this move by VanEck is a positive indicator for the broader acceptance and accessibility of Solana as an asset class, potentially paving the way for more diverse Crypto ETF offerings in the future.

This week, a number of them, as well as some entire projects, found themselves on the receiving end of the social media suspension tool. The most pronounced effect so far has been on PumpFun , a popular memecoin platform that had already started adjusting its business model in anticipation of needing to comply with a clearer, emerging regulatory framework. A legal complaint about a user who lost only $231 on the memecoin $Peanut started this whole thing. But now? It’s turned into something that could seriously shake up the crypto industry. Why? Because it’s uncovering some very shady practices. And authorities are starting to look at those practices quite a bit more closely. PumpFun, along with Solana KOLs, devs, founders, and bots, were suddenly BLOCKED on all socials! > What Happened & What Does This Mean for Memecoins? and most importantly: >> HOW WE CAN PROFIT FROM THIS? lets break this down Turns out there was an old lawsuit from… pic.twitter.com/nK6OdEGCgG — RDeni (@rostikdeni) June 17, 2025 The Ripple Effect of a $231 Loss The dispute stems from an early memecoin, $Peanut, in which a disgruntled investor lost money and decided to sue. Even when this case started making headlines, most everyone who isn’t an investigator thought it might be too inconsequential to matter. We were proven wrong on that front when the case in question turned up a whole lot of dirt not just on $Peanut and its creators but also—for reasons that are unclear, to us at least—on a bunch of Solana projects that were supposedly doing fine and are now under a very bright spotlight. Concerns over not just price manipulation but also the behavior of these projects has regulators looking their way. That’s because they’re not just apps that let people trade crypto. They’re also promoting what you might call gambling-ish behavior—and doing so with virtually no oversight. Some projects didn’t even seem to be trying to adhere to basic rules or that KYC stuff I mentioned earlier. They pretty clearly ignored altogether the part where you’re supposed to do some due diligence before letting people get involved in something that’s going to be as volatile as a crypto market. And when it comes to the tokens involved, pretty much anything went. Another facet of the problem is the financial opacity that surrounds these memecoins. Even though they allow for trading that reaches into the millions of dollars, many of the people and organizations involved seem to have little to no actual tax obligations. If enforcement actions are taken, some are predicting that the fines might total $500 million or more. Sweeping Suspensions Rock the Solana Community In the face of intensifying regulatory pressure, platforms have started to act with increased speed—and sometimes in a precautionary manner. X (formerly known as Twitter) has taken the extraordinary step of either banning or suspending a variety of differing accounts associated with cryptocurrency. In many instances, these accounts are linked to the recent surge in the value of cryptocurrencies like those associated with the Solana memecoin boom. Accounts that have gone dark include notable ones from the GMGN team: @gmgnai, @haze0x, @arthur_gmgn, @ivyflame, and @gmgnaiJapanese. The Bloom team has also seen its social presence vanish, including handles like @BloomTrading, @imBFFF00, @nftraian, and @CookerFlips. Independent accounts from the likes of @shawmakesmagic, @ElizaOS, and @bullx_io have also been caught up in the wave. Numerous connections exist between these accounts and sniper bots, Telegram-based memecoin launch infrastructure, and Twitter API tools that allow for real-time tracking of both wallets and sentiment. Increasingly, these associations have led to speculation that using Twitter’s API for anything other than what one would consider to be normal operational use—monitoring behavior of Twitter users, for example—may have gotten these accounts flagged and then banned. Memecoins Face a Regulatory Crossroads The fallout from all this is immediate and directly affects the memecoin market. But what we really don’t know is what this means for the memecoin sector as a whole. If regulators come down on memecoins and say they are securities, then what happens to the memecoins we trade on centralized exchanges? Do they get delisted? Do we lose access to them altogether? The memecoin market is already on shakier footing than other crypto subsectors. A mass delisting of key memecoins from exchanges could trigger not just a market crash for these tokens but something more serious that drags down the whole crypto market. Certain traders are taking countermeasures against this prospective situation. They’ve started to open up short positions in many tokens that are based on Solana. Their logic is this: The market has not yet fully accounted for the possibility of forced liquidation or of some teams being compelled to shut down their platforms. And what about all the tokens that are in limbo because they’re under compliance review? The traders I spoke with think those tokens—I won’t name any specific ones here—are also being inadequately discounted. Pumpfun( @pumpdotfun ), recently suspended by X, has sold a total of ~4.1M $SOL ($741M) at an average price of ~$180 since May 19, 2024. 264,373 $SOL was sold for 41.64M $USDC at $158. 3.84M $SOL ($699M) was deposited to #Kraken at $182. pic.twitter.com/LB80CZgnUB — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 17, 2025 Meanwhile, behind the scenes, PumpFun—the epicenter of much of the controversy—has been moving large volumes of capital. Since May 19, 2024, the platform has sold roughly 4.1 million SOL, equating to $741 million, at an average price of $180. A portion of that—264,373 SOL—was converted into 41.64 million USDC at a much lower price of $158. More significantly, 3.84 million SOL, worth approximately $699 million, was deposited directly to Kraken, suggesting an attempt to secure liquidity or hedge against possible enforcement action. PumpFun is trying to raise a reported $1 billion in funding. Meanwhile, the regulatory dragnet and platform bans may be halting that momentum altogether. What began as an underground meme experiment on Solana is now a regulatory flashpoint—and potentially a turning point for the future of memecoins.

He is concerned that it may be connected to the $30 million Zkasino exit scam and has written an on-chain analysis to elaborate on his reasons for thinking so. In that analysis, he shares what he sees as troubling connections between WhiteRock and some people who are either part of or were previously associated with this apparent scam. The Zkasino Collapse: A Brief Recap Launched in 2023, Zkasino was highly anticipated as a blockchain gambling platform. Its presale raised upwards of $30 million from the crypto community, with promises of an ambitious and revolutionary gambling platform built on blockchain technology. However, by early 2024, it became clear that things were not progressing as promised. Instead of using the funds to develop Zkasino, it seems the team behind the platform might have been cashing out and working on something else. At least, that’s what the evidence to date suggests. This resulted in a criminal investigation in the Netherlands. In April 2024, Dutch authorities (FIOD) apprehended Elham Nourzai—crypto circles know him as @Derivatives_Ape—and took control of assets connected to Zkasino. Other core team members, including Ildar Ilham (@XBT_Prometheus) and Lior Ben Zakan (@Sigman0x), were said to live in the Middle East, out of reach of European regulators. In late 2024, Nourzai was released from prison, and investigators began scrutinizing a suspicious laundering pattern that involved the embezzled Zkasino funds. Initial blockchain analysis had already indicated that the stolen funds were being chain-hopped—transferred across various blockchains, including not just ZkSync and Starknet but also several EVM-compatible networks and Solana. The laundering trails themselves seemed to indicate three primary target strategies. First on that list was a method involving cashing out via over-the-counter brokers. Those particular blockchain diving sessions had also revealed some not-so-hard-to-see asset conversions, with the launders shifting from the more-traceable path they were already on to Monero (XMR), a cryptocurrency built specifically for privacy. WhiteRock Emerges with Troubling Parallels WhiteRock (WHITE) softly opened in late 2024. Despite an unassuming start, the blockchain project soon drew the attention of analysts—and not in a good way. ZachXBT, a prominent blockchain analyst, illuminated in a recent thread the many things that seemed questionable about WhiteRock right from the get-go. Here are several immediate red flags he identified. An unidentifiable group of individuals with no credible past of development or business, claims of imaginary partnerships, many hidden side wallets fed by instant exchanges, user figures and platform activity that are much too good to be true, and a total absence of transparency about their USDX token reserves. More damning evidence was revealed by further scrutiny. A known influencer was identified by ZachXBT as being paid from a WhiteRock marketing wallet. The payment originated from a wallet address (0xfd978bcb706133403cf2fe0e07d872342c81266b) that was later shown to have direct on-chain ties to wallets handling Zkasino’s embezzled funds. 1/ Community Alert: At least one team member from the $30M Zkasino exit scam appears to be involved with the project @WhiteRock_Fi $WHITE due to onchain transactions linking both projects and a personal email address. pic.twitter.com/rZSvLM98fR — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 16, 2025 The analysis indicated that the assets of the two projects were mixing together—although the exact nature of the relationship involved still wasn’t clear. Between February and March 2025, funds from Zkasino were traced to instant exchanges, where they were rapidly converted to other cryptocurrencies, and then to wallets controlled by WhiteRock, which received equivalent sums just after—again via instant exchange. Digital Footprints Lead to Familiar Faces In yet another revelation, ZachXBT discovered that a personal email address tied to dealings with the WhiteRock deployer was goedel014@gmail.com. Public data was then cross-referenced, and it turned out that the email was linked to a Chess.com account belonging to someone named “IldarTheGrandMaster.” This pointed to Ildar Ilham, a known member of the Zkasino team who had previously operated under the alias @XBT_Prometheus. It looks like Ilham might be using the pseudonym “Goedel” within WhiteRock, which further solidifies our suspicions that the same people responsible for Zkasino and other nefarious ventures like Syncus and Zigzag are trying to restart operations under a new brand. ZachXBT has asked centralized exchanges such as MEXC and Gate.io to rethink their plans to list WHITE and to conduct due diligence of a much stricter sort than what seems to be the current norm. He made the point that the risk of investors getting caught up in another rug pull is alarmingly high. That risk, he suggested, is amplified by how closely connected the WHITE project is with past scams. Currently, the larger crypto community is closely observing events. The legal process linked to Zkasino remains in flux, but many expect that its principals— Ildar Ilham, Elham Nourzai, and Lior Ben Zakan—will at some point be brought to account for the swindle they’ve carried out, which has harmed thousands of investors for whom they’ve conduced a kind of financial therapy. Meanwhile, the essential behind-the-scenes work that ZachXBT has done stands as a strong warning. Just because some new faces in crypto have appeared doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re new players to the game. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The number was identical to the revised estimate for April, which had originally been reported as 3.5% before the ONS admitted there was a miscalculation due to vehicle tax data. The mistake in April’s figure came from incorrect data tied to car taxation. The ONS later said the true figure for April should have been 3.4% as well. But even after identifying the error, the ONS decided not to revise the published number because their policy avoids editing past inflation releases. For May’s inflation print, they used the corrected vehicle tax data. So the official May consumer price index reflects that fix. ONS flags transport as main factor behind monthly change Core inflation, which leaves out food, alcohol, tobacco, and energy, fell from 3.8% in April to 3.5% in May. The ONS said transport costs made the biggest downward impact on the overall inflation rate. But it wasn’t a clean drop—food, furniture, and household goods kept inflation under pressure. Richard Heys, acting chief economist at the ONS, explained it like this: “A variety of counteracting price movements meant inflation was little changed in May.” Richard also said airfare prices fell compared to the same time last year, mainly because Easter and school holidays landed in different weeks. He added that motor fuel costs also dropped in May, pushing down overall prices in the transport sector. The British pound ticked up 0.22% against the US dollar, reaching $1.345 after the inflation figures came out. Investors appeared unmoved, seeing no real surprise in the numbers. Speaking after the data release, UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves responded by saying, “The Treasury has taken the necessary choices to stabilise the public finances and get inflation under control.” But Rachel also admitted, “there’s more to do.” Bank of England holds back, looks ahead to August rate decision The inflation data landed right before the Bank of England’s next monetary policy meeting scheduled for Thursday. With inflation still running well above the 2% target, the central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 4.25%. Analysts believe the bank will delay its next rate cut until August, assuming no further surprises come from energy markets or economic data. Back in early 2025, the Bank had forecast inflation to climb to 3.7% in Q3 before finally cooling next year. But things have changed since then. Fresh conflict between Israel and Iran has brought oil prices back into the inflation debate. The risk now is that those prices keep rising and push UK inflation higher than originally expected. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation could average 3.4% this year, but he expects it to rise slightly and peak at 3.6% in September. Rob said the current print doesn’t include the full effect of the latest spike in oil prices, which came after tensions escalated in the Middle East. “We are yet to fully factor in higher oil prices following events in the Middle East — we use a 15-day average of prices to smooth volatility — but would need to raise the inflation peak to 3.7% if oil and natural gas prices are sustained at their current levels. We would bump up the peak to 3.8% if oil prices reach $80 a barrel and natural gas prices match those rises proportionately,” Rob said. Crude oil futures jumped over 4% on Tuesday after President Donald Trump told Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to agree to what he called an “unconditional surrender.” That headline alone pushed global oil markets into a frenzy and added more weight to the inflation outlook for the next quarter.

Introduced roughly six weeks ago by Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill seeks to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoin market in the country. This move marks a significant step toward integrating blockchain-based digital assets into mainstream financial systems. “The United States is one step closer to becoming the global leader in crypto,” said Hagerty during his remarks on the Senate floor. He emphasized that the GENIUS Act would allow Americans and businesses to process payments in near real-time, eliminating current settlement delays that can take days or weeks. However, the bill’s journey has not been without controversy. The GENIUS Act initially failed a cloture vote in May, largely due to Democratic concerns over former President Donald Trump’s involvement in the crypto space. The Trump family holds substantial interest in World Liberty Financial, which launched its own USD1 stablecoin earlier this year. House Faces Tight Margin and Political Tensions With the Senate hurdle crossed, the bill’s fate now lies in the hands of the House of Representatives, where it could face fresh amendments and further political challenges. The House’s Republican majority is slim, and opposition from Democrats remains strong, especially concerning Trump’s perceived influence over digital asset policy. David Sacks, Trump’s appointed AI and crypto czar, previously hinted that the president would back any stablecoin legislation approved by a Republican-led Congress. Meanwhile, speculation has emerged that major tech giants like Apple, Google, Airbnb, and even social media platform X are exploring stablecoin issuance if the GENIUS Act becomes law. Lawmakers have also raised concerns about Meta potentially reviving its own token plans . Broader Implications and Growing Stablecoin Market Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projected the stablecoin market could boast a $3.7 trillion market cap by 2030, stating that the GENIUS Act is a critical step toward realizing that growth. But the legislative push has drawn criticism as well. Bartlett Naylor of Public Citizen called the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts a “massive scam with the American flag,” accusing lawmakers of ignoring Trump’s alleged misuse of crypto for personal gain . As the House prepares to debate the companion STABLE Act and the CLARITY Act for broader digital asset regulation, the spotlight remains fixed on whether bipartisan agreement can be achieved—or whether political tensions will stall progress yet again.

This movement occurred just ahead of a key decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve regarding interest rates, highlighting how traditional financial events can sometimes influence the digital asset space. But could this correction actually be setting the stage for something bigger? Many analysts are suggesting this recent price action might be a crucial setup for a significant Bitcoin rally . Decoding the Latest BTC Price Analysis Looking closely at the charts, BTC price analysis reveals that the dip found potential support right in the zone between $102,000 and $104,000. This area is significant for a couple of reasons: Historical Resistance Turned Support: This price range previously acted as a strong resistance level. When a resistance level is broken decisively, it often turns into a support level on subsequent pullbacks. The market seems to be testing this theory now. Compressing Bollinger Bands: Technical indicators like the Bollinger Bands are showing compression. This often signals a period of low volatility that precedes a significant price move. The tighter the bands, the more explosive the potential breakout can be. These technical signals, combined with the price holding within this key zone, suggest that a short-term bottom could be forming. This is a critical observation for anyone following Crypto market analysis . What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Price Prediction? Based on these technical observations and historical market behavior, analysts are painting an optimistic picture for the near future. The prevailing Bitcoin price prediction suggests that if the $102,000-$104,000 zone holds as support, Bitcoin could be poised for a substantial upward move. Past market cycles have shown instances where similar technical setups led to rallies in the range of 18% to 25%. Applying this historical pattern to the current levels, a rally of this magnitude from the $103,000 area could potentially push Bitcoin towards the $120,000 to $129,000 range. Is a $130,000 BTC Price Target Realistic by End of Q2? According to reports, including one by Cointelegraph, analysts are specifically eyeing a potential target of around $130,000. This target aligns with the upper end of the 18-25% rally projection and is being discussed as a possibility by the end of the second quarter (Q2). This timeframe suggests a potential move over the next six to eight weeks, potentially leading to new all-time highs. However, achieving this ambitious target hinges on one crucial condition: Bitcoin must maintain its position above a key support level. The level to watch closely is $98,300. A sustained break below this price point could invalidate the bullish outlook and suggest further downside is possible. Understanding Bitcoin Technical Analysis For those new to trading or investing, Bitcoin technical analysis involves studying charts and using statistical indicators to predict future price movements. The reference to Bollinger Bands is a prime example. These bands measure market volatility and can help identify potential price squeezes (like the current one) that often lead to significant breakouts. Understanding these technical tools is vital for interpreting the market’s signals. While no indicator is foolproof, using them in conjunction with historical data provides valuable insights into potential price trajectories and key levels to monitor. Key Takeaways for Investors Here are some actionable insights derived from the current market outlook: Monitor Key Support: The $102,000-$104,000 zone is the immediate area to watch for confirmation of a short-term bottom. The more critical level for the overall bullish thesis is $98,300. Potential Upside: A successful hold of support could pave the way for an 18-25% rally, potentially targeting $130,000. Timeframe: This potential rally is anticipated to unfold over the next 6-8 weeks, aiming for the end of Q2. Volatility Ahead: The compressing Bollinger Bands suggest increased volatility is likely coming soon, which could fuel the predicted rally or lead to a breakdown if support fails. Concluding Thoughts: Is the Stage Set for a Massive Bitcoin Rally? While the recent dip below $104,000 might have caused some concern, technical indicators and historical patterns are suggesting this correction could be a necessary step before a significant move higher. Analysts are pointing towards a potential 18-25% Bitcoin rally , which could see BTC challenging or surpassing previous all-time highs and potentially reaching $130,000 by the end of Q2. As always, the market remains dynamic, and maintaining position above key support levels, particularly $98,300, is paramount for this bullish scenario to play out. Investors should stay informed and watch these levels closely. To learn more about the latest Crypto market analysis trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Has Crossed Above 2.2 In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Darkfrost has talked about the latest trend in the NVT Golden Cross of Bitcoin. The NVT Golden Cross is an indicator based on another metric known as the NVT Ratio. The NVT Ratio keeps track of the ratio between the BTC market cap and transaction volume. The idea behind the indicator is that the ability to transact coins (as gauged by the transaction volume) could be considered as a reflection of the asset’s ‘fair value.’ Related Reading: XRP Bullish Signal: Shark & Whale Wallets Set New All-Time High Thus, through the comparison of the cryptocurrency’s current value (that is, the market cap) with this fair value, the metric can tell us about whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued. When the value of the metric is high, it means the market cap is high compared to the transaction volume. Such a trend could imply BTC may be becoming overheated. On the other hand, the indicator being low could suggest room for the coin to grow relative to its volume. Now, the NVT Golden Cross, the actual metric of relevance here, is a signaling indicator like the Bollinger bands for the NVT Ratio that aims to locate tops and bottoms in its value. The NVT Golden Cross does so by comparing the short-term trend (represented by the 10-day MA) with the long-term one (30-day MA). Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the metric over the last couple of years. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has recently registered a sharp uptick and entered into the region above the 2.2 mark (highlighted in red). This zone is where the cryptocurrency’s market cap has historically outpaced the transaction volume to a degree that a reversion to the mean has tended to occur. In other words, it’s where price corrections to the downside have taken place for the asset. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Plummet $61 Billion—Warning Sign For Bitcoin? Though, it’s visible from the chart that not every top in the NVT Golden Cross inside this territory coincides with a price top. And in many instances that it does, the decline in the asset isn’t to some major degree. So far since the signal has appeared, however, the asset has indeed been going down, a potential sign that the same reversion effect may be in play once more. It now remains to be seen whether downside will be limited, or if this will be one of those instances where the signal was followed by an extended drawdown. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,700, down almost 5% in the last seven days.

The decision was enacted following a unanimous vote during the Spokane City Council’s legislative session on June 17, making it the first city in Washington to formally ban virtual currency kiosks in response to a rise in scams targeting residents. The ordinance, titled “Virtual Currency Kiosk Prohibition for a Safer Spokane,” was introduced by Council Member Paul Dillon in collaboration with Council President Betsy Wilkerson. Officials said the measure was introduced to curb fraudulent losses tied to crypto kiosks, which have been frequently used in scams targeting vulnerable residents in low-income areas and retail locations. “This ordinance will protect vulnerable Spokane residents from scams involving virtual currency kiosks, and I am proud we are the first city in the state to move this legislation forward,” Council Member Dillion said. Under the new rules, operators have 60 days to remove existing kiosks or face civil infractions, including potential revocation of their business licenses. The Spokane Police Department will monitor compliance and report on the impact of the ban on scam-related crime rates. As of June 18, Spokane had over 40 cryptocurrency kiosks, according to data from crypto ATM tracker Coin ATM Radar. You might also like: Crypto ATM operators in Australia hit with cash limits and tougher compliance checks Detective Tim Schwering of the Spokane Police Department, who has worked closely with victims of such frauds and supports the measure, said funds sent through these kiosks typically “end up in places like China, North Korea, Russia.” Scammers were often found impersonating law enforcement or tax officials to pressure victims into converting cash into cryptocurrency, claiming it would help “protect their money” or prevent arrest. By the time the transaction is complete, “it’s already too late,” Schwering added. Spokane’s ban on crypto ATMs follows a broader trend across the U.S., where concerns over fraud and consumer exploitation have prompted both local and state governments to tighten oversight of virtual currency kiosks. According to an FBI report , nearly 11,000 complaints related to crypto ATM scams were filed in the United States in 2024, with reported losses exceeding $246 million. Most of the victims were found to be over the age of 60. In response, several states have introduced their own measures. For instance, North Dakota lawmakers are reviewing House Bill 1447, which would impose a $2,000 daily transaction cap, require fraud warnings at machines, and mandate that operators use blockchain analytics to detect suspicious activity. The bill also includes licensing and quarterly reporting requirements. Meanwhile, in March, Nebraska enacted the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act, which requires crypto ATM operators to be licensed, caps fees at 18%, and enforces daily transaction limits of $2,000 for new users. It also mandates full refunds for new customers who have been defrauded if a report is filed within 90 days following the incident.

Key Takeaways: Crypto analyst Johnny believes a Ripple IPO could spark a major rally for XRP. XRP has traded within a symmetrical triangle since January, with analysts expecting a breakout. Despite IPO speculation, Ripple leadership says public listing isn’t planned for 2025. In a recent post on X , Johnny, who is also founder of the Wealth Group trading community, said he “would not be surprised” if Ripple hits the public markets with a “crazy high” valuation. In a follow-up post, he doubled down, predicting an “insane valuation” that would make XRP holders “win big.” XRP Charts Form Symmetrical Triangle Since January Drop Johnny pointed out that XRP has been trading within a symmetrical triangle since its January 2025 drop from $3.4. For the past five months, the token has hovered around $2, failing to break out. One notable attempt occurred in March when XRP briefly surged to $3 after Donald Trump proposed adding it to a U.S. government crypto reserve—before slipping back into its previous range. Now, with XRP nearing the tip of the triangle, Johnny and other market watchers suggest a breakout could be imminent. His chart points to an initial move above the $3 mark if the pattern resolves to the upside. “Ripple going public could be the catalyst,” Johnny noted, echoing comparisons to Circle’s IPO, which saw the USDC issuer’s valuation jump from $7 billion to over $25 billion. Balls tingling that $XRP goes public at an insane valuation and Ripple maxis win big https://t.co/vD1Ey1DGqq pic.twitter.com/GmjpvpDria — Johnny (@CryptoGodJohn) June 16, 2025 Analysts argue Ripple could follow a similar trajectory, especially with regulatory challenges largely behind it. Dennis Liu, another market analyst, called a potential IPO a watershed moment: “It could open the floodgates to serious gains for XRP.” In 2023, attorney John Deaton suggested Ripple might target a $100 billion valuation within a year of resolving its legal dispute with the SEC. Despite the speculation, Ripple executives have repeatedly stated that an IPO is not on the table this year. In April, Ripple President Monica Long told CNBC the firm “doesn’t need outside capital” and is instead focused on strategic acquisitions. Ripple recently purchased prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion, following its $250 million acquisition of custody provider Metaco in 2023. CEO Brad Garlinghouse reinforced that message, stating an IPO “does not make sense just yet,” though he described it as a “natural future step.” Ripple Preparing for an IPO? Still, signs of IPO readiness remain. Ripple launched a $700 million share buyback this month at $175 per share, implying a valuation near $25 billion—more than double its $11.3 billion valuation in early 2024. The company is also actively hiring for corporate development and shareholder relations roles. On June 11, VivoPower, a publicly listed firm, announced a partnership with the Flare blockchain to generate yield from its XRP holdings. The move could indicate that institutional players are looking for ways to leverage their crypto assets without liquidating them.

Thailand’s Ministry of Finance has approved a new tax measure aimed at promoting the country as a global digital asset hub. Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat announced on Jun. 17 that the measure will exempt personal income tax on capital gains from the sale of digital assets made through licensed digital asset businesses — including exchanges, brokers, and dealers — under the 2018 Royal Decree on Digital Asset Businesses. This exemption will apply from Jan. 1, 2025 to Dec. 31, 2029. Julapun stated that this tax reform is expected to boost the domestic digital asset market and related sectors, contributing to economic growth and generating at least 1 billion baht in medium-term tax revenue. He added that the measure promotes transparent and traceable digital asset trading through entities overseen by the Anti-Money Laundering Office, following international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force. Additionally, Thailand’s Revenue Department is working on adopting the OECD’s system for automatically sharing digital asset information with other countries, which will make transactions even more transparent.

This move aligns with the country’s broader effort to promote crypto trading within a regulated framework overseen by the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission. On the other hand, crypto exchange KuCoin has taken a compliant route, launching a fully regulated local subsidiary in Thailand after securing an SEC license last Friday, joining a competitive field that includes eight other licensed exchanges. Thailand’s crypto sector is among the most active in Southeast Asia, fueled by progressive regulation— now bolstered by the 5-year capital gains tax exemption — and growing adoption, most notably a recent pilot program allowing tourists to make payments with crypto.

A recent revelation from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sheds light on the aggressive tactics being employed by tech giants like Meta in this fierce competition for talent. Meta AI’s Bold Recruitment Strategy Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been actively building a superintelligence team, reportedly making massive offers to lure away leading AI researchers from competitors like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. These compensation packages were said to be astronomical, reaching upwards of $100 million annually or as signing bonuses. Speaking on a podcast with his brother, Jack Altman, Sam Altman confirmed these reports, stating, “[Meta has] started making these, like, giant offers to a lot of people on our team… You know, like, $100 million signing bonuses, more than that [in] compensation per year.” Why OpenAI Talent Resisted Meta’s Offers Despite the eye-watering sums offered by Meta, Sam Altman noted that these recruitment efforts have been largely unsuccessful in attracting OpenAI’s best researchers. He expressed satisfaction that “at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take him up on that.” Altman believes this resistance stems from his employees’ assessment that OpenAI offers a better opportunity to achieve Artificial General Intelligence ( AGI ) and potentially become a more valuable company in the long run. He contrasted this mission-driven focus with what he perceives as Meta’s emphasis solely on high compensation, suggesting that this approach is less conducive to fostering a strong, innovative culture. Specific examples of failed poaching attempts reportedly include OpenAI’s lead researcher Noam Brown and Google’s AI architect Koray Kavukcuoglu, both of whom apparently declined Meta’s overtures. The Culture Clash: Innovation vs. Compensation Sam Altman highlighted OpenAI’s culture of innovation as a critical factor in its success and talent retention. He offered a pointed critique of Meta’s approach to innovation in the AI space, stating he doesn’t “think they’re a company that’s great at innovation” and that Meta’s “current AI efforts have not worked as well as they hoped.” According to Altman, simply catching up in AI is insufficient; true innovation is required to lead the AI race . This perspective underscores the strategic differences between the companies – OpenAI prioritizing its core mission and innovative environment, while Meta leverages its vast financial resources. Meta’s Moves in the AI Race While Meta may have struggled to poach top OpenAI talent with massive offers, they are certainly not idle in the AI race . Besides attempting to hire individuals, Meta recently invested significantly in Scale AI, the former company of Alexandr Wang, who is now leading a key AI team at Meta. Reports also indicate Meta has successfully hired other notable researchers, including Google DeepMind’s Jack Rae and Sesame AI’s Johan Schalkwyk. These moves demonstrate Meta’s commitment to building its AI capabilities, even if directly recruiting from OpenAI at the highest levels has proven difficult. The competition for expertise remains fierce as companies vie for dominance in developing the next generation of AI models and applications. The Future of AI and Potential Collision Courses The intense talent war is just one facet of the broader competition between OpenAI and Meta. OpenAI is reportedly developing an open AI model expected to launch soon, which could further challenge Meta in the AI landscape. Furthermore, Sam Altman hinted at OpenAI’s potential foray into social media, describing an AI-powered feed that customizes content based on user preferences, potentially encroaching on Meta’s core business. Meta is also experimenting with AI in its Meta AI app, though initial user reactions suggest confusion and issues with overly personal interactions. The viability of AI-powered social networks is still uncertain, but the exploration itself signals future areas of direct competition between the two tech giants. Conclusion: The Battle for Brains and Vision Sam Altman’s remarks underscore that while financial incentives are powerful, they are not the sole determinant in attracting and retaining elite AI talent, particularly when a strong mission like achieving AGI is involved. The rivalry between OpenAI and Meta highlights not just a battle for individuals but also a clash of cultures and strategic visions in the ongoing AI race . As both companies continue to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, the competition for the brightest minds will undoubtedly remain a critical factor shaping the future of the industry.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a popular barometer for measuring the prevailing emotion in the Bitcoin market and broader crypto space, has taken a notable dip. As of June 18, the index registered a score of 52, marking a significant drop of 16 points from its position the previous day. This movement has pushed the index out of the ‘Greed’ territory it recently occupied and firmly into the ‘Neutral’ zone. But what exactly does this shift in crypto market sentiment signify, and why should you pay attention? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Before we delve into the implications of the recent drop, let’s quickly recap what the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is and how it works. Provided by the software development platform Alternative, this index aims to quantify the two primary emotions that drive investor behavior in volatile markets: fear and greed. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0: Extreme Fear – This suggests investors are overly worried, potentially indicating a buying opportunity for those brave enough. 0-24: Fear 25-49: Neutral – This is where we currently stand. It indicates a lack of strong conviction in either direction. 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed – This suggests the market might be due for a correction, as investors could be getting ahead of themselves. The index isn’t just a random number; it’s calculated using a blend of six key factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive snapshot of crypto market sentiment: Let’s break down the components: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the past 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals increased fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum to average values over the past 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market is a sign of greedy or bullish behavior. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes posts on platforms like Twitter, looking for specific hashtags related to crypto. It checks the speed and number of posts, alongside sentiment analysis of those posts, to gauge public interest and mood. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) This component historically incorporated weekly sentiment surveys. While paused, its potential inclusion highlights the value of direct investor opinion. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be moving funds out of smaller altcoins and into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Conversely, falling dominance might suggest increasing confidence in altcoins (greed for higher returns). Google Trends (10%): This analyzes Google search data for crypto-related search queries. Rising search volume for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” might indicate fear, while searches for terms like “buy crypto” or specific altcoin names could signal growing interest and potential greed. The Recent Drop: From Greed to Neutral The move from 68 (Greed) to 52 (Neutral) is more than just a number change; it reflects a palpable shift in the collective mood surrounding the Bitcoin market and the wider crypto ecosystem. After a period where the market felt confident, perhaps even overly optimistic, the sentiment has cooled down significantly. What could be driving this change? Several factors might contribute to such a shift: Price Consolidation: If Bitcoin or other major cryptocurrencies have been trading sideways or experienced minor pullbacks after a run-up, this can dampen momentum and volume, impacting two key index components. Lack of Fresh Catalysts: Sometimes, markets cool off simply due to the absence of major positive news or developments that could fuel further price increases. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Broader economic news, such as inflation data, interest rate decisions, or global geopolitical events, can easily spill over and affect risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, leading to increased caution. Regulatory Discussions: Ongoing discussions or potential regulatory actions in various jurisdictions can introduce uncertainty, causing investors to become more hesitant. Whale Activity: Large movements of funds by major holders (‘whales’) can sometimes signal potential selling pressure or accumulation, influencing market sentiment. This shift to ‘Neutral’ doesn’t scream panic, but it certainly whispers caution. It suggests that the aggressive buying or strong bullish conviction that characterized the ‘Greed’ phase has waned. Investors are now potentially more hesitant, waiting for clearer signals before making significant moves. Why Does Crypto Market Sentiment Matter? Understanding crypto market sentiment is crucial because emotional biases heavily influence financial markets, especially one as volatile and driven by retail participation as crypto. The old adage, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” highlights the contrarian approach often advocated when using sentiment indicators. When the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’, it might signal that the market is overheated and due for a correction. Conversely, ‘Extreme Fear’ often coincides with market bottoms, presenting potential accumulation zones for long-term investors. The ‘Neutral’ zone, however, is less clear-cut. It represents a state of equilibrium, or perhaps indecision. It can be a precursor to a move in either direction, depending on what catalysts emerge next. It’s a time when the market is catching its breath, potentially consolidating before the next significant trend develops. Navigating the Neutral Zone: Actionable Insights So, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is at 52, sitting comfortably in the ‘Neutral’ zone. What does this mean for you as an investor or trader? Here are some actionable insights, keeping in mind this is not financial advice: Exercise Caution: Neutrality suggests uncertainty. Avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on emotion. Stick to your pre-defined investment strategy. Focus on Market Analysis: This is a good time to dive deeper than just sentiment. Look at technical analysis (price charts, indicators), fundamental analysis (project developments, news), and macroeconomic factors. The index is a sentiment tool, not a complete trading strategy. Prepare for Volatility: The neutral zone can be a period of increased choppiness. Prices might swing back and forth as market participants wrestle for direction. Re-evaluate Positions: Use this calmer period to review your portfolio. Are you comfortable with your current allocations? Is now the time to trim some positions or look for entry points if your analysis supports it? Stay Informed: Keep up with the latest crypto news update. Major news events, regulatory clarity, or technological breakthroughs can quickly shift sentiment out of neutral. Think of the ‘Neutral’ zone as a yellow light. It’s not a red light (stop, extreme fear) or a green light (go, extreme greed, maybe proceed with caution!). It’s a signal to slow down, observe the intersection carefully, and be prepared for potential changes. Challenges and Benefits of Using the Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to understand its limitations. Benefits: Quick Snapshot: Provides a simple, easily digestible overview of general market sentiment. Counter-Signal Potential: Can help identify potential contrarian opportunities when sentiment is at extremes. Educational: Helps new investors understand the impact of fear and greed on markets. Challenges: Not Predictive: The index tells you the current sentiment, not where the market will go next. A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t guarantee a crash, and a high ‘Fear’ score doesn’t guarantee a bounce. Bitcoin-Centric: While it reflects broader crypto sentiment, it is heavily weighted towards Bitcoin data (volatility, dominance, Google Trends). Altcoin-specific sentiment might differ. Factor Limitations: The chosen factors might not capture every nuance of market sentiment, and their weighting is determined by the index provider. Surveys Paused: The temporary absence of the survey component means a piece of direct investor feedback is missing. Using the index effectively means integrating it with other forms of market analysis rather than relying on it in isolation. Historical Context and Examples Looking back, we can see how the index has behaved during different market cycles. During the depths of bear markets, the index often lingers in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone for extended periods. Conversely, during bull market peaks, it can reside in ‘Extreme Greed’. For example, during the significant price drops in past years, the index hit single digits, reflecting widespread panic. These periods, in retrospect, often represented strong accumulation opportunities for those with a long-term view and conviction. Similarly, during the euphoric phases of bull runs, scores above 80 or 90 were common, signaling a potential top or at least a point where caution was highly warranted. The current ‘Neutral’ reading is less dramatic than these extremes but equally important. It suggests a period of re-calibration after recent price action and a potential pause before the market decides its next major move. It highlights that while the extreme fear or greed has subsided, a clear directional consensus has not yet formed in the Bitcoin market and beyond. Conclusion: A Moment of Equilibrium The drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 52, placing it in the ‘Neutral’ zone, is a significant crypto news update for anyone following the market. It signals a shift away from the recent ‘Greed’ phase towards a state of balance or indecision. While not indicating imminent danger or opportunity like the extreme zones, ‘Neutral’ is a crucial signal for investors to remain vigilant. This period calls for careful market analysis, a focus on strategy over emotion, and preparedness for potential volatility. The index serves as a valuable reminder that market sentiment is dynamic and constantly reacting to the myriad factors influencing the Bitcoin market and the broader crypto landscape. Use this neutral period wisely to assess, plan, and stay informed.

A pro-Israeli hacktivist group, “Gonjeshke Darande” (Predatory Sparrow), has claimed responsibility, framing the attack as a direct strike against the Iranian regime’s financial apparatus. Although the crypto exchange assured users of their funds’ safety, it has halted operations, and the website and app have stopped working. اطلاعیه در خصوص حادثه امنیتی صبح امروز ۲۸ خرداد، تیم فنی ما نشانه‌هایی از دسترسی غیرمجاز به بخشی از زیرساخت‌های اطلاع‌رسانی و کیف پول گرم را شناسایی کرده است. بلافاصله پس از تشخیص، تمام دسترسی‌ها متوقف شد و تیم‌های امنیتی داخلی ما در حال بررسی دقی�… The post Israel-Iran Cyber War Erupts as Hackers Hit Top Iranian Crypto Exchange Nobitex appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Top Crypto News|Crypto Hack|Exchange News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-06-18 09:32:00

The custom chips are engineered to maximize profit margins in AI workloads by slashing data transfer costs in cloud environments. AWS announced an update to its Graviton4 chip that includes 600 gigabits per second of network bandwidth, which the company calls the highest offering in the public cloud. Ali Saidi, an engineer at AWS, likened the speed to a machine reading 100 music CDs a second. The Graviton4 CPU is one of many chip products from Amazon’s Annapurna Labs in Austin, Texas, and it is a win for the company’s custom strategy, putting it up against traditional players like Intel and AMD. With Graviton4′s upgrade on the horizon and Project Rainier’s Trainium chips, Amazon demonstrated its ambition to control the entire AI infrastructure stack, from networking to training to inference. As more major AI models like Claude 4 proved they could train successfully on non-NVIDIA hardware, the question was not whether AWS could compete with the chip giant but how much market share it could take. Hutt says Amazon will provide cheaper alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs AWS Senior Director for Customer and Product Engineering Gadi Hutt said Amazon wanted to reduce AI training costs and provide alternatives to Nvidia’s expensive graphics processing units (GPUs). According to AWS, Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4 AI model launched on Trainium2 GPUs, and Project Rainier is powered by over 500K chips—an order that would have generally gone to Nvidia. Hutt said that while Nvidia’s Blackwell was a higher-performing chip than Trainium2, the AWS chip offered better cost performance. He also pointed out that Trainium3 was coming up this year, and it was doubling the performance of Trainium2, and it would save energy by an additional 50%. Rami Sinno, Director of Engineering at AWS’s Annapurna Labs, said demand for these chips was already outpacing supply. “Our supply is very, very large, but every single service that we build has a customer attached to it.” – Rami Sinno , Director of Engineering at AWS’s Annapurna Labs The AWS team stressed that while the company acknowledged specific gaps, it preferred to work with smaller, innovative startups such as Anthropic, Scale AI, and Fiddler rather than relying on large vendors. Amazon often supports these companies through strategic investments, forming mutually beneficial relationships in return for providing capital or infrastructure, as in the case of Anthropic. AWS announced Project Rainier—an AI supercomputer built for startup Anthropic—at the Invent 2024 conference last December and reportedly put $8B into backing Anthropic. AWS’s Graviton4 and Trainium3 chips promise improved performance and efficiency The Amazon team disclosed that the upgraded Graviton4 and Trainium3 chips set for late 2025 promised a 4x performance leap and 40% better energy efficiency, further compressing Nvidia’s margins. It added that this was not just a win for AWS’s top-line growth but a direct assault on Nvidia’s GPU premium. Rahul Kulkarni, Amazon’s Director of Product Management for Compute and AI, said the upgraded Graviton4 promised to deliver three times its predecessor’s compute power and memory, 75% more memory bandwidth, and 30% better performance. He added that collectively, it was expected to deliver more price performance, meaning that users got a lot more performance for every dollar spent. Patrick Moorhead, the CEO and Chief Analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said all AI companies were spending a lot of money on developing chips, adding that they had giant R&D budgets despite not disclosing the exact figures of how much was being invested. Moorhead, who spent over a decade as a vice president at AMD , added that Nvidia still remained a dominant player in the AI chips market. However, there was enough demand to support multiple competitors, including AWS.

The latest data from Coinglass shows a swelling wave of short exposure building above current levels, over $500 million in potential short liquidations could be triggered if XRP climbs just 20 cents higher. At the heart of this setup is one brutal market mechanic: leverage cuts both ways. And right now, XRP bears are looking dangerously overexposed. The XRP Exchange Liquidation Map reveals a sharply rising green curve just past $2.20, peaking around $2.35–$2.40. That’s where the bulk of leveraged short positions are stacked.

Source: Coinglass If XRP breaks through resistance and moves into that zone, it could force those short sellers to cover fast, buying back the token in a panic, adding fuel to the rally in what’s known as a short squeeze. On Bybit, Binance , and OKX, these liquidation levels are densely packed. For beginners, this means XRP could move explosively without any new headlines, just the pressure of shorts collapsing under their own weight. But the headlines are coming too. Ripple v. SEC court case continues On the legal front, the Ripple v. SEC saga drags on. The case won’t see final resolution until at least August 2025, after Judge Torres granted an extension for remedy briefs. This delay, while frustrating to some, removes near-term legal risk, and ironically gives XRP room to rally unburdened by court drama for the next several weeks. Meanwhile, a spot XRP ETF has officially launched in Canada, marking a significant milestone in XRP’s journey toward institutional legitimacy.

Market Metrics Say the Worst May Be Over,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-done-falling-market-metrics-say-the-worst-may-be-over/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating over the past few days following a significant correction triggered by geopolitical tensions last week. As the consolidation continues, analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex have found reasons to believe that the digital asset may have hit its bottom for this correction. According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report , market behavior, historical data, and certain metrics, such as Bitcoin Net Taker Volume, suggest that the correction may not extend further than it already has. BTC Reacts to Geopolitical Tensions Last week, BTC started with a strong rebound and recovery from earlier lows. The asset reclaimed key support levels around its previous all-time high (ATH) of $109,900, marking a 4.7% gain from the weekly open. This was supported by a temporary pause in profit-taking activity and improving market sentiment. However, things took a turn for the worse after tensions in the Middle East increased and Israel attacked Iran. BTC experienced a 7.33% peak-to-trough decline, losing much of its early-week gains amid heightened uncertainty in the markets. The cryptocurrency ended the week at 0.09% despite earlier gains. “The swift reversal highlights the marketʼs fragility in the face of exogenous shocks, and underscores how quickly sentiment can shift even during strong trend conditions. Heading into this week, all eyes are on the macro newsflow and whether BTC can maintain support above the $103-105K region,” Bitfinex stated. Is The Bottom In? While global markets continue to react to the effects of ongoing geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin is experiencing a spike in selling activity. This is evident in the Net Taker Volume, a metric that measures the balance between market buys and sells. The indicator has dropped to -$197 million, its most negative level since June 6, which suggests that traders are offloading BTC at market prices rather than waiting with passive bids. Such low readings in Net Taker Volume, especially below -$160 million, have coincided with local BTC bottoms. This is because panic selling exhausts weaker market participants, allowing larger players to accumulate the asset. One more reason for believing that BTC has hit its bottom for this decline is that the magnitude of this plunge closely aligns with the cycle median drawdown of roughly 7%, which is neither extreme nor anomalous. Analysts say this reflects a healthy consolidation phase during an ongoing uptrend rather than the onset of a deeper structural correction and that BTC is likely to recover soon.

According to a recent report by Reuters, the world’s top three Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining hardware manufacturers, all originating from China, are gearing up to penetrate the U.S. market. The three companies, which are Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT, have a stronghold on 95.4% of the machinery used in global mining rigs, according to an estimation from Consultancy Frost & Sullivan in 2023 . The biggest firm of the three by sales, Bitmain, had already established U.S. production of mining rigs back in December, right after Trump’s presidential win just a month prior. Meanwhile, Canaan started its initial U.S. production foray in April, aiming to shield itself from Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs . Senior executive Leo Wang said the initiative was a necessary exploration, considering the high tariffs could lead to heavy investments. MicroBT declared in a statement that it is currently trying to implement a localization strategy in the U.S.” to “avoid the impact of tariffs”. You might also like: U.S. vs China: How Bitcoin factors into the trade wars Are U.S. Bitcoin mining rigs in trouble? The strategic move made by each firm signifies their efforts to combat the effect of Trump’s tariffs on overseas imports. By establishing manufacturing bases in the U.S., they could effectively shy away from the tariffs in place for Chinese exports. On the other hand, their presence could potentially raise alarms in the U.S. regarding security concerns held by the federal government against Chinese technology firms, as seen in previous cases involving Chinese manufactured chips and energy-related businesses. U.S. crypto-law attorney, John Deaton, said that U.S. overreliance on Chinese hardware for Bitcoin mining “creates a choke point for U.S. miners.” He said this is because China has the upper hand, in the sense that they could restrict exports or manipulate supply and “disrupt Bitcoin’s network stability and affect U.S. users and investors.” Not only that, local players in the U.S. Bitcoin mining industry have also brought up concerns about Chinese firms coming for the market in the U.S. MARA Holdings-backed U.S. mining manufacturer Auradine is one of the rival companies that are currently lobbying to restrict Chinese supplies to stimulate competition in hardware. Auradine’s chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta said that Chinese mining rigs pose a “security risk,” and hundreds of thousands of them are plugged into the U.S. electrical grid. “While over 30% of global Bitcoin mining occurs in North America, more than 90% of mining hardware originates from China representing a major imbalance of geographic demand and supply,” said Gupta. According to the report, China used to dominate the entirety of the Bitcoin supply chain, from rig-making to mining to BTC trading. All of that changed after the Chinese government banned cryptocurrency in 2021 due to financial security reasons. As a result, many Chinese miners, traders and exchanges set up operations abroad. For example, Canaan moved its headquarters to Singapore, though it still has Chinese operations.

The crypto has delivered a modest 3.63% gain so far this year , with a 0.45% rise in the previous quarter and a 3.18% uptick this quarter . But analysts say the real action may be just around the corner. Ripple IPO Could Trigger XRP Rally According to John , founder of the Wealth Group trading community, Ripple’s long-rumored IPO could be the next big XRP price catalyst . While Ripple executives continue to deny any near-term IPO plans, several corporate actions suggest otherwise. Ripple recently launched a $700 million share buyback at $175 per share , implying a $25 billion valuation . John believes a successful IPO would boost investor confidence in Ripple and, by extension, increase demand for XRP , which powers Ripple’s cross-border products. “An IPO would bring traditional investors into the ecosystem and potentially send XRP soaring,” John stated. XRP Price Forms Symmetrical Triangle – A Big Move Is Coming Since hitting $3.4 in January 2025, XRP has been consolidating in a symmetrical triangle pattern . A sharp rise of 44.92% occurred in mid-January , but a quick sell-off followed, leading to a full retracement by early February. Another short-lived rally occurred in March when former President Trump mentioned XRP as part of a government crypto reserve . The coin spiked 36.97% in just two days , but again saw a sharp correction. The price touched a yearly low of $1.61 in April before beginning a slow recovery. Now, as XRP nears the apex of this triangle, analysts expect a breakout — with a potential target above $3 . Ripple IPO Could Mirror Circle’s Explosive Debut Many compare Ripple’s potential IPO to Circle’s blockbuster listing on the NYSE . On June 5, 2025, Circle (CRCL) surged 167% on debut , jumping from $31 to $82.84 per share. Its valuation soared from $7 billion to $25 billion . This success has reignited speculation that Ripple might achieve even more — especially if it settles its ongoing lawsuit with the SEC , which is now reportedly close to resolution. John Deaton once predicted Ripple could target a $100 billion IPO valuation after ending its legal battles. Ripple Denies 2025 IPO Rumors, Focuses on Acquisitions Despite mounting speculation, Ripple executives insist no IPO is planned for 2025 . President Monica Long said the company is well-capitalized , and CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized a focus on strategic acquisitions instead.

In Nazarovo, an industrial town in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia, prosecutors have shut down an illegal open-air crypto mining operation that reportedly earned its operators around 4.6 million rubles ($58,672) per month. As stated in a Telegram post by the official Krasnoyarsk Krai Prosecutor’s Office account, the 30,000-square-meter site was officially registered as hosting a non-residential building under a management company. In reality, no such building existed. Instead, the area was filled with mining equipment, power units, and other infrastructure, all leased to a third party under the guise of renting out the fictitious structure. According to the prosecutors, the land itself is state-owned, and the company had no legal right to use it. Additionally, the mining equipment was connected directly to the city’s power grid, raising concerns about potential power outages and safety hazards. The operation also violated fire safety regulations. After the prosecutor’s office issued a warning that went ignored, the matter was taken to court. A judge ordered the immediate suspension of the facility’s operations until all legal violations are resolved. Enforcement of the court ruling is being monitored by the prosecutor’s office.

However, since then, the authorities have imposed mining restrictions in certain Siberian areas to mitigate the risk of power shortages. Even though crypto mining is legal throughout Russia — except in those restricted regions — many miners bypass official channels to avoid high electricity costs and taxes. This often involves illegally connecting to the power grid, using residential tariffs meant for households, or operating without registering their facilities — actions that can strain local infrastructure and pose serious fire and safety risks. For example, earlier this year, a staff member at a regional energy provider in Krasnoyarsk Krai was caught accepting bribes to overlook illegal crypto mining connections. Investigators found that the miners involved had stolen electricity worth over 9 million rubles ($119,000) by bypassing the official power grid. In a more resourceful vein, hackers have been exploiting vulnerabilities in Russian smart home devices, turning them into crypto mining botnets and tools for cyberattacks.

If so, you’ve likely heard of the Altcoin Season Index. This crucial metric offers insights into whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin or if Bitcoin is currently leading the charge. The latest reading suggests a significant shift is underway. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), is a valuable tool for investors trying to gauge market sentiment and potential trends. But what exactly does it measure? It focuses on the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The analysis looks at the performance of these top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index ranges from 1 to 100. Essentially, the index asks: How many of these major altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin in the last three months? Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season The index clearly defines the two primary market phases: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score is typically high (often above 75). Characterized by broad rallies across many altcoins, often seeing significant percentage gains. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score is typically low (often below 25). Characterized by Bitcoin’s dominance, where BTC might be performing strongly, consolidating, or even dipping, but altcoins are generally performing worse or stagnant. The Current Reading: Altcoin Season Index at 21 As of 00:27 UTC on June 18, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 21. This is a slight drop from the previous day’s figure. According to the index’s definition, a score of 21 falls squarely into the Bitcoin Season category. What does this specific number tell us? It means that in the last 90 days, less than 25% of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin. The vast majority of large-cap altcoins have either underperformed Bitcoin or seen larger losses during this period. This confirms the market’s current state: Bitcoin is the dominant force, and capital is either flowing primarily into BTC or remaining cautious regarding broader altcoin exposure. This reading is a clear signal to market participants about the prevailing trend. Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors could contribute to the current Bitcoin Season : Post-Halving Dynamics: Historically, Bitcoin often sees a period of consolidation or slower growth after its halving event before potentially resuming an uptrend. Capital might be stabilizing or re-evaluating after the initial excitement. Institutional Inflows: The approval and activity of Bitcoin ETFs in the US have brought significant institutional capital into the market, primarily directed at Bitcoin. This sustained demand for BTC can naturally lead to its outperformance relative to altcoins. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic uncertainty, investors often move towards assets perceived as less risky or more established. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is often seen as the primary ‘safe haven’ or store of value compared to the more volatile and less established altcoins. Market Consolidation: After periods of significant gains (which some altcoins saw earlier in the year), markets often enter a phase of consolidation where gains are less uniform, and capital might rotate back into the market leader (Bitcoin) before identifying the next potential movers. Understanding these potential drivers helps frame the current index reading within the broader market context. Implications for Cryptocurrency Investing During Bitcoin Season For individuals involved in Cryptocurrency Investing , a market in Bitcoin Season has practical implications: Altcoin Underperformance: Expect many altcoins, especially smaller and less established ones, to struggle to keep pace with Bitcoin, or even decline while Bitcoin holds steady or rises. Increased Volatility for Altcoins: While altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin, this volatility can be amplified during Bitcoin Season, with sharp drops possible. Focus on Bitcoin: Investors primarily focused on riding the dominant trend might allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to Bitcoin. Selective Altcoin Opportunities: Not all altcoins will underperform. Specific sectors or individual projects with strong news, developments, or unique narratives might still see positive price action, but these are often exceptions rather than the rule during this phase. This is a time when careful portfolio management and realistic expectations for altcoin returns are essential. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights How can investors navigate the current Bitcoin Season effectively? Here are a few strategies to consider: Risk Management is Key: Review your portfolio’s altcoin exposure. Is it higher than you’re comfortable with during a period of potential underperformance? Consider setting stop-losses to limit potential downside on altcoin holdings. Avoid taking excessive leverage on altcoins during this phase. Rebalance Your Portfolio: You might consider increasing your allocation to Bitcoin or stablecoins if your goal is capital preservation or riding the BTC trend. Conversely, if you are comfortable with higher risk and believe certain altcoins are undervalued, this period might present accumulation opportunities, but exercise caution. Focus on Fundamentals: During periods of slower price action, focus on the underlying technology, adoption, development progress, and tokenomics of altcoin projects. Strong projects with real-world use cases are more likely to survive and thrive when market sentiment eventually shifts. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index for potential shifts. Monitor Bitcoin’s price action and overall market sentiment. Follow news related to institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and major project milestones. Approaching the market strategically during Bitcoin Season can help protect capital and position you for future opportunities. When Might Altcoin Season Return? The market is cyclical, and Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever. What signs might indicate a potential shift back towards Altcoin Season ? Rising Altcoin Season Index: The most direct signal would be the index climbing back above the 25 threshold and heading towards 75. This would show that a growing number of altcoins are starting to outperform Bitcoin again. Broad Altcoin Rallies: Look for sustained positive price action across a wide range of altcoins, not just a few isolated pumps. Increased trading volume in altcoin pairs is also a good sign. Rotation of Capital: As Bitcoin’s rally potentially matures or consolidates at higher levels, capital might begin to rotate out of BTC and into altcoins in search of higher percentage gains. Sector-Specific Strength: Sometimes, a new Altcoin Season is kicked off by strong performance in a specific sector (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, AI tokens) that then spills over into the broader market. Predicting the exact timing is impossible, but monitoring these indicators can help identify when the tide might be turning. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Crypto Market Landscape The Altcoin Season Index currently sitting at 21 is a clear indicator that the market is firmly in Bitcoin Season . This means that, for the time being, Bitcoin is the dominant force, and most altcoins are likely to underperform it. For those engaged in Cryptocurrency Investing , this phase calls for a cautious and strategic approach. Focus on risk management, consider your portfolio allocation, and prioritize understanding the fundamentals of the projects you invest in. While Bitcoin Season presents challenges for altcoin holders, it also offers opportunities for strategic positioning. Stay informed, be patient, and prepare for when the market eventually shifts back towards favoring altcoins.

In its June 17 announcement , AgriFORCE said the site was launched in partnership with energy provider BlueFlare Energy. The site, located in Berwyn, Alberta, is the company’s first operational deployment under its Power & Compute Initiative. It uses 425 kilowatts (kW) of power to support 120 Bitmain S21 ASIC miners, delivering over 32 petahashes per second (PH/s) of computing power. The deployment includes a custom-engineered mining pod with high-efficiency airflow, thermal controls, and BlueFlare’s proprietary telemetry system for performance monitoring. AgriFORCE said the Berwyn facility is powered entirely by stranded natural gas, which is natural gas that cannot be sold or accessed through traditional infrastructure. The site also features BlueFlare’s emissions tracking system, Carbon Cube, to ensure environmental compliance and real-time monitoring. Phase 2 of the project is currently underway and is expected to increase the capacity of the site by an additional 200 kW, bringing the total to over 625 kW. To date, AgriFORCE has mined seven Bitcoin across its Alberta and Ohio operations, valued at roughly $735,000. The company stated it may retain up to 50% of the mined BTC in its corporate treasury, while the remainder will be used to fund infrastructure expansion.

In addition to the Berwyn site, AgriFORCE signed a binding letter of intent with BlueFlare to deploy two more sites in Alberta, located in Oyen and Hinton. Each of these will replicate the Berwyn model and include modular, off-grid gas-to-power units rated at approximately 640 kW. The new sites will support workloads beyond Bitcoin mining, including AI inference, industrial IoT processing, and edge computing. AgriFORCE aims to scale its operational capacity to over 0.5 exahashes per second (EH/s) by the fourth quarter of 2025, with a long-term target of reaching 1 EH/s by Q1 2026. As Bitcoin mining becomes more energy-intensive, operators are increasingly seeking alternative power sources to reduce costs and improve sustainability. Recent trends point to a move away from coal-based energy sources, with renewable energy adoption among miners growing at an annual rate of 5.8%. Around the world, new initiatives are emerging to support more sustainable mining practices . For instance, earlier this year, United States Senator Ted Cruz introduced the FLARE Act, a bill that offers tax incentives for crypto miners using flared natural gas to power operations. The legislation proposes 100% expensing for systems that repurpose otherwise wasted gas into electricity or computational power. Meanwhile, Pakistan recently announced plans to allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to Bitcoin mining and AI data centres as part of a broader national strategy to prevent energy wastage and attract tech investment.

46267427,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71449,1750239798,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Crypto Founder: Ripple CEO Isn’t Lying About XRP, I Can Tell When Someone Is Lying",https://timestabloid.com/crypto-founder-ripple-ceo-isnt-lying-about-xrp-i-can-tell-when-someone-is-lying/,"Mason Versluis (@MasonVersluis), a recognized voice in the crypto community with over seven years of industry experience, recently expressed a clear opinion on XRP’s leadership, stating, “I can tell when someone’s lying, and Brad Garlinghouse doesn’t seem like he’s lying.” This observation reflects a broader sentiment shared by many XRP supporters. Garlinghouse, who has long been at the forefront of Ripple’s mission, is seen not only as a business executive but also as one of the most trustworthy figures in crypto. That trust is not based on branding or vague optimism. It stems from Ripple CEO’s steady messaging over the years and his active role in pushing for regulatory clarity while publicly advocating for XRP . Garlinghouse’s Vision for XRP One of the Ripple CEO’s most notable recent statements surfaced during his recent appearance at the APEX 2025 developer summit. Garlinghouse stated that XRP could realistically capture up to 14% of SWIFT’s volume over the next five years. I can tell when someone’s lying, and Brad Garlinghouse doesn’t seem like he’s lying. $XRP — MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) June 16, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The comment was notable not just for its ambition, but for the conviction with which it was made. The CEO has previously called SWIFT’s network outdated and has positioned XRP as a modern alternative for international payments. Ripple’s blockchain technology enables fast and low-cost cross-border transactions through XRP, solving a problem that plagues traditional systems, such as SWIFT. His assertion reflects Ripple’s continued focus on solving inefficiencies that plague legacy systems. A Community Aligned with Long-Term Goals Versluis’s comments reflect what many in the XRP community believe: that Garlinghouse is not exaggerating the potential of the asset he leads. XRP supporters have long viewed the token not just as a tradable asset, but as infrastructure for future financial rails. That alignment between leadership and community has been instrumental in sustaining faith in XRP, even during difficult market conditions or regulatory uncertainty. This support is so strong that some detractors falsely believe that Ripple pays its supporters to defend XRP. The trust in Garlinghouse is further backed by Ripple’s strategic direction. Instead of relying on speculative growth, Ripple has consistently emphasized utility and adoption , particularly through On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) and enterprise-grade adoption. The five-year roadmap shared at APEX, with the 14% SWIFT volume projection, fits this utility-driven approach. Versluis, just like many in the community, is convinced that Garlinghouse’s leadership at Ripple can help XRP reach new heights.

According to recent reports, asset manager Purpose Investments has received final approval from Canadian regulators to launch the country’s first spot XRP ETF. Trading for the Purpose XRP ETF will begin on Wednesday, June 18, on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker XRPP. Despite the approval giving Canadian investors an easy and regulated way to access XRP, it didn’t lift sentiment, and the token stayed under pressure. XRP ( XRP ) price dropped 3.4% in the past 24 hours to $2.17, with its market cap falling to $127 billion. The decline came as the broader crypto market cap dropped 3.6% over the past day, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other major tokens also sliding amid weak overall sentiment. This was largely driven by heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and growing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision. Rising inflation risks have dimmed hopes of imminent rate cuts, prompting a risk-off mood across financial markets. You might also like: XRP, SOL ETFs face SEC delay, but approval hopes remain Despite the bearish short-term pressure, several bullish catalysts are emerging for XRP. A recent court filing in the SEC v. Ripple case revealed that both parties have agreed to a $50 million settlement . If approved, this settlement could finally resolve the long-standing legal battle that has overshadowed XRP’s regulatory clarity and hindered its broader adoption. In addition, former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo, appointed during the Trump administration, proposed the idea of issuing government bonds for crypto assets such as Bitcoin and XRP. He shared these insights during the XRPL Apex 2025 conference in Singapore, signaling a growing policy shift in favor of regulated crypto finance. Ripple also continues to push forward on product and regional expansion. The company is preparing for the rollout of its RLUSD stablecoin, a key addition to its ecosystem. Simultaneously, Ripple has been strengthening regulatory footholds in key crypto hubs like Dubai and Singapore, which could enhance XRP’s cross-border utility. From a technical standpoint, XRP is forming a multi-month bull pennant pattern on the 1-week/USDT chart. This bullish continuation setup typically precedes a breakout, with price targets based on the length of the initial flagpole. XRP 1-week price, 50-day and 200-day SMA chart — June 18 | Source: crypto.news In XRP’s case, a breakout could project a move to $4.61, representing a 114% gain from current levels. Supporting this thesis, technical analyst Mikybull Crypto drew parallels with XRP’s 2017 chart structure, noting that a similar bull pennant breakout preceded a rally of over 1,300% to all-time highs near $3.40. Momentum indicators, however, present a mixed picture. On the weekly chart, a golden cross has recently formed, with the 50-day SMA crossing above the 200-day SMA, typically a bullish signal suggesting trend continuation. XRP 1-day 50-day, and 200-day SMA chart — June 18 | Source: crypto.news In contrast, the daily chart has turned more bearish. The 200-day SMA has crossed above the 50-day SMA, forming a death cross, which is viewed as a bearish reversal indicator in technical analysis. In addition, both the MACD and RSI are trending lower, reinforcing short-term downside risks. XRP 1-day MACD and RSI chart — June 18 | Source: crypto.news Investor uncertainty was further amplified after the SEC delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot XRP ETF, extending the review period into late July. The delay, coupled with market-wide caution, has likely contributed to XRP’s underperformance. If XRP loses the key psychological support at $2.00, further downside toward $1.62, its April 2025 low, appears likely before any sustained rebound. Conversely, holding above this level and breaking above the pennant’s resistance could reaffirm the bullish scenario and pave the way toward a retest of cycle highs.

In a recently submitted 13-page letter to CFTC Inspector General Christopher Skinner, Gemini accused the agency’s enforcement division of waging a years-long “lawfare” campaign driven by litigators’ personal ambition rather than public interest. The dispute stems from the 2022 lawsuit filed by the CFTC against Gemini . At the time, the agency claimed that the exchange made misleading statements back in 2017 about how its Bitcoin ( BTC ) auction prices could be manipulated, resulting in a $5 million settlement. You might also like: “Regulators aren’t easy”: Acting CFTC Chair warns crypto firms against rule-bending under Trump Era According to Gemini, the CFTC’s case was based on false allegations from a former employee who was on a mission to “destroy” the company and was later found to have lied under oath and committed fraud. The exchange added that despite this, the agency pursued the case for years without producing any evidence of actual wrongdoing or market harm. “It did not matter that Gemini Trust was, in fact, the victim of fraudulent activity by multiple bad actors or that the claims against it originated with a lie-riddled whistleblower submission by a discredited former employee. The DOE Staff was willing to burn millions of dollars of taxpayer money to sue an innocent party—all because “victory” would serve their personal interests and agenda,” the letter read. Gemini further argued that the enforcement division strayed from its mission to serve the public’s interest and treat market participants fairly, and instead abused its power. The exchange now calls for internal accountability to straighten out the misconduct, pointing to the calls for reform within the system by the current head of the agency, Caroline Pham. CFTC Acting Chair calls for better regulatory era Since taking office, Pham has advocated for a higher standard of oversight in regulating the crypto industry. According to her, the CFTC “must take a forward-looking approach” to address conflicts of interest and gaps left by the previous administration. Earlier this year, Pham called for a roundtable meeting with industry figures to promote more balanced oversight and constructive dialogue. Her most recent comments came during the Coinbase Annual Summit, where she reiterated the agency’s focus on fair but firm regulations that tackle real concerns. Caroline Pham has also emphasized that the agency will not overlook misconduct, stressing that both service providers and regulators must operate within the law.

Ohio is taking significant steps towards creating a clearer and more favorable environment for digital assets. The Ohio Blockchain Basics Act, known as HB 116, has recently achieved a crucial milestone, passing unanimously through the Technology and Innovation Committee. This development signals a strong legislative interest in fostering blockchain technology while providing essential safeguards for those involved with cryptocurrencies in Ohio. Understanding the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (HB 116) At its core, the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (HB 116) aims to establish a foundational legal framework for blockchain and digital assets within the state. It’s designed to address some of the key uncertainties that have historically surrounded cryptocurrency use and development. By providing clear definitions and protections, the bill seeks to encourage innovation and adoption while shielding individuals and businesses from overly restrictive or ambiguous regulations. The bill’s journey through the Technology and Innovation Committee was a significant step, demonstrating bipartisan support for these measures. This unanimous approval suggests a shared understanding among lawmakers regarding the importance of addressing the legal status of digital assets and their associated activities. What Does the Ohio Crypto Bill Mean for You? The passage of this bill through the committee brings several key protections and clarifications that directly impact cryptocurrency users and participants in Ohio. These provisions are designed to enhance user rights, promote specific activities, and reduce regulatory burdens in certain areas. Let’s break down the most impactful aspects: Protection for Self-Custody: This is a major win for individual crypto users. The bill explicitly protects the right of individuals to control their own private keys and manage their digital assets without relying on third-party custodians. In an era where control over one’s assets is paramount, this legal recognition of self custody crypto is a vital safeguard against potential future regulations that might seek to limit or monitor private ownership. Permitting Mining and Node Operations: For those involved in the technical backbone of blockchain networks, the bill provides clarity and permission for cryptocurrency mining and running network nodes. This means individuals and businesses can engage in these activities within Ohio without facing undue legal hurdles or uncertainty. This is particularly important for supporting decentralized networks and fostering a local digital infrastructure. Capital Gains Tax Exemption: While federal tax rules still apply, the bill includes a provision for a $200 capital gains tax exemption for digital assets at the state level. While seemingly modest, this exemption acknowledges the nature of digital assets and provides a small relief for minor transactions or gains, potentially simplifying reporting for small-scale users. Preventing Local Bans: One significant aspect is the bill’s power to prevent local governments within Ohio from enacting bans on using cryptocurrency for payments or on the use of self-hosted wallets. This preemption ensures a consistent statewide approach and prevents a fragmented regulatory landscape that could hinder adoption and usability. Exemption from Certain Money Transmitter Rules: The bill also exempts certain cryptocurrency activities from state money transmitter regulations. This is crucial for developers, innovators, and users who might engage in activities like transferring crypto peer-to-peer or developing decentralized applications, without being unfairly classified under rules designed for traditional financial institutions. Why is Protecting Self Custody Crypto Crucial? The emphasis on protecting self custody crypto in the Ohio bill reflects a growing recognition of a fundamental principle in the digital asset space: ownership means control of the private keys. Unlike traditional banking where a third party holds your funds, self-custody allows individuals to have direct, unfettered access to their digital wealth. Legal protection for this right is vital because: It upholds the decentralized ethos of many cryptocurrencies. It protects users from risks associated with third-party custodians (like hacks, insolvency, or censorship). It empowers individuals to manage their own financial sovereignty. By enshrining this protection, Ohio is taking a stance that respects individual property rights in the digital age. How Does This Impact Crypto Mining in Ohio? The explicit permission for crypto mining Ohio residents and businesses can engage in is a positive signal for the state’s potential in the digital economy. Cryptocurrency mining, while energy-intensive, can bring investment, job creation, and contribute to the security of blockchain networks. By providing a clear legal framework, Ohio makes itself a more attractive location for mining operations, potentially leveraging its energy resources and infrastructure. This move could position Ohio as a friendly jurisdiction for this specific, yet crucial, part of the blockchain ecosystem. Comparing Ohio’s Approach to Crypto Regulation Ohio’s approach, as outlined in HB 116, appears to lean towards fostering a permissive environment rather than a restrictive one, particularly concerning individual rights and core blockchain activities. This contrasts with jurisdictions that might impose stricter licensing requirements, ban certain activities outright, or fail to provide clear protections for self-custody. The bill’s focus on foundational basics suggests a strategic effort to build a welcoming legal ground floor for digital assets. Feature Ohio HB 116 Provision Significance Self-Custody Explicitly protected Empowers users, protects against third-party risk Mining/Nodes Permitted Encourages infrastructure development, supports networks State Capital Gains Tax $200 exemption Small relief, acknowledges digital assets Local Bans (Payments/Wallets) Prevented Ensures statewide consistency, promotes adoption Money Transmitter Rules Exemptions for certain activities Reduces regulatory burden for innovators/users What Are the Next Steps for This Ohio Crypto Bill? While passing the committee is a significant hurdle cleared, the Ohio crypto bill still needs to navigate the rest of the legislative process. It must pass the full Ohio House of Representatives and then move to the Ohio Senate for consideration and approval before potentially being signed into law by the Governor. The strong unanimous committee vote is a positive indicator, but continued support is needed for it to become law. Actionable Insights for Ohio Residents and Crypto Enthusiasts If you’re in Ohio or interested in the future of crypto regulation Ohio , here’s what you can do: Stay Informed: Follow the progress of HB 116 through the Ohio legislature. Contact Representatives: If you support the bill, consider reaching out to your state representatives and senators to express your support. Educate Others: Help explain the importance of these protections to friends, family, and colleagues. Advocacy plays a key role in shaping legislation, and showing community support can make a difference. Conclusion: A Positive Step for Ohio’s Digital Future The unanimous committee approval of the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act is a tremendous positive step for the digital asset landscape in the state. By providing clear protections for self-custody, permitting mining and node operations, offering a tax exemption, and preventing restrictive local bans, Ohio is positioning itself as a state that understands and supports the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. While the bill still has further steps to complete before becoming law, this early success is a promising sign for users, developers, and businesses alike, signaling a commitment to a forward-thinking approach to crypto regulation Ohio .

The bill passed with strong bipartisan support – 68 votes to 30 – marking the first major financial legislation since Dodd-Frank. For Garlinghouse, who’s been vocal about the need for clear regulations, this is a huge step forward for the industry. New Rules for Stablecoins Are Here The GENIUS Act sets a federal framework for regulating stablecoins. Under the new law, only approved entities like banks can issue dollar-backed digital currencies. It also requires stablecoin issuers to publish monthly reports showing what backs their tokens, and major issuers must complete yearly audits. These rules aim to increase transparency and build trust in the growing stablecoin market. Bipartisan Support Shows Changing Attitudes The bill saw rare unity in Washington, with 18 crypto-friendly Democrats joining Republicans to support it. This shift suggests lawmakers are beginning to take crypto more seriously and recognize its potential if properly regulated. Crypto Community Responds These historic developments will boost the confidence of crypto lovers. With such pro-crypto programmes, investors who are looking to put their money on crypto will gain confidence. How will it benefit XRP? A user on X shares that the GENIUS Act could increase XRP by improving Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin credibility, increasing institutional trust, and pushing XRP’s usage in cross-border payments. Stronger Protections, Stronger Dollar Supporters say the bill does more than regulate; it strengthens consumer protections, improves national security, and reinforces the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the digital age. Garlinghouse said the industry has spent years asking for clear rules, and now, those efforts are finally paying off. As the GENIUS Act moves toward implementation, its real impact on crypto markets – and Ripple’s future – will become clearer. For now, the message is loud and clear: U.S. lawmakers are finally starting to meet the crypto industry halfway.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 09:50:50

After years of underperformance, XRP may finally be ready to reclaim its all-time high, but rising star Little Pepe is already offering early investors a shot at much bigger gains. Table of Contents Little Pepe presale gains strong early momentum More than memes: Real tech, real potential Utility, speed, and security at the core Empowering creators: The Little Pepe launchpad The $777,000 giveaway supercharges engagement After seven long years in the shadows, Ripple ( XRP ) is eyeing a powerful return to its all-time high of $3.92, a level not seen since the 2017-early 2018 crypto boom. Despite a brief rally to $1.96 during the 2021 bull run, XRP lagged behind while most altcoins soared to new highs. Now, with the SEC lawsuit nearly behind it and fresh institutional interest surging, XRP could finally reclaim its former glory. But while XRP’s comeback story is bullish, smart investors are setting their sights on higher-upside play Little Pepe, currently in stage 2 of its presale at just $0.0011, already up 10% from stage 1. With a listing price of $0.003, that’s a built-in 173% ROI, but projections suggest it could soar far to $2.5. Little Pepe presale gains strong early momentum The presale for Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is off to a powerful start, with already raising over $782,112 and more than 756,465,830 tokens sold. Stage 1 of the LILPEPE token presale sold out in just 72 hours, generating $500,000. The token price has since increased by 10% to $0.0011. Crypto analysts are taking notice, with some forecasting a major post-launch surge. But Little Pepe isn’t just another memecoin chasing hype; it’s gaining traction thanks to a long-term vision, strong utility, and a clear, well-executed roadmap. More than memes: Real tech, real potential Where most memecoins depend on virality alone, Little Pepe is built on a high-performance Layer 2 blockchain designed specifically for meme tokens. It offers ultra-fast, low-cost transactions, addressing major limitations like congestion and high gas fees that affect older networks. Another standout is its sniper bot protection system, a rare and important feature that ensures fairer token launches by preventing bots from gaining early access. With a development team of seasoned crypto veterans and early backing from investors who’ve supported other successful meme projects, Little Pepe is already attracting serious interest. You might also like: From meme to the moon: Why LILPEPE might outperform XRP this bull cycle Utility, speed, and security at the core What truly sets Little Pepe apart is its commitment to real infrastructure. Its custom Layer 2 network allows for blazing-fast transactions and minimal fees, critical for the rapid trading dynamics typical in the memecoins market. The anti-sniper bot mechanism reinforces fairness by neutralizing exploitative trading behaviors during launch events. This focus on user protection is a major differentiator, and some analysts are already predicting a potential post-launch price of $2.50, driven by the token’s real-world functionality and thoughtful design. Empowering creators: The Little Pepe launchpad Beyond its token and blockchain, Little Pepe is preparing to debut its memecoin Launchpad, a simple, secure platform where creators can easily launch their own meme tokens directly within the Little Pepe ecosystem . This creator-first initiative expands the project’s use case and supports the emergence of a decentralized, meme-driven economy. Little Pepe is clearly focused on transparency, safety, and long-term value. The $777,000 giveaway supercharges engagement To celebrate its presale momentum and reward early adopters, Little Pepe is launching a massive $777,000 giveaway. Ten lucky participants will each win $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. Little Pepe is up 10% in Stage 2, with a 2.73x ROI at launch and projections as high as $2.50, LILPEPE blends meme appeal with real tech, Layer 2 speed, anti-bot protection, and a creator Launchpad. With $782k+ raised and a $777k giveaway, the momentum is undeniable.

The Stablecoin market is already a significant part of the cryptocurrency world, but its future looks even brighter, according to a top U.S. official. What Did the US Treasury Secretary Say About Stablecoins? Recently, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent shared a compelling vision for the future of digital finance. Taking to the social platform X, Secretary Bessent projected that the market capitalization for stablecoins could reach an astounding $3.7 trillion by the year 2030. This isn’t just a hopeful forecast; he tied this significant growth potential directly to specific legislative action. He specifically highlighted the importance of the GENIUS Act , a piece of proposed legislation designed to establish a clear federal framework for how dollar-backed stablecoins are issued and traded within the United States. According to Bessent, the passage of this act is key to unlocking the market’s full potential and making the $3.7 trillion figure a more probable outcome. How Can a Strong Stablecoin Market Benefit the Economy? Secretary Bessent outlined several key advantages he believes a thriving and well-regulated stablecoin market could bring. These benefits extend beyond just the crypto space, potentially impacting traditional finance and even government finances. Increased Demand for U.S. Treasuries: As stablecoins are typically backed by reserves, often including U.S. government debt, growth in the stablecoin market would naturally lead to increased private sector demand for Treasury securities. Lower Borrowing Costs: Higher demand for Treasuries can help keep the government’s borrowing costs down. Easing National Debt: By lowering interest payments on government debt, a strong stablecoin market could indirectly contribute to easing the burden of the national debt over time. Expanding the Digital Dollar Economy: Stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the U.S. dollar, serve as a bridge between traditional fiat currency and the digital asset space. Their widespread adoption could onboard millions of new users into a dollar-based digital economy, facilitating faster, cheaper, and more accessible transactions globally. Bessent characterized this potential outcome as a significant win-win-win scenario – beneficial for the private sector developing and using stablecoins, advantageous for the U.S. Treasury through debt management, and positive for consumers who gain access to more efficient digital payment methods. What is the GENIUS Act and Why is it Important for Cryptocurrency Regulation? The GENIUS Act (Getting a National Industry Understanding of Stablecoins Act) is central to Secretary Bessent’s optimistic outlook. For years, the lack of clear federal Cryptocurrency regulation for stablecoins has been a major point of uncertainty for businesses, developers, and users alike. This regulatory ambiguity can stifle innovation and adoption. The GENIUS Act aims to provide that much-needed clarity. By establishing a federal framework, it would define how stablecoin issuers operate, what reserves they must hold, and how they are supervised. This is crucial for building trust and ensuring the stability and reliability of dollar-backed stablecoins. Providing a clear regulatory path is often seen as a necessary step for attracting larger institutions and mainstream adoption. Without it, many potential participants remain hesitant due to compliance concerns and perceived risks. The passage of the GENIUS Act is viewed by proponents as a catalyst that could legitimize stablecoins further and pave the way for their integration into broader financial systems. Significantly, the U.S. Senate recently took a major step towards making this framework a reality. On June 17, the Senate gave its final approval to the GENIUS Act, sending it forward in the legislative process. This development underscores the growing recognition among policymakers of the importance of addressing stablecoins. Connecting Stablecoins to the Digital Dollar Economy The concept of a Digital dollar economy is evolving rapidly, and stablecoins are currently the most prevalent form of digital dollars in use today. Unlike a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC), stablecoins are issued by private entities but are designed to maintain a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar, typically through reserves. A robust and well-regulated stablecoin market could accelerate the transition towards a more digital economy by: Benefit Area Impact of Stablecoins Payments Faster, cheaper cross-border and domestic transactions. Financial Inclusion Easier access to digital financial services for the unbanked/underbanked. Innovation Foundation for new decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and services. Global Reach Facilitating international trade and remittances using a digital dollar. Secretary Bessent’s comments highlight the potential for stablecoins not just as a crypto asset, but as a tool that can strengthen the global position of the U.S. dollar in an increasingly digital world. Challenges and the Path Forward While the potential is significant, challenges remain. Implementing effective Cryptocurrency regulation that fosters innovation while ensuring stability and consumer protection is a delicate balancing act. Ensuring stablecoin reserves are truly secure and transparent is paramount to maintaining trust. The legislative process, even with Senate approval, can be lengthy, and the final form of the GENIUS Act is subject to further steps before becoming law. However, the positive sentiment from the US Treasury Secretary and the progress in the Senate signal a growing consensus on the need for action. Summary: A Trillion-Dollar Opportunity Awaits? U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s projection of a $3.7 trillion Stablecoin market by 2030, contingent on the passage of the GENIUS Act , paints a compelling picture of the future. This growth isn’t just about the crypto industry; it’s seen as a strategic move that could bolster demand for U.S. debt, lower borrowing costs, and expand the reach of the Digital dollar economy globally. With the Senate’s recent approval of the GENIUS Act, the path towards clearer Cryptocurrency regulation seems to be gaining momentum, potentially unlocking this trillion-dollar opportunity and integrating stablecoins more deeply into the global financial fabric.

Despite its prominence in the crypto market, BNB has struggled to break out of this consolidation, leaving investors wondering where the next wave of strong returns might come from. Meanwhile, a new DeFi player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is quickly building momentum with millions raised during its presale and thousands of active holders already behind the project. While the broader market has stayed cautious, early movers are already rotating capital into more agile, utility-driven ecosystems like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that empowers users to lend, borrow, and earn interest in a transparent, permissionless environment. The technical architecture, upcoming product features, and verified security all point to a platform designed not just for today’s market, but for long-term DeFi expansion. A Platform That Doesn’t Wait for Market Sentiment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a dual lending model—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—allowing users to choose between passive income or more hands-on yield strategies. In the P2C model, assets like USDC, ETH and AVAX will be deposited into shared liquidity pools. These pools dynamically adjust interest rates based on real-time utilization. When pool demand rises due to borrowing activity, APYs increase for depositors, creating a feedback loop that encourages liquidity inflow and balances risk automatically. For those seeking higher returns, the P2P lending system will offers direct token-based agreements where lenders can customize terms and provide loans even for underrepresented tokens like Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Dogecoin (DOGE)—assets frequently excluded from centralized platforms. This combination of flexibility and deep DeFi functionality makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a versatile income engine for both newcomers and experienced users. Mutuum’s reward system is further enhanced by mtTokens—automated yield-bearing tokens that represent deposits in the protocol. When a user deposits DAI or another supported asset, they receive an equivalent number of mtDAI, for example. These mtTokens appreciate over time as interest accumulates and can be freely traded or used as collateral for new borrowing opportunities within the platform. Beyond individual interest payments, mtToken users who participate in the staking safety module will receive dividends from the protocol’s revenue. A portion of Mutuum’s future income is planned to be used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to these mtToken stakers in designated contracts. This not only incentivizes community loyalty but applies upward pressure on the token’s price as market demand grows alongside platform adoption. While BNB holders watch for breakout signals that have yet to arrive, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is progressing with a well-defined roadmap. Most key components of Phase 1, including the CertiK audit, AI-powered helpdesk, and platform listing on tracking services, have already been executed. As the presale moves forward, the team is preparing for a beta release of the lending platform by the time the token launches live—allowing users to begin experiencing the protocol’s key features. The ongoing $100K giveaway has also brought additional attention to the project, reinforcing the strength of its marketing and community-building strategy. Security Backed by CertiK The protocol’s smart contracts have been reviewed by CertiK—one of the industry’s most trusted security firms. With a token scan score of 80.00 and a formal audit process that included both static analysis and manual code reviews, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives users an added layer of trust that many early-stage projects simply lack. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed with Layer-2 infrastructure, significantly reducing transaction costs and latency. By integrating these advanced scaling solutions, the platform aims to resolve the inefficiencies that often plague Ethereum-based lending protocols. The team is also working on a decentralized, fully overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized alternatives backed by fiat or opaque reserves, this stablecoin will be transparently collateralized by assets already locked within the protocol. It will provide users with reliable borrowing options while redirecting interest income back into the ecosystem. Strong Fundamentals Attract Smart Capital Projects like Binance Coin (BNB) began with core principles—utility, functionality, and strong tokenomics—and grew into household names. Investors who understood these fundamentals early made life-changing returns. Today, those same principles are being found in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), now trading at just $0.03 during Phase 5 of its presale. To illustrate the investment potential, consider this: a $1,000 investment at the current price would secure approximately 33,333 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $1.05—a realistic 35x return considering the protocol’s advanced features and growing adoption—the investment would be worth $35,000. For many in the DeFi space, such numbers aren’t just speculation; they’re math-driven results tied directly to a project’s real-world utility. While BNB remains a central asset within the crypto space, its performance has stagnated, bound by the macro tide and centralized exchange limits. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still early in its lifecycle, offering both price accessibility and platform-level innovation. As new users join, developers complete additional roadmap milestones, and MUTM listings begin, it becomes increasingly clear that the next generation of DeFi won’t be led by yesterday’s range-bound giants—but by agile, utility-backed protocols like Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Goldman Sachs loads up on safe, regulated Bitcoin ETFs, crypto-native whales are chasing bolder bets, like APORK, a memecoin mixing virality with real utility. Table of Contents Why does Goldman Sachs bet on the BTC ETF? What is it about APORK that attracts the Telegram Whales? In February 2025, we saw that Goldman Sachs make a significant investment in Bitcoin ETFs, as it increased its holdings in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) by 28%. For a firm that manages billions in client capital, Bitcoin ( BTC ) via ETF is the safest way to offer exposure in the crypto market to its consumers. Why does Goldman Sachs bet on the BTC ETF? Because it is most likely a safer bet. It’s regulated by the SEC, and the assets are custodied by trusted third parties like Coinbase. In fact, everything from liquidity to tax treatment is structured in a way that they don’t touch private keys. And they do it all in clean, auditable ways. For firms as large as Goldman Sachs, it’s about parking large amounts of money into an asset they believe is now legitimised. In fact, in early June, we saw that the Bitcoin ETF surged past $70 billion in assets under management (AUM), reaching the milestone in just 341 trading days. Source: https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1932119109476687884 But the Telegram whales, or the big analysts that assess communities of fast-moving private groups filled with crypto-native players, don’t have to stick to less risky assets just to play it safe. Many are leaning toward something much louder, faster, and looser: memecoins with utility, like APORK .

What we have seen over the years is that whales don’t have compliance departments and don’t need to wait for ETFs. What they care about is multipliers, narrative momentum, early access, and spotting trends. What makes it stand out? Its core idea is to build a memecoin that monetizes attention, not just speculation. APORK does this through three layers of engagement: Meme culture: It uses humor, branding, and virality to attract attention. Through GambleFi games, staking, deflation, and reward tiers, it ensures users have reasons to stay. With CommunityFi, users earn coins for holding and for spreading the word and adding value to the community. This trifecta makes APORK a hybrid: part meme, part GameFi, part DeFi. Solana’s memecoin sector exploded in late 2023 and early 2024 thanks to the platform’s ultra-low fees, fast confirmation times, and strong Telegram-native community support. But most of these coins were short-lived pumps with no real matter. There were very few coins that timed its virality right in the markets. In this sense, APORK could be: Solana’s first GambleFi-meme hybrid A blueprint for sustainable memecoin design As the Solana market shows maturity and saturation of old memecoins, it surely looks like Angry Pepe Fork could be the one to pump up the markets again.

A recent post by John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) compared holding XRP to “watching a really slow TV show,” but emphasized that “everyone says the final season makes you a millionaire.” Holding $XRP is like watching a really slow TV show… But everyone says the final season makes you a millionaire. — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 16, 2025 In the replies, several XRP investors echoed the idea that the journey has been slow, but the result is expected to be worth the wait. One user remarked that the entire show is in slow motion, and X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), another well-known community member, emphasized that the end is what counts, although it feels like it is taking forever to get there. The responses show a shared outlook that XRP’s market performance may not always be interesting, but steady accumulation could lead to significant gains. XRP’s Performance Has Shifted Significantly Although some long-time holders remain frustrated, XRP’s market behavior has changed substantially over the past months. Between November 2024 and January 2025, XRP experienced major upward shifts, climbing over 500% from around $0.55 to a multi-year peak of $3.39. The asset is currently trading at $2.25, up 3.54% from yesterday, and its resilience over the past few months despite broader market declines was driven in part by improving clarity around regulatory treatment, continued institutional interest, and excitement for its integration with financial infrastructure , such as SWIFT through the upcoming ISO 20022 integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? While the price has since moved within a more consolidated range, many analysts view the current position as a staging point for further growth. One commenter stated that XRP “will be a winner in the end,” noting that the true impact will depend on how much individuals were able to accumulate during the slower phases. This comment echoes similar statements from XRP advocates who have advised the community to buy XRP and wait rather than waiting to buy XRP. Another commenter also referenced accumulation, stating that XRP could be especially rewarding “if you own over 250,000.” These remarks reflect how investors are not only focused on short-term price movement but also on long-term positioning. Squire recently argued that XRP holders deserve to be billionaires because of their patience, and while its price may not currently be moving as many hope, it could surprise investors soon.

The move follows a June 15 trademark application for “JPMD” and will begin with a pilot phase transferring tokenized U.S. dollar deposits from JPMorgan’s wallet to Coinbase. JPMD is fully backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars and will initially be available to institutional clients only. Pending regulatory greenlight, broader access and support for additional currencies are expected. JPMD: JPMorgan’s Blockchain-Backed Answer to Stablecoins JPMD is structured as a permissioned digital deposit token, distinguishing it from fully decentralized stablecoins like USDT or USDC. In a June 17 report from Bloomberg, JPMorgan explained: The bank sees the token as a safer and compliant alternative to stablecoins, particularly at a time when traditional financial institutions are grappling with increasing competition from crypto-native payments and tokenized assets. This isn’t JPMorgan’s first entry into blockchain. The bank already operates Kinexys, an in-house blockchain-based platform processing over $2 billion in daily tokenized payments, including foreign exchange and derivatives transactions. Nelli Zaltsman, Head of Platform Settlement Solutions at Kinexys by JPMorgan, just shared insights on the groundbreaking collaboration between JPMorgan x Chainlink | $LINK x Ondo | $ONDO — and what it means for the next wave of financial infrastructure. If this doesn’t make you… pic.twitter.com/TxaZWAJVB5 — CryptoED (@Crypto_ED7) June 18, 2025 Kinexys is integrated with JPMorgan’s Liink network for secure data sharing and validation across institutions. Why JPMorgan Chose Coinbase Base for JPMD: A Middle Ground Blockchain Rather than deploying JPMD on Ethereum or other fully permissionless networks, JPMorgan opted for Base, a Layer 2 blockchain developed by Coinbase. J.P. Morgan is bringing banking onchain. Kinexys by @jpmorgan is launching JPMD, a USD deposit token for institutional clients, on Base. It will be the first token of its kind on a public blockchain, enabling fast, secure, 24/7 money movement between trusted parties. — Base (@base) June 17, 2025 While public, Base is only partially decentralized and governed by a Security Council, offering a structure that traditional financial institutions find more palatable. This setup provides an avenue for communication and intervention, two things regulators and banks often find lacking in fully decentralized networks. Base’s design presents a “middle path” between permissionless blockchains and private ledgers, which may help banks address regulatory scrutiny while taking advantage of public chains’ innovation. JPMD’s launch comes just a day after the U.S. Senate passed the long-awaited GENIUS stablecoin bill . Already, some institutions in various regions are reportedly witnessing outflows as clients migrate to digital alternatives that offer 24/7 settlement and lower transaction friction. Source: VanEck Matthew Siegel With stablecoins gaining traction as viable payment tools, tokens like JPMD may help banks defend their turf by offering compliant, blockchain-native alternatives under regulated frameworks. JPMorgan’s Rapid Blockchain Expansion in 2025 JPMorgan’s Base experiment follows a string of blockchain-related developments in 2025. Earlier this month, the bank began allowing select clients to use crypto ETFs, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as loan collateral. JPMorgan Plans to Let Clients Borrow Against Crypto ETFs – Here’s What That Means JPMorgan Chase & Co. will allow select trading and wealth clients to use cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as collateral for loans, according to a report by Bloomberg published on June… — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 6, 2025 It also announced plans to let clients buy Bitcoin, although custody will remain off-limits . CEO Jamie Dimon, previously a vocal crypto skeptic, acknowledged during a recent investor briefing : “ We’re going to allow you to buy it. We’re not going to custody it, but it’ll be in statements for clients. ” Adding fuel to this shift, a February 13F filing revealed a 69% jump in JPMorgan’s Bitcoin-related holdings, rising to $964,322. The bank increased its IBIT exposure to 5,242 shares and boosted its position in Fidelity’s FBTC fund by 208%, signaling deeper institutional conviction in digital assets. As real-world assets, from equities to bonds to currencies, move on-chain, traditional players are adapting their infrastructure to remain competitive in the digital era. With more than $260 trillion in potential assets eligible for tokenization, the implications for capital markets are vast.

This strategic move significantly enhances global accessibility to Bitcoin-backed loans for institutions and individual users, powered by advanced mobile solutions and innovative products. Why This Launch Matters Debifi’s exit from beta marks a strong validation of its non-custodial lending infrastructure. Operating with limited capacity during the beta phase, the platform saw over $20 million worth of loans originated by third-party institutional lenders over a 12-month period. What began with just two lenders has expanded to a network of over 30 institutions – including Berglinde and STOKR – with 3 to 5 new institutional lenders joining the platform each month. With loan application volume on the platform growing between 50 -100%, Debifi is now targeting a 15 – 20x increase in lending activity over the next year. Revolutionizing Bitcoin Lending The official release of Debifi’s iOS and Android mobile applications significantly enhances platform accessibility and user experience. The updated iOS app introduces cutting-edge features such as TAPSIGNER integration, a comprehensive public offers list, streamlined KYC processes, an informative Explore tab, intuitive in-app filters, and a refreshed user interface designed for seamless interaction. Debifi Cards Enters Closed Beta In a major product milestone, Debifi has launched a closed beta of its new Debifi Cards – bringing Bitcoin-backed microlending to everyday users. The cards offer small, flexible credit lines without compromising Bitcoin custody, expanding the practical use of Bitcoin as collateral. Verified Security Debifi upholds a rigorous commitment to security and transparency, having successfully completed three independent security audits including the latest by a leading blockchain security firm, Certik. The platform’s architecture is built on multisig escrow technology and follows a strict no-rehypothecation policy, ensuring client assets remain secure and verifiable at all times. Advisory Council Expansion As part of its institutional growth strategy, Debifi is proud to welcome Willy Woo, one of the most respected macro and on-chain Bitcoin analysts, to its Advisory Council. Woo joins Preston Pysh, a prominent Bitcoin educator and co-founder of The Investor’s Podcast Network. Together, they bring unparalleled market insight, macro perspective, and long-term vision to support Debifi’s mission of making Bitcoin the premier collateral asset in global credit markets. Comments from Leadership and Partners Debifi has signed two strategic partnership agreements – with The Bitcoin Adviser and Finpeers – to expand into new markets. Max Kei, CEO of Debifi: “The last 12 months were a controlled rollout phase, proving the model with minimal tooling and just two lenders. Exiting beta with over $20 million in loans issued shows real demand. Now, with global scale, full mobile support, and institutional capital, we’re building the gold standard for Bitcoin-backed lending.” Peter Dunworth, CEO of The Bitcoin Adviser: “Access liquidity without giving up your Bitcoin or compromising your custody. Debifi delivers smart lending solutions for long-term Bitcoin holders – Bitcoin-backed loans aligned with your estate and wealth preservation strategy. Self-custody meets financial flexibility, powered by Debifi and advised by The Bitcoin Adviser.” Finpeers CEO Sander Andersen : “At Finpeers, we see strong and growing interest from family offices in Bitcoin-related strategies – particularly those that combine yield with downside protection. Our partnership with Debifi enables us to provide access to overcollateralized Bitcoin-backed loans, offering an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin without holding it directly. This structure creates an opportunity to generate fiat returns through a conservative, well-collateralized framework – bridging traditional capital with the Bitcoin ecosystem.” Strategic Goals Product Innovation : Expand the suite of Bitcoin-backed credit products, including the Debifi Cards and enhanced mobile capabilities, to meet diverse market needs. Global Expansion : Strengthen Debifi’s international presence by increasing institutional partnerships and extending reach into new markets with compliant and user-friendly solutions. Institutional Onboarding : Accelerate adoption by financial institutions through robust infrastructure, compliance assurance, and strategic collaborations. Education and Advocacy : Actively promote Bitcoin’s potential as the ultimate collateral asset, enhancing market education through targeted initiatives and thought leadership.

Big movements in the market always catch our eye, and a recent transaction involving the JTO token is certainly doing that. We’re diving into a significant transfer that’s got the on-chain analysis community buzzing. A wallet, potentially linked to the Jito team or an early investor, has just moved a substantial amount of JTO to a major exchange. Let’s break down what happened and what it could potentially signal for the market. What Happened? Breaking Down the Suspected Jito Crypto Transfer According to insights shared by on-chain analyst The Data Nerd on X, a wallet that appears to be associated with either the Jito project’s core team or one of its initial investors recently initiated a large transfer. Approximately an hour before the report, this wallet deposited 4.82 million Jito crypto tokens onto the Coinbase exchange. At the time of the transfer, this amount was valued at roughly $10.54 million. This particular wallet has a notable history. It initially received a massive 17.2 million JTO tokens two years ago, likely during the project’s early phases or token distribution events. Even after this recent significant deposit to Coinbase, the wallet still retains a substantial holding of 14.38 million JTO, currently valued at approximately $26.62 million. Here’s a quick look at the wallet’s activity: Initial Receipt: 17.2 million JTO (approx. 2 years ago) Recent Transfer: 4.82 million JTO Destination: Coinbase Exchange Value of Transfer: ~$10.54 million Current Holding: 14.38 million JTO Current Value of Holding: ~$26.62 million Why Does a Large Crypto Exchange Deposit Matter? When significant amounts of cryptocurrency are moved to exchanges, it often captures the attention of market watchers. This is because moving funds from a private wallet to an exchange wallet is typically the first step someone takes when they intend to sell those assets. A large crypto exchange deposit can potentially increase the selling pressure on that specific asset, which could lead to a decrease in its price if demand doesn’t absorb the increased supply. For tokens like JTO, which have seen considerable price fluctuations since their launch, large movements from wallets associated with insiders (like the team or early investors) are particularly scrutinized. These entities often hold a large percentage of the total token supply. Their decisions to sell can therefore have a more pronounced impact on the market compared to smaller individual investors. Peeking Behind the Curtain: What On-Chain Data Reveals This entire analysis is made possible thanks to on-chain data . The blockchain is a public ledger, meaning that every transaction, including the movement of tokens from one wallet address to another, is recorded and verifiable. While the identity of the wallet owner isn’t always public, analysts can track the history of a wallet address – where it received funds from, where it sends funds, and how much it holds. Tools and platforms specializing in on-chain analysis aggregate and interpret this vast amount of data, allowing analysts like The Data Nerd to identify interesting patterns, track large movements, and infer potential intentions behind those movements. In this case, by tracking the wallet’s history back two years and observing the recent large deposit to Coinbase, the analyst could deduce the likely nature of the wallet’s owner (team or early investor) and the potential purpose of the transfer (preparing for a sale). Understanding on-chain data provides a layer of transparency that is unique to the crypto market. It allows market participants to gain insights that are simply not available in traditional finance, offering clues about supply dynamics and potential selling pressure before it hits the order books on exchanges. Implications for the JTO Token and Solana Ecosystem Jito is a significant player within the Solana ecosystem , primarily known for its liquid staking service and its focus on maximizing Miner Extractable Value (MEV) rewards for stakers. As a prominent token within this ecosystem, the price performance and significant movements of JTO can sometimes reflect broader sentiment towards Solana-based projects. A large transfer of JTO to Coinbase, especially from a suspected insider wallet, introduces the potential for increased selling pressure on the JTO token. While a $10.54 million deposit is substantial, it’s also important to consider it in the context of JTO’s overall market capitalization and daily trading volume. The market’s ability to absorb this potential selling pressure will determine the actual price impact. Potential implications include: Increased Volatility for JTO: The market might react with uncertainty, leading to price swings. Short-Term Price Correction: If the deposited JTO is sold quickly, it could cause a temporary dip in price. Market Sentiment Watch: Traders will be watching to see if this move is followed by others or if it’s an isolated event. While this event is specific to JTO, large movements in prominent Solana ecosystem tokens can sometimes have ripple effects on investor sentiment towards other projects on Solana, highlighting the interconnectedness of the ecosystem. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights So, what should you take away from this piece of on-chain data? Stay Informed: On-chain analysis provides valuable insights, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Combine it with fundamental analysis of the Jito project and broader market trends. Be Aware of Potential Volatility: Large transfers to exchanges increase the potential for price volatility. If you hold JTO, be prepared for possible price swings. Risk Management is Key: Don’t make impulsive decisions based on a single data point. If you are trading, consider setting stop-losses. If you are a long-term holder, understand that market cycles include periods of sell-offs. Context Matters: A $10 million transfer is large, but its impact depends on market depth and overall demand for JTO at the time of potential selling. Not Necessarily a ‘Doom Signal’: While it signals potential selling, the reasons could vary (e.g., diversification, funding operations, planned vesting schedule sales). It doesn’t automatically mean the team or investors have lost faith. Conclusion: Navigating the Signals in the Crypto Sea The transfer of 4.82 million JTO tokens , valued at over $10 million, from a suspected insider wallet to Coinbase is a significant event detected through on-chain data . It signals the potential for increased selling pressure on the Jito crypto token, which is a key part of the vibrant Solana ecosystem . While a large crypto exchange deposit doesn’t guarantee a price drop, it’s a crucial data point that informed market participants consider. This event underscores the transparency offered by blockchain technology and the value of on-chain analysis in spotting potential market-moving activities. For investors and holders, it serves as a reminder to stay vigilant, understand the potential risks associated with large token holder movements, and always practice sound risk management. The crypto market is dynamic, and staying informed about such transfers is part of navigating its complexities.

It’s not just the military talks grabbing headlines. The visit comes amid growing controversy over alleged crypto dealings tied to Pakistan-based firms and Trump family connections, putting the spotlight on digital assets in an unexpected setting. This is the first time in over 20 years that a Pakistani army chief is being hosted at the White House and given the current tensions in West Asia, the timing has raised eyebrows for more than one reason. Crypto Deals in the Spotlight So, what does crypto have to do with this? Reports of the Trump family’s alleged crypto links with Pakistan-based companies have resurfaced just as Munir arrives in Washington for his five-day visit. Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert, highlighted the weight of the moment, saying, “There’s been US-Pak engagement on critical minerals, crypto, and Counter Terrorism. Trump takes a deep personal interest in all of these. And Munir is empowered to talk about it all.” Military Talks, Protests, and Geopolitics The meeting comes amid rising tensions in the Middle East, especially between Iran and Israel. Pakistan shares a border with Iran, making its position a key factor as the US weighs its next moves. Pakistan has already shut down several border routes, affecting trade and travel across the region. But Munir’s visit hasn’t gone unnoticed by critics. Pakistani-Americans, many of them supporters of Imran Khan’s PTI party, have been protesting his presence in D.C., calling him a “mass murderer” and accusing him of crushing democratic voices back home. National security voices in India are questioning the meeting too, especially after a deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam in April, which had links to Pakistan’s military leadership.

The Simpsons told us it would! In 1997, Crypto Barn gave us a glimpse into the possibilities of Crypto, and now we’re riding the narrative and reaping the rewards. But that’s not all! Ethereum is on the precipice of something huge, and potentially taking Crypto Barn to new heights! $BARN has the Crypto degens talking, with Apex Syndicate claiming it will be the next $DOGE, and Crypto Goals forecasting it to 1000x in the coming months. Here’s how $BARN is getting ready to take off with ETH! Ethereum jumped 38% in early May $BARN is poised to pump with ETH $BARN grew 7,114.5% in 8 days The ETH chain advantage for meme coins Forecasts show Ethereum, a long-term rival of Bitcoin, could dominate Bitcoin with its recent performance trends, which could bode well for Memecoins. Early May, ETH added a remarkable 38% value—clearly, some sharks were circling. Considering it’s a $280 billion asset, this was impressive! But this bullish wave didn’t just benefit ETH holders, but also signals to Memecoin holders that a potential pump is on the horizon. The advantage of Memecoins is that they have a smaller market cap, which gives them more room to run in a bullish market. While stablecoins like ETH need vast amounts of money to increase by 10%, smaller caps don’t, thus improving the potential profits for coin holders. So, as ETH sees a pump, popular ETH-based Memecoins are poised to follow! Enter $BARN: Why it’s poised to pump If ETH continues on its upward trajectory, which is expected, $BARN is in a prime position to grow with it. If you don’t believe us, it’s written in history! In 1997, the Simpsons quietly hinted at a future driven by crypto with Crypto Barn, a small store for codes in the background of a scene. Cryptocurrency wasn’t even a word then! $BARN has a real narrative and strong community backing it, ticking the boxes needed for success in the volatile crypto market. With the rise of ETH, this low-cap runner is poised to follow. $BARN forecast – how far can this go? $BARN has huge potential because it is small, or as Apex Syndicate says, “a micro-cap memecoin with great community backing”! It has a current market cap of under $350k, after a pullback from all-time highs following market uncertainty. To give you an idea of how $BARN has grown, by the end of May, it settled around $40k market cap, growing tremendously by the 4th of June to over $1 million! That’s a 7,114.5% increase in just 8 days. Influencers like Apex and Crypto Goals believe it will exceed this, even rivalling $DOGE! You don’t want to miss out on $BARN’s next run! It’s going to be wild!

Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) added approximately 10,000 BTC using proceeds from its latest preferred stock issuance, while BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE American: BMNR) finalized the purchase of over 150 BTC following a common stock offering. BitMine Immersion Technologies Completes $16.3M Bitcoin Treasury Acquisition Following Public Stock Offering BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR), a publicly traded Bitcoin network infrastructure and investment company, has officially completed the deployment of all net proceeds from its recent equity raise into direct Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing its long-term strategy to build a Bitcoin-centric treasury model. In an announcement released Tuesday, the company revealed it had finalized the acquisition of 154.167 Bitcoin at an average price of $106,033 per coin, using $16.347 million—a sum that nearly mirrors the $16.340 million in net proceeds raised from its offering of common stock, which closed on June 6, 2025. A Bitcoin-First Corporate Treasury CEO Jonathan Bates commented on the milestone, saying, “We are very excited to establish our Bitcoin Treasury and fulfill our commitment to invest 100% of the transaction proceeds into Bitcoin,” said Bates. “This is not just a financial strategy—it’s a fundamental part of our identity as a Bitcoin-native business.” This direct investment marks one of the most aggressive treasury conversions to Bitcoin among US-listed public companies in 2025, aligning BitMine with the likes of Strategy and other Bitcoin-forward enterprises that have prioritized the digital asset over traditional fiat reserves. BitMine has differentiated itself from other crypto mining firms by blending traditional immersion cooling-based Bitcoin mining with emerging services in the synthetic hashrate and Bitcoin-denominated financial product sectors. The company operates mining sites in low-cost energy regions, including Trinidad, Pecos, Texas, and Silverton, where it can scale operations while minimizing energy expenditure—a critical component in maintaining profitability, especially in an increasingly competitive post-halving mining environment. Additionally, BitMine offers Bitcoin advisory services to public companies interested in navigating the complexities of earning and holding Bitcoin, either through direct mining or hashrate-related financial instruments. Market Context and Institutional Confidence The announcement comes at a time when institutional confidence in Bitcoin continues to rise, fueled by the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a growing list of corporate adopters , and renewed global interest in decentralized assets amid monetary policy uncertainty. Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,000, making BitMine’s average entry price relatively close to market. BitMine’s Bitcoin allocation strategy mirrors the broader corporate shift toward hard assets amid inflationary concerns and currency debasement. It also reflects the company's intent to treat Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset, but as a strategic treasury reserve and operational foundation. As with all crypto-facing companies, BitMine has acknowledged the risks in its forward-looking statements. These include the volatility of Bitcoin, regulatory developments, and the company’s ability to adapt to a fast-evolving technology and financial landscape. Investors are reminded that future performance could vary based on a wide array of factors, including competition, energy pricing, the global economic climate, and the evolving valuation of Bitcoin itself. The company filed its latest Form 10-K with the SEC on April 3, 2025, and notes that all forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and disclosures outlined in those filings. Strategy Inc. Nears 600,000 Bitcoin as It Converts $1B in Preferred Stock Sales into Massive BTC Purchase In related news, corporate Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) has acquired approximately 10,000 additional bitcoins for $1 billion, bringing its total holdings to a staggering 592,100 BTC—just shy of the 600,000 BTC milestone. This monumental purchase cements Strategy’s dominance as the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin and underscores its long-term conviction in the digital asset as a superior treasury reserve. The company’s relentless Bitcoin accumulation has drawn widespread attention from both institutional investors and regulatory observers alike. Top 10 largest corporate Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries ) The latest acquisition was primarily funded by the $1 billion upsized IPO of the firm’s newly launched Stride (STRD) perpetual preferred stock, which offers a 10% non-cumulative fixed dividend and is non-convertible. The offering drew strong institutional interest and marks another key pillar in the company’s innovative financing ecosystem. Additional funding for the purchase was sourced from the at-the-market (ATM) sales of two other perpetual preferred stock programs: Strike (STRK) and Strife (STRF). STRK offers an 8% fixed dividend and is convertible, while STRF provides a 10% cumulative dividend and is non-convertible. According to TD Cowen analysts, this structured approach “establishes a channel for future high-yield funds flows into Bitcoin,” providing Strategy with scalable, long-term funding sources that minimize dilution to common shareholders while maximizing Bitcoin exposure. The Bigger Vision: “42/42” and Long-Term Leverage The latest round of buying is part of Strategy’s aggressive and ambitious “42/42” plan, which seeks to raise $84 billion in equity and convertible debt offerings by 2027, all earmarked for Bitcoin acquisitions. The firm, led by Bitcoin evangelist and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with the institutionalization of Bitcoin. On a recent earnings call, Saylor outlined the firm’s target leverage ratio of 20%–30%, calculated as total debt and preferred stock divided by the market value of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings. As of now, the firm sits on $63 billion in Bitcoin and $11.6 billion in total liabilities (including preferred shares), which analysts say supports a strong balance sheet. Analysts at TD Cowen remain bullish, reaffirming their “Buy” rating on Strategy stock and setting a $590 price target for MSTR shares. In a note published Tuesday, the bank emphasized the relative safety of Strategy’s junior securities given the firm’s asset base and modest debt load. The perpetual nature of the preferred stock means the capital raised can remain on the balance sheet indefinitely, offering the firm consistent liquidity without the looming burden of debt maturity—making it a highly flexible instrument for Bitcoin acquisition. Strategy’s Role in Institutionalizing Bitcoin Strategy Inc.'s actions are seen as a watershed moment for Bitcoin’s integration into traditional corporate finance. By issuing fixed-income-style securities tied to a Bitcoin accumulation strategy, the firm is effectively creating a new model for capital markets to interface with crypto assets. This model allows yield-hungry investors to access Bitcoin exposure through income-generating instruments, while enabling Strategy to accumulate BTC without shareholder dilution. It also sends a strong message to Wall Street: Bitcoin is not just a hedge or an asset—it's a treasury standard. With this latest purchase, Strategy now holds more Bitcoin than most countries and is rapidly approaching the symbolic 600,000 BTC mark. As the price of Bitcoin continues to climb, the company’s holdings represent a significant portion of the total circulating supply, amplifying its influence in the crypto and financial sectors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-18 11:30:00

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $9.84, with a possible maximum trading value of $10.50 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $15.75 and $17.06, with an average price of $16.41. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, but this crypto asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ripple Token XRP Price $ 2.156 (-2.78%) Market Cap $126.85 Billion Trading Volume (24 Hour) $3.2 Billion Circulating Supply 58.88B XRP All-time High $3.40 Jan 07, 2018 All-time Low $0.002802 July 07, 2014 24-hour High $2.22 24-hour Low $2.15 XRP price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility 3.58% 50-Day SMA $ 2.30 200-Day SMA $1.864515 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed 0 Green Days 15/30 (50%) XRP price analysis: XRP degrades to $2.156 as bears continue to lead XRP price analysis confirmed a downtrend at $2.156. Cryptocurrency loses 2.78% of its value. XRP coin prices seek a support level at $2.09. On June 18, 2025, XRP price analysis revealed a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The coin value has decreased to $2.156 in the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 2.78% of its worth today. This creates unfavorable circumstances for investors, as the cryptocurrency is now losing value. During the past two trading sessions, XRP experienced negative sentiment, and the selling pressure still persists. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of the XRP coin confirmed a downward trend for the cryptocurrency. The XRP/USD value has depreciated to a low of $2.156 for the day. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify continued selling activity. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the volatility. This distance is slowly decreasing, leading to low volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as resistance, has shifted to $2.313, while its lower limit, serving as support, has moved to $2.080. XRP/USD 1-day price chart. XRP price analysis shows decreasing volatility The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 44.34 in the past 24 hours. The descending curve on the RSI graph reflects a rising selling momentum. If the bearish momentum continues to intensify, further downside is possible soon. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of the XRP coin also confirmed a bearish trend in the market. The XRP/USD value has decreased to $2.156 in the past few hours. The increasing volatility signals a higher chance of an upcoming reversal or further price escalation. The Bollinger Bands are converging, leading to decreasing volatility. This downtick in volatility signifies a lower market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $2.298, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $2.10, securing the support. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart The RSI indicator is trending within the neutral region for now. Its value has been decreased to index 42.56 in the last four hours. This decrease is represented by a downward RSI curve. The bears have been ruling the market since the last eight hours. This has resulted in bringing some degree of further instability for the investors.

Ripple price analysis gives a relatively bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has decreased to a low of $2.156 over the last 24 hours. The coin has lost up to 2.78 percent of its value. Technical indicators give sell signals, and the price charts also continue to project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple and the rising adoption might boost XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisition and CBDC development make XRP a good investment option in the long-term. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum took hold, plunging the price to $2.156 during the day. The RSI decreased to 44.34 at the same time and is in the neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.28 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the middle of next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a lesser chance of reaching $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $17.06 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Nasdaq-listed VivoPower has released plans to launch an XRP-focused treasury strategy. VivoPower has secured $121 million in private share placement for the strategy, which will make it the first publicly traded company to adopt XRP as a primary treasury reserve asset.

XRP price prediction June 2025 According to XRP price prediction, in June 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $2.72. The average trading price is expected to be $2.37 for the month, while the lowest it can go as per XRP cost estimation is $1.72, considering the current XRP sentiment.

It is important to consider that predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested, or you can carry out your research. XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57; however, near the start of June, it is trending around the $2.18 range, as the market sentiment tilts towards the negative side.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-18 11:30:00

According to blockchain analyst @DataC5821 , the wallet in question dumped approximately 10.9 million Moonpig ( MOONPIG ) tokens worth $120.2K. On-chain data shows a rapid sequence of sell transactions clustered around the $14 million to $10 million market cap range, culminating in a crash to approximately $9.5 million at the time of reporting. Since then, the market cap has rebounded slightly, currently standing at $9.9 million.

You might also like: The full breakdown of James Wynn’s $1B Bitcoin positions — and how it all fell apart The analyst sarcastically responded that Wynn tends to “de-risk” only after getting liquidated on Hyperliquid, implying that the MOONPING dump may have had less to do with global events and more to do with covering personal trading losses. Whether driven by geopolitical risks or not, the recent sell-off follows Wynn’s reported $100 million liquidation on Hyperliquid in late May, triggered when Bitcoin ( BTC ) price dipped below $105,000. However, it’s still unclear whether Wynn actually incurred those losses. On June 13, crypto analyst Dethective challenged this narrative, suggesting that Wynn’s losses were not actual cash outs but rather reflected trading against his own positions.

Analyst Predicts Bullish Trends For Crypto Amid Conflicts In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Cyclop pointed to historical patterns that suggest geopolitical tensions often lead to bullish trends in cryptocurrency. Citing specific instances from April and October 2024, he noted that Bitcoin (BTC) experienced an initial decline of 18% and 10% respectively during these conflicts, only to rebound with impressive gains of 28% and 62% shortly thereafter. This trend, he argues, indicates a recurring cycle where war-related dips in crypto prices eventually transform into significant growth, as can be depicted in the chart below shared by Cyclop. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge The analyst explains that while such conflicts can trigger short-term bearish movements, the overarching impact tends to be favorable for cryptocurrencies. As wars ignite fears of inflation and instability, Cyclop has noted that many investors for the traditional finance arena turn to crypto as a hedge against weakening fiat currencies. Unlike traditional bank accounts, cryptocurrencies are not subject to freezing, he said, making them appealing during times of geopolitical unrest. Increasingly, digital currencies are being viewed as a form of “digital gold,” a safe haven in tumultuous times. Favorable Macroeconomic Factors The current market dynamics echo previous events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and US-Iran tensions in 2020, which similarly resulted in temporary dips followed by recoveries. Cyclop remains confident that the present situation will yield similar outcomes, despite the typical summer slowdown that often affects market activity. Supporting this bullish sentiment are favorable macroeconomic factors. Recent developments indicate that the US and China have reached a compromise, easing tariffs and aiming to stabilize global supply chains. This move is expected to help cool inflation and restore investor confidence. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s decision to delay new tariffs has contributed to a more risk-friendly environment, allowing liquidity to flow back into crypto markets.

With year-over-year inflation at 2.4%—down from an expected 2.5%—the Federal Reserve (Fed) is now anticipated to cut interest rates twice by the end of the year. Historically, such rate cuts have been bullish for cryptocurrencies, as they often lead to increased liquidity in the markets. While the immediate aftermath of the Israel-Iran conflict may present challenges, historical data suggests that cryptocurrencies have the potential to thrive in such environments.

The offering has already received full subscriptions. In an official press release , the Norwegian firm declared that it would issue new company shares in order to raise at least 85 million Swedish krona or equal to around $8.8 million. The digital asset firm has established the subscription price per share at 0.1036 SEK, matching the closing price on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market as of June 17. The capital raised from sales of the shares will be used to add more Bitcoin ( BTC ) to the company’s balance sheet. According to the release, the goal is to buy up to 1,000 BTC. Exposure to more Bitcoin will allow the company to diversify its holdings, improve margins and fuel scalable growth. The issuance has already attracted pre-commitments, including an investment by the CEO of K33, Torbjørn Bull Jenssen himself that amounts to about EUR 100,000. “We strongly believe that Bitcoin represents the future of global finance and are positioning K33 to benefit maximally from this,” said Jenssen in his statement. You might also like: Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC Aside from Jenssen, the company claimed that the shares have already gotten full subscription commitments from both existing and new investors. The minimum subscription and allocation amount in the Directed Share Issue will be a number of Offer Shares equal to EUR 100,000 per investor. However, the company may, at its sole discretion, offer and allocate amounts below the minimum. The application window opens from June 18 at 09:00 CEST and closes on June 19 at 17:30 CEST, though dates are still subject to change. However, by applying for shares, investors will automatically vote in favor of item 9 at an Extraordinary General Meeting on July 3, which would authorize the board to issue shares and financial instruments as needed. “Such undertaking applies to all shares in the Company held or controlled as of the record date for the EGM,” wrote the company in its notice. According to the release, share allocations will be decided by the board, considering factors like order size, existing holdings, and investor fit. Notification of allocation is expected around June 23, with settlement and share trading beginning in early July. Throughout the year, K33 has been accelerating its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Earlier in May, the Norway-based firm raised 60 million SEK, worth about $5.6 million, from insiders and investors to boost its Bitcoin holdings.

While this status does not guarantee regulatory clearance, it brings the fund closer to possible trading on US exchanges and reflects a broader trend of institutional recognition for Solana-based investment products. Solana ETF listing moves to pre-launch stage The DTCC listing confirms that VanEck’s VSOL is now registered for future electronic trading and clearing. This follows the SEC’s recent request that issuers, including VanEck, submit updated S-1 registration forms. Although the ETF cannot currently be created or redeemed, its presence on the DTCC’s platform signals that infrastructure is being prepared should approval be granted. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas said the SEC is actively engaging with S-1 filings for Solana-based ETFs, suggesting growing openness to expanding crypto ETF offerings. James Seyffart @JSeyff · Follow Delay here was expected. Intermediary deadline for this was today. But, SEC is engaging on S-1 for Solana Staking ETFs and that’s a *very* positive sign. Still, timelines for approvals are less certain IMO 12:03 am · 18 Jun 2025 282 Reply Copy link Read 55 replies The SEC has already approved spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and attention is now turning to whether Solana will be next. Growing institutional interest in Solana The DTCC listing of VSOL is part of a broader wave of institutional interest in Solana. Earlier in the year, futures-based Solana ETFs — SOLZ and SOLT — were also listed on the DTCC but remain in redeemable-only status. Several asset managers, including Bitwise, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton, have also filed for spot Solana ETFs, though the SEC has delayed decisions on some of these applications. VanEck has already launched Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs and manages multiple digital asset funds globally. By adding Solana to its offering, it aims to provide investors with regulated access to one of the most actively used blockchains in the DeFi and NFT space. Solana’s ability to process thousands of transactions per second, coupled with a robust developer ecosystem and growing adoption in Web3 applications, has made it a leading candidate for mainstream financial integration. According to Polymarket, a decentralised prediction market, traders assign a 91% chance that a Solana ETF will be approved by 2025. Market reaction and Solana’s price trend Despite the development, Solana’s native token, SOL, was trading at $147.93 at the time of writing, down nearly 3% in the past 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap The price movement reflects caution, possibly due to broader market volatility or the uncertainty around the SEC’s timeline for a final decision. While listing with the DTCC is a critical part of bringing an ETF to market, it does not mean immediate launch. Instead, it demonstrates that the fund has met preliminary clearing and trading eligibility standards. The actual trading date for VSOL has yet to be confirmed. In the background, the SEC continues to evaluate filings for Solana ETFs. The outcome will determine whether Solana joins Bitcoin and Ethereum as the third cryptocurrency to be granted full spot ETF approval in the US.

According to the pundit, once XRP gains real momentum, the move toward $100 will happen swiftly. Even more striking is his prediction that XRP’s rise from $100 to $1,000 could unfold in even less time. This statement, posted on X, has sparked intense reactions across the XRP ecosystem, reflecting the hopes, doubts, and determination of a highly engaged community. From Fractions to Fortunes: The First Phase XRP is currently trading at $2.16, a level that reflects confidence after years of regulatory hurdles and price stagnation. The token has already proven its ability to generate life-changing gains. During the 2017 bull run, it soared from a mere $0.006 to a high of $3.80, making early holders overnight millionaires. Holding $XRP from $0.006 to $3.80 was a lot easier than what holding #XRP from 2 to $100 will be Once $XRP starts rapidly moving towards $100 It will take a lot less time for $XRP to move rapidly from $100 to $1,000 — BarriC (@B_arri_C) June 17, 2025 BarriC argues that despite how dramatic that rise seemed, the next stage—moving from $2 to $100—will be even more challenging. Why? Because it’s no longer about patience, but discipline. As price action speeds up, the temptation to sell early and lock in profits could override long-term conviction. Community Reactions: Hope, Doubt, and Determination The XRP community responded to BarriC’s forecast with a mix of enthusiasm, skepticism, and strategy. “Early holds test patience; the real challenge is navigating rapid growth,” commented Caspian. “Systems built now prepare you to capitalize when momentum accelerates beyond $100.” His remark highlights the psychological strength and planning needed to ride out parabolic price moves. Janina took a more measured view, stating, “ Hold on to XRP and wait for the first $5 price to arrive,” reflecting the belief that incremental milestones should be the focus before entertaining three-digit valuations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 But not everyone agreed with the math. “$100? That math doesn’t work,” said Konstant Kash, pointing to concerns over XRP’s large circulating supply and the feasibility of such a market cap. Still, die-hard supporters remain firm in their belief. “Anyone selling XRP at any time is ignorant,” wrote Custom Coastal Painting . “XRP will be my bank.” Another user, Ark, went even further: “When I heard XRP, I thought about $10,000.” The Road Ahead: Reality Meets Speculation Reaching $100 would require XRP to hit a multi-trillion-dollar market cap , a feat that would demand massive institutional adoption, widespread use of Ripple’s payment infrastructure, and deep integration into global finance. Ripple’s progress is promising. The company recently launched its U.S.-regulated stablecoin, RLUSD, and continues to expand its On-Demand Liquidity services. Meanwhile, its legal battle with the SEC appears to be winding down, with both parties awaiting Judge Torres’ ruling on a revised settlement agreement . A favorable decision could unlock U.S. exchange listings and institutional flows—critical ingredients for the kind of breakout BarriC envisions. While skepticism is natural, one thing is clear: the XRP community is preparing for something big. Whether it’s $10, $100, or even more, BarriC’s post has reminded holders that the real test might not be believing in XRP’s potential—it will be staying strong when that potential finally starts to unfold.

Ark Invest’s latest sale on Tuesday amounted to $44.76 million in CRCL shares, following a $51.7 million divestment on the previous day. Altogether, Ark Invest sold 342,658 Circle shares, split across three of its actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). According to fund disclosures, ARKK offloaded 196,367 shares, ARKW sold 92,310 shares, and ARKF trimmed 53,981 shares from its holdings. Despite the sizable reduction, Ark holds a substantial stake in the USDC issuer, with over 4.15 million shares valued at approximately $628 million, well above its initial $373 million investment. Ark Invest sells Circle shares after recent rally The selloff came as Circle’s stock, trading under the ticker CRCL, closed Tuesday at $154. The company’s shares have staged an explosive rally since debuting at $31 on June 5, 2025. Within just over two weeks, CRCL surged by nearly 387%, reaching a high of $165.60. Ark’s move to reduce exposure came after the US Senate passed the bipartisan GENIUS Act, a comprehensive framework regulating stablecoin issuers on June 17. The legislation is seen as a positive development for companies like Circle, whose operations were limited due to the previously “unfriendly” regulatory environment. Late Tuesday, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire praised the bill in a post on X, calling it a “genius” piece of legislation. It’s truly GENIUS https://t.co/0fClY524Ii — Jeremy Allaire – jda.eth / jdallaire.sol (@jerallaire) June 17, 2025 Ark Invest reduced its Circle stake, but it has simultaneously increased its holdings in semiconductor stocks, looking to benefit from the artificial intelligence boom. The firm reportedly acquired additional shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and equities in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). In addition, Ark also cut down on its Meta Platforms shares and expanded holdings in Nvidia and food delivery firm DoorDash. ARKK’s rebound shadowed by short-seller numbers Ark’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF has rebounded significantly since April, gaining more than 50%, but it hasn’t convinced everyone. Short interest in ARKK hit a record 37% of the ETF’s free float, according to data from analytics firm S3 Partners. In June alone, short sellers absorbed more than $300 million in mark-to-market losses as ARKK’s value climbed. Monday’s 4.4% rally alone inflicted another $93 million in losses on those betting against the fund. “ The funds have gone on great runs, but I wonder if investors who piled in during 2020 and 2021 are still feeling the effects of that rush and decline ,” said Todd Sohn, senior ETF strategist at Strategas. “ Perhaps they’ve moved on to other areas like crypto or levered single stock funds too .” Analysts suggest that some of the short-selling pressure comes from funds hedging their long positions in large-cap tech stocks, a practice they insist on keeping even as those trades post short-term losses. On Thursday, ARKK logged its largest single-day outflow since 2022. The fund has seen net redemptions for five straight weeks, totaling over $840 million this year. According to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Athanasios Psarofagis, the exodus may be tied to the fund’s recent underperformance and competition from alternative ETFs. In a recent note, Psarofagis mentioned how new single-stock ETFs are the reason why retail investors are deciding to bypass Ark’s actively managed thematic funds.

In a new blog post, Hayes warns that Circle’s stock market debut has marked the beginning of a “stablecoin mania” that he thinks will fleece investors who get caught up in the hype. According to the crypto veteran, Circle’s success will inspire a wave of new stablecoin issuers looking to capitalize on the hype, luring investors with promises of massive growth. “The bubble will pop after the launch of a stablecoin issuer on a public market, most likely in the US, that separates fools from tens of billions of capital by using a combination of financial engineering, leverage, and amazing showmanship… A very bankable charismatic individual will get on stage and spew all sorts of nonsense, wave his (most likely a male) hands to and fro, and convince you why the leveraged piece of dogshit he is selling is about to corner the multi-trillion dollar stablecoin total addressable market (TAM).” Hayes notes that the extent of the damage from the looming stablecoin mania will largely hinge on how the US chooses to regulate the sector. “The more freedom allowed to issuers in terms of what backs a stablecoin and whether they can pay yield to holders, the more financial engineering and leverage that can be used to mask a t*rd. If you assume a light to no touch stablecoin regulatory regime, then you could get a repeat of Terra/Luna in that an issuer creates some fugazi algorithmic stablecoin Ponzi. The issuer can pay high yield to holders and the yield comes from applying leverage to some holdings of assets.” In 2022, the Terra ecosystem collapsed after its algorithmic stablecoin LUNA lost its peg to the dollar, wiping out $40 billion in market value. For those looking to invest in other stablecoin issuers, Hayes says to keep a close watch on the project’s distribution channels. “If you stop reading here, the only question you must ask yourself when evaluating an investment in a stablecoin issuer is this: how will they distribute their product? To distribute at scale, and by that, I mean have the ability to reach millions of users affordably, an issuer must use the pipes of a crypto exchange, a Web2 social media Goliath, or a legacy bank. If they have no distribution, they have no chance of success. And if you can’t easily verify that said issuer has the access to push product through one or more of these channels, run away!” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ahead of the Federal Reserve’s meeting this Wednesday, traders, economists, and anyone who watches the Fed for a living are all stuck on one question: Will the median forecast from 19 Fed officials show one interest rate cut in 2025, or two? That’s it. That’s the big mystery. The rates aren’t even expected to change this week—but the market still treats this dot chart like it’s some kind of divine prophecy. According to Bloomberg, this obsession has gotten ridiculous. The projections are built on economic forecasts full of holes and uncertainty, but the entire market keeps treating them like hard science. That’s part of the reason some Fed officials are openly talking about changing the system. Right now, the dot plot gets updated every other meeting. Each dot represents what one policymaker thinks the interest rate should be by the end of the year. Then Wall Street treats the average—or more specifically, the median—as if it’s the Fed’s secret game plan. Fed’s internal chaos leaks into public confusion The June 2024 meeting proved how misleading this thing can be. In March, the median projection showed three cuts. Then in June, that dropped to just one. But when September came around, the Fed slashed rates by a full percentage point—way beyond what the plot had hinted at. The dot plot didn’t prepare the market for that. It misled it. Things got tighter this past March. Four officials said zero cuts. Four said one. Nine guessed two. Two predicted three. That cluster averaged out to a median of two cuts. But if only two of those officials decide this week to bump their projection down to one cut, the entire median shifts. Suddenly, the market thinks the Fed has changed course—again. That kind of confusion is exactly why people like Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari have a problem with the whole thing. He said , “You’re having to make, essentially, forecasts that people take very seriously, and you can’t communicate just how uncertain you really are, because you have to put these handful of dots down.” Chair Jerome Powell has said over and over that the dot plot is not a promise or a plan. It’s just part of the broader Summary of Economic Projections. He says it’s not binding. But nobody listens. Wall Street still treats it like a statement of intent, not speculation. Kashkari even admitted at a Fed conference, “Most of the time, I really regret having to fill out the SEP. Once in a while, I’m really glad we have the SEP.” That’s the problem. The data’s being used in a way it wasn’t built for. People cling to the dot medians as if the economy will behave exactly how the Fed guessed, months in advance, with half the story missing. Officials consider scrapping the dot plot median This week might finally be the one that forces change. The Fed is already planning a review of how it communicates with the public. And this whole dot issue is front and center. The dot plot first came out in 2012, when interest rates were near zero. The goal back then was to show investors that rates would stay low for a while, to support the recovery. That made sense then. But now, with inflation , tariffs, and everything else flying around, it’s not helping anymore. Some officials want to drop the dot plot completely. Others don’t want to lose the transparency. Powell hinted earlier this year that they’re open to tweaking the format, maybe ditching the median number altogether. One idea that’s floating around is keeping the full spread of projections but using something called the “central tendency.” That means cutting out the three highest and lowest guesses, then showing the range in between. It gives the public a sense of where the Fed’s heads are at—without letting markets fixate on a single number like they do with the median. That would reduce the noise. Right now, one or two dots can move the whole median and send investors into a frenzy. Removing that could help calm things down, especially when officials themselves aren’t confident in their forecasts.

Despite near-term selling pressure, optimism re-emerged after the U.S. Senate approved the GENIUS Act, a watershed moment for stablecoin regulation in the United States. BREAKING : US Senate just passed the Stablecoin Bill! Programmable, on-chain, 1:1 digital cash with clear rules. Massive acceleration for crypto. Next up: House ☞ Trump signs. The U.S. is about to onboard the world. Bullish is an understatement pic.twitter.com/3zpD2xwT4i — matan | eO/ACC (@matan_si) June 17, 2025 The GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) Act passed with a 68-30 vote, making it the first federal law governing fiat-backed stablecoins. The bill enforces 1:1 reserve backing, mandatory audits, and licensing requirements for issuers. Notably, compliant stablecoins will operate outside SEC jurisdiction, a win for crypto innovation. This legal clarity is expected to encourage institutional adoption of stablecoins and create a more trusted environment for broader crypto participation. Senator Bill Hagerty praised the bill as a pivotal step toward making the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” Geopolitical Tensions Add Downside Risk Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East have kept traders on the defensive. The ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel intensified following statements by former President Trump, who demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender” in a social media post. Speculation around U.S. involvement continues to add uncertainty. GM to those who say it back! Where is Bitcoin headed in the next 12 hours?

Fed Decision Looms, Triangle Pattern Forms for Bitcoin Later today, the Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, but markets are watching for dovish clues in the accompanying forecast. A signal for rate cuts later in 2025 could weaken the dollar and support Bitcoin. Technically, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC/USD is compressing within a symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart, with key resistance at 106,658 and support at 103,431. The 50-EMA has flattened at 105,807, reinforcing a period of indecision. MACD momentum has turned negative, suggesting a bearish bias until a breakout confirms direction. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Trade Setup Sell Entry: Below 103,430 Target 1: 102,180 Target 2: 100,450 Stop-Loss: Above 105,800 This structure favors a short-term bearish play unless BTC decisively breaks above the upper trendline. Watch for a confirmed candle close outside the triangle with substantial volume before acting. As macro headlines and regulatory shifts collide, Bitcoin traders are watching closely—and preparing for volatility. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With BTC trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,233,406 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

Accordingly, Iran, which is at war with Israel, experienced a major hacking incident. Blockchain security expert ZachXBT said a hacker group targeted Iranian exchange Nobitex and threatened to leak data. ZachXBT reported that Iranian cryptocurrency exchange Nobitex was hacked by the “Gonjeshke Darande” group. The group claimed responsibility, accusing Nobitex of helping the Iranian regime finance terrorism and evading sanctions. “We, as 'Gonjeshke Darande', launched a cyber attack on Nobitex. These cyber attacks are the result of Nobitex being a major tool of the regime to finance terrorism and violate sanctions,” Group X said on its account. They threatened to release the exchange's internal data within 24 hours and warned users to withdraw their funds immediately. The hacker group said the remaining assets would be at risk, with ZahXBT reporting that more than $81.7 million worth of Nobitex’s cryptocurrencies were stolen. $48.6 million of that amount was stolen ZachXBT also reported that the hacker group uses the address “TKFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXy2r7mNX.” Nobitex confirmed that they detected unauthorized access to some of their hot wallets and the wallets were immediately suspended. “Security incident notification This morning, June 19th, our technical team detected signs of unauthorized access to parts of our reporting infrastructure and hot wallet. Immediately following detection, all access was suspended and our internal security teams are closely investigating the scope of the incident. We would like to remind you that users' assets are completely safe according to cold storage standards, and the above incident only affects some of the assets in hot wallets. Nobitex accepts full responsibility for this incident and assures users that all damages will be compensated through the insurance fund and Nobitex resources. “The website and app are temporarily unavailable until a full investigation is completed. More detailed information will be released to the public once the investigation is complete.” *This is not investment advice.

PEPE, DOGE, and the emerging XYZVerse are seizing the spotlight in the crypto arena. Enthusiasts and investors alike are watching closely to see which token will rise above the rest. The competition is fierce, and the outcome could reshape the digital currency landscape. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price : $0.0001 Price Now : $0.003333 Next Stage : $0.005 Final Presale Price : $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $14 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! PEPE: The Memecoin Frogging Its Way to the Top PEPE is a new memecoin that hopped onto the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by the famous Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s, PEPE aims to join the ranks of top meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a simple approach, it keeps things pure and fun. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw a huge surge. Its market cap reached $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires. This sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” with other memecoins pumping and dumping spectacularly. Looking ahead, PEPE has a three-phase roadmap. The first phase focuses on getting listed on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter. The second phase aims for listings on centralized exchanges. The third phase plans for “tier 1” exchange listings and a “meme takeover.” While PEPE lacks utility, its charm lies in its community and meme appeal. In the current market cycle, with many waiting for the next Bitcoin halving and a potential bull run, PEPE could ride the wave of meme enthusiasm. Compared to other coins, its simplicity and connection to a beloved meme might make it attractive to those looking for the next big thing in the crypto world. From Meme to Market: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a playful spin on cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it used the Shiba Inu meme for its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on its total supply. What began as a joke quickly turned serious when, in 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared. Social media buzz, especially tweets from Elon Musk, helped propel it into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its market value topping $50 billion. This showed how a strong community and online influence can shake up financial markets. Dogecoin’s technology is based on Litecoin, making transactions fast and cheap. Its abundance means it’s often used for tipping and small payments. While some see it as a novelty, others believe its active community could drive future growth. In the current market cycle, where established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum face competition from newer projects, Dogecoin stands out for its simplicity and widespread recognition. As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, Dogecoin could benefit from its friendly image and accessibility. However, like all cryptocurrencies, its value can be volatile, and it’s important to stay informed about market trends. Conclusion While PEPE and DOGE remain significant, XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports and meme culture, positioning itself as the standout meme coin capturing attention in 2025.

Trading activity for the coin has also collapsed by over 90%, on-chain data shows. The contradictory metrics has prompted some analysts to warn investors of immense sell pressures and a possible downward price action. According to updated data tracked on Piscan and exchange wallet dashboards on Wednesday, the total number of Pi coins stored across exchanges has grown from 263 million in March to 345 million in mid-June 2025. As of the latest reading, CEXs now collectively hold 346.8 million PI tokens. The rise in supply is against the backdrop of a decline in trading volume, falling from over $5.4 billion weekly in May to under $500 million this week. Exchange balances rise spells sell-side risk Detailed data from several top exchanges shows that OKX, ranked fourth on CoinMarketCap, currently holds over 28.5 million PI tokens, despite having a net outflow of 741,272 PI in the last 24 hours. Bitget, which holds the second-largest volume at 118.5 million PI, also recorded a negative 24-hour net flow of 171,036 coins. PI balance on CEX wallets. Source: Piscan Gate.io, with 163.2 million PI, is the highest among the observed CEX wallets, registering a 24-hour net outflow of over half a million coins. Overall, centralized exchange wallets processed more than 8 million PI in deposits and over 9.2 million in withdrawals in the past day alone. The withdrawals resulted in a net daily outflow of 1.13 million PI from CEXs, yet the total wallet holdings are still on the rise, even as new inflows arrive faster than existing withdrawals. The cumulative dollar value of PI stored on these exchanges now stands at approximately $187.9 million. Outflows from Pi Foundation wallets rattle community On the wallet activity scan, Pi Foundation team wallet address “GBQQRIQK…HJI25” offloaded 50 million PI in the last 24 hours, the single largest outgoing transaction recorded. This transaction was not offset by any corresponding incoming flow. Another Foundation wallet, “GAB7TEMP…4GC5G” received 50 million PI and sent out approximately 6.97 million, ending the day with a net positive flow of over 43 million tokens. These internal movements could be strategic reallocations, but the sheer scale of transactions and timing relative to falling market volume has sparked chatter of impending liquidity injections into exchanges. Altogether, the Pi Foundation and its associated wallets currently hold more than 72.5 billion PI tokens, valued at over $39.3 billion. Most remain inactive, but the selective movement of millions in PI tokens is contributing to anxiety about potential oversupply and price impact. Despite the on-chain warnings and chart-based bearish signals, the Pi Network’s dedicated community, known as Pioneers, is focused on the platform’s Global Consensus Value (GCV) of $314,159. Many community members view the market exchange price as unrepresentative of Pi’s true value, choosing instead to hold their assets or transact through the in-app barter system. Still, the current sentiment is of a community frustrated with the Core Team’s lack of visible progress. Weekly trading volume for PI has shrunk by more than 90% in a single month, dropping from $5.4 billion to less than $500 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Declines in volume often precede sharp corrections, especially in markets already flooded with tokens. $Pi is trading at $0.62 and is just getting hammer down with each $BTC dip. The strength & power to go up is gone with an always decreasing trading volume.

Its digital platform already facilitates repurchase agreements — a critical segment of short-term lending — under its “Digital Financing” and “Digital Debt Services” categories. JPMorgan Pilots JPMD Deposit Token on Base In a notable move toward onchain finance, JPMorgan announced the pilot launch of a deposit token named JPMD on Coinbase’s Base blockchain. The pilot program, expected to run for several months, will enable institutional clients of Coinbase to conduct transactions using JPMD once the initial testing phase concludes. Just a day before the announcement, JPMorgan filed a trademark application for JPMD , detailing a suite of crypto-related services, including trading, transfers, and payment processing. The development signals the bank’s deepening commitment to blockchain-based infrastructure and its ambitions to lead in digital asset innovation. No Stablecoin Plans, Deposit Tokens Seen as Superior The JPMD trademark filing stirred speculation that JPMorgan might collaborate with other large banks to launch a stablecoin. However, Naveen Mallela, an executive at Kinexys — the bank’s blockchain arm — clarified that the bank views deposit tokens as a more effective solution for institutions. He emphasized that tokenized deposits, unlike stablecoins, are fully integrated into traditional banking systems and are backed directly by customer bank deposits. These deposit tokens aim to deliver faster and more secure payments without the scalability issues associated with stablecoins’ fractional reserve models.

It also launched certain perpetual contracts with up to 50x leverage and announced upcoming delistings of select spot trading pairs. Additional Support for These Tokens The world’s biggest crypto exchange announced on its official website that clients can now use Official Trump (TRUMP), Sonic (S), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), SSV Network (SSV), Defi App (HOME), and Resolv (RESOLV) as loanable assets on Binance Loans. Such tokens refer to cryptocurrencies that users can either borrow or use as collateral to borrow other assets. There are two subdivisions of that section: coins that all customers have access to and VIP Loan (designated for high-volume or institutional clients). Despite the support, all newly added cryptocurrencies to that list remain in the red zone. RESOLV has suffered the biggest decline in the past 24 hours, with its price plunging by 13%. The popular meme coins TRUMP and PNUT are down 3% and 4%, respectively, within this timeframe. The downtrend coincides with the overall slump of the entire cryptocurrency sector, whose market capitalization dipped to $3.35 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly plunged to approximately $103,600, while Ethereum (ETH) is fighting to stay above $2,500. The Recent Listings/Delistings Besides adjusting its Binance Loans section, the company expanded the list of trading choices on Binance Futures. It launched the MYX/USDT and MYX/FUSDT perpetual contracts with up to 50x leverage. These products enable users to bet on the price of the aforementioned cryptocurrency wit hout owning it, and have no expiration date. MYX Finance (MYX) reacted positively to the news, with its valuation soaring by 12% and reaching almost $0.10. However, its market capitalization remains insignificant at less than $12 million. MYX Price, Source: CoinGecko On the contrary, Binance announced some delisting efforts. It will remove the trading pairs CATI/FDUSD, ONE/BTC, and TLM/FDUSD on June 20 . “The delisting of a spot trading pair does not affect the availability of the tokens on Binance Spot. Users can still trade the spot trading pair’s base and quote assets on other trading pair(s) that are available on Binance,” the company clarified.

This brings the company’s total holdings to a total of 1,653 BTC. In an official press release , The Blockchain Group declared that it has acquired a combined total of 182 BTC ( BTC ) in the time period from May 26 to June 12. Most of the proceedings used to buy more Bitcoin came from the completion of the company’s recent convertible bond issuance, amounting to approximately $19.6 million. The Blockchain Group’s latest purchase brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 1,653 BTC. Not only that, the company also declared that its generated BTC yield from its holdings has jumped 1,173% this year. After the recent purchase, the company added that there still exists one subscription left from its previous shares issuance that has not been redeemed yet. The subscription was made by TOBAM and Adam Back, and is worth around $7.31 million, which could be used to purchase another 70 BTC. Once the shares are redeemed, this could potentially raise the company’s current BTC holdings to 1,723 BTC.

Just a day prior, the company managed to raise as much $7.7 million that it has allocated to buy more BTC for its treasury. The funding was secured through an “At-The-Market type” capital raise with asset manager TOBAM, where 1.6 million new shares were issued at an average price of 4.49 euros. Since Bitcoin reached a new all-time high in May, many corporations have been accelerating their Bitcoin acquisition strategy, hiking up institutional demand for the digital asset. The Blockchain Group was one of the early adopters, having accumulated BTC holdings since November 2024. At the time, it had become the first European company to start a Bitcoin Treasury. Most recently, the Norwegian digital asset firm K33 announced that it will be issuing a round of new shares to raise enough capital to purchase 1,000 BTC.

At the time of writing, XRP trades at approximately $2.14, and according to the analyst’s chart, a major breakout is imminent , possibly ushering in what he calls an “XRP Summer.” Echoes of the 2017 Bull Run WatersAbove’s analysis points to a striking resemblance between XRP’s current market structure and its historical price action leading up to the explosive 2017 rally. His chart outlines an extended consolidation phase similar to the one that preceded XRP’s climb from under a penny to over $3.30. The current pattern also spans 182 bars, about 18 months, mirroring the time XRP spent ranging before its last parabolic breakout. The chart places XRP in the early stages of a large wave 3 within an Elliott Wave structure, suggesting that the most aggressive phase of the cycle is yet to unfold. A marked label on the chart—“We are here”—indicates that XRP is positioned right before the historical liftoff point, with a massive upward move labeled as “This comes next.” The projection targets $15 , a level supported by long-term Fibonacci extensions and historical fractals. Dear #XRPArmy we're about to get an ' XRP Summer ' $15 XRP by July 24th 2025 pic.twitter.com/hv5GcO4FPZ — WatersAbove (@WatersAbve) June 8, 2025 A $15 Price Target: Ambitious Yet Grounded A move from $2.14 to $15 represents an approximate 600% increase, and while it may sound lofty, it is not without precedent in crypto market dynamics. XRP has a history of rapid price acceleration once it breaks through major resistance levels. WatersAbove’s forecast suggests the breakout could be swift, potentially reaching the $15 target in just over a month. This timeline aligns with cyclical patterns observed in past XRP bull runs and coincides with a broader shift in market sentiment as liquidity and interest return to the crypto space. Historical chart behavior suggests that once XRP clears its current resistance zones around $3.30, price discovery could resume at full speed. Strengthening Market Foundations Beyond technicals, the XRP ecosystem has grown significantly, with increasing adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in areas such as tokenized assets, institutional finance, and payment infrastructure. The growing use of XRPL’s decentralized features are enhancing the token’s utility and reinforcing its market appeal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These developments add fundamental weight to the technical picture, creating a favorable backdrop for the kind of rally WatersAbove is projecting. XRP’s strong community base, combined with rising on-chain activity and broader crypto momentum, further supports the case for a breakout. The Path Ahead With the chart drawing a clear parallel between XRP’s current posture and its historic rise, the market appears to be on the verge of what the analyst describes as an “XRP Summer.” The $15 target may be bold, but it is anchored in a repeatable pattern that has already played out in XRP’s history. As July 24 approaches, eyes will be on XRP to see if this forecast becomes reality. Whether or not the exact timeline holds, the energy in the market suggests that a significant move may not be far off.

Key Takeaways: ARK Invest has sold nearly $100 million worth of Circle shares in just two days. The firm’s divestment now totals over 640,000 shares, or 14% of its original stake. Despite bullish legislation, Circle’s stock dipped as ARK remained the only major backer reducing exposure. The move brings its two-day total to nearly $100 million, raising questions about the investment firm’s confidence in the USDC stablecoin issuer and the broader crypto market amid worsening geopolitical tensions. Previously, the firm sold 342,658 shares of Circle on Monday, valued at roughly $51.7 million. ARK Invest Sells 300K Circle Shares Across Three Flagship ETFs According to trade notifications , ARK sold 300,108 shares across its three major ETFs — ARK Innovation (ARKK), Next Generation Internet (ARKW), and Fintech Innovation (ARKF). ARKK accounted for the largest sale with over 208,000 shares, while ARKW and ARKF offloaded smaller portions. The timing of the sale came as Circle’s stock fell 1.3% on the day, closing at $149 after briefly trading above $165 the day prior. That drop followed the Senate’s passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill , a legislative win that many expected to support the stablecoin industry. So far, ARK is the only major Circle investor to significantly reduce exposure post-IPO. Other backers, including BlackRock, reportedly eyeing a 10% stake in the company, have not disclosed any sales.

At that time, the firm’s investment was valued at over $373 million. Trump’s Iran Threats Shake Crypto Markets The sell-off arrives as the crypto market slipped Tuesday after US President Donald Trump issued a direct threat toward Iran’s supreme leader, sparking fears of broader geopolitical instability. Trump posted on Truth Social that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was a “target” but would not be “taken out… at least not for now,” amid rising tensions between Iran and Israel.

Sentiment metrics shifted sharply as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell from “Greed” to “Neutral” for the first time in nearly two weeks. The market appears sensitive to any escalation involving Iran, especially with continued hostilities between Tehran and Tel Aviv. Since returning to the presidency in early 2025, Trump’s actions — including a tariff order in February — have triggered both dips and rallies.

Key Takeaways: K33 is raising at least $9 million to buy Bitcoin and strengthen its balance sheet. The firm aims to reach a 1,000 BTC target as part of its broader treasury strategy. Direct Bitcoin holdings are expected to boost K33’s margins and attract institutional clients. The offering, managed by Pareto Securities AS, sets the share price at SEK 0.1036 and allows for an open-ended raise beyond the minimum amount, according to a Wednesday press release . The move is part of K33’s broader strategy to solidify its financial foundation and gain long-term exposure to Bitcoin, while enhancing its operational strength as a brokerage platform. K33 Advances Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy After May 28 Disclosure K33’s initiative follows a May 28 announcement detailing a dedicated BTC accumulation strategy. By holding Bitcoin directly, the firm aims to unlock operational leverage that would improve profit margins, enable new product lines, and bolster appeal to institutional partners. The company believes this approach will fuel scalable growth without exposing the acquired BTC to risk. The directed share issue offers quick access to capital, allowing K33 to respond swiftly to favorable market opportunities while bringing in strategically aligned investors. CEO Torbjørn Bull Jenssen said that the financing round marks a major step toward the company’s near-term target of acquiring 1,000 BTC. “We strongly believe that Bitcoin represents the future of global finance and are positioning K33 to benefit maximally from this,” said Jenssen. “A strong balance sheet built on Bitcoin enables us to significantly improve our brokerage operation while maintaining full exposure to Bitcoin’s upside potential.” The company has not set an upper limit for the raise, giving it flexibility to expand its BTC reserves further should demand from investors allow. The board retains the discretion to introduce a maximum offer size at a later stage.

VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

OpenPayd, a financial infrastructure provider that processes more than €130 billion annually, has partnered with Circle, the issuer of USD Coin ( USDC ). The partnership will let OpenPayd’s clients easily send and manage money worldwide using both traditional banks and blockchain networks. By leveraging Circle’s scalable, programmable stablecoin infrastructure and wallets, OpenPayd’s clients can quickly convert between regular currencies and USDC, gaining faster access to funds, lower fees, and new ways to handle payments, treasury, and digital assets. “Stablecoins will be foundational to the next era of financial services, and our partnership with Circle positions us, and our clients, at the centre of that transformation,” said Iana Dimitrova, chief executive of OpenPayd. You might also like: iPhone moment incoming? Circle CEO says stablecoins are almost there The development is part of Circle’s ongoing efforts to broaden USDC’s adoption and real-world use. Most notably, Circle recently integrated its stablecoin natively on the XRP Ledger, allowing developers, institutions, and users to access it directly on the network, without resorting to bridging. In another major development, Circle partnered with Latin America’s largest digital bank, Nubank, to launch a 4% annual rewards program for USDC holders at the start of this year. Nubank noted that more than 50% of new crypto users on its platform chose USDC as their first digital asset. Despite these ongoing efforts to increase USDC adoption, some early investors have already begun offloading Circle’s shares following its IPO.

The token has entered a consolidation phase following a rally earlier this week and is testing key support amid mounting ETF optimism. Market sentiment remains broadly neutral-to-positive: on-chain activity and ecosystem growth support confidence, even as geopolitical jitters trigger short-term volatility. In times when many altcoins are struggling to find a base, Solana is quietly attracting major investor attention. As per some reports, nearly $135 million worth of assets has been bridged from the other chains to Solana in the past 7 days. This also includes more than $70 million from Ethereum alone. This also suggests the growing cross-chain confidence and increasing utility. Ethereum-to-Solana flows leading the charge underscore shifting liquidity trends. This could be a major bullish signal for the SOL price ahead of the ETF approval. Solana Sustains Within a Bullish Structure Over the past couple of days, the SOL price has been facing huge bearish pressure as the sell-offs escalate, bringing the price close to $145. The token is forming consecutive lower highs and lows, hence displaying the rising dominance of the bears. Although the token is believed to maintain a descending trend and reach out to the local support, it remains within a huge bullish pattern. As seen in the above chart, the SOL price is trading within a massive cup & handle pattern wherein the selling pressure is yet to fade. Besides, the CMF has remained stuck below the average since the start of the month, suggesting no major money flow into the token. On the other hand, the RSI is heading towards the lower threshold, dragging the SOL price close to $143 or $140, which could act as a base to trigger a rebound. If it fails to do so, the price may test the support of the channel at $133, which is one of the most pivotal ranges. Therefore, the hopes for a strong upswing continue to remain high for the Solana (SOL) price rally as long as the support at $133 is held strongly.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 12:19:32

33767162,[object Object],1750249239,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,GENIUS Bill Passed Senate as Bessent Predicts $2T Stablecoin Market; Best Wallet Shines,https://bitcoinist.com/genius-stablecoin-bill-passes-join-best-wallet/,"Yesterday, in a 68–30 vote, the US Senate passed the GENIUS Act – the first significant legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins. Following this news, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated his belief that the dollar-linked stablecoin market could hit an eye-watering $2T . But with regulation comes new rules, coupled with increased government oversight. If you care about safeguarding your digital footprint, anonymous crypto wallets like Best Wallet are worth checking out as the crypto landscape shifts. These non-custodial solutions grant you complete ownership of your digital assets, eliminating the need for centralized control. Stablecoins Face Tighter Rules Under GENIUS Act So, what’s this new crypto bill all about? The GENIUS Act is short for ‘Guaranteeing Essential National Infrastructure Using Stablecoins.’ It aims to bring stability, transparency, and guardrails to the crypto industry, which traditionally operates in a gray area. If the House agrees on the final version, it heads to President Trump’s desk before August. Should everything go as planned, the bill will mark one of the most significant signs that the US is genuinely committed to crypto assets. Under the new law, only licensed institutions will be able to issue stablecoins. Large issuers with $10B+ in market capitalization will be required to transition to regulation under a comptroller or file a new application for further conditional approval with the appropriate Federal regulator. Meanwhile, smaller players must operate under pre-approved state frameworks. All payment stablecoins must be backed 1:1 by high-quality liquid assets, such as Treasury bills, notes, or bonds. Moreover, issuers will be required to publish monthly reserve disclosures, segregate customer funds from company operations, and comply with anti-money laundering rules, including customer ID checks and suspicious activity reports. Yield-bearing stablecoins are a no-go. The Treasury will standardize reserve audits, whereas the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will get limited enforcement power in the spot market. GENIUS Act Sparks Concerns Over Privacy & Political Influence Supporters believe the bill has what it takes to increase global trust in fiat-backed digital assets and boost demand for US Treasuries. What’s more, SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci stated that regulated stablecoins could eliminate up to $7T in global transaction costs . On the flip side, Senator Elizabeth Warren warns that, if the bill passes, it ‘would enable Trump’s egregious corruption.’ She also fought back by saying that ‘it would mean easier access to money for terrorists and drug cartels.’The bill hasn’t been without its woes, period. It initially stalled in May after Democrats raised alarm bells over national security risks and potential loopholes. Fears significantly intensified when reports surfaced about an Abu Dhabi firm planning to invest in Binance using the stablecoin tied to Trump’s World Liberty Financial crypto venture. Foreign capital being able to flow into a major exchange through a politically-linked digital asset raised concerns about regulatory oversight and potential conflicts of interest. But after weeks of negotiations, lawmakers agreed on key revisions: tighter ethics rules for officials who hold stablecoins, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank customers, and a new Treasury mandate to monitor suspicious activity. Such changes helped secure enough Democratic support for the bill to move forward. Still, problems related to centralized control – including privacy, censorship, and single points of failure – remain key concerns for everyday crypto users. This is where emerging privacy-oriented solutions, like Best Wallet , come in. The fully decentralized, non-custodial crypto wallet puts you in control of your digital assets, free from government oversight and third-party interference. Shield Against Government Crypto Control With Best Wallet Digital freedom shouldn’t come at the cost of control or privacy. Best Wallet takes this into consideration and provides an answer to growing centralization concerns. Upon making a Best Wallet account, you have full access to your private keys and, thus, full ownership of your digital assets. Plus, you can sign up for an account and swap crypto pairs without KYC verification . The mobile app supports stablecoins like $USDT, as well as major cryptocurrencies like $BTC and $ETH, and even the best crypto presales . In total, it supports 1K+ digital assets across major networks like Ethereum, Bitcoin, BSC, Base, and Polygon. The app will soon expand its coverage to 60+ blockchains. As such, it provides you with the freedom to explore, trade, and manage an extensive crypto portfolio in one place. Thanks to its Cross-Chain Swap feature, you also get access to 30 cross-chain bridges, ensuring the best possible swap rates with minimal fees. You can also rest easy knowing the app is built with security in mind. Best Wallet uses advanced Fireblocks MPC technology to protect your assets from key vulnerabilities, breaches, and hacks. You can also create secure cloud backups of your multi-chain wallets, which eliminates the need for seed phrases . This is a major win in itself. In 2024, nearly 70% of all stolen crypto funds were the result of infrastructure breaches, mostly due to compromised private keys and seed phrases. And at the core of the app’s ecosystem is $BEST , the wallet’s native token. It unlocks lower transaction fees, staking rights (currently at a hefty 104% APY), and even governance rights on the platform. Most importantly, Best Wallet is a work in progress, and the app is constantly rolling out updates to stay competitive in the crypto market. There’s already much to look forward to in the pipeline. One of the most exciting developments is Best Card, a crypto debit card that will soon enable you to spend your digital assets in everyday life – a must-have for a crypto-forward future. $BEST Opens Possible 185% Gains Amid Stablecoin Reform The GENIUS Act signals a historic shift: crypto is on the brink of being officially accepted into US legislation. While regulation could bring trust and transparency to stablecoins, it also means deeper government control, surveillance, and barriers to entry. If you value privacy in digital ownership, non-custodial crypto wallets like Best Wallet are a great way to stay in control of your virtual assets – away from centralized intermediaries. To maximize the benefits of the Best Wallet ecosystem, you can purchase $BEST on presale for as low as $0.025195. If US crypto regulations remain favorable, the Best Wallet Token could reach $0.072 this year . Compared to its current price, this represents potential gains of up to 185%.

According to Arkham Intelligence data, on June 17, BlackRock purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ). The acquisition is part of a broader accumulation streak that has now spanned six consecutive days, bringing the firm’s total Bitcoin investment during this period to $1.4 billion.

BlackRock has now bought BTC for 6 days in a row. pic.twitter.com/VjbtlcSGk9 — Arkham (@arkham) June 17, 2025 The buying spree comes alongside a wave of inflows into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has consistently led all spot Bitcoin ETFs in net inflows over the past week. On the same day as its latest BTC purchase, IBIT recorded approximately $639.2 million in net inflows, even as other major issuers like Fidelity, ARK, and Bitwise posted significant outflows. The strong influx of funds and steady buying also follow a major milestone for IBIT, which recently became the fastest exchange-traded fund in history to surpass $70 billion in assets under management (AUM). The fund reached that mark in just 341 days, crushing the previous record of 1,691 days set by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF.

With the latest purchases, IBIT now manages approximately $74.8 billion in assets and holds 670,295 Bitcoin in its portfolio. Beyond BlackRock, several traditional financial heavyweights are also doubling down on Bitcoin. Strategy, the largest corporate holder of BTC, recently made a $1.05 billion purchase , reinforcing its long-term bullish stance.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana Strategies has planned to raise $1 billion to boost the ecosystem. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 50.24% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world.

The RSI near 40.12 hints at the lack of strong momentum for a recovery. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight. Potential High: $190 Average Price Range: $165 Potential Low: $140 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the derivatives market with $6.56B in open interest, far surpassing other altcoins. The heatmap and high trader positioning signal elevated volatility ahead. Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

Here’s the Destination,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-abruptly-moved-200m-xrp-amid-settlement-brouhaha-heres-the-destination/,"On June 18, 2025, Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain transaction tracker, reported that Ripple transferred 200 million XRP, valued at approximately $438,999,244 at the time of execution, to an unidentified wallet. The movement was detected and broadcast via social media, where it gained additional attention following commentary from crypto influencer Amelie. The transfer occurred during a period of heightened scrutiny of Ripple’s activities, particularly as the company continues to face regulatory and public pressure related to its ongoing legal matters. Amelie published a tweet in response to the event, highlighting the precise amount and origin of the transfer. She stated that the funds were moved “from Ripple themselves” and questioned the purpose of the transfer, which lacked any accompanying explanation from Ripple. The transaction was verified via Whale Alert’s transaction monitoring interface and linked to the XRP Ledger . The recipient address has not been publicly linked to any exchange, custodian, or partner institution, intensifying uncertainty about its role.

WHAT IS GOING ON? https://t.co/sYU2WtHCvQ pic.twitter.com/5WmiSWTPsN — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) June 17, 2025 Criticism of Ripple’s Operational Transparency The community’s response to Amelie’s post included concerns over transparency and trust. A user identified as CKS questioned the logic of holding XRP while Ripple continually liquidates its holdings. The user expressed doubt about the company’s intentions and suggested that Ripple’s ongoing activity in the market contradicts the interests of XRP holders. Another user, Economicswizard, commented that the identity of the recipient wallet should be publicly disclosed, describing the lack of information as “shady.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Although Ripple routinely conducts monthly sales or redistributions from its XRP holdings , the lack of a formal announcement or designation for this particular transfer has prompted speculation. Neither Ripple nor any affiliated personnel has issued a clarification regarding the destination of the 200 million XRP. Blockchain records confirm that the receiving wallet has no known prior association with centralized exchanges or previously identified Ripple partner addresses. Ongoing Context: Legal and Regulatory Pressures Remain in Focus The transfer arrives during a critical legal phase involving Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although both parties finalized and signed a settlement agreement—Ripple on April 23, 2025, and the SEC on May 8 —they are still awaiting approval from the district court. A joint motion under Rule 60(b) was filed on June 12 , seeking a ruling to allow the case to return from appeal for judgment modification. Presently, the Court of Appeals has paused proceedings until Judge Torres rules on the motion. Amid this unresolved process, market participants have been closely tracking Ripple’s movements. The lack of a clear explanation for the $438 million XRP transfer has led some to question whether the transaction relates to the pending settlement, internal liquidity management, or other undisclosed obligations. At the time of writing, no additional information has been made available about the receiving wallet or the reason for the $438 million equivalent transfer. As the blockchain ledger only records wallet addresses and amounts, further identification requires a statement from Ripple or the involvement of investigative tracking services.

Not because $28m is a monumental figure in the context of crypto fundraising (it isn’t), but because of the fund’s many links to Stanford University. Founded by three Stanford graduates – Gil Rosen, Kun Peng, and Steven Willinger – it’s no exaggeration to say that Blockchain Builders bloomed from the corridors of the private research university. Indeed, the phrase “Stanford blockchain ecosystem” got plenty of play when the fund launched, a reference to things like the Center for Blockchain Research, the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, and the BASS (Blockchain Application Stanford Summit) conference series. So, what does all of this mean? Why should we care that Stanford’s become a hub of blockchain research and innovation, and that the endeavors of its crypto community have led to the creation of a seven-figure fundraising chest? From Bold Visions to Real-World Applications Well, for starters, the very fact that one of the world’s most respected research institutions is turning its gaze to blockchain is a boon for the Web3 space. Between entrepreneurship courses and accelerators, Stanford is turning into a pipeline for crypto innovation. It also represents a proving ground for university involvement in the industry, giving rise to the possibility of prominent education institutions investing in Web3 firms and tech directly. In fact, reference has already been made to expansion of this nature: while the $28m chest was dubbed Fund I, and dedicated to investing in pre-seed and seed-stage blockchain ventures mostly focused on Stanford’s community, Fund II will support the new IC3-Cornell Blockchain Accelerator , “an initiative designed to transform bold ideas into real-world applications.” Interestingly, this research-driven program includes faculty members of Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Princeton, Yale, and University College London (UCL). In other words, some of the brightest minds in the university system are collaborating on developing blockchain-based solutions; on taking proof-of-concepts to the real world. Given academic institutions are already accustomed to deploying capital for various initiatives, it’s not a stretch to imagine them leveraging their talent pool and deep pockets to finance the next wave of Web3 innovation. We can only guess at how impactful this might be, though Blockchain Builders itself has already funded some exciting cutting-edge projects, from decentralized AI operating system 0g (co-founded by Stanford graduate students Michael Heinrich and Thomas Yao) to Nexus Labs, a decentralized network for verifiable cloud computing created by Stanford graduate Daniel Marin. The Institutions Have Arrived Institutional funding, of course, is already pushing the crypto industry forward: inflows from tradfi investors have poured into bitcoin and ether since the approval of spot ETFs last year. Market participants previously immune to crypto’s charms are now making digital assets a fixture of their portfolios. Meanwhile, the SEC is sifting through dozens of altcoin ETF applications. Last month, BTC funds attracted a net $5.5 billion while ETH funds posted a net $890 million per Coinshares data . All told, the value of crypto fund assets hit $167 billion in May, a sure sign that the industry is breaking new ground. Academic research into blockchain is one thing, but if the growth of the Stanford crypto ecosystem is any indication, initiatives with a financial focus could be the industry’s next major funding driver. Particularly if the richest Ivy League universities are behind them. Just as the arrival of ETFs legitimized digital assets in the eyes of many, the increased involvement of august institutions like Stanford and their scholars has strengthened their appeal.

Furthermore, they will contribute verifiable, permissioned datasets, and experiment with innovative attribution frameworks, says the announcement. Moreover, to encourage all this, OpenLedger will offer grants for “standout model development and valuable data contributions.” The participating individuals will also be earning onchain rewards for their contributions. Meanwhile, the models they build will have immediate utility across industries, OpenLedger claims. “From decentralized finance and predictive healthcare to autonomous governance and smart cities, the collaboration focuses on high-impact sectors where accuracy, transparency, and public accountability aren’t optional, they’re mission-critical,” it says.

Pan said China will establish an international operation center for the digital RMB. This is to promote the international use of digital currency, strengthen financial market services, and support widespread digital finance innovations. Blockchain development in this area extends a wider trend, bringing tech capabilities for financial advancement. Pan Gongsheng highlights China’s position at the forefront of digital currency innovation The Lujiazui Forum , an event in the financial industry organized by China’s leading financial regulators and the Shanghai municipal government, focused on “financial opening-up and cooperation for high-quality development in a changing global economy.” During the event, key central financial regulators were expected to unveil important financial policies. Officials from top regulatory bodies like the National Financial Regulatory Administration and the China Securities Regulatory Commission attended. Notable speakers included Pan Gongsheng, Zhu Hexin (Deputy Governor of the PBoC and Director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange), Li Yunze (Minister of the National Financial Regulatory Administration), and Wu Qing (Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission). Pan delivered a keynote address that blockchain speeds up the growth of stablecoins and changes cross-border payments. According to him, this technology is changing traditional systems by allowing instant settlements. However, the governor of the People’s Bank of China highlighted that the system also brings new challenges for regulations. The upgrade concerns smart contracts and decentralized finance, indicating an interest in moving payment systems forward without being dependent on traditional systems. Zhou Xiaoquan, the executive deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, said that Shanghai will support central financial regulators to enhance China’s high-level financial openness gradually. The central bank’s digital currency stablecoin was also mentioned, which is believed to facilitate cross-border payments. Li Kexin, the deputy director of the PBoC’s general office, mentioned at a press conference in late May that the central bank is speeding up its efforts to boost policy reserves. This move aims to strengthen Shanghai’s position as an international financial center. Even with these important announcements, other global financial organizations did not give any direct replies. However, the spotlight on blockchain still continues to highlight China’s position at the forefront of digital currency innovation, according to the official agenda of the Lujiazui Forum. China’s innovation in crypto solidifies its position as a fintech leader in Asia China has a long history of leading in digital finance. Events like those held in Lujiazui often highlight important progress in blockchain and digital currency, strengthening China’s position as an Asian fintech leader. The Lujiazui Forum has shown how China’s financial growth has progressed for many years. The terms “reform” and “opening up” are important topics at the forum, featuring in the themes of almost half of its past sessions. As stakeholders, industry leaders and researchers discuss their views and ideas at the forum, they address concerns on how to handle the global financial crisis, ways for the financial sector to support the real economy better, issues with liquidity in Chinese banks, and methods to avoid systemic risks, among others. Analysts believe shifting to blockchain for payments might increase trust among institutions in cryptocurrency systems. This has the potential to develop stablecoins and is a strategic move for financial modernization in China. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

WIF and BONK are making significant moves on Solana, hinting at possible growth. On Ethereum, AI advancements are catching attention. Meanwhile, XRP has its sights set on a higher price range, raising eyebrows among investors. With fresh projects like Codename:Pepe, the meme coin market is buzzing with potential. Codename:Pepe emerges as a new player, promising to redefine meme coin dynamics using artificial intelligence. As investors explore high-risk, high-reward options, this coin aims to deliver substantial gains. Its community-driven approach could see it achieve extraordinary growth. As markets evolve and excitement builds, all eyes are on these intriguing developments in the world of crypto. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, two of the most prominent trends today. Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use ""AI"" as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility, while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Codename:Pepe stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Codename:Pepe is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform. According to its developers, the project’s AI framework will be able to: Identify Emerging Meme Coins: By constantly monitoring social media and on-chain activity, Codename:Pepe spots early trends and high-potential tokens before they gain mainstream attention. Analyze Market Sentiment: AI-driven algorithms evaluate discussions, hype levels, and whale movements to determine which coins have the most momentum. Provide Actionable Trading Insights: Generates AI-backed forecasts, risk assessments, and early buy/sell signals to maximize trading efficiency. Optimize Auto-Trading Strategies: Uses real-time data to adjust automated trading strategies, ensuring adaptability in fast-moving market conditions. The development team behind Codename:Pepe is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Codename:Pepe has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices. The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token was offered at $0.003333333. It goes through 28 stages, and its price increases incrementally. Those who buy $AGNT earlier get a bigger discount. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Codename:Pepe combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market: AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Dogwifhat: The Meme Coin Turning Heads in 2025's Crypto Market Dogwifhat (WIF) is a Solana-based meme coin gaining attention in 2025. Without a specific function, its value comes from community interest and market sentiment. With a limited supply of over 998 million tokens, it's viewed as a digital collectible. Since its start in December 2023, Dogwifhat has seen wild price swings. It hit a high of $4.85 in March 2024 but also dropped to a low of $0.0677. These fluctuations highlight the volatile nature of meme coins. Analysts have mixed views but often lean positive. Some predict Dogwifhat could reach $7.64 by 2030, with higher estimates up to $16.65 in 2025. These outlooks depend on ongoing community support. Though lacking utility, Dogwifhat's strength is its community and meme appeal. In today's market, sentiment matters, and WIF may draw investors. However, without features like token burning or staking, growth could be limited. Dogwifhat's future in 2025 is uncertain but intriguing. While facing challenges due to speculation, a strong community might push it higher. Investors should be cautious, considering its volatile history and the factors affecting meme coins. BONK Coin: Is the Solana-Powered Meme Token Ready to Soar in 2025? Bonk (BONK) is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain. Unlike many meme coins that run on Ethereum, BONK leverages Solana's fast and low-cost transactions. This makes it an attractive option for users seeking quick payments and liquidity on the Solana network. Since its release in December 2022, BONK saw a significant surge in price alongside SOL. By 2025, the coin has experienced substantial growth, drawing attention from investors and crypto enthusiasts. However, its anonymous founders and a basic white paper have raised concerns among some experts. Supporters like Subhash Chandra believe BONK has room to grow, especially with the anticipated crypto bull market. They see ongoing giveaways and promotions as ways to attract new users and boost the coin's adoption on Solana. Critics like Peter Henn point to the lack of transparency and detailed plans as reasons to be cautious. Looking ahead, forecasts suggest BONK could continue its upward trend. Predictions for 2025 range from a low of $0.000036 to a high of $0.00009368. While these are optimistic, the coin's future will depend on market conditions and its ability to build trust within the community. In the current market cycle, BONK presents both opportunities and risks. Its alignment with Solana's growing ecosystem could propel it forward. However, potential investors should carefully consider the coin's fundamentals and the volatile nature of meme coins. Ethereum in 2025: The Future of Decentralized Innovation Ethereum is a blockchain platform that powers decentralized applications, or dApps, using smart contracts. These smart contracts run without central control, allowing secure and transparent transactions across industries. Ethereum's uniqueness lies in its vast ecosystem of tokens and applications. Developers can create tokens, enabling digital assets like stablecoins and governance tokens. Transactions still require Ether (ETH) for fees. Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has grown significantly. The shift to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 reduced energy use and set the stage for upgrades. Sharding, aiming to improve scalability, promises faster, cheaper transactions. In 2025, Ethereum remains a leading platform for innovation. Its ongoing development and adoption suggest strong potential. Investors see promise in its technology and the demand for decentralized solutions. Analysts predict Ethereum's advancements could drive its value higher. With improvements and a robust ecosystem, it may continue to be attractive in the digital landscape. Conclusion WIF, BONK, and Ethereum have shown activity, but their short-term potential appears limited. Market conditions suggest these coins may not deliver significant gains in the immediate future. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto stands out by unleashing true intelligence for maximum profits. It employs artificial intelligence to identify promising meme coins, predict market trends, and provide exclusive AI-powered trading signals. With a community-driven approach and a capped supply of 5 billion tokens, Codename:Pepe crypto positions itself as the next meme coin poised for substantial growth.

Recently, observers have noted a fascinating shift in Bitcoin’s typical correlation patterns. Despite a backdrop of rising geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable stability, diverging from its usual behavior as a purely risk-on or risk-off asset. This unexpected resilience is a key point in understanding the current Bitcoin price analysis . Understanding Current Bitcoin Holder Behavior A significant factor contributing to Bitcoin’s current stability lies within the actions of its long-term investors. According to insights highlighted by Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, and reported by CoinDesk, extensive blockchain data indicates that seasoned BTC holders are largely maintaining their positions. There are minimal signs of widespread profit-taking, even as Bitcoin’s price has seen recent gains. This steadfast Bitcoin holder behavior is a powerful signal, suggesting conviction rather than caution among those who have held BTC through various market cycles. They aren’t just holding; they appear to be accumulating or at least refraining from selling into strength, which removes significant selling pressure from the market. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market Outlook? This observed reluctance of long-term holders to sell is a crucial piece of the puzzle when assessing the broader Bitcoin market outlook . When large portions of the supply are held off-market by conviction holders, it naturally reduces the available supply for trading. This dynamic contributes directly to the ongoing period of price consolidation we are witnessing. Instead of volatile swings driven by quick profit-taking, the market is absorbing demand without a corresponding flood of sell orders from established participants. This consolidation phase, while potentially frustrating for short-term traders, is often viewed by analysts as a necessary period of building a strong base before a potential significant price move. Key takeaways from the current market structure: Reduced Selling Pressure: Long-term holders acting as ‘HODLers’ limit the supply entering the market. Price Consolidation: Demand is being met without significant price drops, leading to sideways movement. Foundation Building: This period allows the market to establish support levels and prepare for future moves. Divergence from Risk Assets: Bitcoin’s stability amidst geopolitical tension suggests maturity or unique market drivers. Is a Crypto Market Q3 Breakout on the Horizon? The stable foundation built during this consolidation phase, underpinned by strong Bitcoin holder behavior , has led many analysts, including Kuptsikevich, to eye the third quarter of the year for a potential breakout. The theory is that this prolonged period of stability is coiling like a spring. When a catalyst eventually arrives – whether it’s positive macroeconomic news, increased institutional adoption, or a significant technical level being breached – the reduced selling pressure from holders could allow the price to move upward more freely and rapidly. The Crypto market Q3 outlook is becoming a focal point for investors hoping for renewed bullish momentum. Potential catalysts for a Q3 move could include: Positive developments around Bitcoin Spot ETFs (flow data, new approvals). Changes in global monetary policy (e.g., interest rate decisions). Increased corporate or institutional investment announcements. Significant technical chart patterns completing their formation. Positive regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions. Considering Your BTC Price Prediction Strategy Given the current dynamics, what should investors consider when formulating their BTC price prediction or investment strategy? While no one can predict the future with certainty, the current market structure provides valuable clues. The strength shown by holders suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. However, potential challenges remain. Challenges to a Q3 Breakout Despite the optimistic signs, several factors could challenge or delay a potential breakout: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Unexpected global economic downturns or market crashes could still impact risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty: Negative regulatory news from major countries could dampen sentiment. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events could disrupt market stability. Whale Activity: While long-term holders are strong, concentrated selling from large individual or institutional wallets could still occur. Actionable Insights for Investors Based on this analysis, here are some points to consider: Monitor Holder Data: Keep an eye on on-chain metrics related to long-term holder supply and accumulation trends. Watch Key Technical Levels: Identify significant support and resistance levels that could signal the start of a breakout or breakdown. Stay Informed on Macro Events: Global economic and geopolitical developments can still influence the crypto market. Consider Your Time Horizon: The current environment seems favorable for those with a longer-term perspective, aligning with holder behavior. Risk Management: As always, invest only what you can afford to lose and consider diversification. Summary: Poised for Potential? In conclusion, the current Bitcoin price analysis reveals a market in consolidation, heavily influenced by the unwavering commitment of long-term holders. This strong Bitcoin holder behavior is providing a stable base, potentially setting the stage for a significant move. While the exact timing and direction are never guaranteed, the prevailing Bitcoin market outlook , supported by the potential for catalysts in the Crypto market Q3 , suggests that a breakout is a distinct possibility. Investors formulating their BTC price prediction should weigh the strong fundamental signal from holders against potential external challenges, positioning themselves wisely for what the coming months may hold.

The company’s latest purchase was worth around 17 million euros ($19.6 million). The Blockchain Group Continues Bitcoin Purchases: 182 More BTC Added, Bringing Total Value Over $170 Million With the latest purchase, the company's total Bitcoin holdings reached 1,653 BTC, with a total market value of approximately 149 million euros (approximately $171 million). The company also drew attention with its 1,173% “BTC yield” so far in 2025. This ratio is calculated by dividing the total amount of Bitcoin held by the company’s fully diluted share count. This metric is used to show how effective companies’ Bitcoin acquisition strategies are. For comparison, MicroStrategy (MSTR), the world’s largest institutional Bitcoin holder, reported a 19.1% BTC yield since the beginning of the year, while Japan-based Metaplanet (3350) reported a 266.07% yield and US-based Semler Scientific (SMLR) reported a 26.7% yield. Bitcoin Purchases Funded by Bond and Stock Proceeds The Bitcoin purchase was financed by a convertible bond issue worth more than €18 million, with investors including UTXO Management, Moonlight Capital, Ludovic Chechin-Laurans and asset manager TOBAM. The company also raised an additional €1.6 million by converting its stock purchase warrants into approximately 3 million new shares, and used this proceeds to purchase Bitcoin. The Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin purchases were made through Swissquote Bank Europe and Banque Delubac, while the crypto assets are being held in custody by Switzerland-based digital asset infrastructure provider Taurus. The company's average cost of Bitcoin purchases is around 90,000 euros (about $103,000). Following the news of the acquisition, the company's shares were traded on the Euronext Paris exchange in the morning hours, down 2.1% at 4,895 euros, while France's CAC 40 index remained flat.

It has formed a double-top pattern with a neckline at $100,300, a formation often associated with bearish breakouts. Bitcoin has also fallen below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average and is approaching the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator has dropped below the zero line. As such, Bitcoin may continue falling, with the next level to watch being $100,300, about 4.2% below current prices.

Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partner ships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Pepe (PEPE) Source: TradingView Pepe (PEPE) has seen notable price fluctuations recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 16.33%, and over the past month, it dropped by 12.98%. Looking back six months, the coin has declined by 45.52%. Currently, PEPE is trading within the range of $0.000009852 to $0.00001299, showing a period of consolidation after significant volatility. Technical indicators suggest varying signals for PEPE. The 10-day simple moving average is at $0.00001063, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.00001103. This narrowing gap may indicate a potential shift in trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 32.25, approaching the oversold territory, which could hint at a possible rebound. Additionally, the Stochastic indicator is at 27.33, also suggesting the coin might be oversold. PEPE faces immediate resistance at $0.00001486. Breaking through this level could pave the way toward the second resistance at $0.00001800, representing a potential increase of over 40% from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.000008588. If the price falls below this, it might test the second support at $0.000005449, a decrease of around 45%. Traders are watching these levels closely as they may signal significant price movements ahead. Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin has seen significant fluctuations recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 10.31%. In the last month, it decreased by 18.97%. Looking back over six months, the decline is 51.44%. The current price ranges between $0.1615 and $0.1976. This shows a consistent downward trend in the short and medium term. Despite the recent declines, Dogecoin may find support at $0.1477, which could halt further losses. If buying interest increases, the price might test the nearest resistance level at $0.2199. Breaking through this level could lead to the second resistance at $0.256. On the downside, if the price falls below the nearest support, it could head toward the second support at $0.1116. Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index is at 41.60, suggesting that Dogecoin is approaching oversold territory. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $0.1745, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.1765. This indicates short-term weakness but also potential for a rebound. The MACD level is -0.0007965, reflecting bearish momentum, but the Stochastic at 42.62 may indicate that selling pressure is easing. Conclusion PEPE and DOGE are bullish, but XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme blend positions it for massive growth in the 2025 bull run.

In a clear and insightful thread on X, well-known crypto analyst Pumpius broke down XRP’s core features and real-world applications, cutting through the noise to focus on facts. Building on that foundation, this guide explores what XRP is, how it works, and why it matters today. What Is XRP? XRP is a digital asset built for real-time, cross-border payments. While Bitcoin was created to function as a decentralized store of value, XRP was specifically designed to make global money transfers faster, cheaper, and more scalable. According to Pumpius, XRP processes transactions in just three to five seconds, costs less than a cent per transaction, and can handle over 1,500 transactions per second. This speed and efficiency are what separate XRP from most other cryptocurrencies. It isn’t meant to replace traditional money, but rather to upgrade how money moves. As Pumpius puts it, “It’s not ‘just another coin. ’ It’s infrastructure.” Beginner’s Guide to $XRP — What You Need to Know If you’re just getting into crypto or finally curious about XRP, this thread breaks down what it is, how it works, and why it matters. No hype. No noise. Just facts. pic.twitter.com/fIqSz4U106 — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 17, 2025 Understanding the XRP Ledger (XRPL) The technology behind XRP is the XRP Ledger , commonly referred to as XRPL. This is the decentralized blockchain network where XRP transactions take place. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which depend on energy-heavy mining, XRPL uses a consensus mechanism that doesn’t require mining at all. This makes it environmentally friendly, incredibly fast, and highly reliable, with the ledger closing every few seconds. Pumpius explains it best: “Think of XRPL as the highway. XRP is the car.” The ledger also comes with advanced capabilities, including a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), native tokenization, and support for real-world assets like stablecoins, NFTs, and even tokenized biotech data. This makes the XRPL not just a payments network but a powerful platform for developers and institutions building on-chain solutions. Who Uses XRP and the XRPL? XRP’s real-world use extends well beyond trading. Ripple, the fintech company closely associated with XRP, uses it to develop global payment solutions for financial institutions. Through RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity, XRP helps banks and remittance companies settle international payments within seconds, removing the need for pre-funded accounts and reducing costs. Pumpius highlights that XRP and XRPL aren’t just used by banks. Developers are building a wide range of projects on the ledger, including DeFi protocols, tokenized asset platforms, and even biotech applications such as XRP Healthcare and DNA Protocol. These projects demonstrate that XRP is not just about finance; it’s about enabling secure and efficient value transfer across multiple industries. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP vs. Other Cryptocurrencies Each major cryptocurrency serves a different role. Bitcoin is widely viewed as a store of value, often referred to as digital gold . Ethereum dominates the smart contract space but faces persistent issues with network congestion and high fees . XRP, in contrast, is optimized for real-time value transfers and liquidity provisioning. Pumpius summarizes it this way: “XRP isn’t trying to replace banks—it’s replacing their plumbing.” Instead of tearing down the financial system, XRP enhances the infrastructure behind it. Legal Status and Regulatory Clarity One of the most significant milestones in XRP’s journey came in 2023, when U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold on digital asset exchanges. This decision gave XRP a rare level of regulatory clarity in the United States—something that most cryptocurrencies still lack. Pumpius rightly called it “one of the most important wins in crypto history.” The ruling allowed XRP to be relisted on major U.S. exchanges and restored institutional confidence in the asset. How to Store XRP Safely Pumpius stresses the importance of self-custody for those holding XRP. Rather than leaving assets on exchanges, where users don’t control their private keys, he advises using secure wallets such as Xaman, Tangem, or Ledger hardware wallets. As he puts it, “Not your keys = not your coins.” In crypto, maintaining control of your assets is essential. Final Thoughts XRP is not built on hype. As Pumpius concluded, “XRP is not hype. It’s not a meme. It’s one of the most adopted, fastest, and legally clarified assets in crypto.” With a clear use case, powerful infrastructure, and growing adoption across sectors, XRP stands out as a practical tool in the future of finance and decentralized value transfer. For beginners seeking a serious and credible introduction to digital assets, XRP is a smart place to start. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This prediction was highlighted by market expert Giovanni Incasa, who emphasized the significance of applying rigorous supply-demand theories to Bitcoin’s unique economic structure. Supply Shock Warning Rudd and Porter have employed pure mathematical modeling to analyze Bitcoin’s market dynamics, warning that the impending supply shock could lead to price fluctuations ten times more severe than anything seen to date. Their findings suggest that the effects of this supply shock will result in permanent wealth redistribution, fundamentally altering the landscape of digital assets. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge According to their conservative estimates, the Bitcoin price could reach $2.2 million per coin by 2036, a projection rooted in what they describe as “economic physics.” The researchers note that the current liquid supply of Bitcoin stands at only 11.2 million coins, with an estimated 4 million Bitcoin lost forever due to lost keys and Satoshi Nakamoto’s unspent stash. Their analysis reveals that only half of BTC’s total supply is actively liquid, meaning that even modest institutional purchases could lead to significant supply shortages. Evidence of this trend can be seen in the daily buying habits of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have averaged 285 Bitcoin per day since their launch, and the actions of Bitcoin treasury companies that are removing thousands of coins from circulation through debt financing. Senator Cynthia Lummis has also proposed a strategic reserve of one million Bitcoin, which would involve an acquisition of approximately 550 coins per day over five years. The researchers calculate that if 2,000 Bitcoin are removed from circulation daily, the price could reach $106,000—a figure that is already close to today’s trading price of $104,800, suggesting that their mathematical framework is holding true. The crux of the researchers’ findings is that traditional supply curves are not applicable to BTC. Its perfectly inelastic supply creates significant bottlenecks as demand rises, leading to dramatic price increases. They emphasize that institutions that delay their investments risk becoming permanently priced out of the market. Three Scenarios For Bitcoin Rudd and Porter outline three potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s future. In a conservative scenario, with a 20-fold increase in demand and continued institutional adoption leading to 2,000 daily Bitcoin withdrawals, prices could reach $2.2 million by 2036. Their bullish scenario posits a 30-fold demand growth, where Bitcoin could hit $5 million by early 2031. The most extreme, hyperbolic scenario anticipates a 40-fold demand increase, with daily withdrawals escalating to 4,000 Bitcoin, potentially driving prices to $4.3 million by 2036 and valuing Bitcoin at six times the current market cap of gold.

It highlights a transformative period for BTC and the broader financial landscape, where strategic positioning and early adoption could mean the difference between thriving and merely surviving in the digital economy.

A potentially significant development is on the horizon for accessing digital assets through traditional investment vehicles. Canada’s Evolve Funds Group has announced its intention to launch the Evolve XRP ETF , bringing the popular cryptocurrency Ripple XRP into the regulated exchange-traded fund space on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). This move could mark a new chapter for investors looking to gain exposure to Ripple XRP without directly holding the digital asset. What is the Evolve XRP ETF and Why Does it Matter? The Evolve XRP ETF is designed to provide investors with exposure to the daily price movements of XRP, the digital asset associated with the Ripple payment network. Unlike buying and storing XRP yourself on a crypto exchange, an ETF trades on a traditional stock exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange , making it accessible through standard brokerage accounts. This proposed XRP ETF Canada offering is significant for several reasons: Accessibility: It simplifies the investment process for traditional investors who are comfortable with brokerage platforms but might find navigating crypto exchanges and wallets daunting. Regulation: Trading on a regulated exchange like the TSX brings a level of oversight and investor protection not always present in direct crypto markets. Institutional Interest: The availability of an ETF can attract institutional investors who have mandates preventing direct crypto holdings but can invest in regulated fund products. Market Validation: The launch of a dedicated Canada Crypto ETF for XRP, following similar products for Bitcoin and Ethereum, signals growing acceptance and maturity of the digital asset class within Canadian financial markets. The ETF is expected to trade under the ticker symbols XRP (for the Canadian Dollar unhedged units) and XRP.U (for the US Dollar units), pending final approval from the TSX. How Does the Evolve XRP ETF Fit into the Canada Crypto ETF Landscape? Canada has been a leader in approving cryptocurrency ETFs, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Evolve Funds itself was among the first to launch a Bitcoin ETF (EBIT) and an Ethereum ETF (ETHR) on the TSX. The potential arrival of the Evolve XRP ETF further diversifies the options available to Canadian investors seeking regulated exposure to digital assets. Here’s a quick look at the evolving landscape: Asset Existing ETFs in Canada Evolve’s Offering Bitcoin (BTC) Multiple (e.g., Purpose, Evolve, CI Galaxy) Evolve Bitcoin ETF (EBIT) Ethereum (ETH) Multiple (e.g., Purpose, Evolve, CI Galaxy) Evolve Ether ETF (ETHR) XRP (Ripple) None (as of announcement) Proposed Evolve XRP ETF This expansion suggests growing investor demand and regulatory comfort with offering exposure to a wider range of prominent cryptocurrencies through the traditional financial system. The XRP ETF Canada would be a notable addition, offering access to an asset with a different use case (cross-border payments) compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Considering the Evolve XRP ETF: Benefits and Potential Drawbacks Like any investment, the proposed Evolve XRP ETF comes with its own set of potential upsides and considerations. Understanding these is crucial before making any investment decisions. Potential Benefits: Ease of Investment: As mentioned, buying shares of an ETF through a brokerage account is often simpler than managing private keys or dealing with different crypto exchange interfaces. Liquidity: ETFs trade throughout the day on the Toronto Stock Exchange , offering liquidity that can sometimes be challenging on smaller crypto exchanges. No Custody Worries: Investors don’t need to worry about securely storing XRP themselves; the fund handles the custody of the underlying asset. Diversification Potential: For investors building a diversified portfolio, an XRP ETF Canada could offer exposure to the digital asset sector through a regulated product. Potential Drawbacks: Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can eat into returns over time compared to holding the asset directly (though direct holding has its own costs like exchange fees). Tracking Error: While designed to track the price of XRP, ETFs can sometimes experience minor tracking differences due to operational costs and market dynamics. Regulatory Uncertainty for XRP: While the ETF is regulated in Canada, the underlying asset, Ripple XRP , has faced significant regulatory challenges in other jurisdictions (most notably the ongoing SEC lawsuit in the United States), which can impact its price volatility and future prospects. Market Volatility: The price of XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile. Investing in the ETF means accepting this inherent market risk. Investors should weigh these factors carefully and consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals. What’s Next? The Path to Launch for the Evolve XRP ETF According to reports, the Evolve XRP ETF is currently awaiting final approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange . This is a standard step in the process for listing new financial products. Once approved, the ETF will become available for trading on the TSX under the specified ticker symbols. The exact launch date will depend on the timing of this final regulatory clearance. The launch of this Canada Crypto ETF for XRP could potentially: Increase mainstream investor exposure to Ripple XRP. Potentially impact the liquidity and trading volume of XRP. Further solidify Canada’s position as a leading jurisdiction for regulated crypto investment products. Market participants will be watching closely to see how the ETF is received by investors and what impact it has on the broader crypto market, particularly for Ripple XRP . Actionable Insights for Investors If you are considering investing in the proposed Evolve XRP ETF , here are a few steps you might consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye out for the official approval announcement from Evolve Funds and the TSX. Understand XRP: Before investing in the ETF, take the time to understand what Ripple XRP is, its technology, use cases, and the regulatory environment surrounding it. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Ensure your investment aligns with your personal risk profile. Consult a Financial Advisor: Consider speaking with a qualified financial advisor to understand how this ETF might fit into your overall investment strategy. Summary: A New Era for XRP Access in Canada? The announcement by Evolve Funds Group regarding the planned launch of the Evolve XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange is a significant development for the Canadian crypto investment landscape. It represents the potential introduction of the first regulated ETF product offering exposure to Ripple XRP in the country. This move underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance and provides Canadian investors with another avenue to participate in the crypto market through a familiar and regulated structure. While awaiting final approval, the prospect of the XRP ETF Canada is certainly creating buzz among investors interested in expanding their digital asset portfolios.

Holders with no history of selling (accumulation addresses) also reached an all-time high of 22.8M ETH. According to CryptoQuant, these two metrics combined positioned Ethereum as one of the strongest crypto assets in terms of long-term fundamentals and investor conviction. Data from Dune analytics also confirmed there were nearly 1.1M validators, with netflows of 13.9M ETH (16.9M ETH excluding rewards) since Shanghai. The data also confirmed that about 28.33% of all ETH in circulation was staked, and Ethereum’s economic security, the total dollar value of staked ETH, exceeded $91 billion. Lido tops staking provider list as seven ETH stakers hold 1M+ ETH Ethereum stakers according to amount staked. Source: Dune Dune’s data revealed Lido was the largest staking provider, holding 9.02 million ETH through 282K validators. The data also showed that the amount of staked ETH declined by 0.65% over the past month, accounting for 25.6% (-0.65%) of the total market share. The amount of staked ETH on Lido dropped by 1% (92.83K ETH) over the past 30 days and by 8% over the past six months, with a total of 833K ETH earned. Binance followed with a market share of 7.5% (2.65M ETH) of the staked ETH supply being held through 83K validators. The amount of staked ETH increased by 6% in the past month and 37% over the past six months, with 202K ETH earned. Coinbase was third with a market share of roughly 7.4% (2.59M ETH) held through 81K validators. Overall, the market share dropped by 0.26%, decreased by 2.0% over the past month, and decreased by 27% over six months. Slightly more than 400K was earned. Dune’s data also confirmed that ether.fi (2.3M ETH), Kiln (1.5M ETH), Kraken (~1.2M ETH), and Figment (1.03M ETH) completed the list of the top seven exchanges with over a million staked ETH. They had market shares of 6.6%, 4.3%, 3.4%, and 3.0%, respectively. The four exchanges earned a combined total of 359K ETH. “Although liquid staking solutions suggest conviction is growing for Ethereum…People are maybe expecting the price to go up in the future, and therefore feeling more confident in terms of holding the asset.” – Carlos Guzman , a Research Analyst at GSR Breaking down staked ETH by category, the data showed that 10.2M ETH (29.2%) was staked through liquid staking, 8.7M ETH (24.8%) through CEXs, and 6.4M ETH (18.3%) through staking pools. Additionally, 2.7M ETH (7.8%) was staked through liquid restaking, while 6.8M ETH (19.6%) was staked through unidentified means. Coinbase becomes Ethereum’s largest node operator Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, said that Coinbase’s stake made the exchange the “single largest node operator” in the network. CryptoQuant’s data confirmed that Coinbase was Ethereum’s largest node operator, holding over 11.4% of staked ETH supply through its validators. Sassano pointed out that while the staking platform Lido was bigger collectively, each node operator had a much smaller percentage share. Coinbase also reported that its validators had an average uptime of 99.75%, outperforming their target of 99% uptime without compromising security standards. The exchange attributed the performance to an upgrade implemented in 2024, which allowed the exchange to keep validators running while performing beacon node maintenance. Coinbase validators’ participation rate was also at 99.75%, exceeding the network average of 99.52%. The Coinbase team said the company distributed its validators across several regions to help maintain a “truly distributed” and decentralized Ethereum blockchain.

From joke currencies to payment platforms, investors are looking for the best cryptocurrency presale to purchase right now. When supported by actual features and engaged communities, early-stage ventures have a lot of potential. Today’s top cryptocurrency presales are Angry Pepe Fork , SpacePay, and SUBBD. Each adds something unique—real-world integration, viral usefulness, or specialized payment mechanisms. Let’s see how these cryptocurrencies on presale stand up. SUBBD converts subscriptions into one token system SUBBD seeks to change the way consumers pay for subscriptions. The idea is simple: merge Netflix, Spotify, and other services under a single token payment mechanism. Instead of managing various bills, consumers may pay everything with SUBBD. The concept has potential; however, the initiative is still in its early stages. There is no functional platform yet, and progress has been sluggish. The community is tiny, and investor trust is low. It’s one of the most unusual crypto ICO presale concepts, but it still has to establish its usefulness. SpacePay bridges crypto and card payments SpacePay is attempting to make cryptocurrency payments as easy as swiping a conventional card. It is building an APK that will interact with card machines, allowing shops to accept cryptocurrency from over 300 wallets. This might make cryptocurrencies more useful in ordinary transactions. The objective is not to replace fiat currency, but rather to make cryptocurrency more usable in everyday situations. That kind of accessibility might help SpacePay develop quickly. As far as crypto presale initiatives go, SpacePay prioritizes functionality above excitement, which has earned it early backers. Angry Pepe Fork delivers real rewards and real fun Angry Pepe Fork ($APORK) is more than just a meme; it’s an entire ecosystem that rewards its participants. It was priced at $0.0269 in presale and has already raised more than $240,000. That early success is supported by legitimate features such as staking, CommunityFi, and GambleFi mini-games. Presale customers may stake their Ethereum purchases to earn more than 10,000% APY. The earlier you check in, the higher your rate. CommunityFi allows users to earn $APORK by tweeting, uploading memes, or recommending others. It rewards every activity that helps the project flourish. Then there’s GambleFi, a play-to-earn mechanism incorporated right within the token platform. You may use tokens in mini-games to earn extra $APORK. Following each win, a fraction of the tokens are burnt, which contributes to the long-term price increase. Angry Pepe Fork is more accessible than other presale token initiatives since it supports many blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana. With deflationary dynamics, community power, and early staking benefits, it is one of the best crypto presales for 2025. Final thoughts: Angry Pepe Fork leads presale crypto list SUBBD and SpacePay each have a unique concept, but Angry Pepe Fork provides greater value to today’s presale cryptocurrency purchasers. From staking incentives to viral engagement and deflationary tokenomics, it ticks all the boxes. As new crypto token presales emerge, Angry Pepe Fork gains traction. Earning, community, and clever mechanics are more than simply buzz. That is why it is the best cryptocurrency presale to invest in right now.

According to a blog post by Meta Pool, the attacker exploited the “fast unstake functionality” to mint 9,705 mpETH tokens — the platform’s liquid staking token — valued at nearly $27 million. However, due to limited liquidity in the swap pools and Meta Pool’s prompt contract pause, the hacker managed to convert only a fraction of the minted tokens into 52.5 ETH, worth just over $132,000. Meta Pool’s early detection systems flagged the suspicious activity, allowing the team to freeze the exploited smart contract and prevent further loss. Co-founder Claudio Cossio stated on X that the fast unstaking feature, which skips the standard waiting period after unstaking, was key to the exploit. This mechanism can offer users faster access to funds but can pose security risks if not carefully implemented. Bug in Mint Function Blockchain security firm PeckShield confirmed that the vulnerability stemmed from a critical bug in the staking contract’s ERC4626 mint() function. This flaw enabled the attacker to mint mpETH tokens without any cost. However, because mpETH is a relatively illiquid token, the hacker’s ability to convert the tokens into ETH was significantly hindered. The attacker primarily targeted liquidity pools on Ethereum mainnet and Optimism, draining 52.5 ETH in total. One of the affected pools on Optimism had particularly low volume and liquidity, which helped contain the damage. In its statement, Meta Pool reassured users that all staked Ethereum remains secure, as it is delegated through the SSV Network and continues to accrue staking rewards. The team has paused the affected mpETH contract and plans to publish a full post-mortem within the next 48 hours, along with a recovery plan. Exploit Cases Rise Across Crypto Platforms Meta Pool joins a growing list of DeFi platforms exploit cases this month. On June 6, Bitcoin-based DeFi platform Alex Protocol lost $8.3 million due to a self-listing flaw, while Taiwan-based exchange BitoPro reported a $11.5 million hot wallet breach from May 8. Despite the failed theft attempt, the Meta Pool incident underscores the growing need for rigorous security auditing in DeFi platforms , especially as protocols race to offer faster user functionality without compromising safety.

As Israel and Iran exchange missile strikes and former President Trump takes emergency security meetings, risk appetite worldwide has faltered, but Bitcoin's underlying bullish momentum is undeniable. Geopolitical Shockwaves and Trump's Security Meetings The latest bout of volatility began after reports that Israel had launched its largest attack on Iran in decades, sparking fear of wider regional conflict. It took a turn for the worse after Trump abruptly pulled out of the G7 summit and called for an emergency Situation Room meeting, urging Americans to depart Tehran. The market's reaction was immediate: Bitcoin lost over $2,000 in a matter of hours, and altcoins plummeted even harder, wiping out $80 billion in cryptocurrency market capitalization. Traders were hit with nearly $400 million in liquidations, with leveraged longs being blindsided. Yet, as the dust settled, Bitcoin's price stabilized above $103,000. This kind of resilience is similar to previous wartime shocks, where BTC sold off in the first instance but soon got back on its feet as markets adjusted to the new reality. In fact, historical data shows that after similar events—like the Israel-Gaza war in 2023 and the Iran embassy bombing in 2024—Bitcoin can bounce back within weeks, sometimes even outperforming traditional safe havens like gold. Funding Rates and ETF Inflows Continue to Be Bullish The special thing about this cycle is the speed and size of the bounce. On-chain metrics and derivatives markets show that, even as headlines spooked retail investors, institutional players and seasoned traders viewed the dip as a buying opportunity. Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rates, which temporarily turned negative during panic, have flipped positive again—meaning traders are paying a premium to hold long positions and are expecting higher prices in the future. ETF flows tell the same story. Despite the price decline, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs gathered over $200 million of net inflows, led by BlackRock's IBIT with $639 million in a single day. Although inflows slowed from last week's record pace, the nine-week streak of positive flows has pushed year-to-date ETF inflows to $13.2 billion. That suggests that institutional investors remain confident in Bitcoin's long-term trajectory, even as short-term volatility shakes out less determined participants. Macro Context: How Bitcoin Behaves In Wartime Bitcoin's relationship with geopolitical risk is evolving. Historically, BTC has been considered a ”digital gold” hedge, but recent cycles have seen it behave more like a risk asset—selling off in conjunction with equities in crises, prior to rebounding as markets stabilize. Bitwise and CoinShares researchers note that Bitcoin's volatility has reduced structurally over time but remains vulnerable to global shocks. But the evidence shows that Bitcoin's post-war recoveries can be quick and decisive. After the COVID crash in 2020, BTC lost half its value within days, only to gain 583% over the next year. In the Russia-Ukraine war during 2022, Bitcoin dropped 20% before gaining 65% over two months. In spite of recent Israel-Iran tensions, BTC's ability to hold key support levels and attract new inflows is a sign of a market that's ageing—and increasingly being driven by institutional money. The Bottom Line Despite war-driven volatility and headline risk, the underlying Bitcoin narrative remains unchanged. Dip-buyers, positive funding rates, and relentless ETF inflows suggest the market's conviction is stronger than fear. If history is any guide, Bitcoin's strength amidst geopolitical shock can yet again set the stage for fresh highs—especially with institutions still buying and traders betting on a V-shaped recovery.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-18 13:34:29

For years, the production of the specialized computer hardware essential for mining, known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), has been dominated by a handful of companies based in China. However, the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China have created powerful incentives for these manufacturing giants to reconsider their strategies and geographical footprint. This strategic pivot is not just a business decision; it’s a structural shift impacting the entire crypto mining supply chain and raising important questions about national security and economic resilience. Understanding the Giants Driving US Manufacturing Expansion At the heart of this story are three titans of the mining hardware industry: Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT. These companies collectively hold an estimated over 90% share of the global market for Bitcoin mining rigs. Their dominance means that virtually every large-scale Bitcoin mining operation, regardless of its location, relies heavily on their products. For decades, their manufacturing base has been primarily in China, leveraging the country’s established electronics supply chain, infrastructure, and labor force. However, the imposition of tariffs under former President Donald Trump’s administration, specifically targeting goods imported from China, significantly increased the cost of these crucial components for US-based mining operations. These tariffs acted as a direct financial burden, making it more expensive to set up or expand mining facilities in the United States. This economic pressure point became a major catalyst for the Chinese manufacturers to explore alternatives to mitigate the impact and remain competitive in a key market. Why Are China Tariffs Pushing Mining Hardware Production to the US? The primary driver for Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT’s decision to ramp up US manufacturing is the direct financial penalty imposed by the tariffs. Importing ASICs manufactured in China into the United States incurs substantial additional costs, which are ultimately passed on to the customers – the US Bitcoin miners. By establishing production capabilities within the US, these companies can potentially bypass or significantly reduce these tariff-related expenses, making their products more cost-effective for American buyers. Beyond just tariffs, other factors are at play: Market Proximity: The United States has rapidly become one of the largest and most attractive regions for Bitcoin mining globally, thanks to factors like access to abundant, often cheap, energy sources (renewables, natural gas flares) and a favorable regulatory environment in certain states. Having production closer to this major customer base can improve logistics, reduce shipping times and costs, and allow for quicker response to market demand. Supply Chain Resilience: Relying on a single manufacturing hub, especially one in a potentially adversarial geopolitical environment, introduces significant supply chain risks. Diversifying production locations enhances resilience against future trade disputes, export restrictions, or other disruptions. National Security Concerns: As the article notes, the heavy reliance of US infrastructure (including crypto mining, which is seen by some as critical digital infrastructure) on hardware from a geopolitical rival has raised national security concerns. While the manufacturers’ move is primarily economic, it aligns with broader calls for diversifying critical supply chains away from China. Customer Relationships: Local production can facilitate stronger relationships with large institutional mining clients in the US, offering better support, repair services, and potentially customized solutions. Examining the Strategies: How Are the Giants Adapting? Each of the big three is implementing its own version of a localization strategy: Bitmain: As the market leader, Bitmain made an early move, reportedly beginning production in the U.S. in December 2023. This timing, shortly after the U.S. presidential election, suggests a proactive approach to navigate the political landscape and potential future trade policies. Bitmain has previously explored US operations, including mining farms, indicating a long-term interest in the North American market. Canaan: Canaan, another major player, initiated trial manufacturing in April. The timing here is also notable, following discussions around potential new or reinforced tariffs, sometimes referred to informally as ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs in political discourse. Trial manufacturing allows Canaan to test the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and logistical challenges of US production before committing to a larger scale. MicroBT: The maker of the popular Whatsminer series is focusing on a broader “localization strategy.” This might involve not just manufacturing but also establishing stronger local sales, support, and repair networks. While the specific details of their US production plans might differ, the goal is the same: reduce exposure to trade restrictions and better serve the North American market. It’s important to note that “production” in the US might initially focus on assembly rather than the complex, capital-intensive fabrication of the ASIC chips themselves, which still heavily relies on advanced foundries primarily located in Asia (like TSMC in Taiwan). However, even assembly in the US represents a significant step towards shifting part of the value chain geographically. What Does This Mean for the US Crypto Mining Landscape? The expansion of mining hardware production within the United States has several potential implications for the domestic crypto mining industry: Reduced Costs (Potentially): By avoiding tariffs, the cost of acquiring new mining rigs could decrease for US operators, improving profitability and encouraging further investment in domestic mining infrastructure. Faster Deployment: Shorter supply chains mean quicker delivery times for new equipment, allowing miners to scale their operations more rapidly in response to market conditions. Enhanced Supply Chain Security: Domestic production offers greater predictability and security of supply compared to relying solely on imports subject to geopolitical risks. Job Creation: Establishing and operating manufacturing or assembly plants creates jobs in the US, contributing to the local economy in states that attract these facilities. Development of Domestic Expertise: Increased manufacturing activity can foster the development of a skilled workforce and technical expertise related to ASIC production and maintenance within the US. While the benefits are clear, challenges remain. The cost of labor and manufacturing in the US is generally higher than in China. Sourcing components, many of which are still produced in Asia, could also present logistical hurdles. However, the strategic advantages, particularly tariff avoidance and supply chain security, appear to outweigh these challenges for the major players. Beyond Tariffs: The Long-Term Impact on the Global Mining Supply Chain The shift of Chinese mining hardware manufacturers towards US production is more than a temporary response to trade policy; it signals a potential long-term restructuring of the global Bitcoin mining supply chain. For years, the supply chain has been heavily centralized in East Asia, from chip design and fabrication to assembly and distribution. This move suggests a trend towards decentralization and regionalization. As more production capacity is established outside of China, other regions like North America could develop more robust local ecosystems for mining hardware – including repair centers, component suppliers, and potentially even domestic design and fabrication capabilities in the future. This could lead to a more diversified and resilient global mining network, less susceptible to disruptions in any single country. Furthermore, this trend could encourage the emergence or growth of non-Chinese mining hardware manufacturers, fostering greater competition in a market currently dominated by the big three. While challenging, the opportunity exists for companies in the US or other geopolitically neutral countries to capture market share by offering domestically produced or assembled hardware. Addressing National Security and Supply Chain Concerns The concerns around national security stem from the potential for hardware backdoors or vulnerabilities embedded during the manufacturing process, as well as the strategic risk of relying on a competitor for essential digital infrastructure components. While these concerns are complex and often debated, a shift towards domestic or allied-country production of Bitcoin mining equipment can, in theory, alleviate some of these worries by bringing parts of the supply chain under the jurisdiction and oversight of the host country. Increased US manufacturing of mining hardware contributes to greater supply chain transparency and potentially allows for more stringent security checks and quality control processes that align with US standards and regulations. This is particularly relevant as Bitcoin mining becomes increasingly integrated into the energy sector and attracts larger institutional players. What’s Next? The Future of Mining Hardware Production The success and scale of these initial US production efforts will likely determine the extent of future expansion. Factors to watch include: The evolution of US trade policy towards China. The cost-effectiveness of US manufacturing compared to traditional hubs. The ability to build a skilled workforce and reliable local component supply chains in the US. Demand from US-based mining operations. If these initiatives prove successful, we could see a more permanent shift, with a significant portion of global mining hardware assembly serving the North American market being done locally. This would not only reshape the business models of the major manufacturers but also further solidify North America’s position as a major global hub for crypto mining activity. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Bitcoin Mining The decision by Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT to expand production in the United States marks a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin mining industry. Driven primarily by the economic pressures of China tariffs , this move is accelerating a broader trend towards the regionalization and diversification of the global mining hardware supply chain. While challenges in manufacturing costs and component sourcing remain, the strategic benefits of being closer to a major market like the US, avoiding tariffs, and enhancing supply chain security are compelling. This shift is not just about where machines are made; it’s about building a more resilient, geographically diverse, and potentially more secure foundation for the future of Bitcoin mining worldwide. As the US continues to grow as a mining destination, domestic hardware production could become an increasingly vital component of its digital infrastructure.

The market is caught between two liquidity zones: the buy-side above $108K and the sell-side beneath $100K, while the price slowly gravitates toward the lower boundary. Momentum has weakened as seen in the RSI drop below 50 on both daily and 4H timeframes, suggesting bearish pressure is gaining control. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Bitcoin remains stuck in a broader consolidation pattern, forming a descending triangle just below a major resistance level. The RSI is holding around 46, and the price is still above the key trendline depicted in orange. This structure reflects a classic re-accumulation or distribution phase. If the bulls fail to reclaim $108K with conviction, the ascending trendline becomes a likely magnet. Moreover, the orange 100-day MA and the blue 200-day MA are still pointing up but have narrowed near the $95K region, indicating a slowdown in trend strength. The daily range between $100K–$108K is critical. So far, buyers have absorbed dips into the $101K–$103K zone, but continued lower highs and failure to flip the $108K area into support suggest the market may be preparing for a deeper sweep of liquidity. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the price action has formed a clear descending channel. The lower highs show consistent bearish pressure, while support at $103.5K is being tested repeatedly. This is often a bearish continuation pattern, and with RSI around 41, the momentum leans toward the downside. The failure to break through the fair value gap (FVG) around $106K, and even failing to test it, confirms that sellers are defending the premium levels efficiently. Currently, market participants can expect a quick sweep of the double sell-side liquidity levels marked around $102K and $103K. A break and close below these levels could open up a run toward the key daily demand at the $100K area. Meanwhile, any upside breakout above $110K must begin with a reclaim of the FVG zone convincingly to flip short-term sentiment. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Whale Ratio The whale ratio on exchanges has surged above 0.55, its highest point in over a year, which is typically considered a warning signal. This metric measures the proportion of the top 10 inflows to total inflows on exchanges. Historically, a rising whale ratio means large holders are increasingly active on exchanges, likely preparing to sell. This shift often precedes corrections or sharp volatility, especially when retail activity is cooling off. Combining this with stagnant price action below key resistance, the current whale behavior suggests cautious distribution rather than aggressive accumulation. If the whale ratio remains elevated while BTC trades sideways or drops further, it strengthens the case for a liquidity sweep below $100K before any potential continuation higher.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially started a formal process to decide whether to approve or reject the proposed Franklin XRP ETF . A final decision is expected by September 9, 2025 — a date to watch out for. XRP ETF Formal Process Began The proposal , filed by Cboe BZX Exchange , would allow Franklin Templeton to launch an ETF that holds physical XRP, similar to how Bitcoin ETFs now hold actual Bitcoin. The ETF plans to use Coinbase Custody Trust to store the tokens, while the price would track the CF Benchmark CME XRP-Dollar Index. It would be listed under Cboe’s BZX Exchange, following the same rules used for other commodity-based trusts. SEC Has Until 9 Sept To Revive XRP ETF But before that happens, the SEC wants to take a closer look. The agency has moved into the “Order Instituting Proceedings” phase, which is basically a formal investigation. The SEC is now gathering opinions and data to answer big questions: Will this XRP ETF protect investors? Can it prevent market manipulation? And does it meet the standards of the law? The review process started back in March 2025, and the next major date is September 9, 2025. By then, the SEC will likely reach a decision, either greenlighting the ETF or blocking it. Public Comments Are Open What’s interesting is that the SEC is now actively asking the public for comments. They’re especially interested in whether the XRP market is mature enough to handle an ETF without price manipulation or unfair trading practices. For now, all eyes are on September. If the SEC gives the green light, it could mark a huge milestone for XRP As of now, XRP price is trading around $2.12, reflecting a rise of 4.14% seen in the last 24 hours.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 13:42:08

The latest incident shaking the market involves Nobitex, a prominent Iranian cryptocurrency exchange. Reports have surfaced detailing a significant Nobitex exploit on the TRON (TRX) Network, resulting in substantial financial losses. This event serves as a stark reminder of the persistent security challenges within the digital asset space. Understanding the Scope of the Nobitex Exploit According to on-chain detective ZachXBT, who shared details on Telegram, the Nobitex exploit led to estimated total losses of approximately $48.65 million. This figure represents a significant amount of value compromised from the exchange’s holdings or user funds held on the platform. Details emerging about the attack point to the use of a vanity address by the attacker. ZachXBT specifically noted the use of an address beginning with ‘TKFuck’, a tactic sometimes employed by malicious actors, potentially to taunt or simply for recognition. While the exact method of the exploit is still under investigation or not fully public, the outcome is clear: a large-scale compromise affecting a major regional exchange. The TRON Network Attack Context The incident specifically occurred on the TRON network attack . TRON is a popular blockchain platform known for its focus on decentralized applications and content sharing. While the exploit targeted Nobitex’s operations or wallets connected to the TRON network, it’s important to distinguish between an attack on the blockchain protocol itself and an attack on an entity operating on the network, like an exchange. In many exchange hacks, the vulnerability lies not within the underlying blockchain technology (like TRON, Bitcoin, or Ethereum) but rather in the exchange’s own systems, such as: Weaknesses in hot or cold wallet management Vulnerabilities in smart contracts used by the exchange Compromised private keys Insufficient security protocols or internal errors Phishing attacks targeting employees Further analysis will likely clarify if the vulnerability was specific to how Nobitex interacted with the TRON network or a more general security lapse within the exchange’s infrastructure that happened to impact TRON-based assets. Broader Implications of a Crypto Exchange Hack A crypto exchange hack like the one experienced by Nobitex has ripple effects far beyond the immediate financial loss. These incidents severely impact user trust, which is a critical component for any financial platform, especially in the nascent crypto industry. When an exchange is compromised, users worry about the safety of their own funds and may withdraw assets, potentially causing liquidity issues for the exchange. Other implications include: Reputational Damage: An exchange’s reputation can be severely tarnished, making it difficult to attract new users or retain existing ones. Regulatory Scrutiny: Security breaches often attract attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to investigations, fines, or stricter compliance requirements. Market Volatility: Large hacks can sometimes cause temporary dips in the prices of affected cryptocurrencies or the broader market due to panic selling or negative sentiment. Increased Security Costs: Exchanges are forced to invest heavily in improving their security infrastructure after an attack, which can be costly. For Nobitex, being the largest exchange in Iran, this event carries particular weight for the local crypto community and its confidence in digital asset platforms. Enhancing Cryptocurrency Security Measures In the wake of incidents like the Nobitex exploit , the focus inevitably shifts to enhancing cryptocurrency security . Both exchanges and individual users play a crucial role in mitigating risks. For exchanges, robust security practices are non-negotiable: Cold Storage: Keeping a vast majority of user funds in offline cold storage wallets, inaccessible from the internet. Multi-Signature Wallets: Requiring multiple private keys to authorize transactions, preventing a single point of failure. Regular Security Audits: Conducting frequent third-party audits of smart contracts, infrastructure, and internal processes. Intrusion Detection Systems: Implementing sophisticated systems to monitor for suspicious activity. Employee Training: Educating staff on phishing risks and secure operational procedures. For users, personal security is paramount: Enable 2FA: Always use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), preferably hardware-based, on your exchange accounts. Strong Passwords: Use unique, complex passwords and consider a password manager. Be Wary of Phishing: Verify the legitimacy of emails and websites before entering login details. Withdraw to Personal Wallets: For long-term storage, withdraw significant amounts of crypto from exchanges to hardware or software wallets where you control the private keys. Research Exchanges: Use reputable exchanges with a strong security track record. The Challenge of Digital Asset Loss and Recovery The estimated $48.65 million figure represents a significant digital asset loss . Recovering stolen cryptocurrency is incredibly challenging. While blockchain transactions are transparent and traceable, identifying and apprehending the individuals behind the wallet addresses used in exploits requires significant effort, often involving international cooperation between law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms. Trackers like ZachXBT play a vital role in following the flow of stolen funds across various networks and exchanges, making it harder for attackers to cash out undetected. However, once funds are laundered through mixers, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), or moved across multiple chains, they can become exceedingly difficult to trace back to an identifiable entity. For users affected by the Nobitex exploit, the path to recovery is uncertain. Exchanges sometimes use insurance funds or their own reserves to compensate users for losses, but this is not always guaranteed and depends heavily on the exchange’s policies and financial health. Conclusion: A Persistent Threat The Nobitex exploit on the TRON Network is another unfortunate chapter in the ongoing struggle for security in the cryptocurrency space. The estimated $48.65 million digital asset loss highlights the lucrative target that exchanges represent for malicious actors. This crypto exchange hack underscores the critical need for exchanges to continuously strengthen their cryptocurrency security measures and for users to adopt vigilant personal security practices. While the transparency of the TRON network allows for tracking, the recovery of funds after a large-scale TRON network attack targeting an exchange remains a complex challenge. As the industry matures, improving security infrastructure and user education will be paramount to building a safer ecosystem for everyone.

One name that’s rising fast both in price and attention is Bitcoin Solaris. BTC-S is more than a new chain. It’s an ecosystem built with the performance and scalability that legacy chains like Polygon aimed for but never fully reached. And with a presale explosion already underway, Bitcoin Solaris is now positioning itself to challenge and possibly surpass Polygon’s place in the market. Polygon Was First to Scale Ethereum. But the Game Has Moved On. Polygon brought real solutions to Ethereum’s bottlenecks. With its sidechains and Layer-2 architecture, it opened the floodgates for scalable dApps, especially in DeFi and NFTs. But its success also revealed its limits: centralization concerns, high validator requirements, and reliance on Ethereum’s network stability. Bitcoin Solaris, by contrast, enters with a fresh foundation. It doesn’t just scale another chain. It builds its own parallel architecture from the ground up. And more importantly, it invites the average user in, not just developers. Bitcoin Solaris: A Dual-Layer Engine Designed for Real Growth Bitcoin Solaris is built to go faster, farther, and deeper into mass adoption. Its core structure includes a dual-layer consensus model where the Base Layer runs Proof-of-Work (PoW) for unmatched security, while the Solaris Layer executes transactions at lightning speeds using Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). The result is one of the most efficient and balanced blockchain systems in development. Here’s what powers it: 300-second PoW block time with SHA-256 compatibility 15-second DPoS blocks with 32MB dynamic sizing Validator rotation every 24 hours for decentralization State synchronization between layers for seamless integrity Built-in privacy through Zero-Knowledge Proofs With up to 100,000 transactions per second and 2-second finality, Bitcoin Solaris is a technical beast that doesn’t sacrifice security to achieve speed. Smart Contracts at Lightning Speed: See Why Everyone Loves BTC-S Accessible Mining With Real-World Profitability Where Polygon never offered native mining, Bitcoin Solaris thrives. Through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app, mining becomes as easy as tapping your screen. Whether you’re using a phone, laptop, or full rig, BTC-S empowers anyone to contribute and earn. The system adapts to your device’s capabilities and uses energy-efficient algorithms that operate 99.95% leaner than traditional mining networks. To see what your device could earn, the team has launched a live calculator that breaks it all down by type and performance. Mining isn’t just a backend process anymore. It’s a feature every user can access and benefit from daily. Liquid Staking Without Sacrifice One standout innovation from Bitcoin Solaris is its approach to staking. Instead of locking assets, users who stake receive sBTC-S at a 1:1 ratio, enabling them to remain fully active within the ecosystem. This feature integrates directly with the Solaris Nova app and supports DeFi use cases, governance, and liquidity. Explore the full breakdown here . Key staking advantages include: Passive income without lockups DeFi-ready sBTC-S tokens Enhanced decentralization and validator strength Integrated into a mobile-first experience Presale Firestorm: $5 Million Raised and Climbing Bitcoin Solaris is currently in phase 8 of its presale, priced at $8 per token. With over 11,500 unique buyers onboard, the market momentum is undeniable. The next price jump is to $9, with a final launch price of $20, giving investors a potential 150% return from this point alone. Only around 6 weeks left in the presale Over $5 million raised One of the shortest and most explosive presales in the 2025 cycle For more details and live updates, check out the Bitcoin Solaris website . Influencers Are Paying Attention With so much buzz, it’s no surprise that Bitcoin Solaris is getting serious attention across YouTube and social channels. Reviews by Token Empire and Crypto Show have dissected the project’s architecture, mining tools, staking mechanics, and future plans, with many enthusiasts calling BTC-S the most promising launch of the year. Another feature catching the attention of everyone is Bitcoin Solaris’s daily mini games that reward users and allow a lot of people to increase their earnings before the official release. Final Verdict While Bitcoin continues to hold value, it’s no longer moving markets. Polygon’s structure still works, but has become stagnant. Bitcoin Solaris is the fresh blood the ecosystem needs: bringing user-first mining, lightning-fast finality, and accessible staking into a fully integrated, mobile-driven chain. Whether it’s through scalable tech, inclusive mining, or DeFi-ready staking, BTC-S is coming not just to participate, but to dominate. Polygon opened the door. Bitcoin Solaris plans to walk through it and never look back.

Recent events have sent shockwaves through the Iranian crypto community, specifically impacting users of the Nobitex exchange. A significant security incident involving the Nobitex hack has been reported, raising alarms about the safety of user data and funds. What Happened with the Nobitex Hack? The news broke via prominent blockchain security expert ZachXBT , who communicated through his Telegram channel. According to ZachXBT’s report, the Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex has allegedly been compromised by a hacker group known as “Gonjeshke Darande.” This group has publicly claimed responsibility for the attack. The alleged hackers, Gonjeshke Darande, didn’t just claim the attack; they also provided their purported motives. They accused Nobitex of facilitating financial activities for the Iranian regime, specifically mentioning the financing of terrorism and the evasion of international sanctions. This accusation adds a complex layer of geopolitical context to the security incident. Following their claim of responsibility, the group issued a severe threat: they stated they would release Nobitex’s internal data within a mere 24 hours. This kind of data breach threat is incredibly serious, potentially exposing sensitive information belonging to the exchange and its users. Simultaneously, Gonjeshke Darande issued a stark warning directly to Nobitex users. They urged users to withdraw their funds from the exchange immediately. The group explicitly stated that any assets remaining on the platform after their specified deadline would be at risk. Such a public warning from an alleged attacker is unusual and aims to create panic and potentially trigger a bank run on the exchange. The Financial Fallout: Estimates from ZachXBT While the immediate focus is on the data threat and user safety, the financial implications of the alleged Nobitex hack are also significant. ZachXBT, known for his detailed on-chain analysis and tracking of illicit flows, previously provided an estimate regarding potential losses associated with the attack. According to ZachXBT’s earlier analysis, the exchange may have suffered losses in the range of approximately $48.65 million. It’s important to note that this figure is an estimate and the full extent of any financial loss is yet to be officially confirmed by Nobitex or independent auditors. However, an estimated loss of this magnitude highlights the potential severity of the security breach. Such a substantial figure, even as an estimate, underscores the critical need for robust crypto security measures, especially for exchanges operating in challenging regulatory or geopolitical environments. The potential loss represents a significant amount of value that could impact the exchange’s operations and user confidence. Why Target an Iranian Crypto Exchange? The choice of target – an Iranian crypto exchange – and the stated motives of the hacker group point towards potential geopolitical motivations behind the attack. Iran operates under various international sanctions, which significantly impact its financial system. Cryptocurrency exchanges in such regions can become critical infrastructure for local economies, but also potential targets for groups with political agendas or those seeking to disrupt financial flows they deem illicit. The accusation by Gonjeshke Darande that Nobitex aids the regime in financing terrorism and evading sanctions, while unverified, provides context for their actions. Attacks like this can be attempts to disrupt financial operations, expose individuals or entities allegedly involved in sanction evasion, or simply to cause chaos and erode trust in platforms operating within sanctioned countries. For users within Iran, exchanges like Nobitex often serve as vital gateways to the global cryptocurrency market, enabling participation despite traditional financial restrictions. However, this also places them at higher risk, both from external geopolitical actors and potential domestic issues. The Threat of a Data Breach: What Does it Mean? The threat of a data breach is often as damaging, if not more so, than the loss of funds. User data held by exchanges can include highly sensitive information: Personal identification documents (passports, IDs) Know Your Customer (KYC) verification details Transaction history Wallet addresses Contact information (emails, phone numbers) If this information is leaked, users could face significant risks, including identity theft, phishing attacks, blackmail, or exposure of their crypto activities, which could have legal or personal consequences depending on their location and circumstances. For the exchange itself, a data leak can be catastrophic for reputation and trust. Rebuilding user confidence after sensitive information is compromised is an immense challenge. Regulatory bodies, where applicable, often impose severe penalties for data breaches. The 24-hour deadline issued by the attackers adds urgency to the situation, putting immense pressure on Nobitex to respond and potentially on users to act quickly if they choose to follow the withdrawal warning. What Can Users and Exchanges Learn About Crypto Security? This incident serves as a harsh reminder of the persistent threats in the crypto space. While this specific attack targets an Iranian crypto exchange with unique geopolitical factors, the underlying principles of crypto security are universal. Both exchanges and users must remain vigilant. For Users: Don’t Keep Funds on Exchanges Long-Term: Exchanges are custodial, meaning they hold your private keys. This makes them attractive targets for hackers. For long-term storage, consider using hardware wallets (cold storage) where you control your private keys. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Always enable 2FA on your exchange accounts using an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy) rather than SMS, which can be vulnerable to SIM swap attacks. Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Never reuse passwords across different services. Use a password manager to keep track of complex passwords. Be Wary of Phishing Attempts: Scammers often impersonate exchanges to steal login credentials. Always verify the URL of the website you are visiting and be skeptical of unsolicited emails or messages asking for personal information. Stay Informed: Follow reliable sources like security researchers (such as ZachXBT ) and official exchange channels for updates on potential threats or incidents. For Exchanges: Implement Robust Security Infrastructure: This includes multi-signature wallets, cold storage for a significant portion of assets, regular security audits, intrusion detection systems, and strong access controls. Have an Incident Response Plan: Knowing how to react quickly and effectively during a hack or breach can minimize damage. This includes communication strategies for users and coordination with security experts. Strengthen User Authentication and Authorization: Go beyond basic login security. Educate Users: Provide clear and accessible information to users about security best practices and the risks involved in the crypto space. Monitor for Threats: Continuously monitor network traffic, user activity, and external reports for signs of potential attacks or vulnerabilities. The Role of Security Researchers Like ZachXBT Security researchers like ZachXBT play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem. They often act as independent watchdogs, using their expertise to track suspicious transactions, identify potential scams, and report on security incidents before official confirmations are made or widely publicized. Their work helps to alert the community and provide valuable insights into the methods and potential impacts of attacks. While their findings are sometimes preliminary, they contribute significantly to transparency and risk awareness in a space that can be opaque. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty After the Nobitex Incident The alleged Nobitex hack and the subsequent threat of a data breach by the group Gonjeshke Darande highlight the persistent and evolving security risks faced by cryptocurrency exchanges and their users globally, with added complexities in regions like Iran. While the full details and consequences are still unfolding, the incident serves as a critical reminder. For users of the affected Iranian crypto exchange , the situation is particularly stressful, emphasizing the need for immediate action if they deem it necessary based on the warnings. For the broader crypto community, it underscores the non-negotiable importance of robust crypto security practices, both at the institutional level for exchanges and at the individual level for users managing their digital assets. Staying informed through reliable sources, understanding the risks, and taking proactive steps to secure digital assets are essential in this dynamic environment. The incident also brings attention to the complex interplay between technology, finance, and geopolitics in the age of cryptocurrencies.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near 42,246, up 30 points at the open, while the benchmark U.S. index S&P 500 held near record highs with a gain of 0.01%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite was flat, up just 0.01%. All three major indices were slightly in the green but remained constrained as the Middle East conflict weighed heavily on investor confidence. Israel-Iran war weighs on markets While stocks looked to hold onto recent gains, markets lacked upside conviction. On Wednesday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that the country would not surrender to Israel . The Iranian leader’s comments came after President Donald Trump posted that Iran had to surrender unconditionally, with speculation rife that the United States is set to join the conflict. Khamenei warned that U.S. involvement would be “to its own detriment.” The US entering in this matter [war] is 100% to its own detriment.

Liu pointed out that the use of stablecoins could transform payment systems in e-commerce and reduce costs in cross-border transactions. Additionally, JD.com’s platform serving the Hong Kong and Macau region, JD Global Sale, is preparing to integrate payment support with stablecoins. The move is seen as an important part of JD's growing strategy in Web3 technologies and digital financial solutions.

The Genius Act received enough bipartisan support to pass the Senate and reach the next round of scrutiny. Eighteen Democrats joined the Republicans to vote for the bill. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to real-world assets such as the US dollar. The crypto industry has witnessed a strange turn of events, from experiencing a draconian ‘war on crypto’ under the previous administration to a sudden supportive President Trump creating very generous incentives for the crypto industry. However, the change of context comes after the crypto industry pumped over $131 million into the Trump campaign. Some Republicans voted against the bill, such as Rand Paul, who is sceptical about the Genius Act and its generous concessions to the technology sector, particularly big tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon. However, big tech firms such as Amazon and Meta will be barred from enjoying the use of stablecoins if they do not provide consumer protections regarding data security and financial safety rails. The Genius Act provides other protections for consumers, such as an extra set of provisions that give stablecoin holders priority in an economic crisis, so that banks or companies are barred from using the reserve dollar to steal customers’ funds. Therefore, if a stablecoin issuer faces a crisis, stablecoin holders will receive priority when withdrawing their funds. The largest banks of America, including Bank of America, lobbied hard to bar non-established banks from issuing stablecoins. Such a move would have monopolized an innovation invented to protect Americans from corrupt banks. Circle, a stablecoin issuer and Nasdaq-listed company, may benefit from the Genesis Act because it has invested heavily in its own USDC token. Shareholders have boosted Circle’s price, possibly to take advantage of the new regulatory environment. A company spokesperson commended the senators for passing the act and stated that the new legislation could preserve the US dollar in a new technological age. The company further commended both Republicans and Democrats for supporting legislation that promotes innovation while protecting consumers at the same time. The new bill now has to pass the House of Representatives, and if it passes, it will be placed on President Trump’s desk to be signed into law. Elizabeth Warren , a senator who opposed the bill, accused it of placing more power into the hands of a few tech billionaires, who will use the Genius Act to abuse their customers by accessing their financial data. Warren calls the legislation a “weak bill” and is concerned that wealthy companies will use the new laws to control money more insidiously. Warren has advocated against banks having too much power to prevent a financial crisis from occurring in the future. Warren argues that the Genesis Act allows banks and corporations to have greater freedoms with the use of stablecoins, which traditional financial institutions are usually restricted from enjoying. The greater freedoms seem to bypass the regulations that resulted from the 2008 financial crisis. Ironically, Bitcoin was invented to circumvent the corrupt banks that were given a bailout during the financial crash. Warren predicts that America will experience a massive financial crisis in the next two years due to the deregulation of traditional markets. The House of Representatives is still waiting on the outcome of the Clarity Act, which aims to provide more certainty about the rules of digital assets. Democrats who oppose the Genius Act also oppose the Clarity Act for similar reasons, namely that the two bills conspire against working-class Americans and will ultimately benefit a select few billionaires and their companies.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-18 14:06:28

The passage of the landmark Genius Act in the U.S. Senate has signaled a major shift in crypto regulation. According to industry experts, the change it could bring is hard to overstate. Stablecoins are on track to become part of a core trillion-dollar industry and transform everyday life for consumers. Ira Auerbach, Head of Tandem at Offchain Labs, believes this regulatory clarity removes a major roadblock for adoption. The Genius Act has the potential to bring billions in institutional capital into the industry, already validated by the Circle IPO . He said in a note sent to crypto.news: “By providing definitive regulatory guardrails for stablecoins, it clears the final major hurdle for institutional adoption, Auerbach stated. This regulatory catalyst… unlocks immense capital and innovation.” This capital inflow will be transformative for the entire decentralized finance space, says Erbil Karaman, Co-Founder of Huma Finance. It will elevate stablecoins from speculative tools to “indispensable financial infrastructure,” he believes. “As stablecoins begin to surge towards Citibank’s projected $1.6 trillion market by 2030, the game-changing infrastructure won’t just be the stablecoins themselves—it will be the payment financing layer that transforms them into powerful tools for global commerce,” Erbil Karaman, co-founder of Huma Finance, seperately stated.

Genius Act to boost global adoption Regulatory clarity is what major institutions have been waiting for, said John McCarthy, General Counsel at the DeFi lending protocol Morpho. This applies not just to U.S. firms, but also to institutions around the world. “That clarity likely will usher in numerous new issuers and drive adoption by institutions and retail alike for everything from payments to settlement to lending. It also sends a very strong signal globally,” McCarthy stated. I would expect other countries to look very carefully at passing their own laws to enable tokenized forms of money.” Other countries are already watching developments in the U.S., said Evan Auyang, Group President of Animoca Brands. Hong Kong, where the gaming company is headquartered, was an early mover, but now needs to act decisively, Auyang explained. “Asset tokenisation is an inevitability, and for Hong Kong to preserve the city’s financial leadership, it needs to make stablecoins a strategic priority to ensure its success,” Auyang stated.

These products will soon resemble traditional apps more than complex DeFi protocols. “With improving regulations like the Genius Act, major platforms will soon onboard millions,” said Gosselin. “The future will see stablecoins powering everyday experiences without users needing to understand the complexity,” he added. This growing adoption could transform everyday life for consumers, said Lane Rettig, Head of Research at the NEAR Foundation. One promising use case is remittances—but Rettig emphasized that regulators must leave room for startups to innovate. “Stablecoins, especially dollar stablecoins, can help everyday families by making remittances faster, safer, and cheaper, and protecting their savings from inflation,” Retting stated. “But regulation, including this act, shouldn’t place too much of a compliance burden on cryptocurrency startups, and should ensure the right of ordinary citizens to privacy.” You might also like: Hong Kong accelerates stablecoin licensing to tap into global market boom Stablecoins could become a risk to privacy Wider stablecoin adoption also creates a tangible risk to privacy, with some comparing them to central bank digital currencies. Rob Viglione, Co-Founder of Horizen Labs, one of the earliest zero-knowledge projects, launched in 2017, warns that privacy must be built into any stablecoin framework. “Without privacy by design, stablecoins risk becoming programmable surveillance tools similar to CBDCs,” Viglione stated. Zero-knowledge proofs, FHE, and encrypted smart contracts prove that privacy and compliance can coexist. If we want stablecoins to serve everyone, not just institutions, we need to build for both,” he added.

While $BTC is just hanging on with its price in the green, the vast majority of altcoins have sunk into the red. Will Bitcoin join them, or can it continue to hold the line? Chaos and uncertainty continue to reign The current chaotic and dreadfully uncertain world is continuing to be so. The Israel/Iran conflict is persisting, and the Russia/Ukraine war is proving to be extremely difficult to resolve. The recent G7 summit was not able to come to an accord with which to show a united front on the conflict in Ukraine due to resistance from the US, therefore uncertainty reigns, and markets will have a hard time pricing in what may come. $BTC quick drop into the red Source: TradingView At time of writing, the $BTC price has now fallen into the red and is in danger of dropping through the $104,400 support. This can certainly take place, although as long as the price does not fall below $100,440, which is the last big swing low, there is still hope for the bulls. What would perhaps be expected is that either the $104,400 horizontal support level will actually hold, or that another candle wick could take the price down to the area of $103,000. Ascending trendline lends support Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame it can be noted that an ascending trendline could also lend its weight to halting the current slide in price. There is the possibility that a wick could shoot down through both ascending trendline and support, but $BTC is entering an oversold condition now and it may not be long before the downward price action reverses and is bought back up. At the bottom of the chart, the daily RSI does have the indicator line below the yellow moving average, and it is also dropping below the 50.00 level. This is fairly bearish, so a return above that 50.00 support level will need to occur. Bearish weekly outlook, but plenty of time left for a change Source: TradingView Concerns are also appearing on the weekly time frame. It can be seen that if the support does not hold, a dip that could even take the price below $100,000 could take place. Moving through the indicators at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has its indicator lines poised to potentially drop through the very important 80.00 level. The RSI indicator line has a downward trajectory, which could see it cross below the yellow moving average, while the MACD indicator at the bottom of the chart is showing a roll over of the indicator lines, at the same time that the light green histogram columns are getting smaller. All the above is pointing to a quite bearish scenario. However, we are not even half way through the week. All the shorter-term momentum indicators have bottomed for $BTC and an upward impulse would be expected to take place, and soon. How strong the next upward surge can be will likely have an impact on whether the price will keep rolling over, or whether all the indicators can tip back to the upside and propel Bitcoin back to the all-time high.

For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding AI’s broader societal implications is key, as these technologies often intersect. Now, a powerful voice has entered the fray: Pope Leo XIV is making the potential AI Threat Humanity a central focus of his papacy, raising profound questions for innovators and policymakers alike. Understanding the Vatican AI Stance Pope Leo XIV is positioning the challenge posed by AI as a defining issue of his time. This mirrors the historical precedent set by his namesake, Leo XIII, who championed the rights of factory workers during the transformative Gilded Age. By invoking this history, the Pope signals that the church sees parallels between the societal upheaval caused by rapid industrialization in the late 19th century and the potential disruption brought by AI today. Speaking to cardinals, Pope Leo XIV indicated he would draw upon centuries of church social teaching to address AI innovations. His core concerns revolve around: Human Dignity: How AI impacts the inherent value and rights of individuals. Justice: Ensuring AI systems are fair and do not exacerbate inequalities. Labor: The effects of automation on employment and the nature of work. This firm Vatican AI Stance represents a significant moral and ethical challenge to the technology sector. Addressing the AI Threat Humanity When the Pope speaks of the AI Threat Humanity , he is not necessarily predicting a sci-fi apocalypse, but rather focusing on the concrete risks AI poses to human society and well-being. These threats are seen as impacting the very fabric of human life and interaction. The Vatican’s perspective emphasizes that technology must serve humanity, not the other way around. Key aspects of this perceived threat include: The potential for widespread job displacement due to automation. Ethical dilemmas in AI decision-making, particularly in sensitive areas like healthcare or law enforcement. The risk of bias embedded in algorithms, leading to discrimination. The impact on human relationships and social structures as AI becomes more integrated into daily life. The challenge of maintaining human autonomy and agency in an AI-driven world. The Pope’s focus highlights that these are not just technical issues, but fundamental moral and social ones. The Push for AI Regulation Vatican Style To counter these challenges and shape the global dialogue on AI, the Vatican has become a vocal advocate for international cooperation. Specifically, it is pushing for a binding international treaty on AI. This call for formal AI Regulation Vatican style aims to establish ethical guardrails and legal frameworks on a global scale. The Vatican believes a treaty is necessary to: Ensure AI development aligns with humanistic values. Prevent a regulatory race to the bottom among nations. Provide a universal standard for addressing AI’s risks. This stance puts the Vatican in direct contrast with many in the tech industry who argue that heavy regulation could stifle innovation and slow progress. Tech Giants Vatican Interactions Aware of the Vatican’s moral authority and potential influence on policymakers worldwide, Tech Giants Vatican engagement has been ongoing for years. Leaders from major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Cisco have made trips to Rome, meeting with Vatican officials. Their aim is often to present their vision of AI as a force for good, highlighting its potential benefits and downplaying the risks, essentially attempting to shape the narrative and preempt strict regulation. These interactions demonstrate the tech industry’s recognition of the Vatican as a significant player in the global ethical conversation, alongside governments, academics, and civil society organizations. However, the Pope’s recent, more forceful stance suggests these engagements have not fully alleviated the Holy See’s concerns about the direction and impact of AI. Conclusion: A Moral Compass for the AI Age? Pope Leo XIV’s decision to make the potential threat of AI to humanity a signature issue elevates the conversation from a purely technical or economic one to a fundamental moral and ethical debate. By drawing on the church’s long history of addressing societal change, the Vatican aims to provide a humanistic framework for navigating the complexities of the AI revolution. This call for global AI Regulation Vatican -style challenges the tech industry and urges policymakers to prioritize human dignity, justice, and labor rights as AI technology continues its rapid advancement. The world watches to see what influence this powerful moral voice will have on the future of artificial intelligence.

Key Takeaways: BlackRock’s BUIDL fund will soon be accepted as collateral on Crypto.com and Deribit. The fund offers a 4.5% annual yield, giving traders a less volatile, income-generating alternative. The integration may expand further as Coinbase moves to acquire Deribit. Until now, crypto traders have had to choose between parking stablecoins that earn nothing or pledging volatile assets like BTC or ETH that could plummet in value. With BUIDL, they would be able to post yield-generating collateral with less price risk. BUIDL’s 4.5% Yield Offers Traders Capital Efficiency Without Volatility Currently yielding around 4.5% annually, BUIDL gives traders a way to earn while they wait and opens the door to lower margin requirements. “This is a major turning point,” Michael Sonnenshein, COO of Securitize, which partnered with BlackRock to issue BUIDL onchain, told Forbes . “Tokenized securities are evolving from passive capital to programmable, productive assets.” BUIDL launched in March 2024 and has already attracted $2.9 billion in assets. Its largest holders include Ondo Finance and Ethena Labs, two key players in the real-world asset (RWA) and stablecoin space. Now, its footprint is expanding into crypto’s trading core. Crypto.com, which serves over 140 million users, plans to offer BUIDL as collateral across spot, margin, derivatives, and OTC services for institutional clients in select jurisdictions. Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange, will support BUIDL for futures and options trading, as well as on its spot exchange. Until now, most of Deribit’s collateral has been in Bitcoin. Big news! @BlackRock ’s tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, $BUIDL , issued via @Securitize , is now live on Deribit. Trade it. Earn yield. Use it as collateral. 0% spot fees Daily rewards on holdings Use it as cross-collateral from 20 June Learn more … pic.twitter.com/EtZZEtzGOS — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) June 18, 2025 “For us, it’s about choice and efficiency,” said Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers. “The majority of our users are institutional, and many hold cash, not crypto. They don’t want to lose yield just to get access to leverage.” The move may have wider implications. Coinbase is currently acquiring Deribit in a $2.9 billion deal. If completed, it could bring BUIDL’s use case into Coinbase’s broader infrastructure, accelerating the presence of tokenized Treasurys across U.S. markets and crypto trading platforms alike. Tokenization Market Could Reach $16T by 2030 A report by the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) and Boston Consulting Group estimates the global value of tokenized illiquid assets will reach $16 trillion by 2030 . Even more conservative estimates from Citigroup suggest that $4 trillion to $5 trillion worth of tokenized digital securities could be minted by 2030. Recognizing this potential, major companies are making significant moves in the tokenization space. Goldman Sachs, for instance, plans to launch three new tokenization products later this year, driven by growing client interest. Some protocols have played a significant role in driving this growth, particularly in terms of active users. Digital carbon market platforms like Toucan and KlimaDAO, as well as the real estate tokenization protocol Propy, have experienced substantial user growth.

Dubai, UAE – In a stunning show of momentum and integrity, BROCCOLI ($F2B) has erupted past $5 million in daily trading volume, capturing the attention of the global crypto scene. Following one of the cleanest and boldest acts in DeFi history—the founder burning 81.5% of the token supply just days after launch—BROCCOLI’s rise has been nothing short of revolutionary. The movement gained even more legitimacy when the project’s CTO was seen alongside CZ at Binance Demo Day, solidifying BROCCOLI’s position at the center of crypto’s cultural and financial evolution. As the broader crypto landscape struggles with hype cycles, centralized manipulation, and short-term speculation, BROCCOLI is cutting through the noise with a mission rooted in transparency, cultural value, and community-driven growth. Dubbed the “Meme Redeemer,” $F2B stands as a purpose-driven alternative—not just following in the footsteps of DOGE and SHIB, but evolving their legacy into something deeper, more sustainable, and globally relevant. Born of Purpose, Fueled by Community BROCCOLI didn’t launch with corporate backing or influencer deals. It was born from conviction. With zero KOL payments, no VC funds, and no marketing budget, it has grown into DeFi’s most organic and resilient community. Thousands of songs, videos, and microfilm series have been created by the community, for the community, spanning across 70+ countries. It’s already listed on 10 major exchanges, featured in Binance Alpha, and now on the radar for a potential Binance Spot listing. But what truly sets BROCCOLI apart is its origin story: On day 3 post-launch, the founder burned 81.5% of the total supply, tokens he personally purchased. This act of radical transparency instantly made BROCCOLI one of the cleanest projects in crypto history, with a bubble map as pure as its purpose. BROCCOLI: A Movement, Not a Moment BROCCOLI (ticker: $F2B) is not a gamble; it’s a culture-driven ecosystem powered by its community and fueled by a groundbreaking innovation: Proof of Labor (PoL). This is the first meme coin that rewards actual contributions from developers and marketers to content creators and educators. If you build, you earn. “We’re not just building wealth; we’re building history,” says the BROCCOLI core team. “While others obsess over pumps, we produce culture, elevate voices, and educate communities.” Based in Dubai, the world’s crypto capital, the BROCCOLI team serves as leading representation ambassadors for the decentralized movement. The project is now a fixture at major national and international events, including Crypto 2024 Global Summit, Binance Blockchain Demo Day, Binance Clubhouse Gatherings, Token2049 Dubai, Future Blockchain Summit and many more. With a powerful IP narrative inspired by CZ’s real-life dog, a symbol of loyalty, resilience, and quiet strength, BROCCOLI reclaims the soul of crypto. DOGE had Elon. BROCCOLI has CZ’s dog. Where will the world’s most iconic crypto figure take us next? Core Values That Define BROCCOLI Proof of Labor (PoL): A first-of-its-kind model that rewards real contributions, not idle staking. Global Reach: Active in over 70 countries with upcoming merchant integrations. Cultural Juggernaut: 24+ original songs, viral videos, and growing media campaigns. Fair Launch + Historic Burn: No presale. No VCs. The founder burned 81.5% of the supply forever. True DAO Governance: 100% community-driven with zero centralized manipulation. Skyrocketing Momentum: Over $5 million in daily trading volume in the past two weeks. Led by Real Builders BROCCOLI is now helmed by a CTO team with decades of experience in both DeFi and traditional finance, leaders who have overseen multi-billion-dollar projects. It’s no longer a grassroots movement, it’s a maturing force built for longevity, scalability, and real-world impact. Join the Meme Redeemer Movement Crypto doesn’t need another empty token.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SUI surges into the spotlight with a bullish golden cross and growing institutional interest, while Neo Pepe shatters presale milestones with its gamified, community-first approach. Table of Contents Rising institutional interest points to bright future for SUI Neo Pepe shatters presale expectations, exceeding $1.3m Crypto League: Neo Pepe cuts through the noise NEOP: Beyond leading memecoin status Conclusion SUI ( SUI ) is currently igniting substantial interest across cryptocurrency markets, particularly due to the recent formation of a golden cross. This technical indicator is an extremely positive signal, occurring when the shorter-term 50-day moving average surpasses the longer-term 200-day moving average. Historically, this specific crossover has been a reliable precursor to significant price rallies. For instance, a similar event notably propelled SUI from $1.09 to a remarkable $5.35, reflecting a spectacular 380% increase in late 2024. Investor enthusiasm surrounding SUI is further intensified by its strengthened alliance with Real Vision, one of the world’s leading financial media platforms. This strategic partnership focuses on innovative blockchain technology by integrating rewarding on-chain mechanisms designed to significantly enhance user engagement and bolster widespread adoption. Institutional interest remains robust, underscored by ETF filings from influential financial institutions such as Canary Capital and 21Shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Such actions are indicative of heightened institutional credibility and growing acknowledgment of SUI’s potential within mainstream investment circles. Despite its recent range-bound price movements between $2.94 and $3.45, analysts predict a significant upward trajectory if SUI convincingly breaches the $3.50–$4.00 resistance zone. Rising institutional interest points to bright future for SUI Institutional momentum surrounding SUI continues to gather pace, highlighted by Nasdaq’s recent application to list the 21Shares SUI ETF. This pivotal development symbolizes SUI’s leap into mainstream financial infrastructure, occurring after a staggering $300 million global influx into various SUI-linked exchange-traded products. These substantial investments underscore firm institutional confidence in SUI’s reliability, efficiency, and scalability. Supported by a flourishing DeFi ecosystem and influential strategic partnerships, SUI is exceptionally well-positioned for deeper institutional adoption. This heightened institutional presence promises improved liquidity and visibility within global investment portfolios, significantly elevating investor expectations and optimism regarding SUI’s long-term potential and market dominance.
