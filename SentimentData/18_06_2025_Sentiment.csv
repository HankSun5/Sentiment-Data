Deal Gives Justin Sun’s Father Control of Public Firm Via $100M Token Deal,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/17/tron-inc-deal-gives-justin-suns-father-control-of-public-firm-via-100m-token-deal,"A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing posted Monday night outlines the relationship between Tron DAO, Justin Sun, and SRM Entertainment, a Nevada company in the process of changing its name to Tron Inc. The filing details a $100 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, paid entirely in TRX TRX tokens, that gives Sun’s father, Weike Sun, board control and positions Tron-aligned advisors in key governance roles. Weike was named chairman, while Zhihong Liu, also known as Steve Liu, a strategic adviser to Tron DAO and the CEO of stablecoin issuer Techteryx, and Zi Yang, a senior executive at Tronscan, joined the board’s audit, compensation, and nominating committees, according to the filing. The deal was structured as a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal. An investment vehicle owned by Weike purchased 100,000 shares of SRM Series B preferred Stock via TRX tokens, convertible into 200 million common shares, and received 220 million warrants at a strike price of $0.50. Despite the appearance of alignment, Tron DAO has no direct investment, governance rights, or formal role in the SRM deal, said Liu. ""Tron DAO is not really any part of the deal for SRM. It’s more of the senior Sun's transaction."" The DAO itself is not mentioned in the 8K filing either. Its influence appears to be indirect, reflected through the backgrounds of newly appointed board members tied to the Tron ecosystem. According to the Financial Times , the renamed firm plans to buy and hold up to $210 million worth of TRX, similar to how MicroStrategy built a bitcoin-based corporate treasury. The deal was arranged by Dominari Securities, a brokerage affiliated with Dominari Holdings, whose advisory board includes Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and is located within Trump Tower in Manhattan. Dominari Securities was paid $50,000 for the counsel for the transaction, according to the 8K filing. SRM, the listed Tron entity, is down 15%, trading at $7.73 as the market closed in New York. The TRX token is down 2.5%, trading at $0.27.",Markets|Justin Sun|Tron|TRX|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-17 22:28:33

This allows the nation’s highest court the opportunity to determine whether the president has the authority to implement some of his most severe trade policies in history. The two companies responsible are Learning Resources Inc. and hand2mind Inc. They have asked the Supreme Court to look over their case quickly. This court has recently let cases with equal (or less) far-reaching political and economic importance be reviewed quickly. “Whether the President has authority to impose tariffs…is of such imperative importance that it warrants review now,” the toy companies said in their Tuesday filing to the Supreme Court. The toy companies argue their case based on JPMorgan’s analysis The toy companies had already won a victory before US District Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington, but the decision was narrow in scope. However, Trump filed an appeal, and now the businesses want to skip that fight and go straight to the United States Supreme Court. Their argument in their petition to the court is based on an analysis by JPMorgan that shows that the round of Trump tariffs at issue would hike taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year. This is the largest tax increase in recent memory by a long shot and caused prices to surge by adding 2% to the Consumer Price Index. Due to the high tariffs, the nation’s overall average effective tariff rate has gone from 2.5% to around 27% since the start of the year. This is more than a tenfold rise and the highest for the US in over a century. Before its summer break starts at the end of this month, the companies want the Supreme Court to decide if it will take this case. This would allow for possible arguments in the fall. Another case of tariff in the waiting All of the challengers to Trump’s tariffs are arguing that the administration’s claims for the tariffs, including a national emergency caused by illegal immigration and flows of illegal drugs from overseas, were unauthorized because they did not directly address the stated emergency. A three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade (CIT) sided with a group of small companies in May when they said Trump didn’t have the power to carry out his “Liberation Day” duties under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA). The Trump administration appealed that decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. The court allowed Trump to keep the tariffs in place while it figures out if the president has the legal power to do so. The oral arguments are set to begin on July 31. Trump’s administration is ready to defend itself Legal experts have known for a long time that the Supreme Court would finally rule on whether Trump’s reasons for raising tariffs are legal. This could mean the “major questions doctrine” will be a problem for the Trump administration. This doctrine says that federal agencies can’t act on “vast economic and political significance” issues unless Congress explicitly permits them to do so. However, Trump’s lawyers are set to use Nixon as an example to show that his global tariffs will finally be upheld in court. As part of a set of economic measures called the “Nixon shock” about fifty years ago, the 37th president placed 10% duties on goods without consulting anyone else. These duties were challenged in court in a way that is similar to how Trump’s 2025 tariffs have been challenged.

Integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI has emerged as a top contender for exponential growth, with a 12,900% ROI forecast making it a standout. Experts are calling it a must-buy for those aiming to make strategic investment moves. Here’s why Ruvi AI is dominating conversations and why its trajectory has investors rushing to secure their stake. Why Analysts Are Bullish on Ruvi AI Unlike speculative tokens that rise and fall on hype alone, Ruvi AI grounds its value in real-world utility and structured growth . Tackling critical challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance , Ruvi AI uses AI-powered solutions to provide scalable, in-demand technologies. The project’s presale model offers an even more attractive proposition. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2 , the token’s post-presale price is set to climb to $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x return for early investors. Analysts forecast far higher returns post-listing, with a potential valuation of $1 per token equating to an incredible 12,900% gain for early adopters. This structured roadmap gives Ruvi AI a huge edge over projects relying on unpredictable market conditions. Presale Success Underlines Ruvi AI’s Momentum With over $1.8 million raised thus far, Ruvi AI’s presale has been a testament to the trust and confidence investors have in the project. Over 1,600 holders are already on board, solidifying Ruvi AI as one of the fastest-growing cryptos before its public debut. The presale’s price-fixed model ensures a predictable and secure investment opportunity. Early buyers lock in the lower Phase 2 price and benefit from the guaranteed increase to $0.07 per token after the presale ends. This stability, combined with significant flexibility via scalable investments, makes Ruvi AI an ideal choice for smart investors. VIP Investment Tiers Maximize Growth Potential Ruvi AI sweetens the deal with VIP investment tiers , offering significant bonuses for those who want to maximize their returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers are tailored to reward larger investments with higher bonuses, allowing participants to unlock exponential returns during Ruvi AI’s early growth phases. Transparency and Security Drive Investor Trust Ruvi AI isn’t just about potential gains; it’s also about building trust and security for its community. The project is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a leading blockchain security firm, ensuring the infrastructure is entirely reliable and secure. This audit reassures investors that their funds are protected and the project adheres to high operational standards. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , a globally recognized trading platform, to provide post-presale liquidity . This collaboration ensures that Ruvi AI tokens will have seamless accessibility and trading options once the presale concludes, giving investors confidence in their ability to trade effectively. Real-World Applications Ensure Sustainable Demand Beyond its presale success, Ruvi AI distinguishes itself with broad adoption potential across three major industries. Marketing Ruvi AI empowers businesses with AI-driven tools that enhance ad targeting, engagement, and ROI. These capabilities are essential for modern organizations seeking to optimize their campaigns. Entertainment With blockchain-secured payments and AI-enhanced content recommendations, Ruvi AI improves how creators monetize while providing personalized user experiences. Finance Ruvi AI strengthens financial operations by offering fraud detection tools and operational transparency, helping the finance sector evolve with innovative solutions. These utility-driven applications ensure Ruvi AI’s token demand will remain strong, supported by sustainable market relevance rather than fleeting hype. Why Ruvi AI Is the Opportunity of 2025 While the crypto market is crowded, few projects offer the combination of structured growth , real-world utility , and transparency that Ruvi AI delivers. With its 12,900% ROI forecast and affordable starting price of $0.015 , Ruvi AI creates a compelling narrative for investors chasing exponential rewards. Backed by over $1.8 million raised , 1,600+ holders , a CyberScope audit , and a WEEX Exchange partnership , Ruvi AI is uniquely positioned to rise as a leader in blockchain and AI innovation.

According to analysts, the popular altcoin saw a dramatic 700% surge earlier last year. Now, its price is positioned to exit a seven-month consolidation phase, which could set it up for its next bullish move. XRP Gets Ready For Major Bullish Move A recently published technical chart by market expert ‘Crypto Michael’ on X (formerly Twitter) reveals that XRP has been consolidating for seven months following a staggering 700% price rally, which was triggered by a breakout from a multi-year Symmetrical Triangle pattern. The chart, based on a 3-month candlestick, shows that XRP had been in a major price compression within the triangle pattern for seven years. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance True to form, XRP finally broke above the upper trendline of the pennant in late 2024, igniting one of its most powerful quarterly rallies to date. This breakout led to a price surge of about 700%, pushing the cryptocurrency from around $0.6 to over $2. Since the dramatic breakout, XRP has entered a stabilization phase, trading sideways in what appears to be a healthy consolidation range. The chart highlights this consolidation area with a white circle, indicating a well-defined post-breakout phase. Notably, XRP’s $2.15 price at the time of the analysis is above prior resistance levels, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is maintaining strength while waiting for its next bullish catalyst. Crypto Michael points out that XRP’s consolidation is ending just as Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, approaches a critical juncture: the “8-year line.” This correlation suggests that a broader shift in market sentiment may be underway. Historically, leading altcoins like XRP have followed Bitcoin’s lead during broader market rallies. If BTC successfully breaks through this long-standing line, Crypto Michael believes it could serve as a macro trigger that ignites a fresh bullish move for XRP. Analyst Says The Altcoin Is Set To Explode Against BTC A fresh analysis by Egrag Crypto, a crypto analyst on X, suggests that the XRP/BTC pair could be on the edge of a major breakout. The pair has followed a consistent cycle for over a decade, with lows in 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2024—each succeeded by strong rallies. These lows align with a rising trendline, signaling possible long-term strength. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Structure Remains Bullish: Analyst Releases 3 New Targets Now, XRP/BTC is approaching a key resistance level that has blocked past rallies since 2015. This time, however, Egrag Crypto suggests that the setup looks different and slightly more favorable for a breakout. If the pair breaks above this multi-year ceiling, it could mark a major turning point, effectively leading XRP into an explosive bullish phase. The analyst’s chart outlines two potential paths: a green breakout zone if XRP pushes higher and a red rejection zone if it fails to break this key resistance again.

Unlike previous speculative comments, Claver has now associated this projection with a specific timeframe, approximately two years. In a recently shared video on X , Claver outlined his argument for why a higher XRP price is essential for the network to efficiently support large-scale institutional transactions. His perspective builds on earlier technical insights from Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, who once explained that the number of XRP tokens needed for a transaction is inversely proportional to the asset’s price. For example, transferring $1 million at a token value of $1 would require 1 million XRP. If the token were priced at $10, only 100,000 units would be needed for the same transaction. According to Claver, this relationship illustrates how increasing the token’s price could enhance the XRP Ledger’s transactional efficiency. Does XRP need to be a certain price to move large amounts of money? pic.twitter.com/tbqBbvST4y — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) May 27, 2025 Increased Valuation as a Path to Liquidity Efficiency Claver further elaborated that at current prices, roughly $2 per token, XRP lacks the liquidity required to process transactions involving trillions of dollars. Based on his analysis, a valuation of $10,000 per token would provide the liquidity needed to handle institutional-scale transfers, implying a theoretical market cap of more than $500 trillion. Despite the astronomical figure, Claver maintains that such a valuation is technically necessary for XRP to fulfill its role in large-scale cross-border financial operations. He emphasized that the XRP Ledger’s design allows it to scale its liquidity capabilities in tandem with price increases, making the token more effective at higher valuations. Skepticism and Market Criticism Unsurprisingly, the claim has been met with significant criticism from various financial commentators. One major point of contention is the implication that XRP could achieve a total market capitalization vastly exceeding the size of the current global economy. Critics argue that this renders the prediction implausible, regardless of the underlying logic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Among the skeptics is Alex Caraco, former CEO of an Australian stock market firm, who questioned the practicality of such predictions. He expressed concern that retail investors may be misled by exaggerated price targets, especially those tied to short timelines. Others in the cryptocurrency space have echoed this sentiment, pointing out that even with the development of futures markets and institutional adoption, a $10,000 valuation within two years would require extraordinary demand and systemic changes in global finance. While Claver’s projection remains speculative, it reflects a broader discussion within the XRP community about the token’s long-term potential and the infrastructure required to support institutional-scale transactions.

However, Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, has failed both as a safe haven anda FOMO asset. As is often the case, its underwhelming performance has spilled over to other crypto majors. Even so, its upside potential is significant. As the markets eye the ongoing conflicts, a recovery is still likely. Bitcoin price fails as a safe haven amid the geopolitical tensions The initial attack by Israeli forces on Iranian nuclear sites late last week yielded the expected moves; Brent crude oil price surged by about 7%, gold price rallied by 1.5%, and stocks dropped worldwide. Interestingly, Bitcoin, which is usually referred to as digital gold, failed to live up to its position as a safe haven. In fact, the leading cryptocurrency dropped to a one-week low on Friday; extending losses recorded in the previous two sessions. Like gold, Bitcoin’s tight supply boosts its status as a store of value. However, the rebound of the US dollar in the wake of the Israel-Iran conflict has capped its upward momentum. Even so, it bears high upside potential amid the persistent uncertainties. At a crypto fear & greed index of 50, the traders appear indecisive. However, a bullish undertone is observable. Data released by SoSoValue showed that US BTC spot ETFs had daily total net inflows of $412.20 million as of 16th June. With no outflows, the top 6 ETFs recorded inflows with BlackRock’s IBIT leading with inflows of $266.60 million. Besides, as highlighted by CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s trading volume rose by 25.87% over the past 24 hours. A surge in trading volume usually points to increased investor interest. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView In the short term, Bitcoin price is likely to trade within the range of between $106,309 and $101,370 as the markets continue to weigh in on the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict. Notably, the bullish golden-cross pattern that has been in place for close to two months now confirms a continuation of the uptrend. With the attraction of more buyers, the bulls will be looking to retest Monday’s high of $108,900. Bearish pattern shapes Ripple price path as XRP lawsuit drags on As the Ripple Labs – SEC lawsuit drags on and the broader crypto market remains in a neutral mode, Ripple price is still under pressure. A look at its daily chart shows the altcoin still trading below the descending trendline. At the time of press, the crypto major was trading below the 25 and 50-day EMAs that appear to be converging around $2.24. Amid the traders’ indecisiveness, the range between $2.10 and $2.27 is worth watching. Even with the possible recovery, it will likely face resistance at May’s level of $2.39.

With the indecisiveness in the broader crypto market, $156 remains a pivot worth watching. This makes the range between $140 and $167 worth watching.

Qubetics (TICS) has captured serious attention in this emerging class, especially in its final presale stage. With its aim to solve cross-border friction for professionals, businesses, and Web3 platforms, Qubetics is quickly gaining traction as one of the best 100x crypto assets of the year. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) and Aptos (APT) also show strength, posting healthy daily gains amid renewed momentum in the altcoin market. Though distinct in scope, these three projects form a compelling trio for investors seeking utility, scalability, and near-term upside. Qubetics Final Presale: Redefining Cross-Border Transactions with Real-World Utility Qubetics has officially entered its final public crypto presale phase, offering a fixed $0.3370 price for its remaining 10 million $TICS tokens. The platform has already raised over $18 million, selling more than 516 million tokens to 28,000+ holders. With a sharp supply cut—from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion—the tokenomics now favor scarcity-driven growth, positioning $TICS as a best 100x crypto prospect. At its core, Qubetics tackles one of blockchain’s most pressing challenges: costly, slow, and fragmented cross-border transfers. Its solution? A high-speed, low-fee infrastructure capable of handling near-instant settlements across borders. Whether you’re a DeFi trader or a business accepting international payments, the platform offers a smoother experience than legacy remittance platforms. A major differentiator is its proprietary QubeQode smart contract suite, designed for compliance-heavy use cases in global finance. These features make Qubetics a true contender for real-world enterprise and institutional adoption, especially for those entering Web3 with concrete objectives. Combined with its community-first distribution model (38.55% of tokens allocated to the public), Qubetics’ structure favors transparency, governance, and long-term user value. It could be the best 100x crypto you’ll encounter in a presale this year. Stellar (XLM) Sees a Modest Rally Amid Layer-1 Ecosystem Growth Stellar (XLM) is back in the green, currently trading at $0.2625 with a 24-hour volume of over $228 million—up 1.56%. Long known for its focus on low-cost payments and partnerships with global financial institutions, Stellar continues to gain traction, particularly in emerging markets. Stellar is proving resilient amid broader market fluctuations. Its new integrations with fintech platforms and digital ID systems are helping the network evolve into a real-time payments layer for global infrastructure. Stellar also benefits from its close alignment with CBDC development in various nations, which adds legitimacy to its long-term vision. Although price movement remains modest, it offers lower volatility and slow-but-steady adoption—a contrast to more speculative plays. Still, Stellar may lag behind platforms like Qubetics when looking for the best 100x crypto multiplier for users with higher risk tolerance and ambition. However, its stability and institutional utility make it a solid complementary asset. Aptos (APT) Gains Over 4% As Developers Embrace Move Language Aptos (APT) has surged 4.23%, trading today at $4.67, backed by growing developer interest in its Move programming language and sub-second transaction finality. This Layer-1 chain has been building a name by combining scalability with developer-friendly infrastructure. Recent ecosystem reports show Aptos expanding its DeFi footprint, with increasing dApp deployments and TVL (Total Value Locked) growth. Its low-latency execution model also opens the door to gaming, social dApps, and financial instruments that require high performance. Moreover, strategic partnerships with major infrastructure players like Google Cloud are solidifying Aptos’ Web2-to-Web3 gateway reputation. While still early in its journey, Aptos holds potential for exponential growth and could soon be considered among the best 100x crypto options, particularly for tech-forward investors. However, its current valuation may already price in some of that future potential. In comparison, Qubetics still offers raw asymmetric upside with presale access and lower entry points. Final Thoughts In today’s market, smart people prioritize real-world use cases and early entry opportunities. While Stellar provides tested reliability and Aptos delivers technical promise, Qubetics solves a high-value problem—cross-border remittances—while empowering developers and businesses through native tools. As the presale closes in, Qubetics offers a scarce combination: limited token supply, active user base, enterprise relevance, and built-in 20% listing upside. If you want to enter the next best 100x crypto before the market catches on, $TICS may be your front-runner. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics a strong candidate for the best 100x crypto in 2025? Qubetics combines low-cost global transfers, a proprietary dev suite, and a reduced total token supply to deliver utility and scarcity—ideal traits for exponential growth. When will Qubetics list on public exchanges? The $TICS token is expected to list shortly after the presale ends. Early buyers at $0.3370 are projected to see an initial 20% gain on listing at $0.40. Is Qubetics safe for beginners in crypto? Yes. It features a non-custodial wallet, intuitive dApp interactions, and a transparent governance system, making it one of the best 100x crypto options for new users. How do Stellar and Aptos compare to Qubetics? Stellar is established but slower-moving; Aptos is innovative but already well-valued. Qubetics, being in presale, offers the best raw upside and entry point. How much can I make if Qubetics hits $10 or $15? If you invest $1,000 at $0.3370, you’d receive ~2,967 TICS tokens. At $10, that’s $29,670. At $15, it’s over $44,500, highlighting why it’s seen as a best 100x crypto play.

Since the meme coin hit a local top in mid-May, a 30% drop has put this key level back in question, with $0.168 firmly in the spotlight as a potential tipping point. According to popular X analyst Ali Charts, this level aligns with the lower boundary of a crucial symmetrical triangle—a breakdown from which could trigger a 30% retracement. #Dogecoin $DOGE must hold above $0.168 to avoid a 30% price drop! pic.twitter.com/PDhqo7fpcK — Ali (@ali_charts) June 15, 2025 Below $0.168 lies a dangerous “gap area”—a price range with sparse previous buying activity, creating little historical support to limit downside. Dogecoin Price Analysis: A Breakdown Here Could Get Ugly Zooming out, the symmetrical triangle noted by Martinez contributes to a wider 4-year cup-and-handle pattern, with its lower support crossing the handle. DOGE / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. This creates a potential confluence zone between the make-or-break support and the upper resistance of the descending channel forming the handle—a potential breakout set up. A confirmed breakout would set a technical target around $0.75—a staggering 350% gain from current levels in line with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. However, this bullish case only holds if the $0.168 support does, and momentum indicators don’t inspire confidence. The golden cross from May has proven to be short-lived as the MACD line widens its gap below the signal line after a death cross to start June—a sign of a prevailing longer-term downtrend. The RSI also lends to weakening buy pressure, continuing its decline below the neutral line to its current position at 42. If DOGE posts a weekly candle close below $0.168, the next major Dogecoin price support zone sits around $0.90, last tested during mid-2024. From there, all eyes turn to the June 15 US spot Dogecoin ETF decision, which could offer the external catalyst DOGE needs, opening the doors to inflows from traditional investment markets if approved. Leading Meme Coins are Suffering – Here’s a Better Strategy When it comes to large meme coins like DOGE, timing is everything. Those who entered late from the mid-April market bottom and didn’t sell in mid-May face unrealised losses. Meanwhile, newer meme coins making the rounds like Aura are posting 46x gains in a single day. That’s where Snorter ($SNORT) steps in. Its purpose-built trading bot is engineered to spot early momentum, helping investors get in before the crowd—where the real gains are made. While trading bots are not a new concept, Snorter has been designed specifically for sniping with limit orders, MEV-resistant token swaps, copy trading, and even rug-pull protection. It’s one thing to get in first, it’s another thing to know when to sell—Snorter Bot can help. Snorter Bot vs. other trading bots. The project is off to a strong start— $SNORT has already raised over $1 million in its first three weeks of presale , likely driven by its high 287% APY on staking to rewards early investors.

Per a Telegram post from the official account of the Krasnoyarsk Krai Prosecutor’s Office , the “open-air” facility was located in the town of Nazarovo, some 240 km west of Krasnoyarsk, in Central Siberia. The office said it had obtained a court order allowing bailiffs to raid the facility. The farm reportedly mined coins worth around 4.6 million rubles ($58,672) per month for its operators. Crypto Mining Farm ‘Used Scores of Transformers and Generators’ Prosecutors explained that the operators had fenced off the facility with barbed wire. However, its location was nothing if not conspicuous. They wrote: “The farm was right out in the open air in the town’s industrial hub district.” U.S. President Donald Trump kicked off his time at the Group of Seven summit on Monday by suggesting that Russia and maybe even China should be part of the organization. https://t.co/CHLXxUr0Qn — PBS News (@NewsHour) June 16, 2025 Officially, the site was registered as a “non-residential building” under the name of a management company. However, when investigators conducted their raid, they found several transformers on the premises. They also discovered power generators, cooling equipment, and crypto mining rigs. The management firm, prosecutors said, leased the property to a crypto mining firm, along with a “non-existent building.” The miner had reportedly connected their rigs to the city’s power grid. Prosecutors said they received a tip-off from an energy provider. The latter reported that it had detected a high probability of emergency power outages at the facility. When they investigated, the prosecutors discovered that the company had not obtained permission to operate power-receiving units or use state-owned land. They also found that the miners were not complying with fire safety requirements, which constituted a public safety risk. An illegal crypto mining farm in Nazarovo, Russia. (Source: Krasnoyarsk Krai Prosecutor’s Office) Operator Ignored Prosecutors’ Warnings The office said it initially wrote to the firm to ask it to desist, adding that the operator “ignored” this request. The prosecution service responded by petitioning a district court, which responded by banning all activity at the facility “until the violations are rectified.” In February this year, a staffer at a Krasnoyarsk Krai energy provider was discovered taking bribes worth $7,380 from illegal crypto miners. The staffer agreed to turn a blind eye to the miners’ operations and their illegal connections to the grid. The same miners stole electricity worth about 9.4 million rubles ($119,592) from the Krasnoyarsk Krai energy system, investigators found. According to the Federal Tax Service’s registry of crypto miners, Krasnoyarsk Krai is one of Russia’s top three crypto mining regions, along with the Irkutsk region and the Republic of Tatarstan.

But in every cycle, there are exceptions, projects that move independently, refusing to follow the crowd. Right now, four altcoins are drawing attention for doing exactly that. While the broader market hesitates, Near Protocol (NEAR), Hyperliquid (HYPE), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are showing unusual resilience. However, amidst these altcoins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is turning heads with massive presale buzz, drawing meme coin believers chasing 35x to 100x gains. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Built To Perform When The Market Doesn’t The FloppyPepe (FPPE) altcoin is quickly gaining recognition as one of the most promising crypto plays for outsized gains. Early buyers have already taken advantage of the 80% bonus through the FLOPPY80 code, nearly doubling their holdings. The presale isn’t over yet; there’s still a brief window to get in at $0.00000035 before launch pricing jumps to $0.01. The boldest prediction? Analysts are floating a $1 target for FloppyPepe (FPPE) alongside the Bitcoin dominance, creating a staggering leap from its current level. FloppyPepe (FPPE) continues to rise alongside Near Protocol (NEAR), Fartcoin (FART), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) due to its ability to address gaps left by other altcoins. This gives it a unique edge in a crowded space. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Only Meme Coin Using AI And Scarcity For Real Gains Through its AI tools, Meme-o-Matic , FloppyX , and FloppyAI , FloppyPepe (FPPE) empowers users to instantly generate viral-ready memes, AI-driven video content, and real-time market insights, transforming it from a simple altcoin into an AI-powered platform that reinforces engagement and platform utility. In addition, Floppynomics gives FloppyPepe (FPPE) a unique counter-cycle strength as Bitcoin dominance surges. The altcoins are designed so that holders receive extra rewards from transactions, while the overall circulating supply gradually decreases. This built-in scarcity and reward structure favors early adopters, while the Solidproof audit guarantees security, making now a strategic time to accumulate before broader demand kicks in. Near Protocol (NEAR): Holding Steady While The Rest Look Shaky Near Protocol (NEAR) has recently stabilized between $2.22 and $2.30, recovering from a sharp 12.8% drop tied to broader war tensions. Despite the Bitcoin dominance peak, Near Protocol’s (NEAR) core metrics remain strong; 46 million monthly users place it as the second most-used Layer-1 protocol. As one crypto analyst recently put it, “ Grab Near Protocol (NEAR) while the price is still cheap. ” With this level of usage, Near Protocol (NEAR) remains one of the few altcoins showing strength where it matters. Hyperliquid (HYPE): A Rising Star With Price Action To Prove Hyperliquid (HYPE) recently surged to a new all-time high of $44.69, edging past its previous peak of $43.96. As Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is breaking away from the pack , showing rare counter-cycle strength. The Hyperliquid (HYPE) price rally points to rising transactional activity and deeper liquidity within the Hyperliquid (HYPE) ecosystem. Momentum indicators like MACD and RSI are also trending upward on the 4-hour chart, with some analysts now eyeing a potential push toward $100. Fartcoin (FART): Big Listing, Big Gains, Bigger Potential Fartcoin (FART) jumped nearly 40% in the past week and is now trading at $1.32 , following its Coinbase listing that went live on Thursday, a move known to attract fresh investor inflow. Amidst rising Bitcoin dominance, a Fartcoin (FART) is currently outperforming major meme coins , and with bullish technical signals and growing visibility, Fartcoin (FART) is quickly becoming a standout in the altcoin arena. Buy Now Or Regret Later: FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) 80% Bonus Is Almost Gone Near Protocol (NEAR), Hyperliquid (HYPE), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are showing rare counter-trend strength as Bitcoin dominance reaches its peak. Meanwhile, FloppyPepe (FPPE), the new AI altcoin, stands out not just for its ultra-low entry price but also for strong backing from influential crypto voices and, notably, the ongoing Presale promo. Right now, early early buyers still have a rare chance to scoop up FloppyPepe (FPPE) at just $0.00000035 and get an instant 80% bonus using the promo code FLOPPY80 . But don’t get too comfortable; this offer could vanish before the next stage even kicks in. Miss it, and be ready to chase green candles.

In a message to staff on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy praised generative AI as a game-changer but made clear that efficiency gains from these tools will likely shrink the company’s corporate head count over time. Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used in “virtually every corner of the company.” He noted that Amazon has more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications under way, and that this number represents only “a small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” This push follows Amazon’s pledge to invest roughly $100 billion in AI technologies during the current fiscal year. But for the company’s roughly 1.5 million employees, the message was a sobering one. Jassy warned that as AI changes how work gets done, the firm will need “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” He added, “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Amazon CEO urged employees to gain expertise on AI tools “Be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams.” Amazon has already cut staff in parts of its business it doesn’t consider essential. Earlier this year, the devices and services team lost about 100 jobs, and the books department saw a similar reduction. Overall, CNBC reports that the company has cut around 27,000 positions since 2022 and is preparing for more. Shares of Amazon have fallen about 2.5% so far this year. The Seattle-based company is pouring much of its planned $100 billion investment into AI infrastructure as it races rivals Google and Microsoft to lead the AI boom and to fuel growth at its lucrative cloud arm, Amazon Web Services. Last year, Jassy said he wanted to “eliminate bureaucracy” by creating a flatter organizational structure with fewer layers of middle management. In two major rounds of cuts in 2023, Amazon shed 27,000 roles, and this year Amazon Web Services trimmed hundreds more. Across the tech sector, leaders have generally chosen to highlight efficiency gains over the prospect of job losses from AI. In May, Microsoft reduced its global workforce by 3%. State filings in Washington indicate that many of those affected were software engineers. CEO Satya Nadella has publicly noted that perhaps “20-30% of the code that is inside of our repos today…are probably all written by software,” though the comFpany insists these cuts were not driven by AI. In April, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke told employees seeking more headcount or resources that they should explain why they “cannot get what they want done using AI.” Meanwhile, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn announced plans to replace contract workers with AI as part of the company’s new “AI-first” strategy .

The GENIUS Act passed the Senate in a final vote of 68 to 30. As a result, the GENIUS Act will now proceed to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to gain bipartisan support. Furthermore, the Donald Trump administration has laid significant emphasis on the importance of crypto assets and the digital currency market to the long term sustainability of the economy. “With the GENIUS Act, we’re bringing clarity to a sector that’s been clouded by uncertainty and proving that bipartisan, principled leadership can still deliver real results for the American people. This did not happen by accident,” Tim Scott noted . Stablecoins Market Ready to Bloom Via the GENIUS Act The monumental final vote for the GENIUS Act by the Senate is a major step toward clear stablecoins regulation in the United States. Once passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and stamped by Trump, the comprehensive stablecoin legislation will play a crucial role in the mainstream adoption of the digital dollar. According to Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, the GENIUS Act is a win-win situation for the private sector, the treasury, and consumers. Moreover, Bessent believes that the stablecoins market could reach $3.7 trillion by the end of this decade. “A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for US Treasuries, which back stablecoins. This newfound demand could lower government borrowing costs and help rein in the national debt,” Bessent noted . Already, JPMorgan has spearheaded the development of stablecoins by traditional financial institutions.

Two global internet monitors, Kentinc and NetBlocks, told NBC News that traffic plunged at about 5:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday. The abrupt cut left many Iranians struggling to send messages, browse news sites or post updates beyond Iran’s borders, the firms said. Iran’s communications minister said the slowdown was a deliberate government measure, not the result of damaged cables or power cuts. Spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said leaders limited access to counter what they described as Israeli cyberattacks against Iran’s digital infrastructure. Iran has shut down or slowed the internet during protests in the past. For example, in November 2019, it cut off all access for six days while security forces broke up protests across the country, a crackdown that left more than 100 people dead. After Israel’s strikes on Iran last week, the government had already slowed connections but stopped short of a full shutdown. Reports suggest that services like virtual private networks were hit hardest by the cutbacks. Many Iranians rely on VPNs to reach news outlets, social media and other foreign sites blocked inside the country. Major western apps blocked inside Iran Amir Rashidi, director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, told NBC News that certain Western apps stopped working. He said WhatsApp, Instagram, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store were among those blocked inside Iran. A WhatsApp spokesperson said its parent, Meta, has been locked in a “cat-and-mouse game” with Iran as officials target the company’s internet links. Meanwhile, Iran’s own National Information Network, a closed loop of government-approved sites, stayed online for most users. Data from Cloudflare, an internet services firm, showed on Tuesday that two of the country’s leading mobile carriers were effectively cut off from global networks, further isolating users who rely on phones for calls and data. Some people online urged Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite service to step in. Musk wrote on X last Friday, “The beams are on,” hinting that Starlink could help Iranians bypass the blackout. Iran’s authorities have banned Starlink terminals, and the state-run Saed News Agency warned that using them might guide Israeli strikes. Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit that supports internet access in closed societies, estimates that 30,000 to 40,000 Starlink dishes are already in Iran, based on network scans and conversations with local distributors. Iran alleges broad Israeli cyber offensive On Tuesday, Iran’s National Cybersecurity Command accused Israel of a wide cyberwarfare campaign to disrupt public services, but it did not say which systems were hit. Shargh Daily reported that the cyber police agency, known as FATA, said the government had imposed disruptions after the attacks and would restore normal service soon. A hacker group calling itself Predatory Sparrow claimed on X and Telegram to have launched a destructive cyberattack on Bank Sepah, a national bank under U.S. sanctions for ties to Iran’s military. As a result, some ATMs failed on Tuesday, a local source said. The group’s membership and any links to official agencies remain unknown.

Despite the uncertainty, ETH remains resilient above the $2,500 level, signaling ongoing strength among bulls. However, Ethereum now trades just below a critical resistance level at $2,675 — a zone that has acted as a barrier several times over the past few weeks. A breakout above this mark could trigger renewed upside momentum and set the stage for a rally toward $3,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Market participants remain divided on Ethereum’s short-term direction, but the technical landscape offers a potentially bullish clue. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum is on the verge of completing a golden cross — a chart pattern where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. Historically, this signal has preceded strong upward trends in ETH, with the last golden cross resulting in a 35% surge over the following weeks. As Ethereum hovers in a tight range, traders are closely watching this setup. If bulls manage to reclaim $2,675 and the golden cross confirms, Ethereum could enter a powerful breakout phase, potentially sparking broader optimism across the altcoin market. Ethereum Prepares For A Breakout As Bulls Hold Support Ethereum is facing a decisive moment as it continues to trade within a range that has persisted for more than six weeks. The current price structure reflects growing indecision among market participants, largely driven by geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. This macro backdrop has injected volatility across financial markets, and Ethereum has not been immune. While price action remains contained, ETH bulls are showing resilience by defending the $2,500 level — a crucial zone that has repeatedly served as support during the past month. However, to regain momentum, Ethereum must break above the $2,750–$2,800 resistance area, which has proven to be a major barrier since early May. This range remains the threshold separating consolidation from a full bullish breakout. A reclaim of this level would likely trigger a wave of buying, as it would mark the end of the current sideways phase and possibly initiate a fresh trend toward the $3,000 mark. Adding to the bullish thesis, Ted Pillows highlights that a golden cross is approaching on Ethereum’s moving averages. This occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average — a technical signal often associated with trend reversals and sustained upward moves. The last time this setup formed, Ethereum surged over 35% in just a few weeks. With ETH hovering just beneath key resistance and macro conditions remaining uncertain, the coming days may determine whether the golden cross will serve as a launchpad for a major rally. If bulls hold $2,500 and reclaim $2,800, Ethereum could be preparing for a significant breakout, potentially igniting momentum across the altcoin sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Ethereum Holds Support But Struggles With Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is showing resilience as it continues to trade above the $2,500 mark, but price action on the 4-hour chart reveals persistent difficulty in breaking through the $2,675–$2,700 resistance zone. This area, highlighted on the chart, has acted as a rejection zone multiple times since early June, capping bullish attempts to break out of the current range. Price recently tapped this resistance area again but failed to sustain momentum, resulting in a pullback toward the 200 EMA and 200 SMA, currently acting as near-term support around $2,575. ETH now hovers slightly above that level, and bulls must defend this zone to avoid slipping into lower support near $2,500. The pattern shows continued consolidation between a clearly defined support and resistance band, with the 50 and 100 moving averages flattening — a sign of market indecision. Volume has also declined slightly, reinforcing the idea that the market is waiting for a catalyst. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation – Details If ETH can reclaim $2,675 with conviction and follow through above $2,700, a rally toward the $2,850–$3,000 zone could develop. Until then, this tight range may continue. Holding the current support is crucial to avoid testing lower levels near $2,400, which could shift sentiment bearish.

If this scenario plays out, holders of 5,000 or 10,000 XRP could realize notable returns. Market Overview and Current Price Action XRP has experienced a moderate price increase of just over 3% since the beginning of the week. Despite this upward movement, the asset continues to trade below the $2.20 price level, a threshold it has hovered near for several months without a clear breakout. The broader cryptocurrency market remains largely range-bound, influenced in part by geopolitical events, including heightened instability in the Middle East. This prolonged consolidation phase has limited XRP’s momentum, although some market observers remain optimistic about a potential rally. Historical comparisons to XRP’s significant performance in 2017 continue to fuel expectations of a similar pattern repeating. Forecasts Supporting a $1 Trillion Market Cap Several market analysts have recently expressed optimism about XRP’s long-term potential. Analyst EGRAG has pointed to technical indicators that, in their view, suggest a market structure capable of supporting a major valuation increase. Specifically, EGRAG referenced a chart pattern that they believe could eventually lead XRP to a market capitalization near $1 trillion. Other perspectives have emphasized the importance of utility and adoption. For example, Omni’s founder, Austin King, argued that XRP would need to significantly improve its presence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and strengthen interoperability to reach such a valuation. Similarly, a prior analysis from xAI’s Grok explored the level of capital inflow required for XRP to attain a $1 trillion market cap. In addition, XRP advocate Edoardo Farina has encouraged investors to accumulate between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP, emphasizing the rarity of such holdings. He noted that fewer than 4% of XRP wallets contain over 10,000 tokens, and described such a holding as increasingly difficult to achieve. Farina also asserted that many future success stories in the space may begin with bold moves to secure large XRP positions early.

Using the current circulating supply of approximately 58.88 billion tokens, XRP’s price would need to rise to about $16.90 per coin to reach this valuation. Based on this projected price: An investor holding 5,000 XRP would see their portfolio valued at $84,500 An investor holding 10,000 XRP would have holdings worth $169,000 At the current market price of approximately $2.20, acquiring 5,000 XRP would require an investment of $10,950, while purchasing 10,000 XRP would cost about $21,900. This represents a potential gain of more than 670% if XRP reaches $16.90. While the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, the possibility of a $1 trillion valuation has become a frequent subject of analysis. Achieving such a milestone would require substantial progress in adoption, use cases, and investor confidence. However, if the necessary conditions align, long-term holders of XRP could see significant returns on their investment.

Bank of America sees gold going up to $4,000 an ounce over the next 12 months, a gain of more than 17% from the current level, reports Reuters. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs expects the precious metal to surge to $3,700 by the end of this year, lifted by strong demand from central banks. The firm also sees gold soaring to $4,000 by June 2026. Gold is trading at $3,395 at time of writing, up about 30% year-to-date. The precious metal is slightly down from the all-time high of $3,500 reached in April. Daniel Pavilonis, a senior market strategist at the brokerage firm RJO Futures, tells Reuters that escalating fears of a broader Middle East conflict are pushing gold prices higher. “Israel knocking out Iranian targets is causing a little bit of geopolitical scare in the market. Prices will stay elevated in the anticipation of what is to come, the retaliation by Iran.” On Friday, Israel fired airstrikes at Iran, killing a number of the Islamic Republic’s senior military personnel and destroying strategic military targets. The value of gold surged following the breakout of the conflict before giving up most of its gains on Monday.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, ETH is trading above $2500 as the U.S. Senate passes the GENIUS Act with bipartisan support. While the Senate was busy passing the GENIUS Act, Vivek Raman, founder of Ethereum advocacy firm Etherealize, was even busier, making the rounds on Wall Street to explain why ETH is suddenly at the center of institutional finance. Of course, Ethereum is nothing new. It's almost a decade old. But finally, in its almost 10 years of existence, Wall Street is starting to pay attention, and they really want to talk about it. “It’s an amazing job… running around from bank to bank, buy side to buy side, telling them what Ethereum tokenization means, how L2s work, and why it all flows through ether,” he told CoinDesk during an interview in between meetings from the lobby of Wall Street's Brookfield Place. As founder of Etherealize, Raman leads the firm’s efforts to educate Wall Street on ETH as neutral collateral and to help institutions tokenize assets and build on Ethereum. Raman says that Ethereum’s core value proposition, its role as the settlement and collateral layer behind stablecoins and tokenized assets, is finally resonating with institutional investors. “Every action is powered by ether,” he said. “Eventually, it’s going to be viewed as just as pristine as bitcoin. It'll be the neutral asset for the whole ecosystem.” The turning point, Raman says, was regulatory clarity. “Ethereum’s potential hasn’t been allowed until now,” he said, pointing to the GENIUS Act and broader U.S. policy momentum. “For years we didn’t know if it was a security or a commodity."" That’s why, despite the headlines around the ETH ETF, Raman says the real unlock for Ethereum came from regulatory clarity, not a ticker symbol. “The ETH ETF cleared the way by signaling that ether is a commodity, but it still wasn’t explicit,” Raman said. “With clear market structure, the utility of Ethereum gets completely unleashed. Now ETH permeates everything: every tokenized asset transfer, every stablecoin transfer, every Layer 2, they all flow through ETH.” And while Circle’s IPO and the rise of tokenized treasuries have brought new visibility to the sector, Raman says savvy investors will want more than equity exposure to stablecoin brands. Circle may get the IPO, but Ethereum gets the flows,” he said. “ETH is what secures this whole ecosystem, and it’s the only neutral, non-censorable collateral that can route value between all these tokenized assets.” VanEck's Solana ETF Comes Closer to Listing with DTCC Entry VanEck's proposed Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) has been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website under the ticker symbol VSOL, a procedural step that typically signals readiness for electronic clearing and settlement. VanEck’s DTCC listing comes amid growing institutional interest in Solana, following the blockbuster success of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs. However, just like with those ETFs, Canada has beaten the U.S. in the race to get listed. Four Canadian issuers, Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ, launched their Solana ETFs in April, following approval from the Ontario Securities Commission. OKX Continues European Expansion with Regulated Launch in Germany and Poland OKX has officially launched regulated crypto exchanges in Germany and Poland, marking a strategic expansion into two of Europe’s most active digital asset markets. The company now offers spot trading, staking, automated trading bots, and over 60 crypto-Euro pairs to users in both countries, supported by localized platforms with Euro onramps.

46242870,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=748637,1750208228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46242870.jpeg,Mass sell-off triggers Binance Alpha meltdown,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-binance-alphas-reform-restore-trust/,"Crypto users, influencers, and new traders were psyched about using Binance Alpha to unlock benefits, but the $ZKJ and $KOGE tokens experienced dramatic price swings that triggered mass liquidations. Some traders saw their investment go to waste, while others watched Alpha whales cycle trades between two Alpha tokens with minimal price exposure to farm points. These victims posted screenshots, angry threads, and questions on social media asking questions about whether the program was ever truly fair, and some critics even said Binance waited too long to act. Binance raised deeper concerns about its governance, transparency, and commitment to user protection when it tried closing loopholes and reducing system gaming by ruling that trades between Alpha tokens would no longer count toward Alpha Points. Why wasn’t it built into the system if the rule change was necessary to prevent abuse? Mass sell-off triggers Binance Alpha meltdown Large Alpha holders (whales) pulled their liquidity out of the market, creating a shortage of available funds that caused prices to drop quickly and tokens like $ZKJ and $KOGE to crash. Meanwhile, many traders used borrowed or leveraged money to trade these tokens on the blockchain. So, when prices started falling, it triggered automatic sell orders (liquidations), further pushing prices down in a quick and uncontrollable chain reaction. Users who invested or farmed points in these tokens began losing money and started selling their holdings or stopping their trading activities altogether, making it even harder for remaining traders to buy or sell tokens without facing large losses. Reports show that more than 100,000 users have left the Binance Alpha ecosystem in just a short period as they feel burned by the sudden and severe losses. Binance stops point farming between tokens Binance introduced a new rule that stops users from earning Alpha Points when they trade one Alpha token for another on June 17. Before this change, traders could swap tokens like $ZKJ for $KOGE and keep earning points even if they were simply moving money back and forth between these tokens without adding real value to the market. Some users say the change will stop traders from using clever tricks to game the system because they mislead other traders and the market about the tokens’ popularity and value. However, some say this new rule is too late and doesn’t deal with the design problems that reward high trading volume or the overwhelming influence of large holders or whales who still control much of the market and can manipulate prices. The new rule might reduce some of the most obvious abuses like wash trading , but it won’t fully fix the core challenges that have led to the recent crashes and community backlash. The crypto community criticizes Binance Many users felt betrayed by the system because the rewards they invested their time, money, and effort into earning were now devalued and made more difficult to earn. Some users said Binance should give back the points or rewards they lost because the new rules weren’t clearly explained before they made decisions to trade or hold tokens. In contrast, others wanted the company to explain how the new system worked to prevent similar sudden changes in the future. The backlash showed that many users lost trust in the Alpha brand as they believed the changes were designed to protect big players or the company’s image rather than create a fair and open environment for all users. Some people even said Binance only made those changes to avoid negative headlines and keep investors happy instead of dealing with the Alpha Points program’s issues with fairness and transparency. Some crypto community members think other big exchanges will follow Binance’s example and change their to reduce the risks of manipulation and abuse. Others think the platforms will continue with the traditional systems. Binance can set a new example for the crypto industry by building a fairer, more stable system that works well. However, if users react negatively or the new setup fails to bring in enough people and trading activity, other exchanges might not want to follow its lead. Binance should approach its community members and consult them for ideas about changing the incentive system because users are likelier to believe that the platform cares about their experience and wants to build a fair system that benefits everyone when they feel heard.

The Spanish lender’s act of offering its wealthy clients the opportunity to invest up to 7% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies is the latest evidence that some mainstream banks are starting to open up to a sector that was once dismissed due to its risks. However, regulators continue to caution about the dangers of cryptocurrencies, warning that investors should be prepared to lose all their money possibly. Earlier this year, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) reported that 95% of banks in the EU do not participate in crypto activities. BBVA’s reveals efforts to make its “wealth clients” embrace cryptocurrencies In a statement, Meyer mentioned that they began advising their private clients on Bitcoin in September of last year. Due to the riskier profile accompanying cryptocurrencies, he revealed that BBVA will allow the clients to invest as high as 7% of their portfolios in crypto. What has driven this sudden shift is that cryptocurrency prices have soared recently, and Bitcoin hit its highest record in May. That comes after a rebound from the lows recorded in 2022 as a clutch of major exchanges, including FTX, went under and left millions of investors out of pocket. They were aided in the recovery by support from US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. While private banks often facilitate crypto purchases at clients’ request, they still rarely go so far as to recommend investing in digital assets actively. Meyer mentioned at an event that BBVA was one of the first major global banks to recommend that wealthy clients invest in cryptocurrencies. He noted that the bank has fulfilled client requests to purchase them since 2021. BBVA advises clients to invest between 3-7% in Bitcoin and Ether, but Meyer indicated they plan to include more cryptocurrencies later this year. Meyer stated that clients have generally responded well to this advice and dismissed fears about the assets being too risky. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, adding 3% can really improve performance,” Meyer explained. Based on his argument, investing 3% does not involve taking a significant risk. ESMA raises concerns about the dangers associated with crypto Earlier, the European Union’s securities watchdog warned that issues in the cryptocurrency industry could threaten the stability of financial markets in the future as the sector expands and its links to more traditional financial markets deepen. This call for caution from the ESMA follows US economic policies that irritate global markets as US authorities struggle to remove barriers between the crypto and traditional banking sectors. In a speech to the European Parliament that was shared on the watchdog’s website, Natasha Cazenave, the executive director of ESMA, revealed that E U financial markets face significant pressure due to wider political and geopolitical events. Additionally, stock markets have been crashing since US President Donald Trump announced a blizzard of new tariffs. This also caused a significant drop in crypto prices. However, asset prices in various markets regained some of those losses. Following these concerns, Crypto-asset markets are still quite small. To address this, Cazenave mentioned that in today’s market conditions, even problems in these small markets can lead to wider issues in their financial system. She also noted that the risks to financial stability from crypto are not significant at this time. Still, ESMA raises alarms about the dangers of crypto and states that this sector requires ongoing careful observation.

XRP Wallets With 1 Million+ Tokens Have Set A New Record In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed the latest trend in a couple of indicators related to the XRP network. The first metric of relevance is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us, among other things, the number of wallets that belong to a particular coin range. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Plummet $61 Billion—Warning Sign For Bitcoin? In the context of the current topic, the range of interest is above 1 million coins (with the upper bound being infinity). This cutoff for the range converts to about $2.2 million at the current exchange rate, which is quite significant. Naturally, the only investors who would qualify for this threshold would be the big-money ones. Such holders are popularly known as the sharks and whales. Generally, the influence of any entity on the network goes up the more coins that they hold, so this cohort, with its large holdings, can carry some degree of power. As such, the behavior of the sharks and whales can be worth keeping an eye on. If nothing else, it can at least inform us about what the sentiment may be like among these humongous investors. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of these 1 million+ holders over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Supply Distribution has recently registered an uptick for sharks and whales, implying more wallets carrying above a million coins have popped up on the network. This could be an indication that some new big-money investors have potentially joined the chain. Following the increase, the network now has 2,708 wallets of this size, which is a new record. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data of the second relevant metric: Daily Active Addresses. This indicator measures the unique total number of wallets that are becoming involved in some kind of transaction activity on the network every day, whether as a sender or receiver. Since the smaller entities like retail massively outweigh the large investors in terms of number, this metric essentially represents the amount of activity that the entities on the smaller end of the network are participating in. From the graph, it’s visible that the XRP Daily Active Addresses have recently observed a large spike. Over the past week, the metric has averaged a value of 295,000 addresses daily, which is a drastic jump over the 35,000 to 40,000 figure witnessed during the last three months.

It now remains to be seen what effect, if any, these changes in network metrics would have on the cryptocurrency’s price. XRP Price XRP shot up beyond the $2.33 mark yesterday, but it seems bullish momentum has already faded as the coin has dropped back to $2.20.

The securities regulatory agency requested the members of the public to comment on the proposed rule changes to list both spot ETFs in the coming four weeks. When Will the SEC Approve Spot Solana ETFs According to James Seyffart, a Bloomberg’s ETF analyst, the delay by the U.S. SEC on spot Solana and XRP ETFs on Tuesday was not a surprise. Furthermore, the agency has been postponing other altcoins spot ETF applications in the recent past. However, as Coinpedia reported , the U.S. SEC has actively engaged the fund managers seeking to offer spot Solana ETFs in the past two weeks. Consequently, the odds of spot Solana ETF approval before the end of the year have significantly risen. “I wouldn’t be completely shocked if we see approvals for Solana ETFs in the next month or so. But I also wouldn’t be surprised if we have to wait until the final deadline in October. Timeline is unknown,” Seyffart noted . Market Impact The continued delay on the final decision for the altcoins spot ETFs will further delay the highly anticipated 2025 altseason. Moreover, the traditional crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to the altcoins was disrupted by the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States last year. However, the U.S. SEC will eventually approve the spot Solana and XRP ETFs, especially after Canada approved its first spot SOL ETF. Additionally, the demand for Solana by institutional investors has significantly increased in the past year, led by SOL Strategies.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 01:03:16

Speaking on the Uncapped podcast , which he co-hosts with his brother Jack Altman, the CEO described Meta’s approach as extreme. “It’s insane,” Altman said, referring to the staggering financial offers aimed at poaching top talent. Altman said that Meta had tried to recruit several key staff members from OpenAI, but none had accepted the offers. He noted that the company had targeted many individuals, but so far, none of their top talent had taken the bait. He admitted that Meta is aggressively courting top talent from OpenAI, probably because of OpenAI’s paramount role in the AI domain . Its ChatGPT product and research breakthroughs have positioned the company at the heart of the global AI race. Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Altman’s comments. Yet, insiders throughout the tech world admit that the company’s talent poaching tactics are only getting more intense. Zuckerberg heads personal AI hiring blitz Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, is said to be playing an active role in the talent battle, overseeing attempts to hire top researchers and engineers for Meta’s new “superintelligence” division. This new team is a part of Meta’s larger effort to win the general-purpose AI race and to be a direct competitor to companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. One of Meta’s most aggressive steps came last week when it said it would invest $14.3 billion in Scale AI, which provides data labeling and training services for machine learning. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang joined Meta’s AI team as part of the investment in a move that saw a considerable overlap of resources and talent. Meta has also hired leaders from other AI research centers. One of the most high-profile hires is Jack Rae, previously a principal researcher at Google DeepMind. According to Bloomberg , Rae’s move indicates Meta’s commitment to attracting top AI executives, even if it has to outspend rivals. According to Altman, Meta’s aggressive approach is driven by its competitive rivalry with OpenAI. He mentioned that he had heard Meta regards OpenAI as its biggest competitor. OpenAI’s culture beats the billion-dollar bait, Altman says Despite Meta’s exceptionally high offers, Altman expressed confidence that OpenAI could retain its core team. He questioned whether money alone was enough to distract people from meaningful work. He acknowledged that he respected many aspects of Meta but did not believe the company excelled at innovation. Altman said that OpenAI’s mission-driven culture plays a major role in why employees choose to stay, even when presented with large financial offers. He added that there is a cultural risk in turning AI jobs into roles driven purely by compensation, emphasizing that this is not how true innovation happens. Altman also veiled a dig at Meta’s approach, implying that OpenAI can access insights that Meta cannot. He underscored the company’s commitment to open research, responsible development, and thoughtful scaling of AI technologies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The company also revealed its plans to pivot to trading cards. In May 2025, GameStop bought Bitcoin worth around $500 million, and it plans to continue with that strategy. GameStop is following the investment strategy of MicroStrategy, which now owns billions of dollars’ worth of BTC, making it the largest corporate crypto holder. The decision by GameStop to purchase more BTC shows the growing acceptance of crypto in investment circles. While it has led to some losses in the short term, it could pay off in the long term as has been with MicroStrategy. Disappointed by recent losses, GameStop investors have been looking for a way to grow their portfolio out of meme stocks. One of their strategies has been to purchase the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale tokens, which analysts’ forecast could rise 30x or more. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Next-Gen DeFi Project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been touted by analysts as the most innovative DeFi project of 2025. It offers massive earning opportunities for its users, while also supporting the long-term growth of MUTM tokens. On the Mutuum Finance protocol, users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders will deposit their funds into the protocol for a chance to earn passive income via interest payments. The interest rate is dynamically set by the pool utilization rate. As the number of borrowers in a communal pool grows, so does the utilization rate, and thus the interest rate. This rising interest rate pushes borrowers to pay back their loans, while incentivizing more lenders to deposit their assets to benefit from the higher rates. The process leads to a self-balancing loop that ensures optimal capital utilization. To protect lenders assets in the pools, all loans will have to be overcollateralized. The actual level of collateralization will be set by protocol parameters. That will ensure the liquidators have enough of a moat in which to respond in case of price fluctuations. More stable assets that have low volatility, and high liquidity will have smaller overcollateralization requirements, due to their inherent stability. Additionally, the protocol will implement a reserve factor, which is a portion of the interest collected from borrowers. These funds will go into a common pool, and will be used to maintain the stability of the ecosystem. More stable assets like stablecoins will get a reserve factor of as low as 10%, while more volatile assets, like meme coins, will be assigned a reserve factor of up to 35%. Mutuum Finance will also vet all new tokens added to the platform. This will ensure that users are not exposed to dangers such as price manipulation, and infinite minting exploit. Overall, that will guarantee the stability and growth of the ecosystem in the long term. MUTM Token Presale Details Mutuum Finance is currently in phase 5 of the token presale. So far over $10.7 million has been raised from the ongoing presale. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The analysts are optimistic about the future of MUTM tokens, projecting that their price will go up by 2,550% when they go live. This optimistic forecast has been a major driver of the presale, which has seen over 38% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 sold barely two weeks after they launched. Based on the analysts’ forecast, a $2,100 investment in the presale at the current price of $0.03 could grow to $53,550. That is a massive opportunity to grow your crypto portfolio in the long term. Besides the gains in the initial phases of the token launch, analysts expect the token price to continue rising in the long term. A major reason for this rise will be the buy-back program which the team will launch. They will use protocol profits to support the price of MUTM tokens on the open market, which will boost their profile on major exchanges. With the tokens expected to list on several top-tier crypto exchanges, this could lead to a massive boost in participation numbers as traders try to capitalize on the opportunity for more gains. Bottom Line Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are currently on sale for a 50% discount on the planned listing price of $0.06. At this price you stand to make double what those who wait until the tokens go live. This is a rare opportunity in the crypto sector to join a project while it is on the ground floor, and continue to grow your earning long after it goes live.

The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Optis’ case must be tried a refresh in Texas after concluding that the instructions to the jury in the earlier trial were flawed. This decision marks the second time that a nine-figure patent ruling in favor of Optis has been reversed in this case. The uncertainty around the Optis-Apple case stirs up debates in the tech ecosystem Optis and its affiliates sued Apple in 2019 in federal court in Marshall, Texas, accusing the tech giant of infringing its patent rights in the technology behind the LTE wireless standard with its iPhones and other products. In 2020, a jury ruled that the iPhone maker would have to pay Optis $506 million for infringing its patents. In 2021, US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap ordered a retrial on damages, postulating that the amount may not have necessarily covered the duty of Optis to license the essential patents fairly and reasonably. Later that same year, a different jury awarded Optis $300 million in damages after the retrial. The Federal Circuit reversed this award, and the case was remanded for another trial on infringement and related damages. A three-judge panel said Gilstrap erred in consolidating all the patents into a single question for the jury. The appeals court held that the district court’s single-infringement question deprived the iPhone maker of its right to a unanimous verdict concerning each legal claim against it. In a separate ruling last month, a UK court found that Apple owes Optis $502 million for infringing their UK wireless patents. Apple has announced its intention to appeal this decision. A spokesperson for Optis stated that the company is very confident that the court will set a fair payment for the important Optis patents that allow millions of Apple devices to connect at high speeds. The case is known as Optis Cellular Technology LLC v. Apple Inc., US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 22-1925. When asked to comment on the Federal Circuit ruling, neither an attorney nor spokespeople for Apple responded immediately for comments. Optis demands appropriate compensation in Apple’s case London’s High Court in 2023 ruled that Apple should pay Optis $56.43 million plus interest to cover past and future sales over a specific period. The tech firm was accused of using 4G patents in devices, including iPhones and iPads. However, Optis argued that the amount was far too low, and it challenged the ruling in an appeal that was heard in February and March. Later, the court of appeals said the iPhone maker should pay an undivided $502 million, excluding interest, from 2023 to 2027. The payment was associated with a worldwide license for using Optis’ patents. In a statement, an Apple spokesperson said it was disappointed and would appeal the decision. A spokesperson for Optis, however, welcomed the ruling, saying it “categorically corrected” a previous decision it says was “plainly flawed” and had gone far in the right direction to recognize the true worth of its patents on Apple devices. The spokesman also said they will continue seeking fair compensation for Optis’ intellectual property, which connects millions of devices worldwide with high-speed connectivity.

According to energy researcher Raphaël Bloch, the country wasted about € 80 million worth of power in 2024. Now, a group of lawmakers wants to put that extra juice to work. They’ve filed Amendment No. 547 with the National Assembly to fold Bitcoin mining into the national energy plan. Flexible Mining To Soak Up Excess Energy Based on reports, Bitcoin rigs can start and stop in seconds. That makes them ideal for soaking up sudden slugs of power that would otherwise vanish. France gets more than 70% of its electricity from nuclear plants. Those reactors aren’t built to throttle down fast when demand dips. Mining farms could jump in, kick their computers on, and gobble up the surplus until the grid needs a breather again. Reviving Old Factories As New Hubs Lawmakers want to set up mining centers close to power stations. They’re even eyeing old industrial sites that fell idle when factories shut doors. Those locations already have the hookups and space. Bringing in miners could spark new jobs in areas that have faced decline. Plus, the heat from the machines wouldn’t go to waste. It could warm homes or feed local factories, cutting energy bills for nearby communities. France lost €80M in 2024 due to… excess electricity. It’s such a missed opportunity for Bitcoin mining. The French grid operator is already warning about potential challenges in 2025. This situation presents a compelling case for Bitcoin mining in France, for several key… — Raphaël Bloch (@Raph_Bloch) April 17, 2025 Balancing Climate Goals With Carbon Costs Critics warn that mining still uses a lot of power. Even though France’s grid is mostly low-carbon, it isn’t zero-carbon. Bringing in too many rigs might push authorities to keep aging reactors online longer or fire up backup gas plants during peak use. That would chip away at the climate targets the amendment is meant to support. Parliament will have to set clear limits on mining capacity and tie operations to real power surpluses only. A Global Shift In How Countries See Mining France isn’t alone. Belarus has launched a study on using Bitcoin farms to absorb extra energy. Pakistan has set aside 2,000 megawatts for Bitcoin and AI data centers. Texas, with its wind-heavy grid, has even hailed mining as a way to smooth out wild swings in power supply. Daniel Batten, a researcher in the field, says this kind of controllable demand could be exactly what grids around the world need to handle green but unpredictable sources like wind and solar.

According to a June 16 report by Bloomberg, Cantor Fitzgerald analysts have upgraded their outlook on Solana. The firm highlighted Solana’s growing role in financial applications, thanks to its fast transaction speeds and cost efficiency. Meanwhile, Stellar is gaining more attention for its consistent performance, recording a daily trading volume of over $82.6 million. These signs suggest strong market confidence in utility-driven tokens. Amid this movement, Qubetics ($TICS) is attracting attention with its unique offering and rapidly closing presale. Qubetics is stepping in to solve a major problem: the lack of seamless communication between different blockchains. While Solana and Stellar are proving their value in payments and finance, Qubetics is taking a broader approach by building a unified Web3 experience across networks. With just one presale stage left before listing, it’s shaping up to be one of the top cryptos to invest in today. Qubetics Brings Real-World Use Through Interoperability Qubetics is the first Web3 aggregator designed to link major blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and more—within a single platform. The aim is simple: enable users and businesses to manage their crypto activities without switching between wallets or platforms. For example, a freelance designer working with clients across borders could receive payments in various tokens—such as ETH or SOL—and manage them all within one Qubetics interface. At the same time, a retail business accepting stablecoins from customers can process and reconcile payments across chains quickly. For logistics firms, this application means real-time token tracking and settlement without delays or manual processes. By enabling smoother communication between chains, Qubetics positions itself as a practical solution in everyday operations. This application alone makes it one of the top cryptos to invest in today for anyone looking at long-term utility. Final Stage Alert: Qubetics Presale Offers Rare ROI Opportunity – Top Cryptos to Invest in Today The Qubetics presale has now reached its 37th and final phase, priced at $0.3370. Over 516 million $TICS tokens have been purchased by more than 28,000 token holders, and the total funds raised have already surpassed $18 million. With just 10 million tokens left, this final stage offers a short window before the token lists at $0.40, locking in an instant 20% return for buyers at the current price. Following a major tokenomics revision, Qubetics has reduced its total supply from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion. This move creates scarcity and increases potential long-term value. In addition, by allocating 38.55% of the supply to public participants, the project is shifting toward a more decentralized and user-governed model. Market analysts are already projecting strong growth for $TICS, with estimated future values between $5 and $10. Based on these figures, a $20,000 investment today at $0.3370 would yield 59,347 tokens. At a $5 valuation, that turns into $296,735, and at $10, over $590,000. With listing coming soon, strong demand, and only one stage remaining, the Qubetics presale has become a leading pick among the top cryptos to invest in today . This opportunity is limited, and the momentum is building quickly. For those seeking the best crypto presale of 2025, this could be the right moment to act. Solana Gains Institutional Momentum with Financial Use Case Focus Solana is gaining renewed attention in 2025, not only for its speed and efficiency but also for its growing role in enterprise finance. As highlighted by Bloomberg, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald now rate Solana as “Overweight,” which means they believe it has strong growth potential. The reason is clear—Solana supports up to 65,000 transactions per second and maintains very low transaction fees. These features are attracting traditional financial companies exploring blockchain-based infrastructure. Solana’s ability to handle large transaction volumes without congestion makes it an appealing alternative for financial systems looking to upgrade. This development sets Solana apart as a serious contender among today’s top cryptocurrencies. It’s no longer just a fast blockchain—it’s becoming a bridge between digital assets and mainstream finance, adding real-world use to its technical strength. Stellar Maintains Steady Performance and Real-World Adoption Stellar (XLM), ranked #16 by market cap, has seen its price retreat to $0.2586 after a 5.47% weekly drop, despite maintaining solid fundamentals. With 31.21 billion XLM in circulation out of a 50 billion max supply, XLM holds a market cap of $8.07 billion—just over 62% of its $13 billion unlocked market potential and $12.93 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV). Trading volume in the past 24 hours hit $230.67 million, reflecting a strong 2.85% volume-to-market cap ratio, signaling continued investor interest. Although momentum has cooled, Stellar’s 77% profile score and consistent ecosystem activity keep it firmly on analysts’ watchlists. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss the Chance to Join This Best Crypto Presale Together, Solana, Stellar, and Qubetics represent different strengths in today’s digital asset market. Solana is gaining ground with institutional users due to its speed and enterprise capabilities. Stellar remains dependable with solid trading volume and real-world application in international payments. And then there’s Qubetics—offering a fresh, real-world solution for Web3 adoption with a closing presale that’s drawing widespread attention. With the final stage of its presale nearly over and the listing price already fixed at 20% higher, Qubetics stands out as a clear opportunity. The fundamentals are strong, the demand is rising, and the supply is running low. For those looking to secure value early, this is the time to join this best crypto presale and make a strategic move in 2025’s growing market. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics considered one of the top cryptos to invest in today? Because it solves interoperability issues and is in its final presale phase with high growth projections. What is the price prediction for $TICS after listing?

This drop comes shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF application. The new review deadline has now been pushed to November 2025, adding more uncertainty to the market. XRP Price Analysis: What’s Happening? Looking at XRP’s daily price chart, the market currently shows weak momentum in both directions. The price action remains choppy and range-bound, stuck between $2.10 and $2.35 for now. Unless the price breaks out of this range, traders expect XRP to continue moving sideways in the short term. Important support levels to watch are between $2.10 and $2.05. If XRP falls below this range with confirmation, the next support lies between $1.95 and $1.91, followed by $1.80. On the bullish front, resistance is seen around $2.32 to $2.36. A clear move above this could open the door for a rally towards $2.44 and $2.60. What’s Next for XRP? Despite the recent dip, XRP has been in an uptrend since April’s low. There’s still hope for a fifth wave rally that could push XRP prices above $5 in the long run, but for that to happen, XRP needs to hold support levels and break above recent highs. In the short term, unless XRP can climb past $2.33 and form a clear bullish pattern, the price is expected to remain range-bound, with traders keeping a close watch on whether the market finds a stable support zone soon. Conclusion The SEC’s decision delay has clearly shaken the market, and while long-term bullish hopes remain alive, XRP is currently struggling for momentum. Until a clearer move happens, traders can expect more sideways price action in the coming days.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 02:34:44

Additionally, rising stablecoin inflows to exchanges indicate growing buy-side liquidity, reinforcing the market’s bullish sentiment. Bitcoin Whales Foreseeing Major Rally Ahead? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin whales recorded one of the largest BTC outflows from Binance this month. The chart below shows that nearly 4,500 BTC were withdrawn on June 16. Bitcoin whales are defined as wallet addresses with significant BTC holdings. Past data suggests that such large withdrawals from whales have typically preceded price rallies, as they reflect a reduction in BTC exchange reserves, leaving fewer coins readily available for trading. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Beyond this large-scale withdrawal, on-chain data also reveals dwindling BTC inflows to exchanges from both whales and retail investors. This combination of major outflows and low deposits could be laying the groundwork for a Bitcoin “supply crunch.” For the uninitiated, a Bitcoin supply crunch occurs when the available BTC on exchanges declines sharply, reducing the immediate supply for buyers. This happens when long-term holders or whales withdraw BTC to cold storage, creating upward pressure on price as demand outpaces liquid supply. Stablecoin Inflows Witness Sharp Increase In parallel with Bitcoin’s exchange exodus, stablecoin inflows to Binance have surged in recent days. Notably, over $400 million in stablecoins flowed in on both June 13 and 15. Historically, such significant stablecoin inflows have been linked to buy-side liquidity preparation. In other words, large investors appear ready to deploy capital into crypto assets like BTC, reflecting renewed risk appetite. Taha concluded: The aggressive Bitcoin withdrawals and concurrent stablecoin deposits create a supply-demand asymmetry. With fewer BTC available on exchanges and growing liquidity to fuel buys, the stage is set for a potential price breakout. Meanwhile, additional exchange data supports the case for further upside in BTC. For example, the coin has been experiencing consistently negative funding rates on Binance – often a precursor to short squeezes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000 At the same time, Bitcoin’s long-term holder Realized Cap recently surpassed $20 billion, underscoring rising confidence among seasoned investors. In addition, despite the ongoing BTC rally, retail participation remains relatively low, suggesting further room for growth. However, short-term holders are showing signs of caution, increasing their selling amid recent price corrections. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,575, down 1.0% in the past 24 hours.
