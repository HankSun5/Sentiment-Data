Mutuum Finance is worth $0.035 in stage 6 of its presale. The protocol has over $15.9 million raised in funds and more than 16,370 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been pegged as a millionaire-maker token by analysts tracking the next-generation blockchain technology. Whereas Pepe Coin (PEPE) is predicted to establish ambitious price targets of $0.0001 by 2026, market experts argue that Mutuum’s combination of usability, scalability, and long-term value creation places it light-years ahead of hype-driven rivals. Smart money with a longer-term focus that wants more out of their investments than fleeting momentum is now on Mutuum Finance. PEPE Coin Stalls Even With Promising Plans PEPE is currently priced at $0.00001086, with its action in a tight range and showing little upward momentum compared to earlier stages with high community demand. Its enormous supply and meme-driven nature make sudden rallies dependent more on sentiment than protocol progress fundamentals. Resistance remains just above levels, while support zones remain in place not far below, so that a sturdy breakout would require new volume and catalyst events. Though PEPE has been modeled by some pundits with bullish price estimates, the majority of investors now eye its growth potential relative to emerging Mutuum Finance which is judged to have superior structural supports and higher upside potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 Mutuum Finance has already reached stage six of its presale at $0.035 following a 16.17% boost from the previous stage. The market is witnessing all-time demand for the project where it has already reached more than 16,370 investors and surpassed $15.9 million. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduced a Bug Bounty Program of $50,000 USDT for the security of the platform. The bugs have been divided into four levels depending on the tag critical, major, minor, and low. Collateralization of Mutuum Finance is asset-cap based and is differentiated based on the risk type an asset would bear. It encompasses supply capping, collateral and borrowing capping. The protocol hedges the market risk through overcollateralizing positions. The liquidators are also incentivized when unwinding the undercollateralized trades and thus risky positions are closed in real time. Risk tokens do not have much collateral usage but the most correlated tokens are used to their full extent so that they can build up their collateral. They are all focused on insolvency risk reduction in a way that no type of imbalance is incurred between borrowing and lending in the protocol. User Community and Growth Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to create an engaged user base with a $100,000 giveaway . Ten users will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens, paying them for contributing to the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly become one of the top cryptos to watch in 2025, supported by a strong DeFi focus. Pepe Coin on the other hand is heavily influenced by investor sentiment. Mutuum Finance has seen strong interest in its presale where more than 16,370 investors have raised over $15.9 million. The protocol is rewarding its growing community with a $50,000 bug bounty as well as a $100,000 token giveaway. With its emphasis on scalability, security, and environmentally friendly growth, MUTM provides much more than hype cycles. Lock up your tokens now in Stage 6 before the next price rise.

51945500,584509,1758232832,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"SEC Greenlights New ETF Standards, Opening Door for Altcoin ETFs",https://bitcoinist.com/sec-greenlights-etf-opening-door-for-altcoin-etfs/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved new generic listing standards for spot crypto and altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a landmark shift in digital asset regulation. Previously, every crypto ETF required lengthy case-by-case approval under Section 19b-4—a process that could drag on for months. With this new framework, ETFs meeting specific conditions can now be listed directly on major exchanges like Nasdaq, Cboe, and NYSE without waiting for individual sign-offs. This decision is expected to accelerate the arrival of altcoin ETFs in the U.S., broadening investment access beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts say the streamlined system represents the clearest path yet toward regulated, diversified crypto exposure. Grayscale Leads With First Multi-Crypto ETF Grayscale secured a first-mover advantage as its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) was approved under the new standards. The fund includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, making it the first diversified multi-crypto ETF in the U.S. “Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund $GDLC was just approved for trading… with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano,” Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg confirmed. ETF analysts noted this milestone signals a shift toward broader portfolio products rather than single-asset ETFs. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas estimated that 12–15 cryptos could soon qualify under the SEC’s framework, provided they have established regulated futures trading for at least six months. Altcoin ETFs Considered Imminent Beyond the majors, other altcoins are lining up for potential ETFs. Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Chainlink (LINK) already meet the key requirement of regulated futures trading on Coinbase Derivatives. Solana, for instance, became eligible on August 19, six months after its futures launch. The Chainlink community has also expressed optimism, with both Bitwise and Grayscale filing LINK ETF applications. Meanwhile, the Litecoin Foundation has welcomed the decision, seeing it as a pathway for LTC listings in U.S. markets. Even Hedera (HBAR) is gaining attention, with investors speculating on its ETF prospects. Industry watchers describe the SEC’s move as a turning point for crypto, one that reduces regulatory friction and boosts market confidence. As ETF analyst James Seyffart put it, “We’re gonna be off to the races in a matter of weeks.” With the SEC’s greenlight, the question is no longer if altcoin ETFs will launch, but which will debut first.

Analyst Eye 111% DOGE Breakout Despite Heavy Selling,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/massive-dogecoin-upside-analyst-eye-111-doge-breakout-despite-heavy-selling/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged 13% this week, climbing to $0.282, despite heavy selling pressure from investors. Over $1.63 billion worth of DOGE, nearly 5.81 billion tokens, have been moved to exchanges in September, signaling profit-taking and caution among traders. Related Reading: From $2 Trillion To $400T? CEO Sees Bitcoin Exploding 200x – Here’s More Long-term holders, who had previously offered stability, are also shifting assets according to the coin days destroyed (CDD) metric, often a sign of potential downside risk. However, the bullish rally remains strong, mainly driven by optimism about a possible spot Dogecoin ETF launch. This regulatory milestone, along with increasing corporate treasury use and payment integrations, has kept DOGE on the minds of institutional investors. Technical Setup Points to Potential DOGE Breakout Despite mixed short-term signals, technical analysts remain bullish. The Ichimoku Cloud setup shows all four major indicators aligned in favor of buyers, giving DOGE a “perfect +4” bullish score. Support levels sit near $0.255, with resistance forming at $0.287. A decisive break above could push DOGE toward $0.300 and beyond. Trader Tardigrade highlighted that Dogecoin’s consolidation pattern is steadily building momentum. Each resistance test has been met with higher lows, suggesting waning selling pressure. “Eventually, DOGE will break this resistance and reach new all-time highs,” he noted. Meanwhile, analyst Javon Marks set a breakout target of $0.6533, implying a 111% upside from current levels. CoinCodex forecasts also predict DOGE will trade at $0.32 by mid-October, reflecting continued bullish sentiment. DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Dogecoin ETF Hype and Market Outlook The U.S. SEC’s recent approval of listing standards for spot Dogecoin ETFs has further strengthened the bullish case. The launch of DOJE, backed by REX Shares and Osprey Funds, marks a milestone for meme coin adoption in regulated markets. Corporate participation, such as CleanCore Solutions’ Dogecoin treasury initiative, adds additional credibility and institutional demand. However, risks remain. If DOGE fails to hold above the critical $0.273 support level, analysts warn of a possible correction toward $0.241. Momentum indicators also show overbought conditions, hinting at potential short-term consolidation before any major breakout.

Trump had just wrapped up his second formal state visit, but this wasn’t about dinners and speeches. At Chequers, both men sat down with their delegations from the U.S. and U.K. to hash out trade, tech, and global security issues. The main issue on the table was updating the May 2025 U.S.-U.K. economic prosperity deal, which both sides now want to tweak. The U.K. specifically wants the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum gone. Trump seemed open to it earlier in the week when speaking on Air Force One. “They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,” he said. “We’ve made a deal, and it’s a great deal, and I’m into helping them. They’d like to see if they could get a little bit better deal. So, we’ll talk to them.” Trump discusses Putin, war in Ukraine, and a possible ceasefire While talks focused on trade, Trump and Starmer also addressed the Ukraine war. At a press conference at Chequers, Trump said, “The Russia situation, I hope we’re going to have some good news for you coming up.” He added, “Millions of people have died in that war, millions of souls… They’re being killed, and I feel I have an obligation to get it settled for that reason.” Trump then turned the heat on Vladimir Putin, saying, “He’s let me down. He’s really let me down.” This came as a surprise, considering Trump had repeatedly claimed during his 2024 campaign that he could end the war in a single day. He admitted on Thursday that ending the conflict has been harder than expected. “I’m very honored to tell you that we’ve solved seven wars, seven wars, wars that were unsolvable, wars that couldn’t be negotiated or done,” he said. “The one that I thought would be easiest would be because of my relationship with President Putin, but he’s let me down.” USA Today later checked that “seven wars” comment and found five confirmed ceasefires or agreements, while also pointing out that not everyone credited the White House for them. UK announces $204B in foreign investment as talks continue During the visit, the U.K. government announced £150 billion ($204 billion) in foreign investment. The deals span across AI, civil nuclear, financial services, and energy. The announcements dropped while Trump and Starmer were still in talks at Chequers. Duncan Edwards, head of BritishAmerican Business, called it a big moment for the U.K. “From a U.K. government perspective, they couldn’t really have asked for a better slew of announcements coming over the last three days with the civil nuclear, financial services, and all the AI announcements,” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.” But Edwards warned that words aren’t cash. “Promised dollars” weren’t the same as “actual dollars,” he said, adding that it’s still unclear if the investment will actually show up. The two leaders met after a formal state dinner the night before at Windsor Castle, where Trump addressed British and American officials, business leaders, and royals. He called the visit “one of the highest honors of my life” and joked he hoped he’d be the only president to ever get two state visits. King Charles returned the favor by complimenting Trump’s “personal commitment to finding solutions to some of the world’s most intractable conflicts.” Get seen where it counts.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bhutan-government-makes-remarkable-bitcoin-transfer-hundreds-of-bitcoins-moved-to-a-new-wallet-here-are-the-details/,"The government of the Kingdom of Bhutan has made a notable move regarding its cryptocurrency holdings. According to on-chain data published by Onchain Lens, the government transferred a total of 343.1 Bitcoin (approximately $40.18 million) to a new digital wallet. Bhutan Government Moves 343 Bitcoins to New Wallet, Expectations for Transfer to CEX Experts say that this transaction may have been made for the purpose of depositing funds into centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX), similar to past examples. It is known that the Bhutanese government has previously directed Bitcoin transfers of similar size to CEX platforms and used these funds within the scope of various financial strategies. Although Bhutan has traditionally had a closed economy, it has been making notable strides in the field of digital assets and blockchain technology in recent years. The country, which has invested in crypto mining, particularly using its hydroelectric resources, is one of the rare governments that holds Bitcoin in its state-backed strategic reserves. Market analysts believe the transfer points to two possible purposes: first, creating liquidity through the sale of funds; second, preparing for new commercial or investment moves through centralized exchanges. This development is being closely watched in crypto markets, as large-scale government wallet movements can lead to short-term fluctuations, particularly in Bitcoin's price. The Bhutanese government hasn't officially announced anything, adding to the uncertainty surrounding how the funds will ultimately be disbursed. However, industry experts believe the move indicates the country will continue to take a more active role in cryptocurrency policies. *This is not investment advice.

This potential move is supported by a string of major catalysts – the Federal Reserve’s rate cut yesterday, today’s launch of the first spot XRP ETF, and a clear uptick in institutional interest. If XRP successfully retests the $3.65 zone from above and holds it as support, momentum could accelerate toward the $10 mark. At $10, XRP’s market cap would soar to around $597 billion, putting it on par with Ethereum’s current valuation and cementing its place as one of the top assets in the crypto market.

Market conditions could be setting the stage for this move. Just last week, Bitcoin recorded a fresh all-time high at $124,128, surpassing its prior $122,838 peak from only a month earlier. However, momentum cooled after July’s hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data triggered a market pullback. At the same time, regulators are stepping up. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first complete legislation covering stablecoins, mandating full reserve backing. Shortly afterward, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, an initiative designed to modernize securities laws and provide clearer guidance for digital asset firms. With regulations advancing and optimism building, many analysts believe the next rally in altcoins and meme tokens could rival, or even exceed, the euphoric surge of 2021. If Gemini’s projections play out, XRP, Pepe, and Solana may lead the charge. XRP (Ripple): Gemini Predicts a 60% Jump Toward $5 by Year-End Gemini suggests Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $5 by late 2025, representing a more than fivefold increase from its current price of $3.00. The token has already displayed resilience. On July 18, XRP spiked to $3.65, topping its 2018 record of $3.40, before retracing about 15% amid broader macroeconomic headwinds. Globally, Ripple continues to expand its cross-border payments network. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund highlighted XRP as an affordable remittance tool for emerging economies. Earlier this year, Ripple’s drawn-out battle with the SEC officially came to an end when the agency dropped its case, following a 2023 court ruling confirming that retail XRP sales were not securities. The decision removed a major cloud of uncertainty for Ripple and other altcoins. Should XRP retest recent highs and sustain momentum, Gemini sees $5 although many analysts are claiming significantly higher valuations like $10 or $20. Technical indicators support a positive outlook. XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 59, suggesting buying momentum is picking up. The Fed’s decision to cut interest rates, along with today’s launch of the first spot XRP ETF , are likely price drivers. Over the last 12 months, XRP has soared 440%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 95% and Ethereum’s 98% during the same period. Pepe ($PEPE): Gemini Predicts a 5× Run for the Top Non-Dog Meme Coin Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has quickly grown into one of the three largest meme coins by market cap, now valued at around $4.75 billion, the biggest non-dog-themed meme token. Despite stiff competition, Pepe thrives on its deep liquidity and dedicated community. Elon Musk has even playfully referenced Pepe on X, sparking speculation that he may own it alongside Dogecoin. Currently priced at $0.0000113, Pepe has risen 4% overnight in step with an 4% rise across the now $90.8 billion meme coin sector. Furthermore the token gained 7% over the past week, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Shiba Inu. A decisive breakout above resistance in the $0.000018–$0.000022 zone could set the stage for a move to $0.00003 by mid-fall. In a favorable market, Gemini predicts Pepe could reach $0.00005, a fivefold increase from current levels. From a technical perspective, a descending wedge pattern forming between November and March suggests a bullish setup. With regulatory conditions improving, Pepe could be preparing for another strong rally. Solana (SOL): ETF Speculation and Ecosystem Growth Could Drive 4× Gains by December Solana ($SOL) continues to cement its position in the smart contract arena, with a market capitalization above $133.6 billion and total value locked (TVL) around $12.74 billion . Developer activity and institutional interest continue to climb. Some of the enthusiasm stems from speculation around a potential U.S.-listed Solana spot ETF, which could mimic the inflows seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were introduced. Adding fuel to the narrative, President Trump earlier this year floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. national Bitcoin reserve. However, under his plan, Solana would only be held if obtained from government seizures rather than purchased directly on the open market. Price performance has also improved. After peaking at $250 in January, sliding to $100 in April, and rebounding to $247, Solana is almost at its highest point over the year to date (YTD). This breakout from a descending wedge pattern has Gemini projecting that a rally toward $1,000 by year’s end is feasible, more than tripling its previous record of $293.31. Achieving such a milestone, however, may depend on the SEC implementing broader crypto regulatory clarity in the coming months. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Risk Alternative to Dogecoin For investors seeking opportunities outside Gemini’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) offers a speculative meme coin option, branding itself as Dogecoin’s edgier cousin. While Dogecoin has matured into a multibillion-dollar asset that often tracks Bitcoin and Ethereum, its wild volatility from 2021 has moderated.

The digital asset industry, collectively capitalizing $4.2 trillion, has seen limited expansion over recent months due to inflation fears and geopolitical headwinds, though Bitcoin did set a fresh record high at $124,128 just last month. The crypto market also rose 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Aside from Bitcoin, substantial capital continues flowing into both established altcoins and the best meme coins. Over the past year, many projects have set new price milestones, reflecting increasing investor enthusiasm across the sector. Fueling this optimism are two key policy shifts from Washington. First, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, the United States’ first broad regulatory framework governing stablecoins. Second, the SEC launched Project Crypto, a new initiative to modernize and clarify securities laws as they apply to digital assets. With sentiment improving, it’s worth examining how leading altcoins such as XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin are positioning for potential upside. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Leader is Arguably the Best Crypto Altcoin in 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) reached a record $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act was signed into law, beating its previous 2018 peak of $3.40. Since then, it has eased back to about $3.12, a 15% drop from that high. XRP’s appeal lies in its rapid, cost-effective global transfers, offering an alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. Its credibility is further reinforced by recognition from organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and even acknowledgment from the White House. Earlier this year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a high-level presidential roundtable on crypto policy, cementing the company’s influence in shaping the industry. The token gained fresh momentum in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that retail sales of XRP did not breach securities laws, effectively resolving its long-standing dispute with the SEC. Over the last twelve months, XRP has climbed 440%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 95% gain. A mid-July surge has kept the coin anchored near the $3 mark, a level that has proven resilient despite wider market swings. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) sits near 59, and uptrading, signaling cautious increased inflows following the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates and the launch of the first spot ETF today. Looking ahead, the SEC is expected to rule on more potential spot XRP ETFs in mid-October. A positive decision could push XRP to $4 or higher within the same month. Cardano ($ADA): The Sustainable Ethereum Competitor Eyeing a 2026 Growth Cycle Cardano ($ADA) has consistently ranked among the top altcoins, and 2025 is no exception. Over the past year, ADA surged 175%, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano operates as a smart contract platform focused on sustainability through its Proof-of-Stake consensus and rigorous peer-reviewed research,an approach that even influenced Ethereum’s own development path. With a market cap of $33.5 billion, ADA would need to triple in value to rival Solana and begin challenging Ethereum’s dominance. Currently trading at around $0.9184, ADA posted a 5% overnight gain, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum’s respective 3% and 3.6% increases. Favorable political and macroeconomic developments could propel ADA toward $1.50 by fall, and potentially back to its $3.09 all-time high before year-end, a 240% jump from current levels. Technically, ADA formed a bullish flag between December and March, pointing to further upside potential. Like XRP, its RSI is trending up from 59, signaling market wide appetite for crypto is building. Key resistance sits at $1.15, with strong support in the $0.85–$0.90 zone. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Can the First Meme Coin Finally Break $1? Launched in 2013 as a parody, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has grown into the most recognized meme coin, boasting a $42.4 billion market cap and a passionate fan base supported by high-profile figures. The token’s breakout moment came in 2021 when endorsements from Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons pushed it into mainstream awareness. This May, institutional investors renewed interest, lifting DOGE back into the $0.25 range amid speculation about possible spot Dogecoin ETFs in the U.S. The coin now trades at $0.281, marking a 5.4% overnight gain, a 13% weekly gain and outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Shiba Inu over the same stretch. While DOGE’s technical indicators remain bullish, its RSI is pretty high at 67, which could point to a sell-off over the weekend as traders reap the rewards of its rapid recent price appreciation. Market-wide momentum and supportive policy headlines could enable further growth, so DOGE could still climb toward $0.50 by mid-October. Adoption is also expanding: Tesla accepts DOGE for purchases, while PayPal and Revolut continue adding support, further strengthening its real-world use cases. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The First Bitcoin Layer 2 and One of 2025’s Most Promising Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is among 2025’s most hyped presale projects, aiming to become Bitcoin’s first Layer 2 that combines viral meme appeal with scalability and community-driven development. Its vision is to enhance Bitcoin with faster transactions, added functionality, and grassroots governance. The presale has already attracted more than $16.6 million, with analysts projecting potential post-launch gains of 10× or more. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER supports ultra-fast smart contracts for Bitcoin while keeping fees low. A standout feature is its Canonical Bridge, which enables near-instant BTC transfers on its Layer 2 while powering dApps, meme tokens, and payments with minimal transaction costs. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed no security flaws, further boosting investor confidence. $HYPER serves multiple functions, including staking, transaction fees, and governance. Early presale participants can earn up to 69% APY through staking while also gaining voting rights on ecosystem upgrades after launch.

These three tokens have outperformed the market average today, with the Fed’s rate cut boosting investor appetite for risk-on assets such as cryptos. But what makes this period particularly bullish is that we may begin to see a flood of ETF approvals from the SEC, including for XRP and other major altcoins. This is likely to drive the prices of XRP, BNB and SHIB upwards in the coming weeks, with all three tokens potentially hitting new record highs. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – New DBS and Franklin Partnership Will Push Altcoin Price to New ATH Soon XRP has bounced to $3.12 today, making for a 4% increase in the past 24 hours and a 10% rise in the past fortnight. The coin has also risen by 4% in a month, and what’s encouraging about this is that it’s a sign that XRP is still some way from being overbought (and needing to correct). Indeed the XRP price could perform very strongly in the coming weeks, and not just because of yesterday’s rate cut. Introducing the next building block of onchain markets – we’re partnering with @DBSbank and @FTI_Global to establish repo markets powered by tokenized collateral and stablecoins: https://t.co/vFTL32XO8C Investors will be able to use $RLUSD to trade for Franklin Templeton’s money… — Ripple (@Ripple) September 18, 2025 It’s also benefiting from Ripple’s accelerated growth as a company, with the firm announcing a new tokenization partnership with DBS and Franklin Templeton today. This comes in addition to recent partnerships with BBVA, the $200 million acquisition of Rails, and the company’s expansion into Africa and Dubai. Now is therefore a very bullish time for XRP, which is waiting for the SEC to decide on applications for over 10 XRP ETFs. Source: TradingView It’s in this hugely bullish context that the coin’s chart shows signs of ongoing price rises, with its indicators still moving up from previously oversold positions. The crypto price prediction for XRP is therefore very positive, with the coin set to hit $3.50 by the end of the month, and pass $5 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Binance Coin ($BNB) – Exchange Token Setting New Record Highs Amid High Binance Volumes BNB set a record high of $1,004 only a few hours ago, and at $991, it has posted a 3.5% gain in 24 hours and a 17% increase in the past month. These moves have pushed BNB up to 5th in the market in terms of capitalization, while it’s also up by 84% in the last 12 months. Its chart is unsurprisingly showing some real momentum right now, yet there’s a danger that it may be close to peaking, implying a correction. Source: TradingView However, while its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have entered overbought positions, the wider market’s overall trajectory may help it to continue climbing in the coming weeks. If the SEC does approve the vast majority of outstanding ETF applications (and it approved a multi-crypto ETF yesterday ), then this could send demand even higher, pushing the BNB price with it. An expanding cryptocurrency market will boost Binance’s position as crypto’s biggest exchange , which in turn will increase demand for BNB. As such, we could see the altcoin reach $1,600 by the of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: SHIB Price Builds Bullish Momentum – Major Breakout Now Imminent At $0.00001334, SHIB has gained by 2.5% in the past 24 hours and 9% in the past fortnight, with the meme token also up by 6% in the past month. But if we look at its chart today, we see that there’s still lots of scope for further increases in the coming days and weeks. For instance, its MACD has only recently risen into a positive position, above the baseline, having spent most of August and a little of September at a negative level. We see a similar pattern with SHIB’s relative strength index, which has risen above 50 in recent days, but which is still far from enter overbought territory. Source: TradingView Now is therefore still a good time to buy SHIB, which remains down by 84.5% in relation to its ATH of $0.00008616, implying that it could rise quickly in Q4. Longer term, SHIB also benefits from the fact that Shiba Inu is one of the fundamentally stronger meme tokens, benefitting from a growing ecosystem of platforms, protocols and dapps. Its has its own DEX (ShibaSwap), its own layer-two network (Shibarium), while it has also seen the launch of numerous games in recent months. Given this foundation, the crypto price prediction for SHIB remains very positive, and the meme token could reach $0.00020 by the middle of October, before ending the year above $0.000060. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Innovative New Meme Token Raises $1.25 Million in Presale Traders looking to diversify into newer, smaller-cap tokens may also be interested in some of the presale coins currently available, with some of these showing promise. One interesting example of this is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that boasts a gamified staking system. Ready.. Aim.. MINE! https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/X8843bod4f — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 18, 2025 It opened its ICO only a few weeks ago, but has already raised $1.25 million, a sign of its future potential. PEPENODE is the market’s first mine-to-earn token, with its staking system inviting users to build and grow a virtual mining rig. By spending PEPENODE to add more nodes to their rig, users can earn greater staking rewards, as well as rewards in other meme coins (such as Pepe and Fartcoin). This is an interesting mechanic, and it’s one that could see the PEPENODE price rise steadily over time, as miners accumulate more of the token. Investors can join the coin’s presale at the PEPENODE website , where it’s currently available at $0.0010617. This price will rise later today, and will continue to rise for as long as the sale lasts, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later.

Data indicate that over $3 billion in net inflows were contributed to the large wallets, and this is one of the highest accumulation waves in 2025. This trend indicates a belief in Bitcoin’s strength, despite ongoing controversy on whether the market is at its peak. Additionally, whale activity has long been used as a solid indicator of the market direction. Their surge in August indicates high belief, and analysts predict it may provide the platform for strong gains in Q4. However, with the power of Bitcoin, whales are diversifying as well. A good number is already starting to purchase early slots in a new entrant, MAGACOIN FINANCE, with a credible security and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation in August According to on-chain metrics, whales transferred coins out of exchanges in large amounts last month. This activity has increased net inflows to record highs since the start of the year of up to $3 billion. According to analysts, this kind of movement is a precursor to rallies, as the whales gather ahead of others in the wider crypto market. Support at close to $114,000 has been strong, and whales have made a point of boosting the demand anytime the price dipped. These moves underscore a long-term conviction that Bitcoin is the foundation of the crypto market. The Role of Whale Behavior More so, whale wallets tend to be the most accurate indicator of wider market sentiment. History continues to dictate that when there is high purchasing of whales, the market will experience surges. Their August activity reflected previous stages when Bitcoin rallies started slowly and then soared upwards. To smaller investors, these actions are educational. Although the involvement of retailers is divided, whale conviction indicates bullish sentiment. According to analysts, this accumulation is an indicator that whales believe that Bitcoin will keep rising. Whales Diversify Into Meme Coins In spite of being committed to Bitcoin, the whales are also trying new avenues in search of better returns. The latest trends demonstrate that big investors are offloading into meme coins in search of higher returns than the less volatile Bitcoin growth. The strategy is simple: Bitcoin gives security in the long term, whereas meme coins can guarantee high-ROI investments in bullish cycles. This diversification is an indication of a mature approach. Whales no longer feel content with possessing just Bitcoin. They are diversifying their portfolios with speculative investments, which may increase their returns. Whale-Backed Meme Coin for ROI MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the meme coin of choice for Bitcoin whales, diversifying after a record August. Whales added over $3 billion in BTC last month, but their latest moves show a shift toward meme coins with explosive upside potential. These large investors are securing early allocations in MAGACOIN FINANCE, aiming to balance portfolios between high-growth opportunities and long-term security. Bitcoin remains the foundation of whale holdings, but MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the chance for outsized returns during meme season. The strategy reflects a balanced approach: Bitcoin for stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE for ROI potential. Analysts say this dual-track positioning could define the next phase of whale investment in 2025. Conclusion Bitcoin whales dominated August by adding over $3 billion to their wallets, reinforcing faith in the asset’s resilience. Their conviction points to continued strength heading into Q4. Simultaneously, diversification is shaping whale portfolios. By adding MAGACOIN FINANCE alongside Bitcoin, whales are blending long-term stability with the potential for explosive ROI. Analysts believe this dual approach will define the months ahead, making MAGACOIN FINANCE an altcoin to watch closely.

PEPE Is Approaching The End Of A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a TA pattern forming in the 1-day price of Pepe. The pattern in question is a “Symmetrical Triangle,” which forms when an asset observes consolidation between two trendlines approaching each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the pattern acts as a resistance barrier, while the lower one provides support. Together, they make it so that the price remains stuck in the channel between them, and since the trendlines involved here are of the converging type, the asset’s range shrinks as it moves inside the triangle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Down 13% As Whales Distribute $181 Million In DOGE An escape out of either of these bounds can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, a break above the triangle can be a bullish sign, while a decline under it a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that the 1-day PEPE price is currently trading inside: As is visible in the above graph, Pepe has been stuck inside this channel since December of last year, but its price is now not far from the apex. Generally, breakouts become more likely to occur the tighter an asset’s range is, as it means retests happen more frequently. With the memecoin standing inside the narrow tip of the triangle now, its range is quite small, so an escape could be probable to occur in the near future. Symmetrical Triangles are usually considered to have an equal bias in both directions, so a possible breakout could occur in either direction for the asset. Triangle breakouts are generally of the same length as the base of the triangle (that is, the distance between the trendlines at their widest). Based on this, the analyst believes the memecoin may be gearing up for a 78% move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Touches $117,000 As Binance Records 9 Days Of Outflows It now remains to be seen how the price of the cryptocurrency will develop in the near future and which side of the Symmetrical Triangle a breakout would take place. The Symmetrical Triangle is just one type of triangles that exist in TA. Another popular variant is the Ascending Triangle, which forms when the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, Solana has seen a breakout above such a triangle on the daily timeframe. “Solana $SOL may retest the breakout zone at $210 before pushing toward the $320 target!” explains the analyst. PEPE Price At the time of writing, Pepe is trading around $0.00001137, up more than 9% over the last week.

51947459,584267,1758236434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51947459.jpeg,Ripple Seals Deal With Southeast Asia’s Largest Bank,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-deal-southeast-asia-largest-bank/,"Ripple has inked a three-way agreement with DBS and Franklin Templeton to bring tokenized money market funds and stablecoin-based liquidity onto DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx), in a move that squarely targets institutional demand for on-chain yield and credit. Biggest Bank In Southeast Asia Taps Ripple Tech Under a memorandum of understanding signed on September 18, DDEx will list Franklin Templeton’s sgBENJI—the token of the Franklin Onchain US Dollar Short-Term Money Market Fund—alongside Ripple’s US dollar stablecoin, RLUSD , enabling eligible clients to swap between a yield-bearing fund token and a stable unit of account around the clock. Ripple says the solution is being built on the public XRP Ledger, with repo-style lending to follow as the initiative expands. DBS, Southeast Asia’s largest bank by assets (over $500 billion as of 2025), framed the tie-up as part of a broader institutional shift toward tokenized market infrastructure. “Digital asset investors need solutions that can meet the unique demands of a borderless 24/7 asset class,” said Lim Wee Kian, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange. The bank added that, in a next phase, it will explore allowing clients to post sgBENJI as collateral to obtain credit either directly from DBS via repurchase transactions (repos) or from third-party platforms where DBS acts as collateral agent—formally pulling a core money-markets use case on-chain. Franklin Templeton, which has been at the vanguard of tokenized funds, will issue sgBENJI on the XRP Ledger to increase interoperability across networks. Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, called the collaboration “a meaningful advancement in the utility of tokenized securities” and “a significant step forward in the growth of Asia’s digital asset ecosystem.” Ripple’s VP and global head of trading and markets, Nigel Khakoo, underscored the capital-markets angle, saying the link-up to “enable repo trades for a tokenized money market fund” with a regulated, liquid exchange medium like RLUSD “is truly a game-changer.” Monica Long, Ripple’s president, situated the announcement in the larger tokenization debate, arguing that real-world assets must have both tradability and practical uses to fulfill their promise. “In order for tokenized financial assets to solve the problems they’ve been promised to solve, we need both 1/ liquid secondary markets and 2/ utility for these assets (such as with collateralization). That’s exactly what Ripple, DBS and FTI are working towards with this announcement,” she wrote via X. The mechanics are designed for institutional portfolio management. By listing sgBENJI and RLUSD side by side, accredited investors on DDEx can quickly rebalance from volatile crypto exposures into a comparatively stable, yield-accruing fund token without leaving a single, bank-supervised ecosystem. Ripple and DBS say settlement finality within minutes and 24/7 market access are central to the design, with the XRP Ledger chosen for speed, low fees and throughput suitable for high-volume fund token transfers.

This action aims to boost the revival of Europe’s capital markets. Following their pledge, the international organization intends to enhance pension investment growth and loosen strict cryptocurrency regulations . These plans were made public after Maria Luis Albuquerque, a European Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services, and the Capital Markets Union, shared them on Thursday, September 18, according to reports from reliable sources. The commissioner also highlighted that the commission was considering granting the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), its major market regulator, more direct supervisory powers. The EU vows to enact effective economic strategies to reform its single market During a conference in Copenhagen, Albuquerque stated the commission’s main aim towards implementing these changes . Based on her argument, they want to eliminate cross-border barriers, lower administrative expenses, and ensure the implementation of simple regulations. Her remarks came when individuals raised concerns about getting tired of the EU’s slow-moving approach to reforming its single market. These concerns were raised a year after Mario Draghi, a prominent Italian economist who served as the European Central Bank’s President (ECB), released a significant report on enhancing the European economy using the financial sector. Even with this economic strategy, Draghi warned that Europe was dragging behind global changes at the beginning of this week. Meanwhile, as the ESMA gains supervisory powers, the commission will thoroughly assess whether centralized oversight of specific market infrastructures, such as central counterparties, central securities depositories, and trading venues, will be beneficial. Concerning this, Albuquerque pointed out that emerging sectors like crypto asset service institutions would also benefit from increased centralized supervision while still allowing national authorities to perform their responsibilities. The EU proposes measures to encourage investments in Europe Albuquerque shared additional information about the commission’s proposals that are expected to be implemented by the end of this month. The proposals are intended to encourage investments in Europe and redirect household savings stored in bank accounts into investments. A reliable source familiar with the situation reported that the commission will propose several tax incentives to promote investment. This will include deductions for opening savings and investment accounts, exemptions on income from investments, and introducing a system that will delay taxes until people withdraw their funds from their bank accounts. These suggestions are part of what is referred to as the Savings and Investments Union. This initiative aims to assist European businesses in gaining easier access to funding, as it simultaneously provides more financial opportunities for consumers. This draft may be updated before September 30, the preferred date for the commission to issue these recommendations. For the EU’s pension plan that Albuquerque had shared earlier, the commission will suggest auto-enrollment for workplace pensions, establish systems that track pensions, and offer advice on the most suitable practices to be adopted. These recommended measures must undergo the EU legislative process and represent another effort by Brussels to utilize European capital to enhance the local economy. In the meantime, during her yearly speech last week, President Ursula von der Leyen pointed out internal obstacles in the single market. According to her, they act as a 45% tariff on goods and a 110% tariff on services.

The announcement came during a press call where Jensen confirmed he personally discussed the terms with Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan, a longtime associate. “We thought it was going to be such an incredible investment,” Jensen said, adding that the agreement was finalized Saturday after months of back-and-forth. As Cryptopolitan reported , the partnership involves Nvidia building AI systems and PC chips alongside Intel, combining Nvidia’s graphics processors with Intel’s x86 CPUs. The deal covers more than just a handshake. Nvidia will be buying central processors from Intel to power its NVLink rack AI servers, which currently use Arm chips. Jensen explained: “We’ll buy those CPUs from Intel, and then we’ll connect it into super chips that then becomes our compute node, that then gets integrated into a rack scale AI supercomputer.” At the same time, Intel will start pushing laptops and PC chips that include Nvidia’s GPU components, tech that Jensen says will help both companies tap into a $50 billion market. Nvidia plugs into Intel’s hardware as Intel sells off assets Greg Ernst, Intel’s revenue chief, said on LinkedIn that the agreement came together over the past few months and was finalized on Saturday. Under the deal, Nvidia becomes a major customer of Intel CPUs while also supplying GPU chiplets that go into Intel’s client-side products. “We’re going to become a very large customer of Intel CPUs, and we’re going to be a large supplier of GPU chiplets into Intel chips,” Jensen told reporters. He clarified that the partnership won’t affect Nvidia’s existing work with Arm, and that Thursday’s announcement is only about products, not Intel’s foundry. Right now, Nvidia uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to manufacture its chips. But Jensen said they still evaluate Intel’s foundry capabilities and may work with them down the line. For this partnership though, the collaboration will only involve Intel’s chip packaging, the late-stage part of chip production that combines components into a single part ready for installation. Tan, who was named Intel’s CEO in March after Pat Gelsinger was ousted, said during the same press call, “I’d like to thank Jensen for the confidence in me, and our team and Intel will work really hard to make sure it’s a good return for you.” Pat was removed by Intel’s board last year due to rising costs in manufacturing and failure to break into the AI chip market. Since then, Tan has led Intel through major cost-cutting and fundraising moves. Intel has raised $2 billion from SoftBank, sold a majority stake in its ASIC subsidiary Altera to Silver Lake for $3.3 billion, and offloaded $1 billion in stock from Mobileye, its self-driving tech unit. The company also said in July that it’s laying off 15% of its workforce by year’s end. In total, Intel has received $8.9 billion in CHIPS Act grants and loans from the U.S. government—but the Trump administration requested a 10% equity stake in exchange for the funds. That stake was secured in August. Despite the cash, Intel still hasn’t landed any major foundry customers like Nvidia or Apple. Analysts have said the company needs at least one to prove that its technology is reliable at scale. If it doesn’t, it may be forced to abandon the foundry business altogether. That has raised concern in Washington, where lawmakers see Intel as strategically important due to its status as the only American firm that can build top-tier chips onshore. Jensen was in England earlier this week with President Donald Trump, attending a state dinner at Windsor Palace and announcing new projects in the U.K. But both Jensen and a White House official confirmed that the U.S. government was not involved in the Nvidia-Intel deal. Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, later said in a statement, “Intel’s new partnership with Nvidia is a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing.” Intel’s fall over the last five years has been steep. Its shares have dropped 31.78%, while Nvidia’s have jumped 1,348%, putting Nvidia’s market cap at $4.25 trillion compared to Intel’s $143 billion as of Thursday’s close.

The Russian news agency Interfax reported on September 17 that a court in the city has ordered the arrest the head of a Russian Railways (RZD) power department, along with his deputy. The Smolninsky District Court ruled that Sergei Kuznetsov, the head of the RZD’s St Petersburg-Finlyandsky Station Electricity Supply Department, and his deputy Nikolai Baltser, should remain in custody until November 15. The station is one of the biggest and most important rail transport hubs in the country. Russian Railways Staffers ‘Mined Crypto at Power Substations’ Prosecutors say the duo stole nearly 1 billion rubles (over $12 million) worth of power from their employer to power crypto mining rigs. A Russian Railways train in Chelyabinsk, Russia. (Source: Andrey Khabarov [CC BY 3.0]) The duo has been charged with abuse of power-related offenses. But police think they did not act alone. Investigators said an as-yet “unidentified mastermind” paid Kuznetsov and Baltzer. Officers say the mastermind used this aid to “tap Russian Railways facility resources for energy-intensive mining.” This mastermind, police think, belongs to an organized criminal group that also includes other RZD employees. Police said they found crypto mining rigs “illegally installed at the Gromovo and Lugovaya substations.” Both substations are connected to the RZD’s central power grid. The rigs operated undetected from September 16, 2024, until they were discovered on September 16 this year, officers added.

Prosecutors say they believe that arrestees were “aware” that the rigs would require an “uncontrolled consumption of electrical energy.” The suspects also reportedly understood that their actions were a violation of RDZ’s property rights. They also knew that this would “harm the legitimate interests of their employer,” prosecutors added. Prosecution officials reported that Kuznetsov “immediately began cooperating” with the pretrial investigation upon his arrest. However, both defendants said they objected to being taken into custody. Kuznetsov and Baltzer both said they had no intention of trying to flee ahead of their trials. Earlier this month, Russian electronics retailers reported that demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg and the surrounding region is now the third highest in the country . Evidence appears to suggest that some miners are leaving traditional Bitcoin mining hotspots in Southern Siberia and the North Caucasus in favor of larger urban areas.

That pattern repeated when EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) highlighted a recent statement from Jim Cramer, interpreting it as a decisive signal of altseason for the crypto market. Cramer had insisted that “Altseason is just a myth, it’ll never happen,” a dismissal that resonated because of his reputation for bold market calls that often fail spectacularly. Among digital asset traders, such remarks frequently serve as cues to go in the opposite direction , and EGRAG CRYPTO’s response reinforced that perception. Thank you Lord for the Signal pic.twitter.com/NaeQ6nzQri — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 17, 2025 Cramer’s Reputation and the Crypto Market Sentiment Cramer has built a career as a financial commentator, but his track record is widely perceived as unreliable. Traders often treat his dismissals or endorsements as reasons to anticipate the opposite outcome. When he declared that altseason would never happen, many observers interpreted it as indirect confirmation that such a cycle could arrive soon. EGRAG CRYPTO amplified this view by stating, “Thank you, Lord, for the Signal,” implying that Cramer’s skepticism might mark the onset of a strong altcoin cycle. Altseason and XRP Adding to the excitement is the prediction by veteran trader Peter Brandt concerning the start of altseason . Altseason refers to a period when digital assets outside of Bitcoin experience sharp upward moves, and Brandt is convinced that the market has entered this phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historically, these periods follow phases of Bitcoin strength and often bring massive gains for tokens with established communities. XRP stands among those frequently highlighted as a major candidate for growth when altseason materializes. Many other analysts have also reiterated their altseason predictions , and with a loyal base of holders and ongoing discussions about its role in global finance, XRP benefits disproportionately when capital flows into the altcoin sector. What’s Next for XRP? The possibility of a significant altseason now rests on both technical and psychological foundations. Some inexperienced market participants might view Cramer’s dismissal as a counter-signal, but analysts such as EGRAG CRYPTO see it as confirmation. If capital does rotate heavily into altcoins, XRP could find itself in a position to register sharp moves upward . That expectation has become a central point for investors who believe that market cycles repeat and that XRP, given its liquidity and recognition, could serve as one of the leading beneficiaries.

This wave of rapid adoption is changing the way investors perceive both established giants and emerging speculative plays. XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE now stand as two of the most talked-about names on opposite ends of the spectrum. XRP is a legacy altcoin with global partnerships and enterprise adoption, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is a rising meme-driven presale token. The question for investors: which among these is the best crypto to buy as this market grows towards unprecedented scale? XRP: Momentum and Utility XRP has constantly proven to be one of the most resilient altcoins in the market. Its focus on enterprise level payment solutions have made it widely used among banks and financial institutions. Ripple’s increasing partnership in several different jurisdictions have strengthened the position of XRP as a practical utility coin. Price momentum has made a comeback too with XRP rising steadily as it broke through key resistance levels. Analysts highlight positive technical structures that could propel the asset toward new highs. Combined with speculation around the potential of an XRP ETF, sentiment around the coin is looking increasingly optimistic. XRP is considered by many to be a safer long-term bet. For investors who want to get exposed to the adoption of blockchain without the extreme volatility, it remains to be a cornerstone option. MAGACOIN FINANCE Designed for Explosive ROI MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured attention for very different reasons. Built with token economies based on scarcity, the altcoin applies a 12% burn upon every transaction. These prices constantly supply pressure to value appreciation in support of long term value appreciation. Unlike many projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has paired its community appeal with structure and credibility. The altcoin has been audited entirely by respected firms adding further as a trust for the investor pool. Analysts point to this transparency as a rare strength in a market that is often riddled with conjectures of unverified statements. But what makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out most is its return potential. Analysts suggest the coin could have 2000% ROI before the market even reaches the $100 trillion mark. This projection is based on both the deflationary mechanics, and also on its positioning as a rising name in the altcoin space. For investors seeking higher risk and reward, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly moving onto watchlists. The $100 Trillion Market Outlook The wider environment is conducive to both types of assets. Forecasts of 4 billion crypto users by 2030, however, means established players like XRP will continue to anchor adoption. At the same time, high-upside tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioned to capture higher inflows. Institutional adoption, retail growth and regulatory progress all point toward a maturing industry. In such an environment, portfolios may consist of a rapidly growing mix of both stable utility coins and riskier altcoins with exponential growth potential. Which Altcoin Is the Best Buy? For conservative investors, XRP remains a proven choice that has great utility and partnerships, as well as adoption. For risk-tolerant investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers bold upside with analysts pointing to 2000% ROI potential. As the crypto market continues to make its way to $100 trillion, it is a question of strategy. Do you prioritize stability with XRP, or chase upside gains with MAGACOIN FINANCE?

According to on-chain data from ValidatorQueue.com, the exit backlog has surged to unexpected levels, and the investors making the withdrawals are now facing a wait time of more than 44 days before their ETH is fully unstaked. This sudden spike in withdrawals raises serious questions about the possibility of looming selling pressure and how it might affect the Ethereum price. Largest Exit Queue Ever Recorded According to data from ValidatorQueue.com, about 2.6 million ETH were queued up to be unstaked, its largest exit number on record. This exit queue number dwarfs all previous periods of validator exits since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake in September 2022. At its peak, the ETH tokens in the queue were worth about $12 billion. Interestingly, the chart data from ValidatorQueue shows a growing trend of more validators unstaking their ETH in recent weeks, as evidenced by the parabolic rise since mid-August. Analyst MartyParty commented on social media platform X , stating, “Ethereum Staking Exit Queue parabolic.” Such a large-scale withdrawal event highlights growing unease among stakers, and institutional participants or large staking providers are behind the sudden mass exits. The exit queue has witnessed a parabolic rise in recent months that is hard to ignore. This rise started in July 2025, when the average number of ETH waiting to be unstaked jumped from below 10,000 ETH to about 250,000 ETH within a matter of days. By the end of the month, the exit queue had escalated and climbed past 740,000 ETH. August also saw a similar rise, with queue numbers averaging around 800,000 ETH before crossing 1 million ETH at the end of the month. Now, the queue numbers have more than doubled in September, reaching a peak of 2.63 million ETH last week. As it stands, there are more than 2.4 million ETH waiting to leave the network. The backlog is so large that validators are facing an estimated 43 days and 3 hours of wait time before their ETH can be fully unstaked. Implications For Ethereum Price With more than $12 billion in ETH queued for withdrawal, the looming question is whether this will translate into significant sell pressure on exchanges. If these withdrawals are liquidated, the Ethereum price could face downward pressure. This would damage Ethereum’s rally, which has picked up this week. However, not all unstaked ETH is necessarily heading for the open market. Some may be repositioned into restaking protocols or into Spot Ethereum ETFs. On the other hand, ETH staking has slowed down massively. At the time of writing, 451,950 ETH are currently in the entry queue to be staked. This is a 53% decline from 959,717 ETH on September 5. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,572, up by 2.1% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Staking Exit Queue|ethusd|ETHUSDT|MartyParty|spot Ethereum ETFs|ValidatorQueue.com,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-19 00:00:08

He shared a video that begins with an image of a figure standing on a downward line, symbolizing what many might see as a decline in the market, and Squire suggests that it’s time to sell XRP because the bull market is over. However, as the clip continues, it zooms out to reveal that the apparent downturn is part of a much larger upward trajectory. This mirrors a common sentiment among XRP supporters who view recent market struggles as temporary setbacks rather than permanent shifts. Squire’s Perspective on XRP Squire used the video to express his opinion on the current state of the market. While on the surface his comments may seem pessimistic, the full context of the video conveys a different message. Through the video, he highlights how short-term declines can sit within longer-term growth phases. The bull market is over, time to sell everything $XRP pic.twitter.com/7ugK5WOpKI — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 17, 2025 XRP has experienced difficulties in recent months, with price movements falling short of expectations. The asset reached a new all-time high of $3.65 in July, but has struggled since, losing multiple key support levels. Some investors have grown frustrated, pointing to underperformance compared to other digital assets. Yet, despite these challenges, Squire and many others still emphasize XRP’s long-term potential . His post reflects a segment of the community that regards the current environment as a time to reassess rather than abandon positions. One commenter suggested that now is the best time to buy more, reiterating the belief in the asset’s long-term trajectory.

The asset’s technology and established partnerships remain key reasons why many retain confidence in it. Squire’s post signals that although price volatility can unsettle traders, it does not necessarily diminish the asset’s prospects. This video reinforces the belief that temporary market downturns can coexist with the potential for future appreciation. Many investors view times of uncertainty as opportunities to evaluate assets more closely. XRP is trading at $3.12, and investors are already seizing the opportunity to buy the dip and accumulate tokens.

This comes in the wake of concerns about the exchange’s alleged ties to President Donald Trump’s administration and the potential easing of regulatory oversight. Warren Pressures DOJ On Binance Compliance Following years of legal challenges, which culminated in the resignation and brief imprisonment of former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) over allegations of money laundering in the US, Binance appeared to have navigated a path toward a more favorable regulatory environment during Trump’s presidency. However, in a recent letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Warren, along with two fellow Democratic senators, pressed for confirmation that Binance is adhering to the ongoing requirements stipulated in its plea agreement related to charges, including money laundering and violations of US sanctions laws. Related Reading: REX Shares Claims Its DOGE And XRP Spot ETFs Will Be Approved By US SEC Tomorrow The senators expressed their concerns over reports of meetings between Binance executives and Treasury Department officials, seeking clarity on the administration’s role in ensuring the exchange’s compliance with the settlement. Warren’s letter highlighted several specific inquiries. She requested information about the Department’s efforts to guarantee Binance’s compliance with its plea agreement, the status of the company’s anticipated exit from the US market, and any discussions regarding a potential pardon for Zhao. This follows the former CEO’s official request for a presidential pardon earlier this year, after rumors from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg suggested that CZ and Trump would be collaborating. The senators also sought details about conversations relating to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralised finance (DeFi) venture run by the president’s sons, and its plans to list a new stablecoin called USD1 on the Binance platform. Lawmakers Demand Clarity In a response from the Department of Justice on September 12, officials summarized Binance’s plea agreement and confirmed that the exchange had paid all penalties due. However, the senators asserted that the response failed to address their key questions, particularly regarding Binance’s compliance with ongoing requirements. The letter concluded as follows: These reports make it more important than ever that the public understand the Trump Administration’s interactions with, and relationship to, Binance and its employees. We therefore once again request meaningful answers to the questions above by no later than October 1, 2025. Related Reading: Coinbase Vs.

The shift was announced by the bank’s vice-chairman and former governor of Brazil’s central bank, Roberto Campos Neto. Addressing the Meridian 2025 event yesterday, he discussed blockchain’s role in linking digital assets and traditional banking. The local media quoted Campos Neto as saying Nubank would soon start testing stablecoin payments with its credit cards in what it sees as a broader attempt to connect digital assets into mainstream banking. The data reveals that people aren’t buying for transactions, they’re buying as a store of value,’ he was quoted as saying. “We need to get to the bottom of why this is happening. I think it’s shifting a little bit, but we have to be aware of it.” He also noted that the challenge for banks is finding a way to accept deposits in tokenized forms and use these assets to issue credit for clients. Nubank expands crypto services as stablecoin use surges across Latin America Founded in São Paulo in 2013, Nubank is a Brazilian digital bank serving over 100 million customers across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. The bank entered the digital asset space in 2022 by allocating 1% of its net assets to Bitcoin and rolling out crypto trading for its customers. In March 2025, Nubank broadened its crypto lineup by adding four altcoins, giving customers access to Cardano, Cosmos, Near Protocol, and Algorand. Stablecoin adoption is surging across Latin America. In Brazil, the president of the Central Bank revealed at a Bank for International Settlements event in February that 90% of crypto activity in the country is tied to stablecoins. Dollar-pegge d digital assets are also gaining traction in Argentina, where inflation has surpassed 100% in recent years. A March 2025 report from Bitso showed that USDT and USDC accounted for 50% and 22% of all cryptocurrency purchases in Argentina in 2024, respectively. Across Bitso’s platforms in the region, stablecoins represented 39% of all crypto purchases that year. Adoption is spreading to other countries as well. In July 2025, the Central Bank of Bolivia signed an agreement with El Salvador to promote crypto as a “viable and reliable alternative” to fiat. Since lifting its crypto ban in June 2024, Bolivian banks have been permitted to process Bitcoin and stablecoin transactions. In Venezuela, where inflation reached 229% in May, stablecoins such as USDT are increasingly replacing the bolívar in everyday transactions, from groceries to salaries. Chainalysis data indicates that stablecoins accounted for 47% of all crypto transactions under $10,000 in 2024. Nu Holdings sees profit soar 42% as Nubank shifts focus Nu Holdings, the parent company of Brazilian digital lender Nubank, reported a 42% year-on-year rise in net profit on a foreign exchange-neutral basis on Thursday, sending its shares up more than 8% in after-hours trading . The company, which has 123 million clients in Brazil — its core market — Colombia, and Mexico, made a second-quarter net profit of $637 million for the three months to June. Revenue was $3.7 billion, a 40% increase from the previous year. In an interview, the company’s chief financial officer, Guilherme Lago, said the profit increase resulted from operational leverage and top-line growth, but that factors underpinning that increase were beginning to shift. “If in the last three to five years a lot of our growth has come from adding new customers, in the next three to five years, much more of our revenue growth in Brazil will come from deepening the relationship with those customers,” Lago said. Nubank’s annualized return on equity, a measure of profitability, settled at 28%, compared to the year-earlier figure reported.

The case will test the limits of presidential power and could have major economic consequences. The tariffs, which are still in place, have served as the backbone of Trump’s trade and foreign policy decisions since he secured reelection in January. He enforced them by invoking emergency powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a statute enacted in 1977. Critics have said this was an abuse of authority, while the supporters believe it’s a bold defense of American jobs and security. Courts rule Trump went too far On August 29, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit struck a major blow to Donald Trump’s trade policy. The judges said that the president had overstepped his authority when he ordered the imposition of tariffs at a global level, using emergency powers under a statute known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The judges emphasized that IEEPA never intended to give presidents unlimited authority over tariffs. Rather, the law was written for limited use in national emergencies related to foreign threats. Previous presidents often deployed it to slap sanctions on or freeze the assets of unfriendly governments. None of them had used it to remake global trade, however. The court said that Trump went too far in using IEEPA to impose tariffs on various imports. The ruling underscored that Congress, not the president, possesses the constitutional power to regulate trade and lay duties. The decision came after months of legal wrangling after a coalition of 12 states, led by Democratic attorneys general from New York, Oregon, and Colorado, sued against the tariffs. They said the tariffs lifted consumer costs, wounded local businesses, and disrupted supply chains. Small businesses also scrambled into the fight, with a number saying their costs had risen with the imposition of the tariffs on imported materials and that they had less room for profit on sales. One of the biggest challengers is Learning Resources, a family-owned toy maker. The company said in court documents that the tariffs significantly increased production costs and jeopardized its survival in a competitive industry. The tariffs will stay in place while that legal process continues, even though the ruling went against the government. That means American importers will be paying higher duties for the time being. Consumers’ prices rise on various products – from household goods to electronics and toys. Supreme Court to weigh presidential power Now, the court will determine whether Trump’s use of IEEPA squares aligns with the law. The tariffs and the balance of power between Congress and the presidency are at stake. Lawmakers from both parties have urged the administration not to proceed with tariffs. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and Trump ally, told CNN that changing trade policy in ways that affect Americans is beyond a president’s authority. He said Congress should decide on tariffs, as it traditionally does. Trump argues, however, that national security and financial stability give the president wide powers to act. A ruling for Trump could greatly expand executive power in economic affairs . Future presidents might employ emergency laws to reshape trade without involving Congress. If the court comes down against him, it would restrict presidential power and force the U.S. government to refund hundreds of billions of dollars collected in tariffs. That could blow a hole in federal revenue and roil global markets. Trading partners, already unnerved by the prospect of tariffs, are watching closely. Economists say the uncertainty has contributed to market volatility and weakened investor confidence. Trump, for his part, has doubled down on his approach, saying tariffs are an important tool to shield U.S. industries, slash trade deficits, and pressure other countries like China, Mexico, and Canada to crack down on the flow of illegal drugs or unfair trading practices. Just recently, Scott Bessent said that Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are likely to pass Supreme Court scrutiny, but warned the Treasury may be forced to return hundreds of billions in tariff revenue if the court rules against the White House. Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press, the Treasury Secretary noted he was “confident” Trump’s trade moves would be upheld. Still, he admitted that “we would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” if the court strikes them down. “If the court says it, we’d have to do it,” he added.

Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner and head of policy at a16z crypto, was tapped by President Donald Trump in February to lead the derivatives regulator. His nomination was initially supported by a coalition of crypto industry groups , who argued he was “exceptionally well-suited” for the role given his experience with digital assets. But a series of delays in the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the agency, has left his confirmation in limbo. White House Vets New CFTC Chair Picks Amid Crypto Oversight Debate According to Bloomberg report, the White House is now weighing additional names, including officials with experience in crypto regulation and digital asset policy. Michael Selig, chief counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force and a former partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, has been floated as a contender. Tyler Williams, counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on digital assets and a former executive at Galaxy Digital, has also been discussed. Neither has commented publicly on the matter. BREAKING: White House seeks new crypto-focused candidates for CFTC chair after Quintez’s confirmation stalls. — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) September 18, 2025 The search reflects growing urgency as the CFTC prepares for a larger role in digital asset oversight. The agency traditionally regulates derivatives markets, but pending legislation in Congress could expand its authority over spot trading in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether. The CFTC already oversees trillions of dollars in swaps and futures trading, and its influence in crypto policy has grown under outgoing chair Rostin Behnam. Behnam, who stepped down in January , presided over the agency during some of its most aggressive actions in crypto enforcement, including the $4.3 billion settlement with Binance. He consistently argued that the CFTC is best positioned to regulate digital commodities and warned that large portions of the crypto market remain unregulated. His departure left the agency under Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who had signaled she plans to return to the private sector once a permanent leader is confirmed. The delay over Quintenz’s nomination escalated after reports surfaced that Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss privately urged Trump to reconsider his choice. In June, Politico reported the brothers had raised concerns that Quintenz would not fully back the president’s crypto agenda. Weeks later, the White House requested the Senate Agriculture Committee to pause a scheduled vote. Quintenz later suggested on social media that the president “might have been misled” by the twins, posting screenshots of private exchanges he claimed to have had with Tyler Winklevoss before his hearing was delayed. I’ve never been inclined to release private messages. But in light of my support for the President and belief that he might have been misled, I’ve posted here the messages that include the questions Tyler Winklevoss asked me pertaining to their prior litigation with the CFTC. I… pic.twitter.com/MN75M1XUpT — Brian Quintenz (@BrianQuintenz) September 10, 2025 The situation has been complicated by allegations involving Kalshi, a prediction market platform facing scrutiny over its operations, which further fueled calls for caution around Quintenz’s nomination. Officials close to the process say the White House has not officially withdrawn his name, but the administration is actively vetting alternatives. With only two sitting commissioners currently on the five-member panel, the CFTC is operating with limited capacity. Industry advocates warn that further delays in filling the chair could hinder progress on crypto regulation, even as demand for oversight grows. For now, the White House has declined to comment, leaving the future of the CFTC’s leadership uncertain. CFTC Opens Door to Spot Bitcoin and Ether Trading Despite Leadership Vacuum As the White House reconsiders its stalled nomination of Brian Quintenz to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator itself is pressing ahead with a flurry of new crypto initiatives. In August, Acting Chair Caroline Pham unveiled a plan to permit spot cryptocurrency trading on exchanges already registered with the CFTC. CFTC plans to allow spot crypto trading on regulated futures exchanges, advancing efforts to implement US digital asset policy. #CFTC #SpotCrypto https://t.co/g0mdpetrnJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 The move, described as the first step in the agency’s “crypto sprint,” would allow Designated Contract Markets that currently trade futures to also list spot products such as Bitcoin and Ether. The initiative comes as Congress weighs the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, which could formally expand the CFTC’s authority over digital assets. To prepare, the agency has upgraded its market surveillance tools, adopting Nasdaq’s monitoring platform to detect manipulation and fraud in both derivatives and crypto markets. Coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission is also accelerating. In early September, the two agencies released a joint statement confirming that registered exchanges may facilitate spot crypto trading . A revised draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act further calls for a joint advisory committee on digital assets, with explicit protections for developers and decentralized finance participants. With the CFTC advancing reforms under temporary leadership, the search for a permanent chair has become more pressing, leaving the White House under pressure to resolve its stalled nomination process.

The rapid influx of investor demand highlights Pepesnix as one of the fastest-growing crypto presales of 2025, with momentum showing no signs of slowing. A Milestone That Signals Investor Confidence The presale launched just days ago and has already attracted thousands of investors worldwide. Surpassing the half-million mark this quickly places Pepesnix in the same league as early-stage successes like Shiba Inu and Pepe — projects that went on to generate multi-billion-dollar market caps. Key presale highlights so far: $500,000 raised within days of launch Rapidly growing investor base across North America, Europe, and Asia Strong community expansion with thousands joining Telegram and Twitter channels daily Presale stages selling out faster than projected Crypto analysts suggest that Pepesnix’s strong debut signals not just short-term hype, but the foundation of a project capable of sustaining growth through listings and beyond. The Meme Coin to Watch in 2025 Pepesnix is gaining traction thanks to its fair launch mechanics, viral meme branding, and sustainable tokenomics designed for long-term growth. With allocations for liquidity, marketing, and staking, $PEPEX is structured for both immediate excitement and lasting value. “This milestone proves that investors see Pepesnix as more than another meme coin,” said a spokesperson for the project. “Surpassing $500,000 so quickly demonstrates strong confidence in our vision and confirms Pepesnix’s place as one of the most exciting presales of 2025.” Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, Pepesnix is built to balance community energy with structural safeguards like anti-whale and anti-bot protections, giving everyday investors a fair chance to participate. A Perfect Market Moment The milestone comes at a time when crypto presales are heating up in 2025. With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the market into a bullish phase, meme coins have historically been the next sector to rally. Pepesnix is launching at the perfect moment to capitalize on this momentum, drawing parallels to Dogecoin’s rise in 2021 and Shiba Inu’s run in 2022. As market sentiment turns increasingly positive, Pepesnix’s viral branding and growing community could position it as one of the breakout stars of the cycle. How to Join Before the Next Milestone Investors eager to get in before the next stage price increase can still participate in the presale by visiting the official website: https://pepesnix.com/ . Steps to join: Connect a Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Select a payment option (ETH, USDT, USDC, or SOL if supported). Complete your purchase before the current stage sells out. The earlier investors secure their tokens, the more favorable their entry price will be. About Pepesnix Pepesnix ($PEPEX) is a meme coin project that combines viral internet culture with sustainable blockchain tokenomics.

The South Korean custodian BDACS recently launched KRW1, the country’s first Korean won–backed stablecoin, fully collateralized with deposits at Woori Bank. The stablecoin is in its pilot phase after a successful proof of concept, putting Avalanche at the forefront of Korea’s digital asset integration. Similarly, in Japan, Avalanche is collaborating with industry giants such as SMBC, one of the nation’s largest banks, and retail groups like Densan to develop stablecoin-powered payment systems. AVAX Network Activity and DeFi Boom The expansion of stablecoin utilities coincides with a surge in network activity on Avalanche. In August alone, decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surpassed $12 billion, marking an eightfold increase in just two months. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on Avalanche has also exceeded $450 million, with institutions like Grove Finance and SkyBridge driving adoption. DeFi protocols such as UNI, Pharaoh, Benqi, and LFJ are thriving, pushing Avalanche’s total value locked (TVL) above $2 billion. UNI, for example, has posted a 97% gain in the past month, reflecting growing user activity and liquidity across the network. Avalanche Price Targets $42 as Institutional Interest Grows Currently, AVAX is trading near $33, up over 9.4% in the past 24 hours. The token recently broke above a key pivot at $31.05, supported by bullish technical indicators including an RSI of 68.44 and a positive MACD histogram. Analysts suggest that a decisive breakout above $34.50 could propel AVAX toward its next resistance at $42. Institutional adoption is also on the horizon. With four AVAX ETF filings awaiting regulatory approval, inflows from traditional finance could act as a major catalyst for price growth. Combined with Asia’s growing stablecoin market and Avalanche’s thriving DeFi ecosystem, AVAX aims to become a leading Layer-1 blockchain prepared to challenge rivals in the next crypto bull cycle.

However, recent data from Binance shows that BTC’s current price action is largely supported by retail investors, while whales have been noticeably absent. Bitcoin Holds $117,500 Amid High Retail Inflows According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Bitcoin is hovering around the $117,500 price level, supported by active inflows from retail investors. Notably, large whale inflows have been completely absent, indicating that the current market is being driven by individuals more than by large wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Shift Strategy: Accumulation Over Selling Signals Stronger Bull Cycle Inflows ranging from 0 to 0.001 BTC recorded approximately 97,000 BTC. Similarly, inflows from the 0.001 to 0.01 BTC segment totaled nearly 719,000 BTC. The distribution above suggests that Bitcoin’s current rally is largely driven by retail investors. These investors conduct numerous but small-volume transactions, confirming that individual investors are shaping the market dynamics. Arab Chain added: The figures reveal that the bulk of inflows are concentrated in small and medium-sized transactions, reflecting the dominance of retail activity in Bitcoin trading. This liquidity, despite its limited scale, has helped keep the market balanced at current levels. It is worth emphasizing that there has been almost no whale pressure during the current market rally. Specifically, no significant surges in inflows of more than 100 BTC were observed, mitigating the likelihood of a sharp short-term price correction. To conclude, the current market situation shows that Bitcoin is experiencing a state of equilibrium, largely due to heightened retail investor participation. Such a scenario gives the market an opportunity to steadily surge toward the important $120,000 resistance level. That said, it would be wise to keep an eye on any whale activity, as it could quickly alter the market’s direction. Any sudden entry of whale inflows could trigger a rapid price correction, similar to previous market tops. Experts Divided On BTC Price Action As Bitcoin trades about 5.4% below its all-time high (ATH), there are signs that the top cryptocurrency by market cap may be on the cusp of a fresh rally. For instance, BTC recently broke above the mid-term holder breakeven, reducing the likelihood of an immediate sell-off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Faces Supply Squeeze As Scarcity Index Turns Positive Again Recent positive developments – such as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) reducing interest rates by 25 basis points – could reinvigorate the crypto market. Against that backdrop, crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes recently reiterated his ambitious $1 million BTC prediction. That said, gold bug Peter Schiff opines that BTC has likely already peaked for this market cycle. At press time, BTC trades at $117,523, up 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

The post frames XRP as a tool to handle trillions of dollars sitting idle in nostro and vostro accounts globally, showing the scale of the issue the asset aims to solve. Utility Over Hype In the video, Garlinghouse stresses that the long-term value of any digital asset must stem from its usefulness rather than speculation. He notes that investors and industry participants should ask what problem a token solves, how large that problem is, and how many customers it serves. “There’s no question there’s a lot of hype in this system, and I don’t actually think that’s a good thing,” he says, highlighting Ripple’s approach as grounded in solving tangible financial challenges . #XRP is solving a global payments problem Trillions of dollars are parked in nostro / vostro accounts globally pic.twitter.com/z8nc77plct — XRP_Cro AI / Gaming / DePIN (@stedas) September 16, 2025 XRP’s Use Case Garlinghouse explains that Ripple uses XRP specifically to settle liquidity needs between banks . According to him, about $27 trillion is currently parked at financial institutions around the world so they can facilitate payments with one another. He argued that a digital asset like XRP can handle this process in real time, eliminating the need for such large reserves and revolutionizing this massive cross-border payment market . “Because XRP has been so efficient, it settles a transaction in about three seconds compared to Bitcoin in one hour,” Garlinghouse added. He clarified that XRP “just passes through that currency for that period of time,” highlighting its role as a bridge asset rather than a long-term holding. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential for Growth Garlinghouse’s comments reinforce Ripple’s positioning of XRP as a functional solution rather than a speculative asset. By focusing on liquidity for banks, XRP directly targets a massive existing problem in the global financial system. If banks and financial institutions continue to adopt the technology, XRP’s utility could increase significantly. The emphasis on speed and cost efficiency also aligns with the industry’s push toward instant cross-border settlements, making XRP attractive to institutions looking to modernize their operations. A Utility-Driven Future for Digital Assets The video highlights how Ripple sees its digital asset as more than just a store of value. XRP is an enabling technology that solves problems, and Garlinghouse’s statements indicate confidence that efficiency and utility will drive adoption, especially when dealing with trillions of dollars in global transfers.
