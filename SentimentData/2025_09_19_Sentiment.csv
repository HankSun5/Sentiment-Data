Mutuum Finance is worth $0.035 in stage 6 of its presale. The protocol has over $15.9 million raised in funds and more than 16,370 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been pegged as a millionaire-maker token by analysts tracking the next-generation blockchain technology. Whereas Pepe Coin (PEPE) is predicted to establish ambitious price targets of $0.0001 by 2026, market experts argue that Mutuum’s combination of usability, scalability, and long-term value creation places it light-years ahead of hype-driven rivals. Smart money with a longer-term focus that wants more out of their investments than fleeting momentum is now on Mutuum Finance. PEPE Coin Stalls Even With Promising Plans PEPE is currently priced at $0.00001086, with its action in a tight range and showing little upward momentum compared to earlier stages with high community demand. Its enormous supply and meme-driven nature make sudden rallies dependent more on sentiment than protocol progress fundamentals. Resistance remains just above levels, while support zones remain in place not far below, so that a sturdy breakout would require new volume and catalyst events. Though PEPE has been modeled by some pundits with bullish price estimates, the majority of investors now eye its growth potential relative to emerging Mutuum Finance which is judged to have superior structural supports and higher upside potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 Mutuum Finance has already reached stage six of its presale at $0.035 following a 16.17% boost from the previous stage. The market is witnessing all-time demand for the project where it has already reached more than 16,370 investors and surpassed $15.9 million. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduced a Bug Bounty Program of $50,000 USDT for the security of the platform. The bugs have been divided into four levels depending on the tag critical, major, minor, and low. Collateralization of Mutuum Finance is asset-cap based and is differentiated based on the risk type an asset would bear. It encompasses supply capping, collateral and borrowing capping. The protocol hedges the market risk through overcollateralizing positions. The liquidators are also incentivized when unwinding the undercollateralized trades and thus risky positions are closed in real time. Risk tokens do not have much collateral usage but the most correlated tokens are used to their full extent so that they can build up their collateral. They are all focused on insolvency risk reduction in a way that no type of imbalance is incurred between borrowing and lending in the protocol. User Community and Growth Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to create an engaged user base with a $100,000 giveaway . Ten users will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens, paying them for contributing to the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly become one of the top cryptos to watch in 2025, supported by a strong DeFi focus. Pepe Coin on the other hand is heavily influenced by investor sentiment. Mutuum Finance has seen strong interest in its presale where more than 16,370 investors have raised over $15.9 million. The protocol is rewarding its growing community with a $50,000 bug bounty as well as a $100,000 token giveaway. With its emphasis on scalability, security, and environmentally friendly growth, MUTM provides much more than hype cycles. Lock up your tokens now in Stage 6 before the next price rise.

51945500,584509,1758232832,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"SEC Greenlights New ETF Standards, Opening Door for Altcoin ETFs",https://bitcoinist.com/sec-greenlights-etf-opening-door-for-altcoin-etfs/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved new generic listing standards for spot crypto and altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a landmark shift in digital asset regulation. Previously, every crypto ETF required lengthy case-by-case approval under Section 19b-4—a process that could drag on for months. With this new framework, ETFs meeting specific conditions can now be listed directly on major exchanges like Nasdaq, Cboe, and NYSE without waiting for individual sign-offs. This decision is expected to accelerate the arrival of altcoin ETFs in the U.S., broadening investment access beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts say the streamlined system represents the clearest path yet toward regulated, diversified crypto exposure. Grayscale Leads With First Multi-Crypto ETF Grayscale secured a first-mover advantage as its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) was approved under the new standards. The fund includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, making it the first diversified multi-crypto ETF in the U.S. “Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund $GDLC was just approved for trading… with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano,” Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg confirmed. ETF analysts noted this milestone signals a shift toward broader portfolio products rather than single-asset ETFs. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas estimated that 12–15 cryptos could soon qualify under the SEC’s framework, provided they have established regulated futures trading for at least six months. Altcoin ETFs Considered Imminent Beyond the majors, other altcoins are lining up for potential ETFs. Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Chainlink (LINK) already meet the key requirement of regulated futures trading on Coinbase Derivatives. Solana, for instance, became eligible on August 19, six months after its futures launch. The Chainlink community has also expressed optimism, with both Bitwise and Grayscale filing LINK ETF applications. Meanwhile, the Litecoin Foundation has welcomed the decision, seeing it as a pathway for LTC listings in U.S. markets. Even Hedera (HBAR) is gaining attention, with investors speculating on its ETF prospects. Industry watchers describe the SEC’s move as a turning point for crypto, one that reduces regulatory friction and boosts market confidence. As ETF analyst James Seyffart put it, “We’re gonna be off to the races in a matter of weeks.” With the SEC’s greenlight, the question is no longer if altcoin ETFs will launch, but which will debut first.

Analyst Eye 111% DOGE Breakout Despite Heavy Selling,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/massive-dogecoin-upside-analyst-eye-111-doge-breakout-despite-heavy-selling/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged 13% this week, climbing to $0.282, despite heavy selling pressure from investors. Over $1.63 billion worth of DOGE, nearly 5.81 billion tokens, have been moved to exchanges in September, signaling profit-taking and caution among traders. Related Reading: From $2 Trillion To $400T? CEO Sees Bitcoin Exploding 200x – Here’s More Long-term holders, who had previously offered stability, are also shifting assets according to the coin days destroyed (CDD) metric, often a sign of potential downside risk. However, the bullish rally remains strong, mainly driven by optimism about a possible spot Dogecoin ETF launch. This regulatory milestone, along with increasing corporate treasury use and payment integrations, has kept DOGE on the minds of institutional investors. Technical Setup Points to Potential DOGE Breakout Despite mixed short-term signals, technical analysts remain bullish. The Ichimoku Cloud setup shows all four major indicators aligned in favor of buyers, giving DOGE a “perfect +4” bullish score. Support levels sit near $0.255, with resistance forming at $0.287. A decisive break above could push DOGE toward $0.300 and beyond. Trader Tardigrade highlighted that Dogecoin’s consolidation pattern is steadily building momentum. Each resistance test has been met with higher lows, suggesting waning selling pressure. “Eventually, DOGE will break this resistance and reach new all-time highs,” he noted. Meanwhile, analyst Javon Marks set a breakout target of $0.6533, implying a 111% upside from current levels. CoinCodex forecasts also predict DOGE will trade at $0.32 by mid-October, reflecting continued bullish sentiment. DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Dogecoin ETF Hype and Market Outlook The U.S. SEC’s recent approval of listing standards for spot Dogecoin ETFs has further strengthened the bullish case. The launch of DOJE, backed by REX Shares and Osprey Funds, marks a milestone for meme coin adoption in regulated markets. Corporate participation, such as CleanCore Solutions’ Dogecoin treasury initiative, adds additional credibility and institutional demand. However, risks remain. If DOGE fails to hold above the critical $0.273 support level, analysts warn of a possible correction toward $0.241. Momentum indicators also show overbought conditions, hinting at potential short-term consolidation before any major breakout.

Trump had just wrapped up his second formal state visit, but this wasn’t about dinners and speeches. At Chequers, both men sat down with their delegations from the U.S. and U.K. to hash out trade, tech, and global security issues. The main issue on the table was updating the May 2025 U.S.-U.K. economic prosperity deal, which both sides now want to tweak. The U.K. specifically wants the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum gone. Trump seemed open to it earlier in the week when speaking on Air Force One. “They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,” he said. “We’ve made a deal, and it’s a great deal, and I’m into helping them. They’d like to see if they could get a little bit better deal. So, we’ll talk to them.” Trump discusses Putin, war in Ukraine, and a possible ceasefire While talks focused on trade, Trump and Starmer also addressed the Ukraine war. At a press conference at Chequers, Trump said, “The Russia situation, I hope we’re going to have some good news for you coming up.” He added, “Millions of people have died in that war, millions of souls… They’re being killed, and I feel I have an obligation to get it settled for that reason.” Trump then turned the heat on Vladimir Putin, saying, “He’s let me down. He’s really let me down.” This came as a surprise, considering Trump had repeatedly claimed during his 2024 campaign that he could end the war in a single day. He admitted on Thursday that ending the conflict has been harder than expected. “I’m very honored to tell you that we’ve solved seven wars, seven wars, wars that were unsolvable, wars that couldn’t be negotiated or done,” he said. “The one that I thought would be easiest would be because of my relationship with President Putin, but he’s let me down.” USA Today later checked that “seven wars” comment and found five confirmed ceasefires or agreements, while also pointing out that not everyone credited the White House for them. UK announces $204B in foreign investment as talks continue During the visit, the U.K. government announced £150 billion ($204 billion) in foreign investment. The deals span across AI, civil nuclear, financial services, and energy. The announcements dropped while Trump and Starmer were still in talks at Chequers. Duncan Edwards, head of BritishAmerican Business, called it a big moment for the U.K. “From a U.K. government perspective, they couldn’t really have asked for a better slew of announcements coming over the last three days with the civil nuclear, financial services, and all the AI announcements,” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.” But Edwards warned that words aren’t cash. “Promised dollars” weren’t the same as “actual dollars,” he said, adding that it’s still unclear if the investment will actually show up. The two leaders met after a formal state dinner the night before at Windsor Castle, where Trump addressed British and American officials, business leaders, and royals. He called the visit “one of the highest honors of my life” and joked he hoped he’d be the only president to ever get two state visits. King Charles returned the favor by complimenting Trump’s “personal commitment to finding solutions to some of the world’s most intractable conflicts.” Get seen where it counts.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bhutan-government-makes-remarkable-bitcoin-transfer-hundreds-of-bitcoins-moved-to-a-new-wallet-here-are-the-details/,"The government of the Kingdom of Bhutan has made a notable move regarding its cryptocurrency holdings. According to on-chain data published by Onchain Lens, the government transferred a total of 343.1 Bitcoin (approximately $40.18 million) to a new digital wallet. Bhutan Government Moves 343 Bitcoins to New Wallet, Expectations for Transfer to CEX Experts say that this transaction may have been made for the purpose of depositing funds into centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX), similar to past examples. It is known that the Bhutanese government has previously directed Bitcoin transfers of similar size to CEX platforms and used these funds within the scope of various financial strategies. Although Bhutan has traditionally had a closed economy, it has been making notable strides in the field of digital assets and blockchain technology in recent years. The country, which has invested in crypto mining, particularly using its hydroelectric resources, is one of the rare governments that holds Bitcoin in its state-backed strategic reserves. Market analysts believe the transfer points to two possible purposes: first, creating liquidity through the sale of funds; second, preparing for new commercial or investment moves through centralized exchanges. This development is being closely watched in crypto markets, as large-scale government wallet movements can lead to short-term fluctuations, particularly in Bitcoin's price. The Bhutanese government hasn't officially announced anything, adding to the uncertainty surrounding how the funds will ultimately be disbursed. However, industry experts believe the move indicates the country will continue to take a more active role in cryptocurrency policies. *This is not investment advice.

This potential move is supported by a string of major catalysts – the Federal Reserve’s rate cut yesterday, today’s launch of the first spot XRP ETF, and a clear uptick in institutional interest. If XRP successfully retests the $3.65 zone from above and holds it as support, momentum could accelerate toward the $10 mark. At $10, XRP’s market cap would soar to around $597 billion, putting it on par with Ethereum’s current valuation and cementing its place as one of the top assets in the crypto market.

Market conditions could be setting the stage for this move. Just last week, Bitcoin recorded a fresh all-time high at $124,128, surpassing its prior $122,838 peak from only a month earlier. However, momentum cooled after July’s hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data triggered a market pullback. At the same time, regulators are stepping up. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first complete legislation covering stablecoins, mandating full reserve backing. Shortly afterward, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, an initiative designed to modernize securities laws and provide clearer guidance for digital asset firms. With regulations advancing and optimism building, many analysts believe the next rally in altcoins and meme tokens could rival, or even exceed, the euphoric surge of 2021. If Gemini’s projections play out, XRP, Pepe, and Solana may lead the charge. XRP (Ripple): Gemini Predicts a 60% Jump Toward $5 by Year-End Gemini suggests Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $5 by late 2025, representing a more than fivefold increase from its current price of $3.00. The token has already displayed resilience. On July 18, XRP spiked to $3.65, topping its 2018 record of $3.40, before retracing about 15% amid broader macroeconomic headwinds. Globally, Ripple continues to expand its cross-border payments network. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund highlighted XRP as an affordable remittance tool for emerging economies. Earlier this year, Ripple’s drawn-out battle with the SEC officially came to an end when the agency dropped its case, following a 2023 court ruling confirming that retail XRP sales were not securities. The decision removed a major cloud of uncertainty for Ripple and other altcoins. Should XRP retest recent highs and sustain momentum, Gemini sees $5 although many analysts are claiming significantly higher valuations like $10 or $20. Technical indicators support a positive outlook. XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 59, suggesting buying momentum is picking up. The Fed’s decision to cut interest rates, along with today’s launch of the first spot XRP ETF , are likely price drivers. Over the last 12 months, XRP has soared 440%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 95% and Ethereum’s 98% during the same period. Pepe ($PEPE): Gemini Predicts a 5× Run for the Top Non-Dog Meme Coin Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has quickly grown into one of the three largest meme coins by market cap, now valued at around $4.75 billion, the biggest non-dog-themed meme token. Despite stiff competition, Pepe thrives on its deep liquidity and dedicated community. Elon Musk has even playfully referenced Pepe on X, sparking speculation that he may own it alongside Dogecoin. Currently priced at $0.0000113, Pepe has risen 4% overnight in step with an 4% rise across the now $90.8 billion meme coin sector. Furthermore the token gained 7% over the past week, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Shiba Inu. A decisive breakout above resistance in the $0.000018–$0.000022 zone could set the stage for a move to $0.00003 by mid-fall. In a favorable market, Gemini predicts Pepe could reach $0.00005, a fivefold increase from current levels. From a technical perspective, a descending wedge pattern forming between November and March suggests a bullish setup. With regulatory conditions improving, Pepe could be preparing for another strong rally. Solana (SOL): ETF Speculation and Ecosystem Growth Could Drive 4× Gains by December Solana ($SOL) continues to cement its position in the smart contract arena, with a market capitalization above $133.6 billion and total value locked (TVL) around $12.74 billion . Developer activity and institutional interest continue to climb. Some of the enthusiasm stems from speculation around a potential U.S.-listed Solana spot ETF, which could mimic the inflows seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were introduced. Adding fuel to the narrative, President Trump earlier this year floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. national Bitcoin reserve. However, under his plan, Solana would only be held if obtained from government seizures rather than purchased directly on the open market. Price performance has also improved. After peaking at $250 in January, sliding to $100 in April, and rebounding to $247, Solana is almost at its highest point over the year to date (YTD). This breakout from a descending wedge pattern has Gemini projecting that a rally toward $1,000 by year’s end is feasible, more than tripling its previous record of $293.31. Achieving such a milestone, however, may depend on the SEC implementing broader crypto regulatory clarity in the coming months. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Risk Alternative to Dogecoin For investors seeking opportunities outside Gemini’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) offers a speculative meme coin option, branding itself as Dogecoin’s edgier cousin. While Dogecoin has matured into a multibillion-dollar asset that often tracks Bitcoin and Ethereum, its wild volatility from 2021 has moderated.

The digital asset industry, collectively capitalizing $4.2 trillion, has seen limited expansion over recent months due to inflation fears and geopolitical headwinds, though Bitcoin did set a fresh record high at $124,128 just last month. The crypto market also rose 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Aside from Bitcoin, substantial capital continues flowing into both established altcoins and the best meme coins. Over the past year, many projects have set new price milestones, reflecting increasing investor enthusiasm across the sector. Fueling this optimism are two key policy shifts from Washington. First, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, the United States’ first broad regulatory framework governing stablecoins. Second, the SEC launched Project Crypto, a new initiative to modernize and clarify securities laws as they apply to digital assets. With sentiment improving, it’s worth examining how leading altcoins such as XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin are positioning for potential upside. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Leader is Arguably the Best Crypto Altcoin in 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) reached a record $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act was signed into law, beating its previous 2018 peak of $3.40. Since then, it has eased back to about $3.12, a 15% drop from that high. XRP’s appeal lies in its rapid, cost-effective global transfers, offering an alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. Its credibility is further reinforced by recognition from organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and even acknowledgment from the White House. Earlier this year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a high-level presidential roundtable on crypto policy, cementing the company’s influence in shaping the industry. The token gained fresh momentum in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that retail sales of XRP did not breach securities laws, effectively resolving its long-standing dispute with the SEC. Over the last twelve months, XRP has climbed 440%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 95% gain. A mid-July surge has kept the coin anchored near the $3 mark, a level that has proven resilient despite wider market swings. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) sits near 59, and uptrading, signaling cautious increased inflows following the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates and the launch of the first spot ETF today. Looking ahead, the SEC is expected to rule on more potential spot XRP ETFs in mid-October. A positive decision could push XRP to $4 or higher within the same month. Cardano ($ADA): The Sustainable Ethereum Competitor Eyeing a 2026 Growth Cycle Cardano ($ADA) has consistently ranked among the top altcoins, and 2025 is no exception. Over the past year, ADA surged 175%, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano operates as a smart contract platform focused on sustainability through its Proof-of-Stake consensus and rigorous peer-reviewed research,an approach that even influenced Ethereum’s own development path. With a market cap of $33.5 billion, ADA would need to triple in value to rival Solana and begin challenging Ethereum’s dominance. Currently trading at around $0.9184, ADA posted a 5% overnight gain, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum’s respective 3% and 3.6% increases. Favorable political and macroeconomic developments could propel ADA toward $1.50 by fall, and potentially back to its $3.09 all-time high before year-end, a 240% jump from current levels. Technically, ADA formed a bullish flag between December and March, pointing to further upside potential. Like XRP, its RSI is trending up from 59, signaling market wide appetite for crypto is building. Key resistance sits at $1.15, with strong support in the $0.85–$0.90 zone. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Can the First Meme Coin Finally Break $1? Launched in 2013 as a parody, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has grown into the most recognized meme coin, boasting a $42.4 billion market cap and a passionate fan base supported by high-profile figures. The token’s breakout moment came in 2021 when endorsements from Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons pushed it into mainstream awareness. This May, institutional investors renewed interest, lifting DOGE back into the $0.25 range amid speculation about possible spot Dogecoin ETFs in the U.S. The coin now trades at $0.281, marking a 5.4% overnight gain, a 13% weekly gain and outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Shiba Inu over the same stretch. While DOGE’s technical indicators remain bullish, its RSI is pretty high at 67, which could point to a sell-off over the weekend as traders reap the rewards of its rapid recent price appreciation. Market-wide momentum and supportive policy headlines could enable further growth, so DOGE could still climb toward $0.50 by mid-October. Adoption is also expanding: Tesla accepts DOGE for purchases, while PayPal and Revolut continue adding support, further strengthening its real-world use cases. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The First Bitcoin Layer 2 and One of 2025’s Most Promising Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is among 2025’s most hyped presale projects, aiming to become Bitcoin’s first Layer 2 that combines viral meme appeal with scalability and community-driven development. Its vision is to enhance Bitcoin with faster transactions, added functionality, and grassroots governance. The presale has already attracted more than $16.6 million, with analysts projecting potential post-launch gains of 10× or more. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER supports ultra-fast smart contracts for Bitcoin while keeping fees low. A standout feature is its Canonical Bridge, which enables near-instant BTC transfers on its Layer 2 while powering dApps, meme tokens, and payments with minimal transaction costs. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed no security flaws, further boosting investor confidence. $HYPER serves multiple functions, including staking, transaction fees, and governance. Early presale participants can earn up to 69% APY through staking while also gaining voting rights on ecosystem upgrades after launch.

These three tokens have outperformed the market average today, with the Fed’s rate cut boosting investor appetite for risk-on assets such as cryptos. But what makes this period particularly bullish is that we may begin to see a flood of ETF approvals from the SEC, including for XRP and other major altcoins. This is likely to drive the prices of XRP, BNB and SHIB upwards in the coming weeks, with all three tokens potentially hitting new record highs. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – New DBS and Franklin Partnership Will Push Altcoin Price to New ATH Soon XRP has bounced to $3.12 today, making for a 4% increase in the past 24 hours and a 10% rise in the past fortnight. The coin has also risen by 4% in a month, and what’s encouraging about this is that it’s a sign that XRP is still some way from being overbought (and needing to correct). Indeed the XRP price could perform very strongly in the coming weeks, and not just because of yesterday’s rate cut. Introducing the next building block of onchain markets – we’re partnering with @DBSbank and @FTI_Global to establish repo markets powered by tokenized collateral and stablecoins: https://t.co/vFTL32XO8C Investors will be able to use $RLUSD to trade for Franklin Templeton’s money… — Ripple (@Ripple) September 18, 2025 It’s also benefiting from Ripple’s accelerated growth as a company, with the firm announcing a new tokenization partnership with DBS and Franklin Templeton today. This comes in addition to recent partnerships with BBVA, the $200 million acquisition of Rails, and the company’s expansion into Africa and Dubai. Now is therefore a very bullish time for XRP, which is waiting for the SEC to decide on applications for over 10 XRP ETFs. Source: TradingView It’s in this hugely bullish context that the coin’s chart shows signs of ongoing price rises, with its indicators still moving up from previously oversold positions. The crypto price prediction for XRP is therefore very positive, with the coin set to hit $3.50 by the end of the month, and pass $5 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Binance Coin ($BNB) – Exchange Token Setting New Record Highs Amid High Binance Volumes BNB set a record high of $1,004 only a few hours ago, and at $991, it has posted a 3.5% gain in 24 hours and a 17% increase in the past month. These moves have pushed BNB up to 5th in the market in terms of capitalization, while it’s also up by 84% in the last 12 months. Its chart is unsurprisingly showing some real momentum right now, yet there’s a danger that it may be close to peaking, implying a correction. Source: TradingView However, while its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have entered overbought positions, the wider market’s overall trajectory may help it to continue climbing in the coming weeks. If the SEC does approve the vast majority of outstanding ETF applications (and it approved a multi-crypto ETF yesterday ), then this could send demand even higher, pushing the BNB price with it. An expanding cryptocurrency market will boost Binance’s position as crypto’s biggest exchange , which in turn will increase demand for BNB. As such, we could see the altcoin reach $1,600 by the of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: SHIB Price Builds Bullish Momentum – Major Breakout Now Imminent At $0.00001334, SHIB has gained by 2.5% in the past 24 hours and 9% in the past fortnight, with the meme token also up by 6% in the past month. But if we look at its chart today, we see that there’s still lots of scope for further increases in the coming days and weeks. For instance, its MACD has only recently risen into a positive position, above the baseline, having spent most of August and a little of September at a negative level. We see a similar pattern with SHIB’s relative strength index, which has risen above 50 in recent days, but which is still far from enter overbought territory. Source: TradingView Now is therefore still a good time to buy SHIB, which remains down by 84.5% in relation to its ATH of $0.00008616, implying that it could rise quickly in Q4. Longer term, SHIB also benefits from the fact that Shiba Inu is one of the fundamentally stronger meme tokens, benefitting from a growing ecosystem of platforms, protocols and dapps. Its has its own DEX (ShibaSwap), its own layer-two network (Shibarium), while it has also seen the launch of numerous games in recent months. Given this foundation, the crypto price prediction for SHIB remains very positive, and the meme token could reach $0.00020 by the middle of October, before ending the year above $0.000060. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Innovative New Meme Token Raises $1.25 Million in Presale Traders looking to diversify into newer, smaller-cap tokens may also be interested in some of the presale coins currently available, with some of these showing promise. One interesting example of this is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that boasts a gamified staking system. Ready.. Aim.. MINE! https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/X8843bod4f — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 18, 2025 It opened its ICO only a few weeks ago, but has already raised $1.25 million, a sign of its future potential. PEPENODE is the market’s first mine-to-earn token, with its staking system inviting users to build and grow a virtual mining rig. By spending PEPENODE to add more nodes to their rig, users can earn greater staking rewards, as well as rewards in other meme coins (such as Pepe and Fartcoin). This is an interesting mechanic, and it’s one that could see the PEPENODE price rise steadily over time, as miners accumulate more of the token. Investors can join the coin’s presale at the PEPENODE website , where it’s currently available at $0.0010617. This price will rise later today, and will continue to rise for as long as the sale lasts, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later.

Data indicate that over $3 billion in net inflows were contributed to the large wallets, and this is one of the highest accumulation waves in 2025. This trend indicates a belief in Bitcoin’s strength, despite ongoing controversy on whether the market is at its peak. Additionally, whale activity has long been used as a solid indicator of the market direction. Their surge in August indicates high belief, and analysts predict it may provide the platform for strong gains in Q4. However, with the power of Bitcoin, whales are diversifying as well. A good number is already starting to purchase early slots in a new entrant, MAGACOIN FINANCE, with a credible security and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation in August According to on-chain metrics, whales transferred coins out of exchanges in large amounts last month. This activity has increased net inflows to record highs since the start of the year of up to $3 billion. According to analysts, this kind of movement is a precursor to rallies, as the whales gather ahead of others in the wider crypto market. Support at close to $114,000 has been strong, and whales have made a point of boosting the demand anytime the price dipped. These moves underscore a long-term conviction that Bitcoin is the foundation of the crypto market. The Role of Whale Behavior More so, whale wallets tend to be the most accurate indicator of wider market sentiment. History continues to dictate that when there is high purchasing of whales, the market will experience surges. Their August activity reflected previous stages when Bitcoin rallies started slowly and then soared upwards. To smaller investors, these actions are educational. Although the involvement of retailers is divided, whale conviction indicates bullish sentiment. According to analysts, this accumulation is an indicator that whales believe that Bitcoin will keep rising. Whales Diversify Into Meme Coins In spite of being committed to Bitcoin, the whales are also trying new avenues in search of better returns. The latest trends demonstrate that big investors are offloading into meme coins in search of higher returns than the less volatile Bitcoin growth. The strategy is simple: Bitcoin gives security in the long term, whereas meme coins can guarantee high-ROI investments in bullish cycles. This diversification is an indication of a mature approach. Whales no longer feel content with possessing just Bitcoin. They are diversifying their portfolios with speculative investments, which may increase their returns. Whale-Backed Meme Coin for ROI MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the meme coin of choice for Bitcoin whales, diversifying after a record August. Whales added over $3 billion in BTC last month, but their latest moves show a shift toward meme coins with explosive upside potential. These large investors are securing early allocations in MAGACOIN FINANCE, aiming to balance portfolios between high-growth opportunities and long-term security. Bitcoin remains the foundation of whale holdings, but MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the chance for outsized returns during meme season. The strategy reflects a balanced approach: Bitcoin for stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE for ROI potential. Analysts say this dual-track positioning could define the next phase of whale investment in 2025. Conclusion Bitcoin whales dominated August by adding over $3 billion to their wallets, reinforcing faith in the asset’s resilience. Their conviction points to continued strength heading into Q4. Simultaneously, diversification is shaping whale portfolios. By adding MAGACOIN FINANCE alongside Bitcoin, whales are blending long-term stability with the potential for explosive ROI. Analysts believe this dual approach will define the months ahead, making MAGACOIN FINANCE an altcoin to watch closely.

PEPE Is Approaching The End Of A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a TA pattern forming in the 1-day price of Pepe. The pattern in question is a “Symmetrical Triangle,” which forms when an asset observes consolidation between two trendlines approaching each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the pattern acts as a resistance barrier, while the lower one provides support. Together, they make it so that the price remains stuck in the channel between them, and since the trendlines involved here are of the converging type, the asset’s range shrinks as it moves inside the triangle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Down 13% As Whales Distribute $181 Million In DOGE An escape out of either of these bounds can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, a break above the triangle can be a bullish sign, while a decline under it a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that the 1-day PEPE price is currently trading inside: As is visible in the above graph, Pepe has been stuck inside this channel since December of last year, but its price is now not far from the apex. Generally, breakouts become more likely to occur the tighter an asset’s range is, as it means retests happen more frequently. With the memecoin standing inside the narrow tip of the triangle now, its range is quite small, so an escape could be probable to occur in the near future. Symmetrical Triangles are usually considered to have an equal bias in both directions, so a possible breakout could occur in either direction for the asset. Triangle breakouts are generally of the same length as the base of the triangle (that is, the distance between the trendlines at their widest). Based on this, the analyst believes the memecoin may be gearing up for a 78% move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Touches $117,000 As Binance Records 9 Days Of Outflows It now remains to be seen how the price of the cryptocurrency will develop in the near future and which side of the Symmetrical Triangle a breakout would take place. The Symmetrical Triangle is just one type of triangles that exist in TA. Another popular variant is the Ascending Triangle, which forms when the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, Solana has seen a breakout above such a triangle on the daily timeframe. “Solana $SOL may retest the breakout zone at $210 before pushing toward the $320 target!” explains the analyst. PEPE Price At the time of writing, Pepe is trading around $0.00001137, up more than 9% over the last week.

51947459,584267,1758236434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51947459.jpeg,Ripple Seals Deal With Southeast Asia’s Largest Bank,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-deal-southeast-asia-largest-bank/,"Ripple has inked a three-way agreement with DBS and Franklin Templeton to bring tokenized money market funds and stablecoin-based liquidity onto DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx), in a move that squarely targets institutional demand for on-chain yield and credit. Biggest Bank In Southeast Asia Taps Ripple Tech Under a memorandum of understanding signed on September 18, DDEx will list Franklin Templeton’s sgBENJI—the token of the Franklin Onchain US Dollar Short-Term Money Market Fund—alongside Ripple’s US dollar stablecoin, RLUSD , enabling eligible clients to swap between a yield-bearing fund token and a stable unit of account around the clock. Ripple says the solution is being built on the public XRP Ledger, with repo-style lending to follow as the initiative expands. DBS, Southeast Asia’s largest bank by assets (over $500 billion as of 2025), framed the tie-up as part of a broader institutional shift toward tokenized market infrastructure. “Digital asset investors need solutions that can meet the unique demands of a borderless 24/7 asset class,” said Lim Wee Kian, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange. The bank added that, in a next phase, it will explore allowing clients to post sgBENJI as collateral to obtain credit either directly from DBS via repurchase transactions (repos) or from third-party platforms where DBS acts as collateral agent—formally pulling a core money-markets use case on-chain. Franklin Templeton, which has been at the vanguard of tokenized funds, will issue sgBENJI on the XRP Ledger to increase interoperability across networks. Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, called the collaboration “a meaningful advancement in the utility of tokenized securities” and “a significant step forward in the growth of Asia’s digital asset ecosystem.” Ripple’s VP and global head of trading and markets, Nigel Khakoo, underscored the capital-markets angle, saying the link-up to “enable repo trades for a tokenized money market fund” with a regulated, liquid exchange medium like RLUSD “is truly a game-changer.” Monica Long, Ripple’s president, situated the announcement in the larger tokenization debate, arguing that real-world assets must have both tradability and practical uses to fulfill their promise. “In order for tokenized financial assets to solve the problems they’ve been promised to solve, we need both 1/ liquid secondary markets and 2/ utility for these assets (such as with collateralization). That’s exactly what Ripple, DBS and FTI are working towards with this announcement,” she wrote via X. The mechanics are designed for institutional portfolio management. By listing sgBENJI and RLUSD side by side, accredited investors on DDEx can quickly rebalance from volatile crypto exposures into a comparatively stable, yield-accruing fund token without leaving a single, bank-supervised ecosystem. Ripple and DBS say settlement finality within minutes and 24/7 market access are central to the design, with the XRP Ledger chosen for speed, low fees and throughput suitable for high-volume fund token transfers.

This action aims to boost the revival of Europe’s capital markets. Following their pledge, the international organization intends to enhance pension investment growth and loosen strict cryptocurrency regulations . These plans were made public after Maria Luis Albuquerque, a European Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services, and the Capital Markets Union, shared them on Thursday, September 18, according to reports from reliable sources. The commissioner also highlighted that the commission was considering granting the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), its major market regulator, more direct supervisory powers. The EU vows to enact effective economic strategies to reform its single market During a conference in Copenhagen, Albuquerque stated the commission’s main aim towards implementing these changes . Based on her argument, they want to eliminate cross-border barriers, lower administrative expenses, and ensure the implementation of simple regulations. Her remarks came when individuals raised concerns about getting tired of the EU’s slow-moving approach to reforming its single market. These concerns were raised a year after Mario Draghi, a prominent Italian economist who served as the European Central Bank’s President (ECB), released a significant report on enhancing the European economy using the financial sector. Even with this economic strategy, Draghi warned that Europe was dragging behind global changes at the beginning of this week. Meanwhile, as the ESMA gains supervisory powers, the commission will thoroughly assess whether centralized oversight of specific market infrastructures, such as central counterparties, central securities depositories, and trading venues, will be beneficial. Concerning this, Albuquerque pointed out that emerging sectors like crypto asset service institutions would also benefit from increased centralized supervision while still allowing national authorities to perform their responsibilities. The EU proposes measures to encourage investments in Europe Albuquerque shared additional information about the commission’s proposals that are expected to be implemented by the end of this month. The proposals are intended to encourage investments in Europe and redirect household savings stored in bank accounts into investments. A reliable source familiar with the situation reported that the commission will propose several tax incentives to promote investment. This will include deductions for opening savings and investment accounts, exemptions on income from investments, and introducing a system that will delay taxes until people withdraw their funds from their bank accounts. These suggestions are part of what is referred to as the Savings and Investments Union. This initiative aims to assist European businesses in gaining easier access to funding, as it simultaneously provides more financial opportunities for consumers. This draft may be updated before September 30, the preferred date for the commission to issue these recommendations. For the EU’s pension plan that Albuquerque had shared earlier, the commission will suggest auto-enrollment for workplace pensions, establish systems that track pensions, and offer advice on the most suitable practices to be adopted. These recommended measures must undergo the EU legislative process and represent another effort by Brussels to utilize European capital to enhance the local economy. In the meantime, during her yearly speech last week, President Ursula von der Leyen pointed out internal obstacles in the single market. According to her, they act as a 45% tariff on goods and a 110% tariff on services.

The announcement came during a press call where Jensen confirmed he personally discussed the terms with Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan, a longtime associate. “We thought it was going to be such an incredible investment,” Jensen said, adding that the agreement was finalized Saturday after months of back-and-forth. As Cryptopolitan reported , the partnership involves Nvidia building AI systems and PC chips alongside Intel, combining Nvidia’s graphics processors with Intel’s x86 CPUs. The deal covers more than just a handshake. Nvidia will be buying central processors from Intel to power its NVLink rack AI servers, which currently use Arm chips. Jensen explained: “We’ll buy those CPUs from Intel, and then we’ll connect it into super chips that then becomes our compute node, that then gets integrated into a rack scale AI supercomputer.” At the same time, Intel will start pushing laptops and PC chips that include Nvidia’s GPU components, tech that Jensen says will help both companies tap into a $50 billion market. Nvidia plugs into Intel’s hardware as Intel sells off assets Greg Ernst, Intel’s revenue chief, said on LinkedIn that the agreement came together over the past few months and was finalized on Saturday. Under the deal, Nvidia becomes a major customer of Intel CPUs while also supplying GPU chiplets that go into Intel’s client-side products. “We’re going to become a very large customer of Intel CPUs, and we’re going to be a large supplier of GPU chiplets into Intel chips,” Jensen told reporters. He clarified that the partnership won’t affect Nvidia’s existing work with Arm, and that Thursday’s announcement is only about products, not Intel’s foundry. Right now, Nvidia uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to manufacture its chips. But Jensen said they still evaluate Intel’s foundry capabilities and may work with them down the line. For this partnership though, the collaboration will only involve Intel’s chip packaging, the late-stage part of chip production that combines components into a single part ready for installation. Tan, who was named Intel’s CEO in March after Pat Gelsinger was ousted, said during the same press call, “I’d like to thank Jensen for the confidence in me, and our team and Intel will work really hard to make sure it’s a good return for you.” Pat was removed by Intel’s board last year due to rising costs in manufacturing and failure to break into the AI chip market. Since then, Tan has led Intel through major cost-cutting and fundraising moves. Intel has raised $2 billion from SoftBank, sold a majority stake in its ASIC subsidiary Altera to Silver Lake for $3.3 billion, and offloaded $1 billion in stock from Mobileye, its self-driving tech unit. The company also said in July that it’s laying off 15% of its workforce by year’s end. In total, Intel has received $8.9 billion in CHIPS Act grants and loans from the U.S. government—but the Trump administration requested a 10% equity stake in exchange for the funds. That stake was secured in August. Despite the cash, Intel still hasn’t landed any major foundry customers like Nvidia or Apple. Analysts have said the company needs at least one to prove that its technology is reliable at scale. If it doesn’t, it may be forced to abandon the foundry business altogether. That has raised concern in Washington, where lawmakers see Intel as strategically important due to its status as the only American firm that can build top-tier chips onshore. Jensen was in England earlier this week with President Donald Trump, attending a state dinner at Windsor Palace and announcing new projects in the U.K. But both Jensen and a White House official confirmed that the U.S. government was not involved in the Nvidia-Intel deal. Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, later said in a statement, “Intel’s new partnership with Nvidia is a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing.” Intel’s fall over the last five years has been steep. Its shares have dropped 31.78%, while Nvidia’s have jumped 1,348%, putting Nvidia’s market cap at $4.25 trillion compared to Intel’s $143 billion as of Thursday’s close.

The Russian news agency Interfax reported on September 17 that a court in the city has ordered the arrest the head of a Russian Railways (RZD) power department, along with his deputy. The Smolninsky District Court ruled that Sergei Kuznetsov, the head of the RZD’s St Petersburg-Finlyandsky Station Electricity Supply Department, and his deputy Nikolai Baltser, should remain in custody until November 15. The station is one of the biggest and most important rail transport hubs in the country. Russian Railways Staffers ‘Mined Crypto at Power Substations’ Prosecutors say the duo stole nearly 1 billion rubles (over $12 million) worth of power from their employer to power crypto mining rigs. A Russian Railways train in Chelyabinsk, Russia. (Source: Andrey Khabarov [CC BY 3.0]) The duo has been charged with abuse of power-related offenses. But police think they did not act alone. Investigators said an as-yet “unidentified mastermind” paid Kuznetsov and Baltzer. Officers say the mastermind used this aid to “tap Russian Railways facility resources for energy-intensive mining.” This mastermind, police think, belongs to an organized criminal group that also includes other RZD employees. Police said they found crypto mining rigs “illegally installed at the Gromovo and Lugovaya substations.” Both substations are connected to the RZD’s central power grid. The rigs operated undetected from September 16, 2024, until they were discovered on September 16 this year, officers added.

Prosecutors say they believe that arrestees were “aware” that the rigs would require an “uncontrolled consumption of electrical energy.” The suspects also reportedly understood that their actions were a violation of RDZ’s property rights. They also knew that this would “harm the legitimate interests of their employer,” prosecutors added. Prosecution officials reported that Kuznetsov “immediately began cooperating” with the pretrial investigation upon his arrest. However, both defendants said they objected to being taken into custody. Kuznetsov and Baltzer both said they had no intention of trying to flee ahead of their trials. Earlier this month, Russian electronics retailers reported that demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg and the surrounding region is now the third highest in the country . Evidence appears to suggest that some miners are leaving traditional Bitcoin mining hotspots in Southern Siberia and the North Caucasus in favor of larger urban areas.

That pattern repeated when EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) highlighted a recent statement from Jim Cramer, interpreting it as a decisive signal of altseason for the crypto market. Cramer had insisted that “Altseason is just a myth, it’ll never happen,” a dismissal that resonated because of his reputation for bold market calls that often fail spectacularly. Among digital asset traders, such remarks frequently serve as cues to go in the opposite direction , and EGRAG CRYPTO’s response reinforced that perception. Thank you Lord for the Signal pic.twitter.com/NaeQ6nzQri — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 17, 2025 Cramer’s Reputation and the Crypto Market Sentiment Cramer has built a career as a financial commentator, but his track record is widely perceived as unreliable. Traders often treat his dismissals or endorsements as reasons to anticipate the opposite outcome. When he declared that altseason would never happen, many observers interpreted it as indirect confirmation that such a cycle could arrive soon. EGRAG CRYPTO amplified this view by stating, “Thank you, Lord, for the Signal,” implying that Cramer’s skepticism might mark the onset of a strong altcoin cycle. Altseason and XRP Adding to the excitement is the prediction by veteran trader Peter Brandt concerning the start of altseason . Altseason refers to a period when digital assets outside of Bitcoin experience sharp upward moves, and Brandt is convinced that the market has entered this phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historically, these periods follow phases of Bitcoin strength and often bring massive gains for tokens with established communities. XRP stands among those frequently highlighted as a major candidate for growth when altseason materializes. Many other analysts have also reiterated their altseason predictions , and with a loyal base of holders and ongoing discussions about its role in global finance, XRP benefits disproportionately when capital flows into the altcoin sector. What’s Next for XRP? The possibility of a significant altseason now rests on both technical and psychological foundations. Some inexperienced market participants might view Cramer’s dismissal as a counter-signal, but analysts such as EGRAG CRYPTO see it as confirmation. If capital does rotate heavily into altcoins, XRP could find itself in a position to register sharp moves upward . That expectation has become a central point for investors who believe that market cycles repeat and that XRP, given its liquidity and recognition, could serve as one of the leading beneficiaries.

This wave of rapid adoption is changing the way investors perceive both established giants and emerging speculative plays. XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE now stand as two of the most talked-about names on opposite ends of the spectrum. XRP is a legacy altcoin with global partnerships and enterprise adoption, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is a rising meme-driven presale token. The question for investors: which among these is the best crypto to buy as this market grows towards unprecedented scale? XRP: Momentum and Utility XRP has constantly proven to be one of the most resilient altcoins in the market. Its focus on enterprise level payment solutions have made it widely used among banks and financial institutions. Ripple’s increasing partnership in several different jurisdictions have strengthened the position of XRP as a practical utility coin. Price momentum has made a comeback too with XRP rising steadily as it broke through key resistance levels. Analysts highlight positive technical structures that could propel the asset toward new highs. Combined with speculation around the potential of an XRP ETF, sentiment around the coin is looking increasingly optimistic. XRP is considered by many to be a safer long-term bet. For investors who want to get exposed to the adoption of blockchain without the extreme volatility, it remains to be a cornerstone option. MAGACOIN FINANCE Designed for Explosive ROI MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured attention for very different reasons. Built with token economies based on scarcity, the altcoin applies a 12% burn upon every transaction. These prices constantly supply pressure to value appreciation in support of long term value appreciation. Unlike many projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has paired its community appeal with structure and credibility. The altcoin has been audited entirely by respected firms adding further as a trust for the investor pool. Analysts point to this transparency as a rare strength in a market that is often riddled with conjectures of unverified statements. But what makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out most is its return potential. Analysts suggest the coin could have 2000% ROI before the market even reaches the $100 trillion mark. This projection is based on both the deflationary mechanics, and also on its positioning as a rising name in the altcoin space. For investors seeking higher risk and reward, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly moving onto watchlists. The $100 Trillion Market Outlook The wider environment is conducive to both types of assets. Forecasts of 4 billion crypto users by 2030, however, means established players like XRP will continue to anchor adoption. At the same time, high-upside tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioned to capture higher inflows. Institutional adoption, retail growth and regulatory progress all point toward a maturing industry. In such an environment, portfolios may consist of a rapidly growing mix of both stable utility coins and riskier altcoins with exponential growth potential. Which Altcoin Is the Best Buy? For conservative investors, XRP remains a proven choice that has great utility and partnerships, as well as adoption. For risk-tolerant investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers bold upside with analysts pointing to 2000% ROI potential. As the crypto market continues to make its way to $100 trillion, it is a question of strategy. Do you prioritize stability with XRP, or chase upside gains with MAGACOIN FINANCE?

According to on-chain data from ValidatorQueue.com, the exit backlog has surged to unexpected levels, and the investors making the withdrawals are now facing a wait time of more than 44 days before their ETH is fully unstaked. This sudden spike in withdrawals raises serious questions about the possibility of looming selling pressure and how it might affect the Ethereum price. Largest Exit Queue Ever Recorded According to data from ValidatorQueue.com, about 2.6 million ETH were queued up to be unstaked, its largest exit number on record. This exit queue number dwarfs all previous periods of validator exits since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake in September 2022. At its peak, the ETH tokens in the queue were worth about $12 billion. Interestingly, the chart data from ValidatorQueue shows a growing trend of more validators unstaking their ETH in recent weeks, as evidenced by the parabolic rise since mid-August. Analyst MartyParty commented on social media platform X , stating, “Ethereum Staking Exit Queue parabolic.” Such a large-scale withdrawal event highlights growing unease among stakers, and institutional participants or large staking providers are behind the sudden mass exits. The exit queue has witnessed a parabolic rise in recent months that is hard to ignore. This rise started in July 2025, when the average number of ETH waiting to be unstaked jumped from below 10,000 ETH to about 250,000 ETH within a matter of days. By the end of the month, the exit queue had escalated and climbed past 740,000 ETH. August also saw a similar rise, with queue numbers averaging around 800,000 ETH before crossing 1 million ETH at the end of the month. Now, the queue numbers have more than doubled in September, reaching a peak of 2.63 million ETH last week. As it stands, there are more than 2.4 million ETH waiting to leave the network. The backlog is so large that validators are facing an estimated 43 days and 3 hours of wait time before their ETH can be fully unstaked. Implications For Ethereum Price With more than $12 billion in ETH queued for withdrawal, the looming question is whether this will translate into significant sell pressure on exchanges. If these withdrawals are liquidated, the Ethereum price could face downward pressure. This would damage Ethereum’s rally, which has picked up this week. However, not all unstaked ETH is necessarily heading for the open market. Some may be repositioned into restaking protocols or into Spot Ethereum ETFs. On the other hand, ETH staking has slowed down massively. At the time of writing, 451,950 ETH are currently in the entry queue to be staked. This is a 53% decline from 959,717 ETH on September 5. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,572, up by 2.1% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Staking Exit Queue|ethusd|ETHUSDT|MartyParty|spot Ethereum ETFs|ValidatorQueue.com,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-19 00:00:08

He shared a video that begins with an image of a figure standing on a downward line, symbolizing what many might see as a decline in the market, and Squire suggests that it’s time to sell XRP because the bull market is over. However, as the clip continues, it zooms out to reveal that the apparent downturn is part of a much larger upward trajectory. This mirrors a common sentiment among XRP supporters who view recent market struggles as temporary setbacks rather than permanent shifts. Squire’s Perspective on XRP Squire used the video to express his opinion on the current state of the market. While on the surface his comments may seem pessimistic, the full context of the video conveys a different message. Through the video, he highlights how short-term declines can sit within longer-term growth phases. The bull market is over, time to sell everything $XRP pic.twitter.com/7ugK5WOpKI — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 17, 2025 XRP has experienced difficulties in recent months, with price movements falling short of expectations. The asset reached a new all-time high of $3.65 in July, but has struggled since, losing multiple key support levels. Some investors have grown frustrated, pointing to underperformance compared to other digital assets. Yet, despite these challenges, Squire and many others still emphasize XRP’s long-term potential . His post reflects a segment of the community that regards the current environment as a time to reassess rather than abandon positions. One commenter suggested that now is the best time to buy more, reiterating the belief in the asset’s long-term trajectory.

The asset’s technology and established partnerships remain key reasons why many retain confidence in it. Squire’s post signals that although price volatility can unsettle traders, it does not necessarily diminish the asset’s prospects. This video reinforces the belief that temporary market downturns can coexist with the potential for future appreciation. Many investors view times of uncertainty as opportunities to evaluate assets more closely. XRP is trading at $3.12, and investors are already seizing the opportunity to buy the dip and accumulate tokens.

This comes in the wake of concerns about the exchange’s alleged ties to President Donald Trump’s administration and the potential easing of regulatory oversight. Warren Pressures DOJ On Binance Compliance Following years of legal challenges, which culminated in the resignation and brief imprisonment of former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) over allegations of money laundering in the US, Binance appeared to have navigated a path toward a more favorable regulatory environment during Trump’s presidency. However, in a recent letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Warren, along with two fellow Democratic senators, pressed for confirmation that Binance is adhering to the ongoing requirements stipulated in its plea agreement related to charges, including money laundering and violations of US sanctions laws. Related Reading: REX Shares Claims Its DOGE And XRP Spot ETFs Will Be Approved By US SEC Tomorrow The senators expressed their concerns over reports of meetings between Binance executives and Treasury Department officials, seeking clarity on the administration’s role in ensuring the exchange’s compliance with the settlement. Warren’s letter highlighted several specific inquiries. She requested information about the Department’s efforts to guarantee Binance’s compliance with its plea agreement, the status of the company’s anticipated exit from the US market, and any discussions regarding a potential pardon for Zhao. This follows the former CEO’s official request for a presidential pardon earlier this year, after rumors from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg suggested that CZ and Trump would be collaborating. The senators also sought details about conversations relating to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralised finance (DeFi) venture run by the president’s sons, and its plans to list a new stablecoin called USD1 on the Binance platform. Lawmakers Demand Clarity In a response from the Department of Justice on September 12, officials summarized Binance’s plea agreement and confirmed that the exchange had paid all penalties due. However, the senators asserted that the response failed to address their key questions, particularly regarding Binance’s compliance with ongoing requirements. The letter concluded as follows: These reports make it more important than ever that the public understand the Trump Administration’s interactions with, and relationship to, Binance and its employees. We therefore once again request meaningful answers to the questions above by no later than October 1, 2025. Related Reading: Coinbase Vs.

The shift was announced by the bank’s vice-chairman and former governor of Brazil’s central bank, Roberto Campos Neto. Addressing the Meridian 2025 event yesterday, he discussed blockchain’s role in linking digital assets and traditional banking. The local media quoted Campos Neto as saying Nubank would soon start testing stablecoin payments with its credit cards in what it sees as a broader attempt to connect digital assets into mainstream banking. The data reveals that people aren’t buying for transactions, they’re buying as a store of value,’ he was quoted as saying. “We need to get to the bottom of why this is happening. I think it’s shifting a little bit, but we have to be aware of it.” He also noted that the challenge for banks is finding a way to accept deposits in tokenized forms and use these assets to issue credit for clients. Nubank expands crypto services as stablecoin use surges across Latin America Founded in São Paulo in 2013, Nubank is a Brazilian digital bank serving over 100 million customers across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. The bank entered the digital asset space in 2022 by allocating 1% of its net assets to Bitcoin and rolling out crypto trading for its customers. In March 2025, Nubank broadened its crypto lineup by adding four altcoins, giving customers access to Cardano, Cosmos, Near Protocol, and Algorand. Stablecoin adoption is surging across Latin America. In Brazil, the president of the Central Bank revealed at a Bank for International Settlements event in February that 90% of crypto activity in the country is tied to stablecoins. Dollar-pegge d digital assets are also gaining traction in Argentina, where inflation has surpassed 100% in recent years. A March 2025 report from Bitso showed that USDT and USDC accounted for 50% and 22% of all cryptocurrency purchases in Argentina in 2024, respectively. Across Bitso’s platforms in the region, stablecoins represented 39% of all crypto purchases that year. Adoption is spreading to other countries as well. In July 2025, the Central Bank of Bolivia signed an agreement with El Salvador to promote crypto as a “viable and reliable alternative” to fiat. Since lifting its crypto ban in June 2024, Bolivian banks have been permitted to process Bitcoin and stablecoin transactions. In Venezuela, where inflation reached 229% in May, stablecoins such as USDT are increasingly replacing the bolívar in everyday transactions, from groceries to salaries. Chainalysis data indicates that stablecoins accounted for 47% of all crypto transactions under $10,000 in 2024. Nu Holdings sees profit soar 42% as Nubank shifts focus Nu Holdings, the parent company of Brazilian digital lender Nubank, reported a 42% year-on-year rise in net profit on a foreign exchange-neutral basis on Thursday, sending its shares up more than 8% in after-hours trading . The company, which has 123 million clients in Brazil — its core market — Colombia, and Mexico, made a second-quarter net profit of $637 million for the three months to June. Revenue was $3.7 billion, a 40% increase from the previous year. In an interview, the company’s chief financial officer, Guilherme Lago, said the profit increase resulted from operational leverage and top-line growth, but that factors underpinning that increase were beginning to shift. “If in the last three to five years a lot of our growth has come from adding new customers, in the next three to five years, much more of our revenue growth in Brazil will come from deepening the relationship with those customers,” Lago said. Nubank’s annualized return on equity, a measure of profitability, settled at 28%, compared to the year-earlier figure reported. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The case will test the limits of presidential power and could have major economic consequences. The tariffs, which are still in place, have served as the backbone of Trump’s trade and foreign policy decisions since he secured reelection in January. He enforced them by invoking emergency powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a statute enacted in 1977. Critics have said this was an abuse of authority, while the supporters believe it’s a bold defense of American jobs and security. Courts rule Trump went too far On August 29, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit struck a major blow to Donald Trump’s trade policy. The judges said that the president had overstepped his authority when he ordered the imposition of tariffs at a global level, using emergency powers under a statute known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The judges emphasized that IEEPA never intended to give presidents unlimited authority over tariffs. Rather, the law was written for limited use in national emergencies related to foreign threats. Previous presidents often deployed it to slap sanctions on or freeze the assets of unfriendly governments. None of them had used it to remake global trade, however. The court said that Trump went too far in using IEEPA to impose tariffs on various imports. The ruling underscored that Congress, not the president, possesses the constitutional power to regulate trade and lay duties. The decision came after months of legal wrangling after a coalition of 12 states, led by Democratic attorneys general from New York, Oregon, and Colorado, sued against the tariffs. They said the tariffs lifted consumer costs, wounded local businesses, and disrupted supply chains. Small businesses also scrambled into the fight, with a number saying their costs had risen with the imposition of the tariffs on imported materials and that they had less room for profit on sales. One of the biggest challengers is Learning Resources, a family-owned toy maker. The company said in court documents that the tariffs significantly increased production costs and jeopardized its survival in a competitive industry. The tariffs will stay in place while that legal process continues, even though the ruling went against the government. That means American importers will be paying higher duties for the time being. Consumers’ prices rise on various products – from household goods to electronics and toys. Supreme Court to weigh presidential power Now, the court will determine whether Trump’s use of IEEPA squares aligns with the law. The tariffs and the balance of power between Congress and the presidency are at stake. Lawmakers from both parties have urged the administration not to proceed with tariffs. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and Trump ally, told CNN that changing trade policy in ways that affect Americans is beyond a president’s authority. He said Congress should decide on tariffs, as it traditionally does. Trump argues, however, that national security and financial stability give the president wide powers to act. A ruling for Trump could greatly expand executive power in economic affairs . Future presidents might employ emergency laws to reshape trade without involving Congress. If the court comes down against him, it would restrict presidential power and force the U.S. government to refund hundreds of billions of dollars collected in tariffs. That could blow a hole in federal revenue and roil global markets. Trading partners, already unnerved by the prospect of tariffs, are watching closely. Economists say the uncertainty has contributed to market volatility and weakened investor confidence. Trump, for his part, has doubled down on his approach, saying tariffs are an important tool to shield U.S. industries, slash trade deficits, and pressure other countries like China, Mexico, and Canada to crack down on the flow of illegal drugs or unfair trading practices. Just recently, Scott Bessent said that Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are likely to pass Supreme Court scrutiny, but warned the Treasury may be forced to return hundreds of billions in tariff revenue if the court rules against the White House. Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press, the Treasury Secretary noted he was “confident” Trump’s trade moves would be upheld. Still, he admitted that “we would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” if the court strikes them down. “If the court says it, we’d have to do it,” he added.

Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner and head of policy at a16z crypto, was tapped by President Donald Trump in February to lead the derivatives regulator. His nomination was initially supported by a coalition of crypto industry groups , who argued he was “exceptionally well-suited” for the role given his experience with digital assets. But a series of delays in the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the agency, has left his confirmation in limbo. White House Vets New CFTC Chair Picks Amid Crypto Oversight Debate According to Bloomberg report, the White House is now weighing additional names, including officials with experience in crypto regulation and digital asset policy. Michael Selig, chief counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force and a former partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, has been floated as a contender. Tyler Williams, counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on digital assets and a former executive at Galaxy Digital, has also been discussed. Neither has commented publicly on the matter. BREAKING: White House seeks new crypto-focused candidates for CFTC chair after Quintez’s confirmation stalls. — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) September 18, 2025 The search reflects growing urgency as the CFTC prepares for a larger role in digital asset oversight. The agency traditionally regulates derivatives markets, but pending legislation in Congress could expand its authority over spot trading in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether. The CFTC already oversees trillions of dollars in swaps and futures trading, and its influence in crypto policy has grown under outgoing chair Rostin Behnam. Behnam, who stepped down in January , presided over the agency during some of its most aggressive actions in crypto enforcement, including the $4.3 billion settlement with Binance. He consistently argued that the CFTC is best positioned to regulate digital commodities and warned that large portions of the crypto market remain unregulated. His departure left the agency under Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who had signaled she plans to return to the private sector once a permanent leader is confirmed. The delay over Quintenz’s nomination escalated after reports surfaced that Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss privately urged Trump to reconsider his choice. In June, Politico reported the brothers had raised concerns that Quintenz would not fully back the president’s crypto agenda. Weeks later, the White House requested the Senate Agriculture Committee to pause a scheduled vote. Quintenz later suggested on social media that the president “might have been misled” by the twins, posting screenshots of private exchanges he claimed to have had with Tyler Winklevoss before his hearing was delayed. I’ve never been inclined to release private messages. But in light of my support for the President and belief that he might have been misled, I’ve posted here the messages that include the questions Tyler Winklevoss asked me pertaining to their prior litigation with the CFTC. I… pic.twitter.com/MN75M1XUpT — Brian Quintenz (@BrianQuintenz) September 10, 2025 The situation has been complicated by allegations involving Kalshi, a prediction market platform facing scrutiny over its operations, which further fueled calls for caution around Quintenz’s nomination. Officials close to the process say the White House has not officially withdrawn his name, but the administration is actively vetting alternatives. With only two sitting commissioners currently on the five-member panel, the CFTC is operating with limited capacity. Industry advocates warn that further delays in filling the chair could hinder progress on crypto regulation, even as demand for oversight grows. For now, the White House has declined to comment, leaving the future of the CFTC’s leadership uncertain. CFTC Opens Door to Spot Bitcoin and Ether Trading Despite Leadership Vacuum As the White House reconsiders its stalled nomination of Brian Quintenz to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator itself is pressing ahead with a flurry of new crypto initiatives. In August, Acting Chair Caroline Pham unveiled a plan to permit spot cryptocurrency trading on exchanges already registered with the CFTC. CFTC plans to allow spot crypto trading on regulated futures exchanges, advancing efforts to implement US digital asset policy. #CFTC #SpotCrypto https://t.co/g0mdpetrnJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 The move, described as the first step in the agency’s “crypto sprint,” would allow Designated Contract Markets that currently trade futures to also list spot products such as Bitcoin and Ether. The initiative comes as Congress weighs the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, which could formally expand the CFTC’s authority over digital assets. To prepare, the agency has upgraded its market surveillance tools, adopting Nasdaq’s monitoring platform to detect manipulation and fraud in both derivatives and crypto markets. Coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission is also accelerating. In early September, the two agencies released a joint statement confirming that registered exchanges may facilitate spot crypto trading . A revised draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act further calls for a joint advisory committee on digital assets, with explicit protections for developers and decentralized finance participants. With the CFTC advancing reforms under temporary leadership, the search for a permanent chair has become more pressing, leaving the White House under pressure to resolve its stalled nomination process.

The rapid influx of investor demand highlights Pepesnix as one of the fastest-growing crypto presales of 2025, with momentum showing no signs of slowing. A Milestone That Signals Investor Confidence The presale launched just days ago and has already attracted thousands of investors worldwide. Surpassing the half-million mark this quickly places Pepesnix in the same league as early-stage successes like Shiba Inu and Pepe — projects that went on to generate multi-billion-dollar market caps. Key presale highlights so far: $500,000 raised within days of launch Rapidly growing investor base across North America, Europe, and Asia Strong community expansion with thousands joining Telegram and Twitter channels daily Presale stages selling out faster than projected Crypto analysts suggest that Pepesnix’s strong debut signals not just short-term hype, but the foundation of a project capable of sustaining growth through listings and beyond. The Meme Coin to Watch in 2025 Pepesnix is gaining traction thanks to its fair launch mechanics, viral meme branding, and sustainable tokenomics designed for long-term growth. With allocations for liquidity, marketing, and staking, $PEPEX is structured for both immediate excitement and lasting value. “This milestone proves that investors see Pepesnix as more than another meme coin,” said a spokesperson for the project. “Surpassing $500,000 so quickly demonstrates strong confidence in our vision and confirms Pepesnix’s place as one of the most exciting presales of 2025.” Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, Pepesnix is built to balance community energy with structural safeguards like anti-whale and anti-bot protections, giving everyday investors a fair chance to participate. A Perfect Market Moment The milestone comes at a time when crypto presales are heating up in 2025. With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the market into a bullish phase, meme coins have historically been the next sector to rally. Pepesnix is launching at the perfect moment to capitalize on this momentum, drawing parallels to Dogecoin’s rise in 2021 and Shiba Inu’s run in 2022. As market sentiment turns increasingly positive, Pepesnix’s viral branding and growing community could position it as one of the breakout stars of the cycle. How to Join Before the Next Milestone Investors eager to get in before the next stage price increase can still participate in the presale by visiting the official website: https://pepesnix.com/ . Steps to join: Connect a Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Select a payment option (ETH, USDT, USDC, or SOL if supported). Complete your purchase before the current stage sells out. The earlier investors secure their tokens, the more favorable their entry price will be. About Pepesnix Pepesnix ($PEPEX) is a meme coin project that combines viral internet culture with sustainable blockchain tokenomics. Built to be fair, community-driven, and exchange-ready, Pepesnix is positioning itself as the most talked-about meme coin of 2025. With explosive presale momentum and a rapidly growing community, Pepesnix is on track to become one of the year’s defining crypto stories.

While SHIB’s rally is a cyclical reflection of the resurgence of memecoins, Mutuum Finance is creating a completely new narrative based on real utility and sustainable development. As a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, MUTM offers investors access to a platform which is set to create tangible value independent of speculation. With its innovative model and rapidly growing user base, many analysts see Mutuum Finance emerging as one of the next big cryptos. Shiba Inu Pops Up as Support Moves In Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001307, with intraday highs reaching $0.00001361 and lows dipping as low as $0.00001296. The token has been showing gradual upward momentum, driven primarily by community buying, higher social activity, and fresh speculation. Resistance is near $0.000014, and support is floating around $0.0000129–$0.0000131, suggesting SHIB could test higher levels if buying volume increases. Contrasted with SHIB’s largely sentiment-driven action, Mutuum Finance, is viewed by analysts as having more upside potential under current market conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance offers investors an opportunity to be part of the project’s early adopters and buy tokens at a much lower price. Selling for $0.035 per MUTM in presale Phase 6, the token’s price will increase to $0.04 in Phase 7. Presale has been a success, with over $15.9 million raised and more than 16,370 token holders, which indicates good investor sentiment and market confidence. To enhance security, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK, with payouts of up to $50,000 USDT. Publicly open, the program invites white-hat hackers, developers, and researchers to scan for possible vulnerabilities in the codebase. Rewards are tiered by severity to ensure that even minor issues get resolved before release. The program is a testament to Mutuum’s commitment to safety, transparency, and investor confidence. MUTM is a hybrid two-tier lending protocol with Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms for optimal flexibility. With the P2C system, contracts continuously track the market to calculate interest rates. The structure enables investors to gain passive income and borrowers to borrow at competitive interest rates, and transactions are automatically performed by the contracts. The P2P model guarantees direct interaction between borrowers and lenders, eradicating the need for intermediaries. This more hands-on alternative is perfect for riskier assets, such as meme coins, and grants autonomy and effectiveness in a trustless environment. Infrastructure and Price Discovery For receiving accurate and timely price data, Mutuum Finance deploys Chainlink oracles, consolidating valuations for top-cap assets such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain data feeds are also deployed for accuracy even in the scenario of volatile markets. The strong pricing foundation is leveraged in stable collateral management, liquidation, and risk analysis to maintain the protocol stable and efficient in all scenarios. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly turning out to be the next DeFi sensation while Shiba Inu (SHIB) aims for a top 10 position. Stage 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, and will jump 14.29% to $0.04 in Stage 7. The project has recorded $15.9M with 16,370+ holders already in. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a P2C/P2P lending dual framework, and Chainlink-based price discovery, MUTM is scalable and secure.

The South Korean custodian BDACS recently launched KRW1, the country’s first Korean won–backed stablecoin, fully collateralized with deposits at Woori Bank. The stablecoin is in its pilot phase after a successful proof of concept, putting Avalanche at the forefront of Korea’s digital asset integration. Similarly, in Japan, Avalanche is collaborating with industry giants such as SMBC, one of the nation’s largest banks, and retail groups like Densan to develop stablecoin-powered payment systems. AVAX Network Activity and DeFi Boom The expansion of stablecoin utilities coincides with a surge in network activity on Avalanche. In August alone, decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surpassed $12 billion, marking an eightfold increase in just two months. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on Avalanche has also exceeded $450 million, with institutions like Grove Finance and SkyBridge driving adoption. DeFi protocols such as UNI, Pharaoh, Benqi, and LFJ are thriving, pushing Avalanche’s total value locked (TVL) above $2 billion. UNI, for example, has posted a 97% gain in the past month, reflecting growing user activity and liquidity across the network. Avalanche Price Targets $42 as Institutional Interest Grows Currently, AVAX is trading near $33, up over 9.4% in the past 24 hours. The token recently broke above a key pivot at $31.05, supported by bullish technical indicators including an RSI of 68.44 and a positive MACD histogram. Analysts suggest that a decisive breakout above $34.50 could propel AVAX toward its next resistance at $42. Institutional adoption is also on the horizon. With four AVAX ETF filings awaiting regulatory approval, inflows from traditional finance could act as a major catalyst for price growth. Combined with Asia’s growing stablecoin market and Avalanche’s thriving DeFi ecosystem, AVAX aims to become a leading Layer-1 blockchain prepared to challenge rivals in the next crypto bull cycle.

However, recent data from Binance shows that BTC’s current price action is largely supported by retail investors, while whales have been noticeably absent. Bitcoin Holds $117,500 Amid High Retail Inflows According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Bitcoin is hovering around the $117,500 price level, supported by active inflows from retail investors. Notably, large whale inflows have been completely absent, indicating that the current market is being driven by individuals more than by large wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Shift Strategy: Accumulation Over Selling Signals Stronger Bull Cycle Inflows ranging from 0 to 0.001 BTC recorded approximately 97,000 BTC. Similarly, inflows from the 0.001 to 0.01 BTC segment totaled nearly 719,000 BTC. The distribution above suggests that Bitcoin’s current rally is largely driven by retail investors. These investors conduct numerous but small-volume transactions, confirming that individual investors are shaping the market dynamics. Arab Chain added: The figures reveal that the bulk of inflows are concentrated in small and medium-sized transactions, reflecting the dominance of retail activity in Bitcoin trading. This liquidity, despite its limited scale, has helped keep the market balanced at current levels. It is worth emphasizing that there has been almost no whale pressure during the current market rally. Specifically, no significant surges in inflows of more than 100 BTC were observed, mitigating the likelihood of a sharp short-term price correction. To conclude, the current market situation shows that Bitcoin is experiencing a state of equilibrium, largely due to heightened retail investor participation. Such a scenario gives the market an opportunity to steadily surge toward the important $120,000 resistance level. That said, it would be wise to keep an eye on any whale activity, as it could quickly alter the market’s direction. Any sudden entry of whale inflows could trigger a rapid price correction, similar to previous market tops. Experts Divided On BTC Price Action As Bitcoin trades about 5.4% below its all-time high (ATH), there are signs that the top cryptocurrency by market cap may be on the cusp of a fresh rally. For instance, BTC recently broke above the mid-term holder breakeven, reducing the likelihood of an immediate sell-off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Faces Supply Squeeze As Scarcity Index Turns Positive Again Recent positive developments – such as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) reducing interest rates by 25 basis points – could reinvigorate the crypto market. Against that backdrop, crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes recently reiterated his ambitious $1 million BTC prediction. That said, gold bug Peter Schiff opines that BTC has likely already peaked for this market cycle. At press time, BTC trades at $117,523, up 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

The post frames XRP as a tool to handle trillions of dollars sitting idle in nostro and vostro accounts globally, showing the scale of the issue the asset aims to solve. Utility Over Hype In the video, Garlinghouse stresses that the long-term value of any digital asset must stem from its usefulness rather than speculation. He notes that investors and industry participants should ask what problem a token solves, how large that problem is, and how many customers it serves. “There’s no question there’s a lot of hype in this system, and I don’t actually think that’s a good thing,” he says, highlighting Ripple’s approach as grounded in solving tangible financial challenges . #XRP is solving a global payments problem Trillions of dollars are parked in nostro / vostro accounts globally pic.twitter.com/z8nc77plct — XRP_Cro AI / Gaming / DePIN (@stedas) September 16, 2025 XRP’s Use Case Garlinghouse explains that Ripple uses XRP specifically to settle liquidity needs between banks . According to him, about $27 trillion is currently parked at financial institutions around the world so they can facilitate payments with one another. He argued that a digital asset like XRP can handle this process in real time, eliminating the need for such large reserves and revolutionizing this massive cross-border payment market . “Because XRP has been so efficient, it settles a transaction in about three seconds compared to Bitcoin in one hour,” Garlinghouse added. He clarified that XRP “just passes through that currency for that period of time,” highlighting its role as a bridge asset rather than a long-term holding. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential for Growth Garlinghouse’s comments reinforce Ripple’s positioning of XRP as a functional solution rather than a speculative asset. By focusing on liquidity for banks, XRP directly targets a massive existing problem in the global financial system. If banks and financial institutions continue to adopt the technology, XRP’s utility could increase significantly. The emphasis on speed and cost efficiency also aligns with the industry’s push toward instant cross-border settlements, making XRP attractive to institutions looking to modernize their operations. A Utility-Driven Future for Digital Assets The video highlights how Ripple sees its digital asset as more than just a store of value. XRP is an enabling technology that solves problems, and Garlinghouse’s statements indicate confidence that efficiency and utility will drive adoption, especially when dealing with trillions of dollars in global transfers.

The launch started Thursday for Mac and Windows desktop users whose browser language is English. The change is the first step of a broader rollout as the company said that iOS users would soon have Gemini in Chrome, and the move was also coming to Android. Business customers using Google Workspace will have access in the weeks ahead, as will mobile users throughout the United States. The move is the first time Google has seamlessly integrated Gemini into its popular browser. Over half of internet users worldwide use Chrome, meaning the AI could have found a massive audience. Gemini brings new features to Chrome Gemini is built to make browsing smarter and more seamless. Users can type questions into the address bar and receive answers from the service’s artificial intelligence. It can also auto-summarize long articles, fetch past pages, and take on several tasks simultaneously. Google says the integration will also link Gemini with other apps , including Calendar, Maps, and YouTube. In other words, the AI can assist with calendaring, directions, or surfacing video without you needing to exit from Chrome. The company shared new “agentic” features in the works. These will allow Gemini to complete multi-step actions like booking tickets, compiling documents, or collating research from multiple websites. Google is positioning it as a tool that does more than answer; it acts. The browser is receiving additional security tools to help users stay safe. Gemini will also assist in detecting scams, managing passwords, and recommending safer browsing practices. The timing of the launch is especially pointed, coming after a federal judge recently denied a US government request to split Google’s business apart, only weeks ago. Judge Amit Mehta determined that the company will not be required to divest itself of Chrome or the Android mobile system . The ruling is an unusual victory for Big Tech in Washington. However, the court also ruled that Google must share some data with its rivals to foster equal competition. It also limited exclusive contracts, which had assisted Google in keeping competitors off. The decision allows Google to continue developing Chrome on its own terms, but the company will face greater oversight from regulators. The introduction of Gemini in Chrome will likely bring renewed scrutiny to whether the company is wielding its dominant power to gain an edge over smaller rivals. Competition in AI browsers is heating up Google’s move also comes as the competition in AI-driven browser technology heats up. Perplexity, a competitor with investors behind it, has promoted its Comet browser to allow users to complete tasks. In August, it even made a surprise $34.5 billion all-cash bid for Chrome that Google rejected. Apple, meanwhile, has been in discussions with Google about adopting Gemini for its Siri voice assistant, The Information reported earlier this year. That illustrates the demand throughout the tech industry to embed more powerful AI tools in everyday software. By incorporating Gemini into Chrome, Google is not simply trying to protect its search supremacy. It attempts to make AI a central part of people’s web browsing. For everyday users, Gemini on Chrome translates to faster answers, more intelligent organization, and less time spent jumping between apps. It also means browsing could be less about searching and more about having a behind-the-scenes assistant on deck. For rivals, it amps up pressure to innovate quickly. At the same time, for regulators, it crystallizes the question of how much influence one company should have in determining the future of the web. Google’s victory in court provides it room to charge ahead. However, how Chrome manages Gemini will tell whether users consider it a helpful innovation or more of a Big Tech incursion.

If the launch becomes successful, the blockchain network will be positioned as the eighth biggest crypto network for stablecoin liquidity. The announcement came after the network shared a blog entry highlighting that its mainnet beta and the XPL token will be launched next week. The network also mentioned that it will have $2 billion in stablecoins ready for the launch. Interestingly, Plasma has already secured a strong support system from Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer in the crypto market, and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. Plasma intends to upgrade its system to enhance its users’ experience The Plasma stablecoin blockchain has made public its intentions to invest significantly in more than 100 DeFi partners. This includes top DeFi protocols such as Aave, Euler, Fluid, and Ethena. With this investment, the team seeks to provide instant benefits, create savings that maintain value, develop deep USDT markets, and offer the lowest borrowing rates, particularly for USDT, in the industry. In the meantime, it is anticipated that Plasma users will be able to access vault deposits and withdraw USDT from the account when the mainnet beta is launched. Concerning this, the team stated that the event will indicate the end of their final launch phase and grant all its users the privilege to enjoy zero-fee USDT transfers. The network has also vowed to introduce PlasmaBFT, a high-throughput consensus layer responsible for overseeing stablecoin transactions as part of its mainnet beta launch. With this tremendous objective, its users can easily move USDT without being subjected to any fees through authorization-based transfers. Plasma aims at solidifying its position as a leading blockchain network in digital dollars Concerning its mainnet beta and native token, XPL’s launch, Plasma has alerted its users that it will restrict zero-fee transfers to its products. Notably, this will apply during the launch and testing phase. This will, however, not apply to other services. The announcement came after the team said it plans to gradually permit zero-cost transfers for other services. To solidify its position as a leading network for digital dollars, Plasma intends to link with real-life peer-to-peer cash systems to enable digital dollars to extend their reach to more businesses. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, had earlier offered a pre-market perpetual contract for XPL, which supports the Plasma stablecoin blockchain, with prices mounting to about $0.55. Following its launch, the network’s team has stated that at the beginning of the mainnet beta, they will give out an additional 25 million XPL tokens as a reward to its users, particularly those who finished Sonar verification and actively participated in the sale. In addition, they will put aside 2.5 million XPL for current and future members of the Stablecoin Collective. In the case of XPL token distribution, Plasma stated that investors in the US will receive their tokens from July 28, 2026, following legal requirements. Those in other countries who joined the public sale will receive theirs when the mainnet beta is launched.

Laos Turns to Bitcoin Mining for Debt Relief Laos, known as the “battery of Southeast Asia,” is exploring Bitcoin mining to ease its $1.3 billion annual hydropower debt. By using surplus electricity for mining, Laos could convert unused power into globally liquid assets.

Now, as repayment pressures mount, officials are re-evaluating crypto mining as a way to monetize stranded energy. This strategy mirrors Bhutan and Ethiopia, where renewables are being redirected to crypto. It reinforces Bitcoin’s growing narrative as “digital energy money.” Bitcoin Price Forecast – Technical Outlook On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin consolidates inside a rising wedge, trading near $117,366. The 50-SMA at $116,000 and the 200-SMA at $113,243 provide firm support. Candlestick rejections near $115,800 suggest buyers continue to defend key levels, while the RSI at 59 shows cooling momentum without signaling overbought conditions. If BTC closes above $117,978, a climb toward $119,287 and $120,298 is likely, with room for $125K–$130K in the weeks ahead. A break below $116,000 could trigger a pullback toward $114,400 or even $113,200. For now, the bias stays cautiously bullish, with long-term potential for a $500,000 supercycle if liquidity and macro tailwinds align. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $16.8 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012945—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

Officials say Canada needs to quickly implement a regulatory framework for stablecoins, digital tokens linked to traditional money like the Canadian dollar. Ron Morrow, the central bank’s executive director of payments supervision and oversight, said at a conference in Ottawa this week that Canada may have to look at regulating stablecoins nationally. He said Momentum is building not just across the United States but worldwide. And that if Canada were on track and weren’t taking action, it might not matter. The appeal comes as digital payments grow worldwide and stablecoins are becoming inexpensive, swift, and efficient for daily transactions. Morrow emphasized that for stablecoins to work as actual money, they had better be just as safe and stable as the balance in a bank account. Canada urged to lead the way The Bank noted that major economies are moving ahead with digital currencies. The U.S. recently passed the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoin issuers , while the EU is preparing to roll out its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law. Both focus on transparency, robust reserves, and consumer protection. It’s now up to Canadian regulators to follow suit, he and other advocates say. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI ) also subsequently recognized that a regulatory framework for stablecoins that includes licensing, redemption rights, and reserves from issuers is in the works. OSFI also announced that it was prepared to experiment with digital assets as long as they can be easily tracked. Partisan watchers fear that a patchwork, with provinces adopting different rules, would stunt innovation. Now there are calls for federal and provincial regulators to collaborate on a single set of standards. Stablecoins are having a moment, courtesy of something within the industry known as “stablecoin summer.” Cross-border transfers, e-commerce, and instant peer-to-peer payments are some of the causes for their surge in popularity. Users benefit from lower costs and faster speeds than traditional banking rails. However, the Bank of Canada has also raised a warning. If not unlimited, the cost of a stablecoin could be attacked by liquidity-induced crises, credit risks, and ruleless poor governance. Morrow warned that Canadians must be well protected lest stablecoins succumb to the pressure and implode, through the experience of other failed crypto projects across the globe. Bank redirects digital currency strategy toward stablecoin regulation The fight over stablecoins is coming as Canada has internally reconsidered its decision to introduce its central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Bank of Canada researched CBDC with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2022. But the bank said in September 2024 that it was taking a break from its work on the project, citing other priorities, such as an effort to upgrade the country’s real-time payments system. According to surveys, while 42% of Canadians have a positive attitude toward CBDCs, one in five said they either disliked or hated the possibility. Many people in crypto are skeptical about CBDCs because they fear governments can and will deploy them to surveil their citizens and eliminate financial freedom. The central bank has set sights on other private digital assets, such as stablecoins. Advocates say doing so could bring many benefits of digital money without provoking the same public outrage. Moderate Canada is scheduled to release a draft of the stablecoin law in months. That would encompass OSFI, federal politicians, and provincial regulators. If it becomes the industry standard, compliance would guide issuers, create rules protecting consumers, and explain how reserves must be held.

Traders are once again debating whether the meme coin that started it all can reclaim the fabled dollar milestone in the upcoming cycle. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new project combining the energy of meme coins with solid fundamentals is garnering strong interest from analysts. This token is touted by some as one of the gems and undervalued picks of 2025. DOGE Price Action: Building Toward a Breakout Buyers are trying to hold Dogecoin (DOGE $0.2964) above the resistance at $0.26. According to the daily chart for DOGE/USDT, the pair could rise to the $0.29 overhead resistance – a key battleground for bears to defend. If buyers are able to move the price above $0.29 the pair may start a new upward trend towards $0.44 and again speculate on an upward move towards $1 in the next altseason. On the other hand, a rejection at $0.29 for DOGE may see the token remain range-bound for days between $0.29 and $0.14. Analysts are still keeping the prediction for the value of one dollar alive for 2025 due to whale accumulation and ETF speculation. Market Narrative: $1 DOGE Dream Returns In the past, Dogecoin has relied on speculation, community hype, and cycles of accumulation from whales to reach $1. Meme coins are back on the uppers a few months into 2025 which has reinvigorated the Dogecoin $1 dream in the market. Recent reports suggest that deskmoney and high net worth inflows of $300M are whale inflows, which indicates they may be positioning ahead of upcoming catalysts, such as ETF speculation. This background reinforces the argument for DOGE to return to a higher level, as meme coins continue to garner media attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 100x Buzz Meme Coin While Dogecoin fuels discussions about $1, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining 100x buzz as one of the most promising breakout projects of the cycle. Unlike meme coins that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is structured with fundamentals that investors are beginning to recognise: audited smart contracts, a fixed token supply, and a credible presale structure. This foundation supports its scarcity and supply narrative , offering investors a clear alternative to inflationary meme coins. At the same time, the project has become a focal point of community and investor hype , with rapid growth in presale participation and social chatter across X and Telegram. Analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as one of the undervalued picks and hidden gems of 2025 , with a presale entry point still below $0.01. Its ability to combine meme coin energy with structural scarcity has prompted comparisons to early-stage DOGE, fueling speculation that it could deliver significant returns. Conclusion The Dogecoin price prediction of $1 is back on the table, supported by bullish technicals, whale inflows, and ETF speculation. Yet while DOGE carries the weight of history, the market’s appetite for fresh opportunities is fueling new contenders. MAGACOIN FINANCE rise , powered by scarcity-driven fundamentals and vibrant community momentum, is quickly being recognized as one of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. For investors, the strategy may be clear: hold DOGE as the original meme leader, but don’t ignore hidden gems like MAGACOIN FINANCE that could deliver exponential upside in the next altseason.

Price Eyes $4 Retest As Momentum Builds,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/sui-breakout-in-the-horizon-price-eyes-4-retest-as-momentum-builds/,"SUI nears a crucial resistance level as intuitional momentum continues to grow and the network scores major partnerships. Some analysts suggest that the altcoin could see a breakout to new highs if the current levels hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set Up For ‘Promising’ Q4, Next Two Weeks Could Be Decisive SUI $4 Retest In Sight On Thursday, SUI surged 4.2% from its daily opening to reclaim the $3.90 area for the first time in a month. The cryptocurrency has been hovering within the $2.50.00-$4.00 price range after the May breakout, hitting a multi-month high of $4.44 in late July. Since then, the altcoin has failed to reclaim the range’s upper boundary, being rejected twice from this key zone in the past two months. Now, its recent rally has propelled its price back to the range highs, nearing the $4.00 resistance once again. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems asserted that SUI’s low-timeframe structure “is super bullish,” highlighting the recent higher highs (HH). Following its recent breakout from a two-month falling wedge pattern, Sjuul affirmed that the altcoin also confirmed the high-timeframe bullish structure. The market watcher previously suggested that the cryptocurrency could be repeating a similar price action to its early Q3 breakout. Per the post, in Q2, SUI printed a new HH, followed by a correction within a falling wedge formation. Then, the cryptocurrency bounced from the local support and demand area, forming a lower high before rallying to a new HH at the start of Q3. Now, he considers that the price seems “ready to move higher” and that the next leg up could target SUI’s all-time high (ATH) levels. Similarly, Rekt Capital signaled that a successful breakout from the $3.80 would set the stage to revisit the $5.35 ATH. Notably, the current levels coincide with the resistance level of the cryptocurrency’s multi-month downtrend channel. Nonetheless, market watcher CW highlighted that SUI’s current sell wall extends from $3.85 to $4.00, suggesting that the price must hold this crucial area, or it will risk another rejection. What’s Behind The Momentum? SUI’s rally appears to be fueled by institutional interest, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), and positive developments for the network. This week, the Sui Network became one of the launch partners for Google’s Agentic Payments Protocol (AP2). The tech giant’s new standard for AI-driven payments allows AI agents to execute transactions on behalf of users. Moreover, Tuttle Capital joined the Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) buzz and recently filed for a SUI Income Blast ETF to “seek current income” and “exposure to the share price of the daily performance of SUI.” It’s worth noting that at the start of the month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed the final decision on the 21Shares SUI ETF to December 21, 2025. However, many expect that the investment product could be approved as early as October, alongside multiple other crypto-based ETFs that have been delayed for early Q4. Related Reading: BNB Chain Projects Lead Binance Wallet With 2,000x IDO Returns The current DAT strategy trend, which has seen corporations pour billions into cryptocurrencies as treasury reserve assets, has also contributed to SUI’s momentum. At the start of the month, Nasdaq-listed SUI Group Holdings announced it had total holdings of approximately 102 million tokens, worth around $403 million at current prices. The company also authorized a new $50 million stock repurchase program earlier this week. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $3.95, a 10% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Bitcoin, Solana Have Seen A Drop In Perpetual Futures Open Interest In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Open Interest for Bitcoin and other top coins in the cryptocurrency sector. The “ Open Interest ” here refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to a given asset that are currently open on all centralized derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the perpetual futures market. Generally, the total leverage present in the sector rises when this trend develops, so the asset’s price can become more unstable following it. On the other hand, the indicator registering a decline implies holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. Such a trend usually leads to a reduction in leverage, which can make the price act in a more stable manner. Now, first, here’s a chart that shows the trend in the Open Interest for Bitcoin over the past week: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has followed an overall downward trajectory in this period, a sign that a net amount of positions have disappeared. Interestingly, this trend has developed alongside a recovery surge in the BTC price to the $117,000 level. Generally, rallies attract speculative activity so the indicator tends to rise with them, but it would appear that it hasn’t been the case this time around. Solana , the cryptocurrency sixth largest by market cap, has seen a similar trajectory in its Open interest during the past week, as the below chart shows. Thus, it seems both BTC and SOL have seen a cooldown in speculative activity even though their prices have witnessed a net increase over the past week. The same trend, however, hasn’t been seen with some of the other top digital assets. The cryptocurrency number two only to Bitcoin, Ethereum, has witnessed a surge in the Open Interest, implying an increase in demand among the investors for leveraged positioning.

This shift aligns with forecasts from leading analysts, who suggest that the market’s top cryptocurrency may reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months. Some experts even believe that this milestone could be achieved as soon as two weeks from now. Bullish Indicators Emerge Market expert Axel Adler has highlighted key indicators supporting this outlook. He noted on social media platform X that BTC futures are trading at a premium compared to spot prices, with a consistently positive basis. Additionally, the seven-day basis is above the thirty-day average, suggesting a bullish market regime. Related Reading: Coinbase Vs. State Regulators: Crypto Exchange Fights Legal Fragmentation Adler’s analysis suggests a base case probability of around 70% for a continued stepwise uptrend or sideways movement over the next two weeks for the Bitcoin price. He emphasized that if a cluster of bullish signals emerges—such as rising prices, an increasing basis, and growing open interest—this would likely attract fresh long positions and enhance the likelihood of the Bitcoin price achieving a new ATH. Importantly, the Short-Term Holder (STH) Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-scores for both the 155-day and 365-day periods are hovering near zero, indicating that the market is balanced and not in an overheated or oversold state. With the Bitcoin price positioned just above its Short-Term Realized Price, Adler stresses that the stage is set for potential consolidation over the next week or two, followed by a possible surge toward new highs. Adler referred to this anticipated movement as a new “uptober” for Bitcoin and the broader digital asset market. Bitcoin Price Boost Predicted Amidst Strong US Stock Market Performance Adding to the bullish sentiment surrounding the Bitcoin price is the recent performance of US stocks, which have been on a significant uptrend for the past two weeks. Analysts at The Bull Theory have noted a correlation between stock market rallies and the Bitcoin price action, with the analysts suggesting that Bitcoin tends to rise when US equities hit new highs. Related Reading: Next XRP ‘Monster Leg’ Will Start No Earlier Than 2026: Analyst Historical data supports this notion: as seen in the chart below, after an all-time high in the S&P 500, the Bitcoin price has averaged an increase of 12% over 30 days and an impressive 36% over 90 days. If this were to occur again, the Bitcoin price would reach $131,000 and even $178,000 respectively. Similarly, following a Nasdaq all-time high, Bitcoin’s average gains are 16% in 30 days and 46% in 90 days. This scenario would position the market’s leading cryptocurrency at $136,000 and $199,000 if similar price action unfolds from current trading levels of $117,770.

Speaking during a joint interview with Reuters and Bloomberg, Scott made the comments after meetings with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng as part of the U.S.-China trade discussions, which also included talks on TikTok. He made it clear that the yuan, also known as the renminbi, has actually strengthened against the U.S. dollar this year, but collapsed to a record low against the euro. “The RMB is actually stronger this year versus the dollar. Now it’s at an all-time low versus the euro, which is a problem for the Europeans,” Scott, rejecting the idea that Beijing was trying to devalue its currency to gain an unfair edge against Washington. He said Chinese officials haven’t tried anything of the sort with the U.S. and explained the reality behind the currency’s movement: “It’s a closed currency. So they manage the level.” Yuan collapse helps Chinese exports flood europe Since January, the yuan has plunged from 7.5 per euro to over 8.4, triggering concerns across Europe. Meanwhile, against the dollar, it’s gained slightly from 7.3 to 7.1. This divergence has created a lopsided trade dynamic, because while the U.S. has seen its imports from China drop 14% due to aggressive tariffs, Europe has recorded a 6.9% increase in trade with China. So, Scott said the U.S. tariffs are doing what they were meant to do, cutting down the trade deficit. But the redirected flow of Chinese goods is now landing in European markets instead, where the yuan’s weakness is making Chinese exports even cheaper in euro terms. The weakening of the yuan is hitting Europe at a sensitive time, as the European Central Bank (ECB) spent the last year consistently cutting interest rates to support growth across the eurozone. Between June 2024 and June 2025, monetary easing was pushed aggressively, but just as prices were starting to stabilize, cheap Chinese products began flooding the market, triggering deflation. Scope Ratings says EU’s core inflation and wage growth are still above target, even though they’ve cooled slightly. Labor markets remain tight, especially in major economies like Germany, though public spending is up across the continent, especially in defense and infrastructure, which is pushing prices higher again. Plus, a new EU energy trading regime is expected to start in 2027. ECB watches euro strength and deflation risks The ECB has no more rate cuts planned for 2025, according to Scope. But it’s not ruling anything out. The next change in policy will depend on several factors: inflation trends, the growth outlook, US-EU trade relations, and most importantly, the exchange rate. So far this year, the euro has gained 13% against the dollar. If it rises beyond 1.20, it could hurt Europe’s competitiveness and raise fears of deflation. Scott’s comments on the yuan point to a growing divide between how the U.S. and Europe are handling their economic relationship with China. America’s trade strategy under President Donald Trump is designed to push back against Chinese imports, and it’s working by Scott’s count. Europe, on the other hand, is getting hit from two directions—an undervalued yuan and an overvalued euro. The euro is still the second major reserve currency after the dollar.

The well-established crypto exchange partnered with Legion, a European entity focused on initial coin offerings (ICOs), to create Kraken Launch. The partnership allows Legion to distribute selected token sales directly to Kraken’s global user base. Kraken will ensure that those tokens are listed for trading on the exchange shortly after each sale concludes. The companies stated that they will focus on “highest-profile” sales, which are defined as projects with major fundraising milestones. Kraken runs token sales with a dual system Kraken Launch will run sales under a dual system. Around 20% of tokens in each offering will be reserved for users holding a Legion Score. The score measures community loyalty and harmony with project goals. The remainder of the tokens will be available on both Kraken and Legion on a first-come, first-served basis. Each sale will require users to complete Kraken’s intermediate-level KYC verification. And a 0.5% fee will apply to purchases. Kraken Launch will earn revenue through transaction fees collected on token sales. It will also earn revenue from trading fees once new tokens begin trading on the exchange. Kraken and Legion will share this revenue. Brett McLain, Head of Payments and Blockchain at Kraken, said, “Kraken is building the foundation of tomorrow’s financial infrastructure with crypto at its core.” Legion clarified that its token sales are compliant with the European Union’s MiCA framework. The EU requires token issuers to publish a white paper and subjects listed tokens to market-abuse rules. Token sales are inaccessible to users located in the United States, Canada, or Australia. However, Legion has indicated that it is exploring ways to open access in the US by working with the SEC’s crypto task force. Legion builds an ICO underwriting model Legion presents itself as the world’s first ICO underwriter. According to co-founder Matt O’Connor, the model resembles the role underwriters play in traditional IPOs. This includes handling pricing, distribution, compliance, research, and even post-launch support, such as liquidity and market stability. Legion wants to automate regulatory compliance, integrate sell-side research, and provide smoother token distribution. This will create a framework that moves closer to traditional capital markets. Kraken will continue to conduct its own compliance and due diligence reviews before listing tokens. O’Connor stated that, “The next Figma or Reddit won’t IPO. It’ll launch to its community onchain. This partnership is another step toward making that possible.” Kraken has been expanding its product line rapidly during what analysts describe as a more permissive US regulatory climate. Recent expansions include the launch of tokenized stock products in the EU, new perpetuals for retail traders, and the acquisition of trading platform Breakout. Cryptopolitan reported that Kraken is preparing for a public listing by the first quarter of next year. The exchange is working with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to raise up to $1 billion. Kraken Launch is just another milestone for the established exchange as it continues to broaden its business model and reinforce its competitiveness. Get seen where it counts.

This drop makes it the third straight month prices have cooled, and both headline and core inflation are now sitting at that same level. Core inflation, for the record, leaves out the price of fresh food, not because anyone stopped eating, but because it moves too much to be useful for month-to-month analysis. The headline number also came down, falling from 3.1% in July to 2.7% in August, hitting another low not seen since late last year. The “core-core” inflation rate , the one Bank of Japan actually watches when making policy calls, also ticked down — now at 3.3%, after hitting 3.4% in July. That version takes out both fresh food and energy. And if you want to know why this number matters, it’s because it’s the only one they trust to track long-term trends, not just short-term swings. Still, these aren’t big drops. They’re just steady. Bank of Japan holds rates as GDP rises and rice prices slow Rice prices, one of the weirdest but strongest parts of Japan’s inflation problem, finally cooled down a bit. In August, rice inflation was 69.7%, way down from 90.7% in July, but still ridiculously high. People are still paying more for food. No one’s celebrating. But the rate’s drop gave the central bank a little space. The Bank of Japan is making its next rate decision today, and economists in that Reuters survey expect the bank to keep its benchmark policy rate at 0.5%. But some are already calling for change. HSBC analysts, in a note sent out on September 12, said they think the central bank might raise rates by 25 basis points when they meet again in October. The reason? “We believe that the second quarter GDP print, which outperformed market expectations, certainly delivered,” they wrote. They’re referring to Japan’s Q2 GDP, which came in at 0.3% growth quarter-on-quarter, better than the 0.1% expected, and a step up from the revised 0.1% in Q1. The main thing behind it? Exports. The Japanese economy hasn’t exactly been exploding, but it’s showing signs of resilience, and that’s enough for some to think a hike could be coming soon. Trade deal with Trump gives exports relief, Kono pressures BOJ A deal Tokyo reached with Washington in late July gave exporters some breathing room. The U.S. agreed to cut tariffs on Japanese goods to 15%, down from the 25% Donald Trump threatened earlier this year in his “tariff letter.” That deal eased fears in Tokyo, but it didn’t remove all risk. HSBC pointed out that if global trade slows, Japan’s exporters could still feel the pain. Meanwhile, the pressure is rising inside the country too. Taro Kono, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said on September 9 that the BOJ better act fast or prices will keep going up. “If the Bank of Japan delays a rate increase, I think it would mean inflation will continue and everything we import would be higher,” Kono warned. Markets aren’t sitting still either. The Nikkei 225 rose 1.19% on Thursday, hitting a record high for the second straight day. The Topix index also gained 0.84%. Investors are watching the BOJ closely, betting that today’s move — or lack of one — won’t be the last. Over in the bond market, Japan’s 2-year government bond yield climbed to 0.885%, the highest level since June 2008, based on LSEG data. Traders are clearly pricing in a future rate hike. Other markets in Asia moved too. Australia’s ASX/S&P 200 jumped 0.77%. South Korea’s Kospi and Kosdaq were flat at the open. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.4%, and China’s CSI 300 rose 0.13%. Then there’s the wider regional context. The Federal Reserve just cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday and signaled there could be more cuts coming. That move has opened the door for other Asian central banks to follow suit — or get ahead of it. A few already have. The Bank of Korea dropped its rate to a three-year low back in May. Australia’s central bank slashed its rate to a two-year low in August. And India’s central bank cut by 50 basis points in June. All this matters because economies like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore still rely heavily on exports. And despite all the inflation and trade chaos, those three still managed to post better-than-expected GDP growth in Q2. Seoul and Singapore even narrowly dodged technical recessions.

On-chain analytics firm Onchain Lens reported that this wallet had been inactive for nearly two years, making its sudden reactivation a significant signal for traders. According to Arkham Intelligence, the receiving address is shown to be 0x10DF1A308F96a8C653faC87bd161C8A5ae91Dc2b, which traders are closely watching. This shift shows whales moving away from DOGE and potentially targeting other promising meme coins. Here are the top 3 meme coins to buy right now as the market responds to this shift. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The top meme coin to buy The biggest attention grabber in this new meme coin wave is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . It has quickly built a reputation as the meme coin that whales and early investors are rushing toward. Unlike many meme coins that remain vulnerable to bot activity, Little Pepe operates on the only chain where sniper bots cannot interfere, giving fairer opportunities to investors. The project is currently in its twelfth presale stage, with each token selling for $0.0021. Its eleventh stage was sold out earlier than planned, proving that demand is outpacing supply. So far, the presale has already raised an impressive $25.11 million, showing strong confidence in the project’s future. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has also been listed on CoinMarketCap, adding credibility and visibility in the crypto community. Many anonymous experts who have supported some of the most successful meme coins are backing Little Pepe, giving it the type of support that can fuel exponential growth. Market analysts are increasingly pointing to Little Pepe (LILPEPE) as the best meme coin to buy right now. Whales are already shifting capital into the token, and forecasts suggest its price could soar once it lists on major exchanges. Entering the presale stage means investors can secure LILPEPE at a fraction of its projected market value. Adding more excitement, the Little Pepe (LILPEPE) team has launched a mega giveaway between stages 12 and 17 of its presale. The 1st biggest buyer will win 5 ETH, the 2nd biggest buyer 3 ETH, the 3rd biggest buyer 2 ETH, and 15 random buyers will each receive 0.5 ETH. This incentive is attracting more retail participation, further strengthening demand. Its roadmap positions Little Pepe as more than just a meme; it is a movement being “cooked in the cryptowomb” with massive potential to dominate the market. With these foundations in place, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as the number one meme coin to buy during this Dogecoin whale shift. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Strong momentum and breakout signals Following closely is Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), another meme coin gaining strong traction. PENGU’s price has surged 13 percent in the last 24 hours to $0.03475, breaking out of a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. Trading volume has skyrocketed by 300 percent, hitting over $564 million. Meanwhile, open interest rose from $270 million to $310 million, showing heightened participation. PENGU is benefiting from the meme coin hype and strong technical indicators, making it one of the top meme coins to buy. MemeCore (M): Impressive weekly growth The third meme coin on the list is MemeCore (M). Over the last week, it has surged by nearly 194 percent, reaching $1.55 after a 9.3 percent gain in the past 24 hours. The token recently broke through descending wedge resistance, signaling continued upward strength. Trading volume has climbed to $53.7 million, while open interest increased by $10.63 million, showing a surge in retail interest. MemeCore’s consistent performance and strong market activity secure its place as a meme coin to watch closely. Conclusion Among the top three to buy now, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) takes the crown as the top meme coin to buy with its bot-resistant chain, strong presale momentum, and whale participation. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and MemeCore (M) also present solid opportunities, but LILPEPE’s unique advantages and community backing make it the most compelling choice.

In 2025, however, SHIB has struggled to maintain its shine. Trapped within a multi-month trading territory around $0.000012, questions linger about whether Shibarium’s ecosystem can deliver its promises. Amidst Shiba Inu’s struggles, a new meme contender, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , is making waves with a bold new approach, building the first Layer 2 blockchain for memes. With its presale already past $25 million and growing, LILPEPE is proving that the next meme cycle will look very different. Here are three reasons it’s attracting a bigger crowd than SHIB this year. Shiba Inu is stalling while Little Pepe is surging The Shiba Inu price action has been volatile in 2025. Despite a few spikes during broader market breakouts, SHIB has dropped more than 60% from its December highs, and its burn rate has collapsed by over 90%. Shibarium, meant to be SHIB’s growth engine, has failed to generate significant fees or sustain user activity, dampening confidence in the ecosystem. Shiba Inu Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Little Pepe, by contrast, has been accelerating. Its price doubled to $0.0021 in Stage 12 from $0.001 in June, selling 15.5 billion tokens. This rapid rise indicates investor appetite for a meme-focused chain, not another ERC-20 token. While SHIB is battling to regain momentum, Little Pepe is creating it. That difference explains why more new investors are flowing into LILPEPE than Shiba Inu in 2025. A new narrative: Meme Layer 2 vs meme token Shiba Inu grew as a meme token, but its transition into a functional ecosystem has been rocky. Shibarium was pitched as a solution, but has yet to deliver the scalability and token-burning mechanics that investors expected. Little Pepe launches with an entirely new narrative: Meme Layer 2. Instead of trying to retrofit a meme token into a utility chain, it is building a blockchain from the ground up, optimized for meme culture. That means: Ultra-low fees and fast settlement with its zero buy/sell tax model A Meme Launchpad for new projects Bot-proof tech, ensuring sniper bots can’t manipulate launches Little Pepe is positioning itself as the sector leader for this narrative by aligning infrastructure directly with meme coin culture, much like how DeFi and GameFi once defined past bull runs. This fresh angle proves magnetic for investors hungry for the “next big thing.” Community incentives and exchange roadmap Shiba Inu has a large community, but its engagement has weakened in 2025 as holders wait for delayed promises. Little Pepe, meanwhile, is energizing its base with aggressive community-driven rewards. The $777K Giveaway is open to all holders, and a newly launched Mega Giveaway for Stages 12–17 offers more than 15 ETH in prizes to whales and random buyers. These campaigns are maintaining high momentum and onboarding thousands of new participants daily. Additionally, LILPEPE has two top centralized exchange listings confirmed for launch, with a plan already in place to pursue the world’s largest exchange. That gives investors confidence in liquidity, something SHIB had to wait months for during its early days. Why LILPEPE is the smart play over SHIB? Shiba Inu remains one of the better-known meme tokens, but 2025 has exposed cracks in its growth model. Slowing burns, limited Shibarium traction, and falling price action make it harder to convince new investors. On the other hand, Little Pepe is shaping the next meme era with its Layer 2 blockchain for memes, presale momentum, exchange roadmap, and viral community giveaways. That combination explains why LILPEPE is drawing a bigger crowd than SHIB, and why many believe it could be the leading meme play of this cycle.

Now, excitement is shifting to Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a meme-powered Layer-2 that analysts say could deliver Solana-level gains, possibly in just eight weeks. Solana’s journey: A benchmark for crypto wealth Three major factors drove Solana’s meteoric rise: 1. High-Speed, Low-Cost Blockchain – Positioned as an “Ethereum killer,” Solana built an ecosystem capable of supporting NFTs, DeFi, and gaming with ultra-low fees. 2. Community Adoption – Early adopters flocked to the network, creating strong liquidity and network effects. 3. Timing – Launched in a booming cycle, SOL caught the right wave of investor enthusiasm. But here’s the catch: Solana’s explosive 7,200% gain unfolded over five years. For today’s investors seeking faster ROI, the market is shifting attention toward tokens with smaller market caps and higher upside potential. Little Pepe: Solana-level profits on meme speed Unlike most meme coins that rely purely on hype, Little Pepe is engineered for sustainability and utility. It’s more than a meme; it’s a Layer-2 blockchain designed specifically for meme coins, combining viral culture with serious infrastructure. Here’s why analysts believe Little Pepe could compress Solana’s five-year ROI into just two months: Ultra-Low Cap Opportunity – At presale pricing ($0.0021), LILPEPE has enormous upside compared to established giants like SOL. 7,500% Growth Forecast – Projections suggest that early buyers could see 75 times returns once listings go live. Meme Launchpad – The first Layer-2 designed exclusively for meme tokens, ensuring constant demand and activity. Sniper-Bot Resistant—Unlike Ethereum and Solana launches, exploitative bots will not hijack new tokens. CertiK Audit Score : 95.49% – A level of security rarely seen in meme projects. While Solana earned its reputation through speed and scalability, Little Pepe is building the fastest and cheapest chain for memes —a narrative with proven mass appeal. Presale momentum: The window is closing The LILPEPE presale has already raised over $25 million, with Stage 12 nearly sold out at $0.0021 per token. In the next stage, the price increase is projected to set investor gains even before launch, at $0.0022. Only a few recognized their value in the early days of Ethereum and Solana, and listings led to astronomical growth. Those who hesitated missed out on life-changing wealth. Tokenomics that protect holders Unlike meme projects plagued by poor planning, LILPEPE features structured tokenomics designed for long-term sustainability: 26.5% Presale – Rewarding early supporters. 30% Chain Reserves – Ensuring blockchain stability. 10% Liquidity – Smooth exchange trading. 13.5% Staking & Rewards – Incentivizing diamond hands. 10% Marketing – Driving virality with influencer campaigns and strategic branding. 10% DEX Allocation – Ready for decentralized exchange listings. 0% Tax – No hidden costs, fully DeFi aligned. This distribution reflects balance: community-driven, liquidity-ready, and growth-focused. Why 8 weeks could be all it takes The difference between Solana and Little Pepe lies in the speed of adoption. Solana needed years to build its ecosystem; Little Pepe launches with: Exchange Listings Already Confirmed – Two top-tier centralized exchanges at launch. Insider Hints of the Largest Global Exchange – Potentially the same catalyst that helped SHIB explode in 2021. Massive Community Energy – A presale community of tens of thousands, already generating viral buzz. Analysts suggest that LILPEPE could reach $0.15 to $0.20 when trading goes live within weeks. That would transform a $2,500 presale investment into over $183,000, replicating Solana’s five-year ROI in just eight weeks. Meme culture + utility = The perfect storm Dogecoin and Shiba Inu proved that memes alone can make millionaires. Solana proved that Layer-1 blockchains can scale adoption. Little Pepe combines both: the virality of memes and the infrastructure of blockchain utility. That’s a recipe for accelerated adoption, faster than anything we’ve seen in the history of crypto. Final thoughts: Don’t be late again If you missed Solana at $0.20 or Ethereum under $50, you know the pain of watching others turn modest investments into fortunes. With Little Pepe (LILPEPE), investors are given a second chance that could compress years of growth into weeks. 👉 Check out the presale at [LittlePepe.com], join the Telegram , and secure your spot before LILPEPE hits the exchanges.

That beat its old intraday high of 2,466.49, set back on November 25, 2024. It was also about to close above its previous record of 2,442.74, untouched since 2021. The rebound came after months of pressure tied to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs, which had pulled the index down hard back in April. According to data from Bloomberg, this is a full comeback for the small-cap index, which has now bounced roughly 42% from its April 7 low. That April drop came when Trump’s sweeping trade policies spooked global investors, who quickly started dumping anything tied to risk. Small caps took the hit first. But the return of easier Fed policy helped flip the mood. While the S&P 500 usually falls in September, it’s up more than 2.5% so far this month. That’s not typical. Over the last 75 years, it usually drops 0.7% on average during September. This year’s different. Lower rates are keeping the rally alive. Nvidia’s $5 billion Intel deal sends shock across markets The Nasdaq 100 jumped 1% Thursday, led by tech stocks. Nvidia threw down $5 billion into Intel, giving the struggling chipmaker its biggest single-day boost in a while. Intel popped 23%, pulling the whole sector higher. The Russell 2000 followed, adding 2.5% by close. At the same time, FedEx brought its full-year earnings outlook back, a move traders took as a green light to keep buying. Jobless claims also dropped more than expected, the biggest fall in almost four years. That erased earlier gains in the bond market and signaled that companies aren’t laying people off. That’s more fuel for the bulls. Robert Schein, chief investment officer at Blanke Schein Wealth Management, said, “The Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates during a time when stocks are at record highs and the economy is still growing.” That combo, no Fed hawkish shock and solid economic numbers, is keeping people in the market. Traders eye next move as Russell 2000 breaks out Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said the lack of any negative Fed surprises and the start of another rate-cut cycle could cancel out seasonal selling. And for once, September doesn’t look like a landmine. There’s growing confidence the Fed will cut rates by another 75 basis points by Q1 2026. Back to small caps, Matt Maley from Miller Tabak said he’s watching the Russell 2000 more closely than big tech right now. “If they can break above that level in a significant way over the next week or two, it should be very bullish,” Matt said. “If, however, they fail at this level (or slightly above it), it’s going to be quite bearish.” In other words, what happens next with small caps could set the tone for the broader market. While some traders keep talking about a bubble, especially in the S&P 500, others aren’t sold. The top five tech stocks (yes, the usual megacap suspects) have done most of the heavy lifting this year. But their profit growth is still holding up. Critics say it’s a dangerous setup, but there’s no crash yet. Some investors are still underweight on stocks, waiting for better entry points. Others are phasing back in, buying the dips and picking sectors they like. Robert says tech and financials could both benefit from lower rates; tech from valuations, and banks from more mortgage and M&A activity. Meanwhile, data shows the S&P 500 has dropped about 1% on average every September since 1971. But when the Fed’s cutting and the economy’s still standing, it’s different. The index has actually gained 1.2% in those situations.

At the time, the total market cap had sunk below $800 billion. Now, the market has grown 5x, surpassing $3.9 trillion. With the market booming, many undervalued coins are quietly building momentum and offering investors asymmetric upside. Here are four undervalued coins to invest in amid this boom. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme infrastructure with asymmetric upside Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presents a distinct approach from the norm. It’s a Layer-2 meme-focused layer two that prioritizes ultra-low fees, near-instant settlement, and anti-sniper protections. These features may materially reduce the launch-day chaos that has punished earlier meme tokens. Its built-in launchpad, Pepe’s Pump Pad, channels new token launches back into the ecosystem. This infrastructure backing has attracted investors seeking meme coins that don’t just capitalize on hype. The broad interest in Little Pepe is evident in the presale. As of today, the presale is in stage 13. Twelve stages are behind it, and only four are left. The project has raised $25,475,000 in stage twelve, with 15.75 billion tokens sold. The project is supported by meme veterans who have a history of backing prominent meme coins. Their expertise is not just talk. It’s reflected in the project’s roadmap. Currently, Little Pepe has secured a listing on CoinMarketCap, giving it credibility. Two CEXs have already been confirmed ahead of launch. Also, the project’s code has passed the test, passing a Freshcoin and Certik audit with high scores above 95%. Little Pepe combines both narrative and product, and this duality could produce outsized returns if network effects take hold. More launches will lead to more transactions, ultimately resulting in increased demand for LILPEPE. With giveaways driving attention to the presale, Little Pepe has the community backing it needs to scale at launch. For investors seeking asymmetric exposure to meme-driven upside with a stronger technical foundation, Little Pepe may be worth monitoring. Avalanche (AVAX): Institutional moves spark undervalued upside Avalanche (AVAX) is drawing serious attention right now. The Avalanche Foundation is structuring two U.S.-based treasury vehicles with Hivemind Capital and Dragonfly. It’s aiming to raise $1 billion in AVAX token purchases at a discount. AVAX/USD 1 week Price Chart | Source: TradingView This suggests strong institutional demand and potential supply removal from markets. On the technical side, AVAX recently broke out of a 213-day consolidation, with analyst EllioTrades pointing to possible targets north of $50. While AVAX trades significantly below those projected levels, its institutional signal and discount entry make it one of the more asymmetric bets among layer-1s right now. Arbitrum (ARB): Layer-2 dominance comes with upside discount ARB is showing clear signs of being undervalued right now. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged past $19.2 billion, the highest among Ethereum layer-2s. It processed over 2.16 billion transactions, with active wallets exceeding 1.45 million. ARB/USD 1 week Price Chart|Source: TradingView Earlier this week, the Arbitrum DAO launched an $80 million DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP) to boost lending, stablecoin flows, and user retention. This signals both product momentum and growing ecosystem utility. Analysts tracking on-chain metrics and whale accumulation note that ARB remains stuck below its $0.58 resistance while support at $0.47 holds, creating a favorable setup for a breakout. For investors seeking exposure to Ethereum’s scaling future, with upside unlocked by adoption and funding flows, Arbitrum now looks like a “discounted infrastructure bet” rather than just another speculative L2. Sui (SUI): Emerging Layer-1 with undervalued momentum SUI is trading around $3.30–$3.40, with a market cap near US$12B. However, many analysts see it as undervalued given its ecosystem strength. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surpassed $2.1B, driven by DEXs like Cetus and Bluefin. Daily active addresses also hit a three-month high of 3.5 million in August, showing increasing real usage. SUI/USD 1 week Price Chart|Source: TradingView Institutional signals are strong. SUIG (Sui Group Holdings) recently expanded its treasury to 101.8M SUI tokens. This signals long-term confidence and potentially reduces pressure on the circulating supply. Also, a whale wallet opened a leveraged long in SUI (868,196 tokens), aligning with bullish sentiment among large holders. Technicals show SUI is above its 200-day SMA, with resistance near US$3.85–$4.44. Given its strong fundamentals, infrastructure advancements, and current institutional accumulation, SUI appears to be an asymmetric bet with room to run if momentum continues. Conclusion The global crypto market has grown fivefold since 2022, yet some tokens remain overlooked despite clear signals of strength. Little Pepe is leading the charge as a community-driven project with explosive upside. Following Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Sui, it appears that scalability, institutional adoption, and expanding ecosystems can still be achieved at a discount. With a price that doesn’t yet reflect its true potential, they stand out as the best tokens to invest in now. Little Pepe’s presale is still ongoing, providing investors with an opportunity to enter before the price discovery. Visit littlepepe.com to join the presale today.

Ethereum’s ETF-driven strength has triggered a broad altcoin revival, paving the way for emerging names to capture capital flows. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a focal point, smashing through $13.5 million raised from over 13,000 investors. With market analysts flagging whispers of potential 10,000% ROI, it has quickly shifted from a niche community play into a mainstream talking point of this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE presale highlights MAGACOIN FINANCE just smashed $13.5M raised, fueling retail hype as analysts rank it the best crypto presale of 2025. With whispers of 10,000% ROI, FOMO is driving thousands to pile in before listings. More than 75% of its allocation has already sold out, signaling how rapidly capital is rotating into high-upside tokens during this stage of the market. The pace of accumulation has been reinforced by meme coin communities like DOGE and RENDER, as well as whale wallets making six-figure entries. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is not just the headline number but the structure behind it. The team deployed a multi-phase token allocation model that rewards early entrants with lower costs while tightening supply at each stage. With a confirmed listing price of $0.007, analysts suggest this model provides a near-term catalyst as scarcity meets swelling demand. This mix of viral buzz and structured tokenomics has amplified its appeal, positioning it as the frontrunner among 2025’s altcoin launches. Why analysts call it 2025’s best presale Analysts emphasize that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s strength lies in its investor-friendly design and market timing. The Ethereum-based token benefits from both a secure backbone and a community narrative that aligns with retail culture. Its zero-tax smart contract and dual audits provide additional assurance at a time when trust remains a key factor for presale participants. Beyond the technicals, whale signals are telling. Transactions as high as 73 ETH (≈$133,000) have been recorded, reflecting deep conviction among big-ticket investors. This combination of grassroots hype and institutional-style entries is rare, and it explains why research desks are beginning to include MAGACOIN FINANCE in their lists of must-watch early assets. With exchange listings expected soon, momentum could spill over into price discovery phases quickly, historically one of the most powerful triggers for post-launch surges. Recent events and the altcoin revival The backdrop could not be more favorable. After years of sluggish performance, altcoins are resurging thanks to regulatory improvements across the US and Europe, alongside an influx of institutional capital into Ethereum ETFs. Analysts note that once ETH breaks higher, capital often rotates into “next-tier” opportunities that combine narrative strength with affordability. This year’s rotation has spotlighted a variety of projects beyond MAGACOIN FINANCE. BlockDAG, BlockchainFX, BullZilla, Maxi Doge, and Remittix have all gained traction, benefiting from scarcity-driven economics and strong presale buzz. Still, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s viral magnetism has made it particularly effective at pulling in retail liquidity, making it the benchmark against which other early launches are measured. The alignment of macro tailwinds and grassroots demand means altcoin-focused portfolios are finally seeing fresh upside for the first time in years. Outlook for 2025 Analyst consensus suggests the altcoin season of 2025 is just beginning, and MAGACOIN FINANCE could become its emblematic breakout. With projections of up to 11,000% ROI, exchange-driven momentum, and a rapidly closing presale window, urgency has gripped retail audiences. Timing is critical, as the final allocations are nearly depleted, leaving latecomers scrambling to secure entry before open-market trading begins. At the sector level, better regulations, stronger liquidity, and increasing institutional participation underpin confidence that this cycle will produce several outsized winners. But within that basket, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the story of altcoin—already leading capital raised in 2025 and drawing the type of FOMO-driven retail crowds that historically fuel explosive rallies. Final thoughts: MAGACOIN FINANCE leads the charge The broader crypto market revival has set the stage for new stars, and MAGACOIN FINANCE currently sits at the center of that narrative. With more than $13.5M raised, whales and retail investors aligned, and strong fundamentals backing the hype, its trajectory has become difficult to ignore. For those watching from the sidelines, the window is closing fast. As exchange listings approach and capital continues to pour into altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents one of the few high-upside early assets positioned to ride both institutional flows and retail frenzy.

Australia has also granted regulatory relief to stablecoin intermediaries, exempting them from holding separate financial services licenses when distributing these assets. Uniform Standards In Stablecoin Regulation During a speech at an international central bank conference on payments, Deputy Governor Chiara Scotti highlighted the importance of clarity in regulations, particularly concerning stablecoins issued by entities in different jurisdictions. She urged the European Commission to provide guidance on whether stablecoins issued by licensed European Union (Eu) firms could be considered interchangeable with those from non-EU counterparts under a multi-issuance model. Scotti’s remarks come amid ongoing discussions about the regulatory framework for stablecoins in the European Union. She noted that while the EU has established regulations through the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), concerns remain regarding the financial stability risks posed by cross-border issuance. She believes that this model could lead to complications, especially if non-EU issuers face redemption requests from EU holders, potentially creating a mismatch between obligations and reserves. The Deputy Governor pointed out that although a multi-issuance model could enhance global liquidity and scalability, it also introduces significant legal and operational challenges. In her view, it is crucial to restrict stablecoin issuance to jurisdictions that uphold equivalent regulatory standards in consumer protection, transparency, and crisis management. New Class Relief From ASIC In a related development, Australia has taken steps to foster growth in its digital assets sector. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) recently announced class relief for intermediaries involved in the secondary distribution of stablecoins issued by licensed Australian financial services providers. According to the regulator’s statement issued on Thursday as well, this regulatory relief exempts these intermediaries from the need to obtain separate licenses when distributing eligible stablecoins, streamlining the process while ensuring that consumer protections remain in place. ASIC’s initiative is aimed at facilitating innovation in digital asset markets. However, intermediaries benefiting from this exemption are required to provide clients with product disclosure statements for the stablecoins they distribute, reinforcing the importance of transparency. The statement further reads: ASIC is committed to supporting responsible innovation in the rapidly evolving digital assets space, while ensuring important consumer protections are in place by having eligible stablecoins issued under an AFS licence. The relief will take effect once registered on the Federal Registration of Legislation.

The fund performs more in line with Solana than competing products that are either closed-end or C-Corp structures. Solana is a compelling buy with a top 3 stablecoin footprint among public chains and a lower price to fees multiple than Ethereum or BNB. As we approach the potential approval of US-listed spot Solana ( SOL-USD ) ETFs in mid-October, there are a variety of different ways traders may look to speculate on a positive outcome for the US market. One such product is the Solana ETF ( SOLZ ) from Volatility Shares. Unlike most of the other products in the market, SOLZ is a futures-based ETF and has no direct exposure to the underlying asset. In this article, we'll look at the fund details for SOLZ, compare it to alternative products, and assess whether Solana could be an outperforming token in the Digital Asset market at this juncture. Fund Details SOLZ Holdings (Volatility Shares) Launched in March, the Solana ETF from Volatility Shares is a futures-based product that allows traders/investors to get exposure to the price of the SOL token through an easy-to-buy ETF wrapper. The fund has over $231 million in AUM which makes it larger than SOL-proxy products that have been in the market for a longer period of time. Fund Assets $231.7 million Shares Outstanding 9,070,000 Expense Ratio 1.15% Fund Inception 03/10/2025 Source: Volatility Shares, as of 9/16/25 One quick note on the expense ratio: the 1.15% figure is currently discounted by Volatility Shares for the first year of trading and the net expense ratio is currently 0.95%. As of market close on September 17th, the fund shares have a net asset value of $25.54 per share and a closing price of $25.55. For all intents and purposes, this fund trades generally at or close to NAV. This is important because, as we'll see in the next section, not all SOL-proxies can claim this. Peer Comparison Despite the lack of a spot ETF currently, there are several ways investors and traders can play the Solana price in a traditional brokerage account. For the purpose of comparison, we'll be looking at SOLZ relative to the following: Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) Osprey Solana Trust ( OSOL ) REX-Osprey SOL+Staking ETF ( SSK ) Each of the SOL-based products above offers investors exposure to the asset, but they function slightly differently. This table below shows differences in market cap, fees, and structure: Solana Exposure Expense Ratio Market Cap Structure Native Yield? Solana ETF 0.95% $211.83M Futures Fund No REX-Osprey SOL 1.40% $273.34M C-Corp Yes Grayscale Solana Trust 2.50% $62.37M Closed end No Osprey Solana Trust 2.50% $30.33M Closed End No Sources: Seeking Alpha, fund managers The big benefit of a fund like REX Shares-Osprey versus the alternative is it offers investors the ability to have exposure to staked-Solana for native yield. This is important because Solana currently has an inflation rate of 4.9% and staking yield rate of 6.8%. None of the funds mentioned offer shareholders the ability to redeem the assets underlying the fund shares. Given this, one would think the REX-Osprey fund has the best total return after fees. Yet, since the inception of that fund on July 1st, it is actually GSOL that is beating the rest of the pack: Solana Products (Seeking Alpha) Since July 1st, GSOL has had a 69% total return versus a 39% total return for SSK. At 55%, SOLZ has been the closest to the true performance of Solana, by far. The outperformance of GSOL and the underperformance of OSOL are due to the closed end nature of how those products are structured. OSOL vs GSOL NAV Rate YTD as of 9/17/25 (Osprey/Grayscale, Analyst's Chart) The chart above shows the year to date trend in premium/discount to NAV for both funds. Interestingly, they traded at relatively close premiums through the first four months of the year. That changed in May when OSOL started trading at a discount and GSOL continued trending toward a higher premium. The biggest reason why GSOL has outperformed SOLZ is simply because the premium has increased from essentially NAV break-even on July 2nd to a 13% premium as of July 17th. In my view, this makes GSOL a 'sell' relative to funds like SOLZ or OSOL and I've argued that several times in the past . Solana Still Looks Good As a digital asset worth exploring, Solana actually looks pretty good from where I sit. Last month, I argued that Solana would be the next big DAT winner and so far I think that thesis is holding up well. Data by YCharts Since my Solana article on August 28th, SOL has appreciated by more than 20%. This is better than Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and Ripple/XRP ( XRP-USD ); each of which have larger market caps than SOL. Stablecoin Supply (DeFi Llama) In the all important stablecoin race, Solana has the third largest supply of stablecoins minted on the blockchain. With the exception of Tron ( TRX-USD ) which trades a minuscule 7x circulating fees multiple, Solana is the cheapest of the major smart contract chains by circulating P/F with large stablecoin supplies: L1 P/F Comparison (Token Terminal) At an average circulating P/F multiple of 237x in September, Solana is far cheaper than Ethereum or BNB Chain ( BNB-USD ) even though it has more daily active addresses, does more daily transactions, and is comparable in fees. To be sure, Ethereum has a larger stablecoin supply and processes more stablecoin transactions. Still, as an altcoin with a favorable setup, I think Solana is in a good position. Summary I'm of the view that now is a good time to maintain a long SOL position. I take that view for two reasons: first, Solana is a high throughput, fast, cheap chain that maintains a top 3 stablecoin footprint in the public blockchain space. Second, it's cheap relative to major peers and has a DAT bid that I believe is just getting started. I wouldn't overweight it against something like Ethereum, but I do think it's a coin to overweight against Bitcoin. I've said for several months that I think Bitcoin's cycle top is either close to current levels or already in . As I see it, major alts like ETH and SOL are good hedges against that thesis. In the event I'm wrong about Bitcoin being at or near its peak, I suspect the large alts will outperform. If I'm correct that Bitcoin is at or near cycle peak, I think coins with strong utility will weather the storm better than those that are purely speculative. I put Solana in the utility category. As far as playing the Solana bull thesis, I think SOLZ will work perfectly fine until there is a spot ETF in the United States. At that point, I would expect it to underperform. For those who want SOL access through a traditional brokerage, I'm going to initiate SOLZ with a 'buy.'",SOL-USD|SOLZ,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-19 03:10:24

The deal, first reported by CNBC, was paid for using a mix of cash and stock, and closed last week. Rochan is now officially on Nvidia’s payroll. Nvidia now owns access to Enfabrica’s hardware tech, the kind that can hook up 100,000 GPUs to work together like one brain. The details line up with what we’ve seen across Big Tech this year, so this is Nvidia copying the same recruiting blueprint that Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have used to scoop up AI talent without triggering regulatory headaches. Enfabrica was founded in 2019, with its selling point being infrastructure; building the data plumbing that lets GPU clusters run like one unified machine, which is exactly what Nvidia wants. The company’s newest systems don’t just run one chip at a time. They run 72 GPUs in tall racks, all working together. That’s the setup going into the $4 billion data center in Wisconsin that Microsoft just announced. This is all part of Nvidia’s bigger play to sell complete AI systems, and the company is actually already invested in Enfabrica during a $125 million Series B round in 2023, led by Atreides Management. The startup didn’t give a dollar value for its valuation, but said it was five times bigger than it had been during its previous round, per CNBC’s report . Rochan’s move to Nvidia follows a string of similar acqui-hire deals in the AI space. In June, Meta paid $14.3 billion to get Alexandr Wang, the founder of Scale AI, and took a 49% stake in the company. One month later, Varun Mohan, the co-founder of coding startup Windsurf, joined Google in a $2.4 billion deal, which also included licensing terms. Google also acquired the team behind Character.AI last year. Microsoft grabbed Inflection, and Amazon got Adept. Nvidia also closed a $700 million purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli company whose technology helps software makers optimize their infrastructure for AI. Nvidia moves money without buying entire companies Even though Nvidia’s chips are everywhere in the AI world, it hasn’t been on a shopping spree. The company’s only billion-dollar acquisition was back in 2019, when it paid $6.9 billion for Israeli chip designer Mellanox. The networking tech from Mellanox still powers Nvidia’s latest Blackwell lineup. Nvidia did try to buy Arm for $40 billion, but regulators blocked it in 2022. In the last year, it bought Run:ai, a Tel Aviv-based startup, for $700 million. The company helps developers manage and optimize GPU usage for AI applications. Just this week, Nvidia said it had taken a $5 billion stake in Intel, and confirmed that both companies will now build AI processors together. It also revealed a fresh $700 million investment in Nscale, a British startup focused on data center tech. Two years ago, Nvidia was pushing toward a $1 trillion valuation. Now, it’s worth over $4.28 trillion, a quadruple jump since 2023.

The clash broke into public view last week as the twins prepared their company Gemini Space Station for its market debut, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. The feud came to light when Brian posted private messages from Tyler on X. In those messages, Tyler raged over what he called years of pressure from the Biden administration on Gemini and demanded help from Trump’s nominee. “7 years of lawfare trophy hunting. It’s outrageous what they did to us,” Tyler wrote in July. Winklevoss brothers flex political muscle in Washington The 44-year-old twins have poured millions into Trump’s comeback and into pro-crypto groups that want friendlier regulators. They are determined to see the CFTC steered by someone who will ease the rules on crypto. But instead of supporting Brian, a Republican with backing from many industry groups, the brothers are fighting him. Critics were quick to call it personal. Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said , “It’s a total temper tantrum. This is about wanting revenge and wanting to punish people…It’s not necessarily about policy going forward.” The fight caught attention because Brian has been known as pro-crypto, yet the brothers still chose to go after him. The twins have always thrived on conflict. At Harvard, they sued Mark Zuckerberg, accusing him of stealing their idea for Facebook, a story later told in “The Social Network.” They walked away with $65 million in cash and stock. They later bet big on bitcoin, buying in 2012 when the price was below $10. In 2013, they tried to launch the first bitcoin ETF, but the SEC blocked them. Their exchange Gemini, founded in 2014, was supposed to cement their place in the industry. The IPO last week raised $425 million, leaving them with about 75 million shares and 94.7% of the voting power. But after an initial pop, shares fell more than 20% and dropped below the $28 IPO price. The exchange has struggled in recent quarters, losing money while larger players like Coinbase dominate. Trump allies build new networks as nomination stalls The brothers are keeping their political connections close as Gemini weathers losses. Last year they gave Trump’s presidential campaign direct backing. They also handed nearly $5 million to a pro-crypto group that spent on Congressional races. Just last month, they gave $21 million worth of bitcoin to Digital Freedom Fund, a new super PAC built to support crypto and Trump. Trump has made his feelings known. At a bitcoin event last year, he called the twins “male models with a big, beautiful brain,” a moment that marked his turn from doubter to strong supporter of crypto. Earlier this year, the twins teamed up with White House crypto czar David Sacks, Donald Trump Jr., and other investors to start a private D.C. club called Executive Branch. It charges a $500,000 entry fee and ongoing dues, making it one of the priciest political hangouts in town. As for Brian, his path to the CFTC has hit a block. The White House is weighing other names as confirmation slows. On the table are Michael Selig, chief legal counsel for the SEC’s crypto task force, and Tyler Williams, who advises Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and once worked at Galaxy Digital. Both men have crypto backgrounds and are now in the mix to take the chair instead. The Winklevoss brothers’ campaign has left Washington wondering why two of Trump’s richest allies are so determined to sink one of his nominees. Their actions have put pressure on the White House and created another layer of uncertainty around who will end up controlling the CFTC at a time when crypto regulation is already at the center of national politics.

The license—issued by New York’s Department of Financial Services—had been the last major roadblock standing in the way of Bullish’s U.S. expansion. CEO Tom Farley confirmed the approval Wednesday on the company’s first earnings call since going public. Tom said the company had already received regulatory clearance to operate in many U.S. states but refused to open for business nationally until it got this specific license from New York. “While we have already had the ability to operate in many states because of our regulatory approval, we refrained from launching our exchange in the United States until we received the New York State Department of Financial Services BitLicense,” he said. “We received that license yesterday, and we look forward to bringing our exchange and our leading liquidity to the United States imminently, and we believe this to be the largest geographic market by far.” Analysts push up price targets after U.S. approval Bullish is already licensed in Germany and Hong Kong, and its exchange is built for institutional clients, not retail traders. With New York checked off, the company now holds three major regulatory licenses across the biggest crypto jurisdictions. Bullish also owns crypto news site CoinDesk. Its public market debut came just last month after a long wait. Bullish had originally tried to go public through a SPAC merger in 2021, but the deal was killed after regulators started poking around. This time, it listed through a standard IPO, setting its price at $37 per share on August 14. After Thursday’s jump, shares are trading nearly 75% higher than that IPO level. The company also reported its second quarter earnings on Wednesday. Revenue hit $57 million, down slightly from $60.7 million in the same period a year ago. But earnings per share came in at $0.93, a full reversal from a $1.03 loss last year. Analysts didn’t waste time reacting. Ed Engel, analyst at Compass Point, raised his price target from $45 to $56, noting they had only given a 50% chance of New York granting the license. Ed’s rating on the stock remains Neutral. Over at Bernstein, Gautam Chhugani said Bullish’s expansion into the U.S. will be a “key growth catalyst for the coming quarters.” He also pointed out the company now holds multiple tier 1 licenses, adding that “Bullish now holds multiple tier 1 regulatory licenses (German BaFin, Hong Kong SFC and U.S BitLicense) across major crypto markets, strengthening its positioning as global regulated institutional crypto exchange.” Gautam’s target is $60, with a Market Perform rating. Bullish is now one of a small group of crypto companies that have gone public in 2025. That group includes Gemini (GEMI), Circle (CRCL), and eToro (ETOR).

Traders looking at crypto charts are wondering whether ADA can go up a lot in value right now, particularly because investors are becoming more cautious due to worries over why crypto is plummeting. With the buzz over memecoins dying down and classic blue-chip altcoins reaching maturity, investors are seeking crypto investments that will provide them more returns than they put in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a next-generation DeFi protocol that is quietly getting a lot of attention. It is now in Phase 6 of its presale and costs $0.035, which is the type of potential that many traders are looking for. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) mechanics and growth potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and stablecoin platform designed to deliver tangible value to users while keeping the system stable. Overcollateralized borrowing is its main characteristic. This lets people get cash without having to liquidate their underlying assets. In the ecosystem, stablecoins may only be made using permitted collateral like ETH, SOL, AVAX, or bluechip tokens. When loans are paid back or liquidated, the stablecoins are instantly burnt. Governance-driven interest rates keep the $1 peg stable, while arbitrage mechanisms and liquidation incentives make sure the protocol is both secure and solvent. The system also includes mtToken staking with MUTM payouts that come from buybacks. In MUTM, depositors may receive mtToken staking rewards by giving stablecoins or bluechip tokens. The platform’s income supports open-market buybacks of MUTMs, which keeps demand for the token steady. P2C lending accepts institutional capital and stablecoins, whereas P2P lending pools handle more volatile cryptocurrencies like DOGE, SHIB, FLOKI, and PEPE. The amount of collateral you may use depends on how volatile the asset is. For example, highly liquid stable assets can have up to 75% LTV, whereas volatile tokens can only have 35–42%. Liquidation thresholds and reserve factors between 10% and 42% keep all pools solvent, which protects both borrowers and depositors from the danger of contagion. The presale momentum shows how popular MUTM is. Phase 6 has brought in $16million, and 42% of the tokens that were available have been sold to more than 16,400 people. The next step will raise the price to $0.040, which will reward those who got in early and make new investors feel like they need to act quickly. The beta launch will let anyone in the community use Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s borrowing, lending, and staking functions directly. Expected exchange listings and multi-chain growth will also make the currency more liquid and popular. Investment case and security confidence When it comes to investing, MUTM is a far better option than ADA. At $0.035 today, a $1,000 investment will get you 28,600 tokens. If MUTM trades at $0.21 by Q1 2026, the stake will be valued at more than $6,000, which is a 500% return. ADA, on the other hand, would have to rise from its current $0.40 to $2.40 to get equal gains. This would take a lot longer because of its current negative tendencies and slower adoption cycles. Early investors who bought in at the lower presale rounds are already seeing significant gains, which supports the token’s development path. The argument for MUTM is much stronger because of security and trustworthiness. The platform has been audited by CertiK, getting a score of 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet. There is also a $50,000 bug bounty program that encourages people to submit bugs of all severity levels, from $200 to $2,000. Also, a $100,000 giveaway that is still happening gives ten early entrants $10,000 each in MUTM, which encourages people to use the service and become involved in the community. The roadmap for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is meant to help the company expand by giving it real goals to reach. Phase 1 was all about audits, presales, an AI helpdesk, and listings on the platform. Phase 2 is all about developing the main smart contracts and the DApp. Phase 3 finishes up testing and audits, and Phase 4 will turn on the entire live platform with institutional partnerships and support for many chains. These planned changes will make the token more useful in the real world and bring in more users, which will raise demand for MUTM and push the token toward its expected upside. ADA is going down, and memecoins are losing power. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a structured, utility-driven alternative. Its stablecoin ecosystem, staking rewards, and risk-managed loan pools provide investors a clear way to make 500% profits by the first quarter of 2026. This is a great chance for anyone who is wondering what crypto to purchase right now. Even if the overall market is still tough on conventional assets, MUTM’s architecture makes it likely to do better than rivals that aren’t moving and provide early investors with good returns.

The Sätra Brunn well is one of Sweden’s oldest and best-preserved natural spring water wells, located in a 324-year-old Swedish village. Every water source added to the network will be measured according to the pedigree and based on the foundations of the historically reliable Satra Brunn natural spring, a well that has endured since the 18th century. The Satra Brunn well secures the first 66 million liters of the annually replenished mineral water supply, starting in January 2027, for the next 150 years. Each liter of water secured in the Satra Brunn well is fully backed by a corresponding Water150 token, issued on the Ethereum blockchain by the Longhouse Water S.A., a Luxembourg public limited liability company. Hence, the first batch of 66 million Water150 tokens to enter circulation will fully back the annual supply from the Satra Brunn well. The project uses blockchain technology as a barrierless and transparent ecosystem to connect users to naturally filtered, high-quality, and sustainably managed drinking water for at least 150 years, starting in 2027. The amount of Water150 tokens in circulation is a verifiable measure of the volume of annual water flow available within the ecosystem, audited by independent third parties. The W150 token is one of the first real-world asset (RWA) utility tokens to get the full approval of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the body responsible for the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), a cryptocurrency regulatory standard recognized and adopted throughout Europe. Water150 is building a global network of 1,000 premium mineral water sources like Satra Brunn, managed according to the high standards of the Longhouse Water Quality Standard (in line with WHO, FDA, and Swedish National Food Administration recommendations) for purity and sustainability. The tests will be according to ISO 17025, the international standard for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories. At full strength, the 210 billion Water150 tokens in circulation will back the corresponding quantity of water reserved annually for at least the next 150 years, starting in January 2027. According to the Water150 whitepaper published on July 25th, each W150 token automatically issues 1 DROP voucher per year via its smart contract, redeemable for 1 liter of premium spring water within the same year, for at least 150 years starting January 1, 2027. Redemption uses and burns the DROP voucher but does not affect the W150 token, ensuring ongoing access rights. Token holders can opt for self-tapping at certified wells or pay for bottling/distribution at competitive rates, with the process beginning in 2027. “When we set out the roadmap for Water150, every step was based on concepts and visions because no one else has done anything like this, nor at this magnitude, on the blockchain. However, we found the perfect balance when we tethered our futuristic visions to the historical anchor that is the Satra Brunn well. The plan moving forward is to add water sources that build on that legacy and standard to the point that every Water150 token holder has the assurance of quality and security, whether at this early stage of one historic spring or when we have a global reserve of 1,000 wells.” About Water150: Water150 is an innovative blockchain-based project created by the Longhouse Foundation, aimed at securing access to premium spring water through a secure, tokenized ecosystem. Led by Longhouse Water150 S.A. in Luxembourg, it connects certified wells—starting with historic sources like Sätra Brunn—to a network of 1,000 springs, managed under the rigorous Longhouse Water Quality Standard for purity and sustainability. Water150 empowers users to secure long-term water rights, fostering a transparent, 150-year vision of hydration backed by real-world assets.

51957485,https://invezz.com/?p=2888823,1758253470,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"ETH, BTC still safe to invest, yet traders claim MUTM could outperform both with 32x ROI",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/19/eth-btc-still-safe-to-invest-yet-traders-claim-mutm-could-outperform-both-with-32x-roi/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are still the most important cryptocurrencies, giving investors protection and long-term stability in markets that are hard to predict. These big projects generally benefit from crypto ETFs and institutional interest, which makes them even safer. But crypto forecasts say that both BTC and ETH are reaching maturity, which means that they are less likely to rise quickly than they did in their early cycles. More and more traders are looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi token that is now in its presale phase. Analysts now think it might generate up to 32x ROI by the first quarter of 2026. The way Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set up makes it possible for a new kind of utility-driven growth that standard cryptocurrencies can’t match. The platform has a decentralized stablecoin environment where loans are backed by more than one asset, such as ETH, SOL, AVAX, and ADA. When you pay back or sell stablecoins that were made with these assets, they are instantly burnt. Interest rates established by the government maintain the $1 peg. The system stays sustainable and appealing to both borrowers and lenders because of arbitrage dynamics and strict liquidation rules. Users who stake mtTokens get MUTM payouts that come from revenue and buybacks. This creates a self-reinforcing demand loop that helps the token value go up and gives investors confidence. Presale momentum and structural advantages driving MUTM growth Phase 6 of the MUTM presale shows that the token might be used early on. With a price of $0.035, 42% of this phase has been sold, bringing in $16 million from more than 16,400 investors. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, which is a 15% increase and the last chance for early-stage users to get a discount. This presale momentum shows that there is a lot of demand for the token, which means that investors are seeing the token’s unique growth mechanisms before the market as a whole does. Because of its structural benefits, MUTM is expected to expand 32x faster than BTC or ETH. Reserve factors gather interest from borrowers, which creates a safety net that supports treasury-backed incentives tied to mtToken staking rewards. A strong oracle architecture that includes Chainlink feeds, backup oracles, and on-chain DEX TWAP integration is needed for price discovery. This makes sure that values stay correct and can’t be changed by the market. When the market is volatile, liquidity-aware liquidation mechanisms keep the system secure. This lets liquidators make money while keeping user funds safe. This foundation makes MUTM more stable than other high-risk tokens, which gives investors both safety and a lot of room for growth. Future catalysts are in place to speed up growth. The beta platform will go live when the presale is over, giving early users a useful tool. Layer-2 integration will make transactions quicker and cheaper, which will bring in more users and improve their experience. Also, expected top-tier exchange listings would make it easier for more people and businesses to experience the service. These changes make real milestones that support the 32x growth estimate and provide a clear route for the value of the tokens to go up. Early investment math and comparative upside The figures show why traders see MUTM as a better growth proposition. Ethereum (ETH) would have to go from $4,000 to $8,000 to double in value, which is a 2x increase that shows consistent but restricted growth over the same time period. MUTM, on the other hand, is worth $0.035 in Phase 6 and may go up to $1.12, giving investors 32x their money back. For instance, buying $5,000 worth of MUTM tokens at $0.035 would give you around 142,900 tokens, which would be worth $160,000 if the goal price is met. This uneven risk-reward profile shows how MUTM uses structured utility, staking incentives, and a presale-driven demand curve to provide growth chances that are better than those of BTC and ETH in the near future. Security and trustworthiness make investors even more confident. CertiK has audited Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and given it a Token Scan score of 90 and a Skynet grade of 79. A $50,000 bug bounty program pays reports based on how serious they are, and a $100,000 giveaway that is always going on encourages people to get involved early and help the community flourish. These steps make sure that MUTM is not just ready for big returns, but also runs on a safe and open base. Conclusion In the end, BTC and ETH are still good investments, but their growth is slowing down. Traders looking for early-stage exposure with structured upside now have a new option in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM is designed to do better than conventional bluechips, with presale momentum, strong collateral and liquidation restrictions, staking incentives, Layer-2 efficiency, and impending exchange listings. It has the ability to give you 32x your money back by Q1 2026. MUTM is the early-stage token with the growth rocket already going off. It’s good for investors who want to keep an eye on crypto forecasts, understand why crypto is down, or find a high-growth alternative to traditional BTC/ETH methods.

First Won-Pegged Stablecoin Launched On Avalanche Digital asset custody firm BDACS officially launched the first South Korean won-backed stablecoin, KRW1, on the Avalanche blockchain in collaboration with Woori Bank, one of the four largest domestic financial institutions in the country According to the X announcement , the stablecoin is currently in a pilot phase, following a successful proof-of-concept (PoC), and each KRW1 token is 1:1 collateralized with won held in escrow at Woori Bank. BDACS reportedly plans to utilize the won-pegged stablecoin as a “low-cost payment and settlement system for public-sector programs, such as emergency relief disbursements, by significantly lowering payment processing fees.” Additionally, KRW1 is “built for more than markets,” Avalanche’s X thread read, as it could become a “technical standard for stablecoins in Korea,” with the upcoming regulatory framework. “BDACS has developed a comprehensive framework, including issuance and management systems as well as a user-facing app supporting peer-to-peer transfers and transaction verification,” the press release detailed . Harry Ryoo, BDACS’s CEO, affirmed that the digital assets firm is “building the backbone of the digital asset market, serving corporate, institutional, and public-sector partners alike. KRW1 marks a turning point for our company, and we believe it will become a foundational asset for the digital economy.” Banks, Crypto Industry Anticipate October Framework KRW1 launches ahead of the regulatory framework by South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC). As reported by Bitcoinist, the financial authority is expected to release the long-awaited guidelines for the issuance and distribution of won-backed stablecoin at the start of next quarter. On August 18, Park Min-kyu, a member of the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), affirmed that the government’s bill was expected to be submitted to the National Assembly in October. The lawmaker revealed that he had recently received a report from the FSC on the direction of stablecoins. The FSC has been working to develop digital assets legislation and shift its regulatory approach, establishing the Virtual Asset Committee in November 2024 to prepare the next phases of its regulatory roadmap and finalize the second one by the end of 2025. Multiple bills related to the issuance and distribution of won-pegged stablecoins have been introduced in South Korea’s National Assembly, including two rival bills in July by Korea’s ruling and opposition parties. Ahn Do-gil, a member of the Planning and Finance Committee from the Democratic Party, introduced the “Act on the Issuance and Distribution of Value-Stable Digital Assets.” On the same day, Kim Eun-hye, a member of the Land, Infrastructure, and Transport Committee from the People Power Party (PPP), proposed the “Act on Payment Innovation Using Value-Fixed Digital Assets.” In June, Min Byung-deok, a member of the National Assembly’s Government Committee, also introduced the “Digital Assets Basic Act,” which proposes allowing the issuance of won-pegged stablecoins and establishing a Digital Asset Committee under the direct authority of the president. The banking sector has been studying two legalization scenarios, as it’s been unclear whether non-bank entities will be allowed to be stablecoin issuers. Notably, South Korea’s biggest banks have reportedly been in talks with Tether and Circle to discuss potential partnerships. According to local reports , the CEOs of Shinhan Financial Group and Hana Financial Group CEO had separate meetings last month with Heath Tarbert, the president of Circle and a Tether official.

ETH outflows from exchanges spike as holders move coins to cold storage or staking platforms. September staking inflows drop to 8.4K ETH, cooling sharply after August’s record-high deposits. Whale Profit Levels Return to 2021 Highs Ethereum wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have now reached the same unrealized profit levels seen during the 2021 market peak. This data suggests large holders are once again sitting on sizable paper gains. In 2017, whale wallets saw unrealized profits peak at around $15 billion. By 2021, this figure had grown to more than $45 billion. As of September 2025, that level has been matched. Charts tracking whale wallet performance show a clear return to the high-profit zone last seen before ETH’s strongest rallies . Crypto analyst commented, The unrealized profits of $ETH whales holding 10-100k have reached the previous cycle’s peak.

And the rate of increase in this… pic.twitter.com/ZZhK2nGR3D — CW (@CW8900) September 18, 2025 Though similar conditions led to large price increases in the past, it is not guaranteed that the same will happen again. Exchange Flows Point to Lower Selling Pressure During early 2025, Ethereum saw large volumes of ETH moved onto exchanges. In February and March, inflows above 200,000 ETH occurred as the price fell from over $3,000 to around $1,500. This activity typically signals selling. Notably, that trend reversed by mid-2025. From June onwards, more ETH began leaving exchanges than entering. Outflow spikes ranged from 200,000 to 400,000 ETH. This behavior change came as ETH started recovering and climbing past $4,000. Large outflows are often linked to reduced sell-side activity as coins are moved off exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant By August and September, this pattern continued while ETH traded near $4,500. Withdrawals remained high, suggesting that holders were choosing to secure their ETH off platforms, possibly for long-term storage or staking. Staking Inflows Rise, Then Drop in September In late 2024 and the first half of 2025, daily displays of staking deposits would range from 20,000 to 100,000 ETH in amount. November 2024 and March 2025 saw some massive spikes, with ETH trading between $2,000 and $2,500. Big inflows began around mid-2025, as ETH had formed a bottom in April. In August, there were days with staking inflows between 250,000 and 300,000 ETH, the largest in that year. As deposits came in substantial sizes with ETH going above $4,000, this is probably reflective of a stronger commitment to the network on the part of participants. Source: CryptoQuant However, the latest data shows a sharp decline. In September 2025, staking inflows dropped to around 8,400 ETH, based on current chart readings. This marks the lowest daily level since late 2024. The recent pullback could reflect a cooling period after heavy deposits in the previous month. ETH Approaches Key Price Level At press time, ETH was trading around $4,600. It has gained over 4% in the past seven days and is approaching its previous all-time high. This level is now acting as resistance. A report by Milk Road noted, $ETH Update Ethereum is stuck between $4k support and its all time high.

If the same pattern occurs again, the price could move toward $16,500. For now, traders are watching whether ETH can hold current levels and close above resistance. If it does, a new upward phase could follow. If not, the market may remain in consolidation until further signals appear.
