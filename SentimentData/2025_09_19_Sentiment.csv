Mutuum Finance is worth $0.035 in stage 6 of its presale. The protocol has over $15.9 million raised in funds and more than 16,370 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been pegged as a millionaire-maker token by analysts tracking the next-generation blockchain technology. Whereas Pepe Coin (PEPE) is predicted to establish ambitious price targets of $0.0001 by 2026, market experts argue that Mutuum’s combination of usability, scalability, and long-term value creation places it light-years ahead of hype-driven rivals. Smart money with a longer-term focus that wants more out of their investments than fleeting momentum is now on Mutuum Finance. PEPE Coin Stalls Even With Promising Plans PEPE is currently priced at $0.00001086, with its action in a tight range and showing little upward momentum compared to earlier stages with high community demand. Its enormous supply and meme-driven nature make sudden rallies dependent more on sentiment than protocol progress fundamentals. Resistance remains just above levels, while support zones remain in place not far below, so that a sturdy breakout would require new volume and catalyst events. Though PEPE has been modeled by some pundits with bullish price estimates, the majority of investors now eye its growth potential relative to emerging Mutuum Finance which is judged to have superior structural supports and higher upside potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 Mutuum Finance has already reached stage six of its presale at $0.035 following a 16.17% boost from the previous stage. The market is witnessing all-time demand for the project where it has already reached more than 16,370 investors and surpassed $15.9 million. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduced a Bug Bounty Program of $50,000 USDT for the security of the platform. The bugs have been divided into four levels depending on the tag critical, major, minor, and low. Collateralization of Mutuum Finance is asset-cap based and is differentiated based on the risk type an asset would bear. It encompasses supply capping, collateral and borrowing capping. The protocol hedges the market risk through overcollateralizing positions. The liquidators are also incentivized when unwinding the undercollateralized trades and thus risky positions are closed in real time. Risk tokens do not have much collateral usage but the most correlated tokens are used to their full extent so that they can build up their collateral. They are all focused on insolvency risk reduction in a way that no type of imbalance is incurred between borrowing and lending in the protocol. User Community and Growth Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to create an engaged user base with a $100,000 giveaway . Ten users will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens, paying them for contributing to the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly become one of the top cryptos to watch in 2025, supported by a strong DeFi focus. Pepe Coin on the other hand is heavily influenced by investor sentiment. Mutuum Finance has seen strong interest in its presale where more than 16,370 investors have raised over $15.9 million. The protocol is rewarding its growing community with a $50,000 bug bounty as well as a $100,000 token giveaway. With its emphasis on scalability, security, and environmentally friendly growth, MUTM provides much more than hype cycles. Lock up your tokens now in Stage 6 before the next price rise.

51945500,584509,1758232832,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"SEC Greenlights New ETF Standards, Opening Door for Altcoin ETFs",https://bitcoinist.com/sec-greenlights-etf-opening-door-for-altcoin-etfs/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved new generic listing standards for spot crypto and altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a landmark shift in digital asset regulation. Previously, every crypto ETF required lengthy case-by-case approval under Section 19b-4—a process that could drag on for months. With this new framework, ETFs meeting specific conditions can now be listed directly on major exchanges like Nasdaq, Cboe, and NYSE without waiting for individual sign-offs. This decision is expected to accelerate the arrival of altcoin ETFs in the U.S., broadening investment access beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts say the streamlined system represents the clearest path yet toward regulated, diversified crypto exposure. Grayscale Leads With First Multi-Crypto ETF Grayscale secured a first-mover advantage as its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) was approved under the new standards. The fund includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, making it the first diversified multi-crypto ETF in the U.S. “Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund $GDLC was just approved for trading… with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano,” Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg confirmed. ETF analysts noted this milestone signals a shift toward broader portfolio products rather than single-asset ETFs. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas estimated that 12–15 cryptos could soon qualify under the SEC’s framework, provided they have established regulated futures trading for at least six months. Altcoin ETFs Considered Imminent Beyond the majors, other altcoins are lining up for potential ETFs. Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Chainlink (LINK) already meet the key requirement of regulated futures trading on Coinbase Derivatives. Solana, for instance, became eligible on August 19, six months after its futures launch. The Chainlink community has also expressed optimism, with both Bitwise and Grayscale filing LINK ETF applications. Meanwhile, the Litecoin Foundation has welcomed the decision, seeing it as a pathway for LTC listings in U.S. markets. Even Hedera (HBAR) is gaining attention, with investors speculating on its ETF prospects. Industry watchers describe the SEC’s move as a turning point for crypto, one that reduces regulatory friction and boosts market confidence. As ETF analyst James Seyffart put it, “We’re gonna be off to the races in a matter of weeks.” With the SEC’s greenlight, the question is no longer if altcoin ETFs will launch, but which will debut first.

Analyst Eye 111% DOGE Breakout Despite Heavy Selling,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/massive-dogecoin-upside-analyst-eye-111-doge-breakout-despite-heavy-selling/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged 13% this week, climbing to $0.282, despite heavy selling pressure from investors. Over $1.63 billion worth of DOGE, nearly 5.81 billion tokens, have been moved to exchanges in September, signaling profit-taking and caution among traders. Related Reading: From $2 Trillion To $400T? CEO Sees Bitcoin Exploding 200x – Here’s More Long-term holders, who had previously offered stability, are also shifting assets according to the coin days destroyed (CDD) metric, often a sign of potential downside risk. However, the bullish rally remains strong, mainly driven by optimism about a possible spot Dogecoin ETF launch. This regulatory milestone, along with increasing corporate treasury use and payment integrations, has kept DOGE on the minds of institutional investors. Technical Setup Points to Potential DOGE Breakout Despite mixed short-term signals, technical analysts remain bullish. The Ichimoku Cloud setup shows all four major indicators aligned in favor of buyers, giving DOGE a “perfect +4” bullish score. Support levels sit near $0.255, with resistance forming at $0.287. A decisive break above could push DOGE toward $0.300 and beyond. Trader Tardigrade highlighted that Dogecoin’s consolidation pattern is steadily building momentum. Each resistance test has been met with higher lows, suggesting waning selling pressure. “Eventually, DOGE will break this resistance and reach new all-time highs,” he noted. Meanwhile, analyst Javon Marks set a breakout target of $0.6533, implying a 111% upside from current levels. CoinCodex forecasts also predict DOGE will trade at $0.32 by mid-October, reflecting continued bullish sentiment. DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Dogecoin ETF Hype and Market Outlook The U.S. SEC’s recent approval of listing standards for spot Dogecoin ETFs has further strengthened the bullish case. The launch of DOJE, backed by REX Shares and Osprey Funds, marks a milestone for meme coin adoption in regulated markets. Corporate participation, such as CleanCore Solutions’ Dogecoin treasury initiative, adds additional credibility and institutional demand. However, risks remain. If DOGE fails to hold above the critical $0.273 support level, analysts warn of a possible correction toward $0.241. Momentum indicators also show overbought conditions, hinting at potential short-term consolidation before any major breakout.

Trump had just wrapped up his second formal state visit, but this wasn’t about dinners and speeches. At Chequers, both men sat down with their delegations from the U.S. and U.K. to hash out trade, tech, and global security issues. The main issue on the table was updating the May 2025 U.S.-U.K. economic prosperity deal, which both sides now want to tweak. The U.K. specifically wants the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum gone. Trump seemed open to it earlier in the week when speaking on Air Force One. “They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,” he said. “We’ve made a deal, and it’s a great deal, and I’m into helping them. They’d like to see if they could get a little bit better deal. So, we’ll talk to them.” Trump discusses Putin, war in Ukraine, and a possible ceasefire While talks focused on trade, Trump and Starmer also addressed the Ukraine war. At a press conference at Chequers, Trump said, “The Russia situation, I hope we’re going to have some good news for you coming up.” He added, “Millions of people have died in that war, millions of souls… They’re being killed, and I feel I have an obligation to get it settled for that reason.” Trump then turned the heat on Vladimir Putin, saying, “He’s let me down. He’s really let me down.” This came as a surprise, considering Trump had repeatedly claimed during his 2024 campaign that he could end the war in a single day. He admitted on Thursday that ending the conflict has been harder than expected. “I’m very honored to tell you that we’ve solved seven wars, seven wars, wars that were unsolvable, wars that couldn’t be negotiated or done,” he said. “The one that I thought would be easiest would be because of my relationship with President Putin, but he’s let me down.” USA Today later checked that “seven wars” comment and found five confirmed ceasefires or agreements, while also pointing out that not everyone credited the White House for them. UK announces $204B in foreign investment as talks continue During the visit, the U.K. government announced £150 billion ($204 billion) in foreign investment. The deals span across AI, civil nuclear, financial services, and energy. The announcements dropped while Trump and Starmer were still in talks at Chequers. Duncan Edwards, head of BritishAmerican Business, called it a big moment for the U.K. “From a U.K. government perspective, they couldn’t really have asked for a better slew of announcements coming over the last three days with the civil nuclear, financial services, and all the AI announcements,” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.” But Edwards warned that words aren’t cash. “Promised dollars” weren’t the same as “actual dollars,” he said, adding that it’s still unclear if the investment will actually show up. The two leaders met after a formal state dinner the night before at Windsor Castle, where Trump addressed British and American officials, business leaders, and royals. He called the visit “one of the highest honors of my life” and joked he hoped he’d be the only president to ever get two state visits. King Charles returned the favor by complimenting Trump’s “personal commitment to finding solutions to some of the world’s most intractable conflicts.” Get seen where it counts.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bhutan-government-makes-remarkable-bitcoin-transfer-hundreds-of-bitcoins-moved-to-a-new-wallet-here-are-the-details/,"The government of the Kingdom of Bhutan has made a notable move regarding its cryptocurrency holdings. According to on-chain data published by Onchain Lens, the government transferred a total of 343.1 Bitcoin (approximately $40.18 million) to a new digital wallet. Bhutan Government Moves 343 Bitcoins to New Wallet, Expectations for Transfer to CEX Experts say that this transaction may have been made for the purpose of depositing funds into centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX), similar to past examples. It is known that the Bhutanese government has previously directed Bitcoin transfers of similar size to CEX platforms and used these funds within the scope of various financial strategies. Although Bhutan has traditionally had a closed economy, it has been making notable strides in the field of digital assets and blockchain technology in recent years. The country, which has invested in crypto mining, particularly using its hydroelectric resources, is one of the rare governments that holds Bitcoin in its state-backed strategic reserves. Market analysts believe the transfer points to two possible purposes: first, creating liquidity through the sale of funds; second, preparing for new commercial or investment moves through centralized exchanges. This development is being closely watched in crypto markets, as large-scale government wallet movements can lead to short-term fluctuations, particularly in Bitcoin's price. The Bhutanese government hasn't officially announced anything, adding to the uncertainty surrounding how the funds will ultimately be disbursed. However, industry experts believe the move indicates the country will continue to take a more active role in cryptocurrency policies. *This is not investment advice.

This potential move is supported by a string of major catalysts – the Federal Reserve’s rate cut yesterday, today’s launch of the first spot XRP ETF, and a clear uptick in institutional interest. If XRP successfully retests the $3.65 zone from above and holds it as support, momentum could accelerate toward the $10 mark. At $10, XRP’s market cap would soar to around $597 billion, putting it on par with Ethereum’s current valuation and cementing its place as one of the top assets in the crypto market.

The digital asset industry, collectively capitalizing $4.2 trillion, has seen limited expansion over recent months due to inflation fears and geopolitical headwinds, though Bitcoin did set a fresh record high at $124,128 just last month. The crypto market also rose 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Aside from Bitcoin, substantial capital continues flowing into both established altcoins and the best meme coins. Over the past year, many projects have set new price milestones, reflecting increasing investor enthusiasm across the sector. Fueling this optimism are two key policy shifts from Washington. First, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, the United States’ first broad regulatory framework governing stablecoins. Second, the SEC launched Project Crypto, a new initiative to modernize and clarify securities laws as they apply to digital assets. With sentiment improving, it’s worth examining how leading altcoins such as XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin are positioning for potential upside. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Leader is Arguably the Best Crypto Altcoin in 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) reached a record $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act was signed into law, beating its previous 2018 peak of $3.40. Since then, it has eased back to about $3.12, a 15% drop from that high. XRP’s appeal lies in its rapid, cost-effective global transfers, offering an alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. Its credibility is further reinforced by recognition from organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and even acknowledgment from the White House. Earlier this year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a high-level presidential roundtable on crypto policy, cementing the company’s influence in shaping the industry. The token gained fresh momentum in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that retail sales of XRP did not breach securities laws, effectively resolving its long-standing dispute with the SEC. Over the last twelve months, XRP has climbed 440%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 95% gain. A mid-July surge has kept the coin anchored near the $3 mark, a level that has proven resilient despite wider market swings. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) sits near 59, and uptrading, signaling cautious increased inflows following the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates and the launch of the first spot ETF today. Looking ahead, the SEC is expected to rule on more potential spot XRP ETFs in mid-October. A positive decision could push XRP to $4 or higher within the same month. Cardano ($ADA): The Sustainable Ethereum Competitor Eyeing a 2026 Growth Cycle Cardano ($ADA) has consistently ranked among the top altcoins, and 2025 is no exception. Over the past year, ADA surged 175%, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano operates as a smart contract platform focused on sustainability through its Proof-of-Stake consensus and rigorous peer-reviewed research,an approach that even influenced Ethereum’s own development path. With a market cap of $33.5 billion, ADA would need to triple in value to rival Solana and begin challenging Ethereum’s dominance. Currently trading at around $0.9184, ADA posted a 5% overnight gain, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum’s respective 3% and 3.6% increases. Favorable political and macroeconomic developments could propel ADA toward $1.50 by fall, and potentially back to its $3.09 all-time high before year-end, a 240% jump from current levels. Technically, ADA formed a bullish flag between December and March, pointing to further upside potential. Like XRP, its RSI is trending up from 59, signaling market wide appetite for crypto is building. Key resistance sits at $1.15, with strong support in the $0.85–$0.90 zone. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Can the First Meme Coin Finally Break $1? Launched in 2013 as a parody, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has grown into the most recognized meme coin, boasting a $42.4 billion market cap and a passionate fan base supported by high-profile figures. The token’s breakout moment came in 2021 when endorsements from Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons pushed it into mainstream awareness. This May, institutional investors renewed interest, lifting DOGE back into the $0.25 range amid speculation about possible spot Dogecoin ETFs in the U.S. The coin now trades at $0.281, marking a 5.4% overnight gain, a 13% weekly gain and outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Shiba Inu over the same stretch. While DOGE’s technical indicators remain bullish, its RSI is pretty high at 67, which could point to a sell-off over the weekend as traders reap the rewards of its rapid recent price appreciation. Market-wide momentum and supportive policy headlines could enable further growth, so DOGE could still climb toward $0.50 by mid-October. Adoption is also expanding: Tesla accepts DOGE for purchases, while PayPal and Revolut continue adding support, further strengthening its real-world use cases. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The First Bitcoin Layer 2 and One of 2025’s Most Promising Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is among 2025’s most hyped presale projects, aiming to become Bitcoin’s first Layer 2 that combines viral meme appeal with scalability and community-driven development. Its vision is to enhance Bitcoin with faster transactions, added functionality, and grassroots governance. The presale has already attracted more than $16.6 million, with analysts projecting potential post-launch gains of 10× or more. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER supports ultra-fast smart contracts for Bitcoin while keeping fees low. A standout feature is its Canonical Bridge, which enables near-instant BTC transfers on its Layer 2 while powering dApps, meme tokens, and payments with minimal transaction costs.

Market conditions could be setting the stage for this move. Just last week, Bitcoin recorded a fresh all-time high at $124,128, surpassing its prior $122,838 peak from only a month earlier. However, momentum cooled after July’s hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data triggered a market pullback. At the same time, regulators are stepping up. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first complete legislation covering stablecoins, mandating full reserve backing. Shortly afterward, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, an initiative designed to modernize securities laws and provide clearer guidance for digital asset firms. With regulations advancing and optimism building, many analysts believe the next rally in altcoins and meme tokens could rival, or even exceed, the euphoric surge of 2021. If Gemini’s projections play out, XRP, Pepe, and Solana may lead the charge. XRP (Ripple): Gemini Predicts a 60% Jump Toward $5 by Year-End Gemini suggests Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $5 by late 2025, representing a more than fivefold increase from its current price of $3.00. The token has already displayed resilience. On July 18, XRP spiked to $3.65, topping its 2018 record of $3.40, before retracing about 15% amid broader macroeconomic headwinds. Globally, Ripple continues to expand its cross-border payments network. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund highlighted XRP as an affordable remittance tool for emerging economies. Earlier this year, Ripple’s drawn-out battle with the SEC officially came to an end when the agency dropped its case, following a 2023 court ruling confirming that retail XRP sales were not securities. The decision removed a major cloud of uncertainty for Ripple and other altcoins. Should XRP retest recent highs and sustain momentum, Gemini sees $5 although many analysts are claiming significantly higher valuations like $10 or $20. Technical indicators support a positive outlook. XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 59, suggesting buying momentum is picking up. The Fed’s decision to cut interest rates, along with today’s launch of the first spot XRP ETF , are likely price drivers. Over the last 12 months, XRP has soared 440%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 95% and Ethereum’s 98% during the same period. Pepe ($PEPE): Gemini Predicts a 5× Run for the Top Non-Dog Meme Coin Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has quickly grown into one of the three largest meme coins by market cap, now valued at around $4.75 billion, the biggest non-dog-themed meme token. Despite stiff competition, Pepe thrives on its deep liquidity and dedicated community. Elon Musk has even playfully referenced Pepe on X, sparking speculation that he may own it alongside Dogecoin. Currently priced at $0.0000113, Pepe has risen 4% overnight in step with an 4% rise across the now $90.8 billion meme coin sector. Furthermore the token gained 7% over the past week, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Shiba Inu. A decisive breakout above resistance in the $0.000018–$0.000022 zone could set the stage for a move to $0.00003 by mid-fall. In a favorable market, Gemini predicts Pepe could reach $0.00005, a fivefold increase from current levels. From a technical perspective, a descending wedge pattern forming between November and March suggests a bullish setup. With regulatory conditions improving, Pepe could be preparing for another strong rally. Solana (SOL): ETF Speculation and Ecosystem Growth Could Drive 4× Gains by December Solana ($SOL) continues to cement its position in the smart contract arena, with a market capitalization above $133.6 billion and total value locked (TVL) around $12.74 billion . Developer activity and institutional interest continue to climb. Some of the enthusiasm stems from speculation around a potential U.S.-listed Solana spot ETF, which could mimic the inflows seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were introduced. Adding fuel to the narrative, President Trump earlier this year floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. national Bitcoin reserve. However, under his plan, Solana would only be held if obtained from government seizures rather than purchased directly on the open market. Price performance has also improved. After peaking at $250 in January, sliding to $100 in April, and rebounding to $247, Solana is almost at its highest point over the year to date (YTD). This breakout from a descending wedge pattern has Gemini projecting that a rally toward $1,000 by year’s end is feasible, more than tripling its previous record of $293.31. Achieving such a milestone, however, may depend on the SEC implementing broader crypto regulatory clarity in the coming months. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Risk Alternative to Dogecoin For investors seeking opportunities outside Gemini’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) offers a speculative meme coin option, branding itself as Dogecoin’s edgier cousin. While Dogecoin has matured into a multibillion-dollar asset that often tracks Bitcoin and Ethereum, its wild volatility from 2021 has moderated. Maxi Doge, by contrast, is targeting risk-seeking investors with satirical lore and a strong emphasis on community engagement. The presale has already raised over $2.3 million within its first month. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MAXI focuses on community growth through Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading contests, and partnerships with other projects. Out of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% are allocated to the Maxi Fund for marketing and collaborations. Staking is also live, currently offering 142% APY, though yields are expected to decline as participation rises. The presale price is $0.000258, with an increase scheduled in just over two days. Investors can join via the official Maxi Doge site using wallets such as MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

These three tokens have outperformed the market average today, with the Fed’s rate cut boosting investor appetite for risk-on assets such as cryptos. But what makes this period particularly bullish is that we may begin to see a flood of ETF approvals from the SEC, including for XRP and other major altcoins. This is likely to drive the prices of XRP, BNB and SHIB upwards in the coming weeks, with all three tokens potentially hitting new record highs. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – New DBS and Franklin Partnership Will Push Altcoin Price to New ATH Soon XRP has bounced to $3.12 today, making for a 4% increase in the past 24 hours and a 10% rise in the past fortnight. The coin has also risen by 4% in a month, and what’s encouraging about this is that it’s a sign that XRP is still some way from being overbought (and needing to correct). Indeed the XRP price could perform very strongly in the coming weeks, and not just because of yesterday’s rate cut. Introducing the next building block of onchain markets – we’re partnering with @DBSbank and @FTI_Global to establish repo markets powered by tokenized collateral and stablecoins: https://t.co/vFTL32XO8C Investors will be able to use $RLUSD to trade for Franklin Templeton’s money… — Ripple (@Ripple) September 18, 2025 It’s also benefiting from Ripple’s accelerated growth as a company, with the firm announcing a new tokenization partnership with DBS and Franklin Templeton today. This comes in addition to recent partnerships with BBVA, the $200 million acquisition of Rails, and the company’s expansion into Africa and Dubai. Now is therefore a very bullish time for XRP, which is waiting for the SEC to decide on applications for over 10 XRP ETFs. Source: TradingView It’s in this hugely bullish context that the coin’s chart shows signs of ongoing price rises, with its indicators still moving up from previously oversold positions. The crypto price prediction for XRP is therefore very positive, with the coin set to hit $3.50 by the end of the month, and pass $5 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Binance Coin ($BNB) – Exchange Token Setting New Record Highs Amid High Binance Volumes BNB set a record high of $1,004 only a few hours ago, and at $991, it has posted a 3.5% gain in 24 hours and a 17% increase in the past month. These moves have pushed BNB up to 5th in the market in terms of capitalization, while it’s also up by 84% in the last 12 months. Its chart is unsurprisingly showing some real momentum right now, yet there’s a danger that it may be close to peaking, implying a correction. Source: TradingView However, while its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have entered overbought positions, the wider market’s overall trajectory may help it to continue climbing in the coming weeks. If the SEC does approve the vast majority of outstanding ETF applications (and it approved a multi-crypto ETF yesterday ), then this could send demand even higher, pushing the BNB price with it. An expanding cryptocurrency market will boost Binance’s position as crypto’s biggest exchange , which in turn will increase demand for BNB. As such, we could see the altcoin reach $1,600 by the of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: SHIB Price Builds Bullish Momentum – Major Breakout Now Imminent At $0.00001334, SHIB has gained by 2.5% in the past 24 hours and 9% in the past fortnight, with the meme token also up by 6% in the past month. But if we look at its chart today, we see that there’s still lots of scope for further increases in the coming days and weeks. For instance, its MACD has only recently risen into a positive position, above the baseline, having spent most of August and a little of September at a negative level. We see a similar pattern with SHIB’s relative strength index, which has risen above 50 in recent days, but which is still far from enter overbought territory. Source: TradingView Now is therefore still a good time to buy SHIB, which remains down by 84.5% in relation to its ATH of $0.00008616, implying that it could rise quickly in Q4. Longer term, SHIB also benefits from the fact that Shiba Inu is one of the fundamentally stronger meme tokens, benefitting from a growing ecosystem of platforms, protocols and dapps. Its has its own DEX (ShibaSwap), its own layer-two network (Shibarium), while it has also seen the launch of numerous games in recent months. Given this foundation, the crypto price prediction for SHIB remains very positive, and the meme token could reach $0.00020 by the middle of October, before ending the year above $0.000060. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Innovative New Meme Token Raises $1.25 Million in Presale Traders looking to diversify into newer, smaller-cap tokens may also be interested in some of the presale coins currently available, with some of these showing promise. One interesting example of this is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that boasts a gamified staking system. Ready.. Aim.. MINE! https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/X8843bod4f — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 18, 2025 It opened its ICO only a few weeks ago, but has already raised $1.25 million, a sign of its future potential. PEPENODE is the market’s first mine-to-earn token, with its staking system inviting users to build and grow a virtual mining rig. By spending PEPENODE to add more nodes to their rig, users can earn greater staking rewards, as well as rewards in other meme coins (such as Pepe and Fartcoin). This is an interesting mechanic, and it’s one that could see the PEPENODE price rise steadily over time, as miners accumulate more of the token. Investors can join the coin’s presale at the PEPENODE website , where it’s currently available at $0.0010617. This price will rise later today, and will continue to rise for as long as the sale lasts, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later.

Data indicate that over $3 billion in net inflows were contributed to the large wallets, and this is one of the highest accumulation waves in 2025. This trend indicates a belief in Bitcoin’s strength, despite ongoing controversy on whether the market is at its peak. Additionally, whale activity has long been used as a solid indicator of the market direction. Their surge in August indicates high belief, and analysts predict it may provide the platform for strong gains in Q4. However, with the power of Bitcoin, whales are diversifying as well. A good number is already starting to purchase early slots in a new entrant, MAGACOIN FINANCE, with a credible security and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation in August According to on-chain metrics, whales transferred coins out of exchanges in large amounts last month. This activity has increased net inflows to record highs since the start of the year of up to $3 billion. According to analysts, this kind of movement is a precursor to rallies, as the whales gather ahead of others in the wider crypto market. Support at close to $114,000 has been strong, and whales have made a point of boosting the demand anytime the price dipped. These moves underscore a long-term conviction that Bitcoin is the foundation of the crypto market. The Role of Whale Behavior More so, whale wallets tend to be the most accurate indicator of wider market sentiment. History continues to dictate that when there is high purchasing of whales, the market will experience surges. Their August activity reflected previous stages when Bitcoin rallies started slowly and then soared upwards. To smaller investors, these actions are educational. Although the involvement of retailers is divided, whale conviction indicates bullish sentiment. According to analysts, this accumulation is an indicator that whales believe that Bitcoin will keep rising. Whales Diversify Into Meme Coins In spite of being committed to Bitcoin, the whales are also trying new avenues in search of better returns. The latest trends demonstrate that big investors are offloading into meme coins in search of higher returns than the less volatile Bitcoin growth. The strategy is simple: Bitcoin gives security in the long term, whereas meme coins can guarantee high-ROI investments in bullish cycles. This diversification is an indication of a mature approach. Whales no longer feel content with possessing just Bitcoin. They are diversifying their portfolios with speculative investments, which may increase their returns. Whale-Backed Meme Coin for ROI MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the meme coin of choice for Bitcoin whales, diversifying after a record August. Whales added over $3 billion in BTC last month, but their latest moves show a shift toward meme coins with explosive upside potential. These large investors are securing early allocations in MAGACOIN FINANCE, aiming to balance portfolios between high-growth opportunities and long-term security. Bitcoin remains the foundation of whale holdings, but MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the chance for outsized returns during meme season. The strategy reflects a balanced approach: Bitcoin for stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE for ROI potential. Analysts say this dual-track positioning could define the next phase of whale investment in 2025. Conclusion Bitcoin whales dominated August by adding over $3 billion to their wallets, reinforcing faith in the asset’s resilience. Their conviction points to continued strength heading into Q4. Simultaneously, diversification is shaping whale portfolios. By adding MAGACOIN FINANCE alongside Bitcoin, whales are blending long-term stability with the potential for explosive ROI. Analysts believe this dual approach will define the months ahead, making MAGACOIN FINANCE an altcoin to watch closely.

PEPE Is Approaching The End Of A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a TA pattern forming in the 1-day price of Pepe. The pattern in question is a “Symmetrical Triangle,” which forms when an asset observes consolidation between two trendlines approaching each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the pattern acts as a resistance barrier, while the lower one provides support. Together, they make it so that the price remains stuck in the channel between them, and since the trendlines involved here are of the converging type, the asset’s range shrinks as it moves inside the triangle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Down 13% As Whales Distribute $181 Million In DOGE An escape out of either of these bounds can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, a break above the triangle can be a bullish sign, while a decline under it a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that the 1-day PEPE price is currently trading inside: As is visible in the above graph, Pepe has been stuck inside this channel since December of last year, but its price is now not far from the apex. Generally, breakouts become more likely to occur the tighter an asset’s range is, as it means retests happen more frequently. With the memecoin standing inside the narrow tip of the triangle now, its range is quite small, so an escape could be probable to occur in the near future. Symmetrical Triangles are usually considered to have an equal bias in both directions, so a possible breakout could occur in either direction for the asset. Triangle breakouts are generally of the same length as the base of the triangle (that is, the distance between the trendlines at their widest). Based on this, the analyst believes the memecoin may be gearing up for a 78% move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Touches $117,000 As Binance Records 9 Days Of Outflows It now remains to be seen how the price of the cryptocurrency will develop in the near future and which side of the Symmetrical Triangle a breakout would take place. The Symmetrical Triangle is just one type of triangles that exist in TA. Another popular variant is the Ascending Triangle, which forms when the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, Solana has seen a breakout above such a triangle on the daily timeframe. “Solana $SOL may retest the breakout zone at $210 before pushing toward the $320 target!” explains the analyst. PEPE Price At the time of writing, Pepe is trading around $0.00001137, up more than 9% over the last week.

51947459,584267,1758236434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51947459.jpeg,Ripple Seals Deal With Southeast Asia’s Largest Bank,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-deal-southeast-asia-largest-bank/,"Ripple has inked a three-way agreement with DBS and Franklin Templeton to bring tokenized money market funds and stablecoin-based liquidity onto DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx), in a move that squarely targets institutional demand for on-chain yield and credit. Biggest Bank In Southeast Asia Taps Ripple Tech Under a memorandum of understanding signed on September 18, DDEx will list Franklin Templeton’s sgBENJI—the token of the Franklin Onchain US Dollar Short-Term Money Market Fund—alongside Ripple’s US dollar stablecoin, RLUSD , enabling eligible clients to swap between a yield-bearing fund token and a stable unit of account around the clock. Ripple says the solution is being built on the public XRP Ledger, with repo-style lending to follow as the initiative expands. DBS, Southeast Asia’s largest bank by assets (over $500 billion as of 2025), framed the tie-up as part of a broader institutional shift toward tokenized market infrastructure. “Digital asset investors need solutions that can meet the unique demands of a borderless 24/7 asset class,” said Lim Wee Kian, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange. The bank added that, in a next phase, it will explore allowing clients to post sgBENJI as collateral to obtain credit either directly from DBS via repurchase transactions (repos) or from third-party platforms where DBS acts as collateral agent—formally pulling a core money-markets use case on-chain. Franklin Templeton, which has been at the vanguard of tokenized funds, will issue sgBENJI on the XRP Ledger to increase interoperability across networks. Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, called the collaboration “a meaningful advancement in the utility of tokenized securities” and “a significant step forward in the growth of Asia’s digital asset ecosystem.” Ripple’s VP and global head of trading and markets, Nigel Khakoo, underscored the capital-markets angle, saying the link-up to “enable repo trades for a tokenized money market fund” with a regulated, liquid exchange medium like RLUSD “is truly a game-changer.” Monica Long, Ripple’s president, situated the announcement in the larger tokenization debate, arguing that real-world assets must have both tradability and practical uses to fulfill their promise. “In order for tokenized financial assets to solve the problems they’ve been promised to solve, we need both 1/ liquid secondary markets and 2/ utility for these assets (such as with collateralization). That’s exactly what Ripple, DBS and FTI are working towards with this announcement,” she wrote via X. The mechanics are designed for institutional portfolio management. By listing sgBENJI and RLUSD side by side, accredited investors on DDEx can quickly rebalance from volatile crypto exposures into a comparatively stable, yield-accruing fund token without leaving a single, bank-supervised ecosystem. Ripple and DBS say settlement finality within minutes and 24/7 market access are central to the design, with the XRP Ledger chosen for speed, low fees and throughput suitable for high-volume fund token transfers.

This action aims to boost the revival of Europe’s capital markets. Following their pledge, the international organization intends to enhance pension investment growth and loosen strict cryptocurrency regulations . These plans were made public after Maria Luis Albuquerque, a European Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services, and the Capital Markets Union, shared them on Thursday, September 18, according to reports from reliable sources. The commissioner also highlighted that the commission was considering granting the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), its major market regulator, more direct supervisory powers. The EU vows to enact effective economic strategies to reform its single market During a conference in Copenhagen, Albuquerque stated the commission’s main aim towards implementing these changes . Based on her argument, they want to eliminate cross-border barriers, lower administrative expenses, and ensure the implementation of simple regulations. Her remarks came when individuals raised concerns about getting tired of the EU’s slow-moving approach to reforming its single market. These concerns were raised a year after Mario Draghi, a prominent Italian economist who served as the European Central Bank’s President (ECB), released a significant report on enhancing the European economy using the financial sector. Even with this economic strategy, Draghi warned that Europe was dragging behind global changes at the beginning of this week. Meanwhile, as the ESMA gains supervisory powers, the commission will thoroughly assess whether centralized oversight of specific market infrastructures, such as central counterparties, central securities depositories, and trading venues, will be beneficial. Concerning this, Albuquerque pointed out that emerging sectors like crypto asset service institutions would also benefit from increased centralized supervision while still allowing national authorities to perform their responsibilities. The EU proposes measures to encourage investments in Europe Albuquerque shared additional information about the commission’s proposals that are expected to be implemented by the end of this month. The proposals are intended to encourage investments in Europe and redirect household savings stored in bank accounts into investments. A reliable source familiar with the situation reported that the commission will propose several tax incentives to promote investment. This will include deductions for opening savings and investment accounts, exemptions on income from investments, and introducing a system that will delay taxes until people withdraw their funds from their bank accounts. These suggestions are part of what is referred to as the Savings and Investments Union. This initiative aims to assist European businesses in gaining easier access to funding, as it simultaneously provides more financial opportunities for consumers. This draft may be updated before September 30, the preferred date for the commission to issue these recommendations. For the EU’s pension plan that Albuquerque had shared earlier, the commission will suggest auto-enrollment for workplace pensions, establish systems that track pensions, and offer advice on the most suitable practices to be adopted. These recommended measures must undergo the EU legislative process and represent another effort by Brussels to utilize European capital to enhance the local economy. In the meantime, during her yearly speech last week, President Ursula von der Leyen pointed out internal obstacles in the single market. According to her, they act as a 45% tariff on goods and a 110% tariff on services.

The announcement came during a press call where Jensen confirmed he personally discussed the terms with Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan, a longtime associate. “We thought it was going to be such an incredible investment,” Jensen said, adding that the agreement was finalized Saturday after months of back-and-forth. As Cryptopolitan reported , the partnership involves Nvidia building AI systems and PC chips alongside Intel, combining Nvidia’s graphics processors with Intel’s x86 CPUs. The deal covers more than just a handshake. Nvidia will be buying central processors from Intel to power its NVLink rack AI servers, which currently use Arm chips. Jensen explained: “We’ll buy those CPUs from Intel, and then we’ll connect it into super chips that then becomes our compute node, that then gets integrated into a rack scale AI supercomputer.” At the same time, Intel will start pushing laptops and PC chips that include Nvidia’s GPU components, tech that Jensen says will help both companies tap into a $50 billion market. Nvidia plugs into Intel’s hardware as Intel sells off assets Greg Ernst, Intel’s revenue chief, said on LinkedIn that the agreement came together over the past few months and was finalized on Saturday. Under the deal, Nvidia becomes a major customer of Intel CPUs while also supplying GPU chiplets that go into Intel’s client-side products. “We’re going to become a very large customer of Intel CPUs, and we’re going to be a large supplier of GPU chiplets into Intel chips,” Jensen told reporters. He clarified that the partnership won’t affect Nvidia’s existing work with Arm, and that Thursday’s announcement is only about products, not Intel’s foundry. Right now, Nvidia uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to manufacture its chips. But Jensen said they still evaluate Intel’s foundry capabilities and may work with them down the line. For this partnership though, the collaboration will only involve Intel’s chip packaging, the late-stage part of chip production that combines components into a single part ready for installation. Tan, who was named Intel’s CEO in March after Pat Gelsinger was ousted, said during the same press call, “I’d like to thank Jensen for the confidence in me, and our team and Intel will work really hard to make sure it’s a good return for you.” Pat was removed by Intel’s board last year due to rising costs in manufacturing and failure to break into the AI chip market. Since then, Tan has led Intel through major cost-cutting and fundraising moves. Intel has raised $2 billion from SoftBank, sold a majority stake in its ASIC subsidiary Altera to Silver Lake for $3.3 billion, and offloaded $1 billion in stock from Mobileye, its self-driving tech unit. The company also said in July that it’s laying off 15% of its workforce by year’s end. In total, Intel has received $8.9 billion in CHIPS Act grants and loans from the U.S. government—but the Trump administration requested a 10% equity stake in exchange for the funds. That stake was secured in August. Despite the cash, Intel still hasn’t landed any major foundry customers like Nvidia or Apple. Analysts have said the company needs at least one to prove that its technology is reliable at scale. If it doesn’t, it may be forced to abandon the foundry business altogether. That has raised concern in Washington, where lawmakers see Intel as strategically important due to its status as the only American firm that can build top-tier chips onshore. Jensen was in England earlier this week with President Donald Trump, attending a state dinner at Windsor Palace and announcing new projects in the U.K. But both Jensen and a White House official confirmed that the U.S. government was not involved in the Nvidia-Intel deal. Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, later said in a statement, “Intel’s new partnership with Nvidia is a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing.” Intel’s fall over the last five years has been steep. Its shares have dropped 31.78%, while Nvidia’s have jumped 1,348%, putting Nvidia’s market cap at $4.25 trillion compared to Intel’s $143 billion as of Thursday’s close.

The Russian news agency Interfax reported on September 17 that a court in the city has ordered the arrest the head of a Russian Railways (RZD) power department, along with his deputy. The Smolninsky District Court ruled that Sergei Kuznetsov, the head of the RZD’s St Petersburg-Finlyandsky Station Electricity Supply Department, and his deputy Nikolai Baltser, should remain in custody until November 15. The station is one of the biggest and most important rail transport hubs in the country. Russian Railways Staffers ‘Mined Crypto at Power Substations’ Prosecutors say the duo stole nearly 1 billion rubles (over $12 million) worth of power from their employer to power crypto mining rigs. A Russian Railways train in Chelyabinsk, Russia. (Source: Andrey Khabarov [CC BY 3.0]) The duo has been charged with abuse of power-related offenses. But police think they did not act alone. Investigators said an as-yet “unidentified mastermind” paid Kuznetsov and Baltzer. Officers say the mastermind used this aid to “tap Russian Railways facility resources for energy-intensive mining.” This mastermind, police think, belongs to an organized criminal group that also includes other RZD employees. Police said they found crypto mining rigs “illegally installed at the Gromovo and Lugovaya substations.” Both substations are connected to the RZD’s central power grid. The rigs operated undetected from September 16, 2024, until they were discovered on September 16 this year, officers added.

Prosecutors say they believe that arrestees were “aware” that the rigs would require an “uncontrolled consumption of electrical energy.” The suspects also reportedly understood that their actions were a violation of RDZ’s property rights. They also knew that this would “harm the legitimate interests of their employer,” prosecutors added. Prosecution officials reported that Kuznetsov “immediately began cooperating” with the pretrial investigation upon his arrest. However, both defendants said they objected to being taken into custody. Kuznetsov and Baltzer both said they had no intention of trying to flee ahead of their trials. Earlier this month, Russian electronics retailers reported that demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg and the surrounding region is now the third highest in the country . Evidence appears to suggest that some miners are leaving traditional Bitcoin mining hotspots in Southern Siberia and the North Caucasus in favor of larger urban areas.

That pattern repeated when EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) highlighted a recent statement from Jim Cramer, interpreting it as a decisive signal of altseason for the crypto market. Cramer had insisted that “Altseason is just a myth, it’ll never happen,” a dismissal that resonated because of his reputation for bold market calls that often fail spectacularly. Among digital asset traders, such remarks frequently serve as cues to go in the opposite direction , and EGRAG CRYPTO’s response reinforced that perception. Thank you Lord for the Signal pic.twitter.com/NaeQ6nzQri — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 17, 2025 Cramer’s Reputation and the Crypto Market Sentiment Cramer has built a career as a financial commentator, but his track record is widely perceived as unreliable. Traders often treat his dismissals or endorsements as reasons to anticipate the opposite outcome. When he declared that altseason would never happen, many observers interpreted it as indirect confirmation that such a cycle could arrive soon. EGRAG CRYPTO amplified this view by stating, “Thank you, Lord, for the Signal,” implying that Cramer’s skepticism might mark the onset of a strong altcoin cycle. Altseason and XRP Adding to the excitement is the prediction by veteran trader Peter Brandt concerning the start of altseason . Altseason refers to a period when digital assets outside of Bitcoin experience sharp upward moves, and Brandt is convinced that the market has entered this phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historically, these periods follow phases of Bitcoin strength and often bring massive gains for tokens with established communities. XRP stands among those frequently highlighted as a major candidate for growth when altseason materializes. Many other analysts have also reiterated their altseason predictions , and with a loyal base of holders and ongoing discussions about its role in global finance, XRP benefits disproportionately when capital flows into the altcoin sector. What’s Next for XRP? The possibility of a significant altseason now rests on both technical and psychological foundations. Some inexperienced market participants might view Cramer’s dismissal as a counter-signal, but analysts such as EGRAG CRYPTO see it as confirmation. If capital does rotate heavily into altcoins, XRP could find itself in a position to register sharp moves upward . That expectation has become a central point for investors who believe that market cycles repeat and that XRP, given its liquidity and recognition, could serve as one of the leading beneficiaries.

This wave of rapid adoption is changing the way investors perceive both established giants and emerging speculative plays. XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE now stand as two of the most talked-about names on opposite ends of the spectrum. XRP is a legacy altcoin with global partnerships and enterprise adoption, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is a rising meme-driven presale token. The question for investors: which among these is the best crypto to buy as this market grows towards unprecedented scale? XRP: Momentum and Utility XRP has constantly proven to be one of the most resilient altcoins in the market. Its focus on enterprise level payment solutions have made it widely used among banks and financial institutions. Ripple’s increasing partnership in several different jurisdictions have strengthened the position of XRP as a practical utility coin. Price momentum has made a comeback too with XRP rising steadily as it broke through key resistance levels. Analysts highlight positive technical structures that could propel the asset toward new highs. Combined with speculation around the potential of an XRP ETF, sentiment around the coin is looking increasingly optimistic. XRP is considered by many to be a safer long-term bet. For investors who want to get exposed to the adoption of blockchain without the extreme volatility, it remains to be a cornerstone option. MAGACOIN FINANCE Designed for Explosive ROI MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured attention for very different reasons. Built with token economies based on scarcity, the altcoin applies a 12% burn upon every transaction. These prices constantly supply pressure to value appreciation in support of long term value appreciation. Unlike many projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has paired its community appeal with structure and credibility. The altcoin has been audited entirely by respected firms adding further as a trust for the investor pool. Analysts point to this transparency as a rare strength in a market that is often riddled with conjectures of unverified statements. But what makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out most is its return potential. Analysts suggest the coin could have 2000% ROI before the market even reaches the $100 trillion mark. This projection is based on both the deflationary mechanics, and also on its positioning as a rising name in the altcoin space. For investors seeking higher risk and reward, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly moving onto watchlists. The $100 Trillion Market Outlook The wider environment is conducive to both types of assets. Forecasts of 4 billion crypto users by 2030, however, means established players like XRP will continue to anchor adoption. At the same time, high-upside tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioned to capture higher inflows. Institutional adoption, retail growth and regulatory progress all point toward a maturing industry. In such an environment, portfolios may consist of a rapidly growing mix of both stable utility coins and riskier altcoins with exponential growth potential. Which Altcoin Is the Best Buy? For conservative investors, XRP remains a proven choice that has great utility and partnerships, as well as adoption. For risk-tolerant investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers bold upside with analysts pointing to 2000% ROI potential. As the crypto market continues to make its way to $100 trillion, it is a question of strategy. Do you prioritize stability with XRP, or chase upside gains with MAGACOIN FINANCE?

According to on-chain data from ValidatorQueue.com, the exit backlog has surged to unexpected levels, and the investors making the withdrawals are now facing a wait time of more than 44 days before their ETH is fully unstaked. This sudden spike in withdrawals raises serious questions about the possibility of looming selling pressure and how it might affect the Ethereum price. Largest Exit Queue Ever Recorded According to data from ValidatorQueue.com, about 2.6 million ETH were queued up to be unstaked, its largest exit number on record. This exit queue number dwarfs all previous periods of validator exits since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake in September 2022. At its peak, the ETH tokens in the queue were worth about $12 billion. Interestingly, the chart data from ValidatorQueue shows a growing trend of more validators unstaking their ETH in recent weeks, as evidenced by the parabolic rise since mid-August. Analyst MartyParty commented on social media platform X , stating, “Ethereum Staking Exit Queue parabolic.” Such a large-scale withdrawal event highlights growing unease among stakers, and institutional participants or large staking providers are behind the sudden mass exits. The exit queue has witnessed a parabolic rise in recent months that is hard to ignore. This rise started in July 2025, when the average number of ETH waiting to be unstaked jumped from below 10,000 ETH to about 250,000 ETH within a matter of days. By the end of the month, the exit queue had escalated and climbed past 740,000 ETH. August also saw a similar rise, with queue numbers averaging around 800,000 ETH before crossing 1 million ETH at the end of the month. Now, the queue numbers have more than doubled in September, reaching a peak of 2.63 million ETH last week. As it stands, there are more than 2.4 million ETH waiting to leave the network. The backlog is so large that validators are facing an estimated 43 days and 3 hours of wait time before their ETH can be fully unstaked. Implications For Ethereum Price With more than $12 billion in ETH queued for withdrawal, the looming question is whether this will translate into significant sell pressure on exchanges. If these withdrawals are liquidated, the Ethereum price could face downward pressure. This would damage Ethereum’s rally, which has picked up this week. However, not all unstaked ETH is necessarily heading for the open market. Some may be repositioned into restaking protocols or into Spot Ethereum ETFs. On the other hand, ETH staking has slowed down massively. At the time of writing, 451,950 ETH are currently in the entry queue to be staked. This is a 53% decline from 959,717 ETH on September 5. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,572, up by 2.1% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Staking Exit Queue|ethusd|ETHUSDT|MartyParty|spot Ethereum ETFs|ValidatorQueue.com,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-19 00:00:08

He shared a video that begins with an image of a figure standing on a downward line, symbolizing what many might see as a decline in the market, and Squire suggests that it’s time to sell XRP because the bull market is over. However, as the clip continues, it zooms out to reveal that the apparent downturn is part of a much larger upward trajectory. This mirrors a common sentiment among XRP supporters who view recent market struggles as temporary setbacks rather than permanent shifts. Squire’s Perspective on XRP Squire used the video to express his opinion on the current state of the market. While on the surface his comments may seem pessimistic, the full context of the video conveys a different message. Through the video, he highlights how short-term declines can sit within longer-term growth phases. The bull market is over, time to sell everything $XRP pic.twitter.com/7ugK5WOpKI — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 17, 2025 XRP has experienced difficulties in recent months, with price movements falling short of expectations. The asset reached a new all-time high of $3.65 in July, but has struggled since, losing multiple key support levels. Some investors have grown frustrated, pointing to underperformance compared to other digital assets. Yet, despite these challenges, Squire and many others still emphasize XRP’s long-term potential . His post reflects a segment of the community that regards the current environment as a time to reassess rather than abandon positions. One commenter suggested that now is the best time to buy more, reiterating the belief in the asset’s long-term trajectory.

The asset’s technology and established partnerships remain key reasons why many retain confidence in it. Squire’s post signals that although price volatility can unsettle traders, it does not necessarily diminish the asset’s prospects. This video reinforces the belief that temporary market downturns can coexist with the potential for future appreciation. Many investors view times of uncertainty as opportunities to evaluate assets more closely. XRP is trading at $3.12, and investors are already seizing the opportunity to buy the dip and accumulate tokens.

This comes in the wake of concerns about the exchange’s alleged ties to President Donald Trump’s administration and the potential easing of regulatory oversight. Warren Pressures DOJ On Binance Compliance Following years of legal challenges, which culminated in the resignation and brief imprisonment of former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) over allegations of money laundering in the US, Binance appeared to have navigated a path toward a more favorable regulatory environment during Trump’s presidency. However, in a recent letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Warren, along with two fellow Democratic senators, pressed for confirmation that Binance is adhering to the ongoing requirements stipulated in its plea agreement related to charges, including money laundering and violations of US sanctions laws. Related Reading: REX Shares Claims Its DOGE And XRP Spot ETFs Will Be Approved By US SEC Tomorrow The senators expressed their concerns over reports of meetings between Binance executives and Treasury Department officials, seeking clarity on the administration’s role in ensuring the exchange’s compliance with the settlement. Warren’s letter highlighted several specific inquiries. She requested information about the Department’s efforts to guarantee Binance’s compliance with its plea agreement, the status of the company’s anticipated exit from the US market, and any discussions regarding a potential pardon for Zhao. This follows the former CEO’s official request for a presidential pardon earlier this year, after rumors from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg suggested that CZ and Trump would be collaborating. The senators also sought details about conversations relating to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralised finance (DeFi) venture run by the president’s sons, and its plans to list a new stablecoin called USD1 on the Binance platform. Lawmakers Demand Clarity In a response from the Department of Justice on September 12, officials summarized Binance’s plea agreement and confirmed that the exchange had paid all penalties due. However, the senators asserted that the response failed to address their key questions, particularly regarding Binance’s compliance with ongoing requirements. The letter concluded as follows: These reports make it more important than ever that the public understand the Trump Administration’s interactions with, and relationship to, Binance and its employees. We therefore once again request meaningful answers to the questions above by no later than October 1, 2025. Related Reading: Coinbase Vs.

The shift was announced by the bank’s vice-chairman and former governor of Brazil’s central bank, Roberto Campos Neto. Addressing the Meridian 2025 event yesterday, he discussed blockchain’s role in linking digital assets and traditional banking. The local media quoted Campos Neto as saying Nubank would soon start testing stablecoin payments with its credit cards in what it sees as a broader attempt to connect digital assets into mainstream banking. The data reveals that people aren’t buying for transactions, they’re buying as a store of value,’ he was quoted as saying. “We need to get to the bottom of why this is happening. I think it’s shifting a little bit, but we have to be aware of it.” He also noted that the challenge for banks is finding a way to accept deposits in tokenized forms and use these assets to issue credit for clients. Nubank expands crypto services as stablecoin use surges across Latin America Founded in São Paulo in 2013, Nubank is a Brazilian digital bank serving over 100 million customers across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. The bank entered the digital asset space in 2022 by allocating 1% of its net assets to Bitcoin and rolling out crypto trading for its customers. In March 2025, Nubank broadened its crypto lineup by adding four altcoins, giving customers access to Cardano, Cosmos, Near Protocol, and Algorand. Stablecoin adoption is surging across Latin America. In Brazil, the president of the Central Bank revealed at a Bank for International Settlements event in February that 90% of crypto activity in the country is tied to stablecoins. Dollar-pegge d digital assets are also gaining traction in Argentina, where inflation has surpassed 100% in recent years. A March 2025 report from Bitso showed that USDT and USDC accounted for 50% and 22% of all cryptocurrency purchases in Argentina in 2024, respectively. Across Bitso’s platforms in the region, stablecoins represented 39% of all crypto purchases that year. Adoption is spreading to other countries as well. In July 2025, the Central Bank of Bolivia signed an agreement with El Salvador to promote crypto as a “viable and reliable alternative” to fiat. Since lifting its crypto ban in June 2024, Bolivian banks have been permitted to process Bitcoin and stablecoin transactions. In Venezuela, where inflation reached 229% in May, stablecoins such as USDT are increasingly replacing the bolívar in everyday transactions, from groceries to salaries. Chainalysis data indicates that stablecoins accounted for 47% of all crypto transactions under $10,000 in 2024. Nu Holdings sees profit soar 42% as Nubank shifts focus Nu Holdings, the parent company of Brazilian digital lender Nubank, reported a 42% year-on-year rise in net profit on a foreign exchange-neutral basis on Thursday, sending its shares up more than 8% in after-hours trading . The company, which has 123 million clients in Brazil — its core market — Colombia, and Mexico, made a second-quarter net profit of $637 million for the three months to June. Revenue was $3.7 billion, a 40% increase from the previous year. In an interview, the company’s chief financial officer, Guilherme Lago, said the profit increase resulted from operational leverage and top-line growth, but that factors underpinning that increase were beginning to shift. “If in the last three to five years a lot of our growth has come from adding new customers, in the next three to five years, much more of our revenue growth in Brazil will come from deepening the relationship with those customers,” Lago said. Nubank’s annualized return on equity, a measure of profitability, settled at 28%, compared to the year-earlier figure reported. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The case will test the limits of presidential power and could have major economic consequences. The tariffs, which are still in place, have served as the backbone of Trump’s trade and foreign policy decisions since he secured reelection in January. He enforced them by invoking emergency powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a statute enacted in 1977. Critics have said this was an abuse of authority, while the supporters believe it’s a bold defense of American jobs and security. Courts rule Trump went too far On August 29, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit struck a major blow to Donald Trump’s trade policy. The judges said that the president had overstepped his authority when he ordered the imposition of tariffs at a global level, using emergency powers under a statute known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The judges emphasized that IEEPA never intended to give presidents unlimited authority over tariffs. Rather, the law was written for limited use in national emergencies related to foreign threats. Previous presidents often deployed it to slap sanctions on or freeze the assets of unfriendly governments. None of them had used it to remake global trade, however. The court said that Trump went too far in using IEEPA to impose tariffs on various imports. The ruling underscored that Congress, not the president, possesses the constitutional power to regulate trade and lay duties. The decision came after months of legal wrangling after a coalition of 12 states, led by Democratic attorneys general from New York, Oregon, and Colorado, sued against the tariffs. They said the tariffs lifted consumer costs, wounded local businesses, and disrupted supply chains. Small businesses also scrambled into the fight, with a number saying their costs had risen with the imposition of the tariffs on imported materials and that they had less room for profit on sales. One of the biggest challengers is Learning Resources, a family-owned toy maker. The company said in court documents that the tariffs significantly increased production costs and jeopardized its survival in a competitive industry. The tariffs will stay in place while that legal process continues, even though the ruling went against the government. That means American importers will be paying higher duties for the time being. Consumers’ prices rise on various products – from household goods to electronics and toys. Supreme Court to weigh presidential power Now, the court will determine whether Trump’s use of IEEPA squares aligns with the law. The tariffs and the balance of power between Congress and the presidency are at stake. Lawmakers from both parties have urged the administration not to proceed with tariffs. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and Trump ally, told CNN that changing trade policy in ways that affect Americans is beyond a president’s authority. He said Congress should decide on tariffs, as it traditionally does. Trump argues, however, that national security and financial stability give the president wide powers to act. A ruling for Trump could greatly expand executive power in economic affairs . Future presidents might employ emergency laws to reshape trade without involving Congress. If the court comes down against him, it would restrict presidential power and force the U.S. government to refund hundreds of billions of dollars collected in tariffs. That could blow a hole in federal revenue and roil global markets. Trading partners, already unnerved by the prospect of tariffs, are watching closely. Economists say the uncertainty has contributed to market volatility and weakened investor confidence. Trump, for his part, has doubled down on his approach, saying tariffs are an important tool to shield U.S. industries, slash trade deficits, and pressure other countries like China, Mexico, and Canada to crack down on the flow of illegal drugs or unfair trading practices. Just recently, Scott Bessent said that Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are likely to pass Supreme Court scrutiny, but warned the Treasury may be forced to return hundreds of billions in tariff revenue if the court rules against the White House. Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press, the Treasury Secretary noted he was “confident” Trump’s trade moves would be upheld. Still, he admitted that “we would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” if the court strikes them down. “If the court says it, we’d have to do it,” he added.

Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner and head of policy at a16z crypto, was tapped by President Donald Trump in February to lead the derivatives regulator. His nomination was initially supported by a coalition of crypto industry groups , who argued he was “exceptionally well-suited” for the role given his experience with digital assets. But a series of delays in the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the agency, has left his confirmation in limbo. White House Vets New CFTC Chair Picks Amid Crypto Oversight Debate According to Bloomberg report, the White House is now weighing additional names, including officials with experience in crypto regulation and digital asset policy. Michael Selig, chief counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force and a former partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, has been floated as a contender. Tyler Williams, counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on digital assets and a former executive at Galaxy Digital, has also been discussed. Neither has commented publicly on the matter. BREAKING: White House seeks new crypto-focused candidates for CFTC chair after Quintez’s confirmation stalls. — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) September 18, 2025 The search reflects growing urgency as the CFTC prepares for a larger role in digital asset oversight. The agency traditionally regulates derivatives markets, but pending legislation in Congress could expand its authority over spot trading in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether. The CFTC already oversees trillions of dollars in swaps and futures trading, and its influence in crypto policy has grown under outgoing chair Rostin Behnam. Behnam, who stepped down in January , presided over the agency during some of its most aggressive actions in crypto enforcement, including the $4.3 billion settlement with Binance. He consistently argued that the CFTC is best positioned to regulate digital commodities and warned that large portions of the crypto market remain unregulated. His departure left the agency under Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who had signaled she plans to return to the private sector once a permanent leader is confirmed. The delay over Quintenz’s nomination escalated after reports surfaced that Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss privately urged Trump to reconsider his choice. In June, Politico reported the brothers had raised concerns that Quintenz would not fully back the president’s crypto agenda. Weeks later, the White House requested the Senate Agriculture Committee to pause a scheduled vote. Quintenz later suggested on social media that the president “might have been misled” by the twins, posting screenshots of private exchanges he claimed to have had with Tyler Winklevoss before his hearing was delayed. I’ve never been inclined to release private messages. But in light of my support for the President and belief that he might have been misled, I’ve posted here the messages that include the questions Tyler Winklevoss asked me pertaining to their prior litigation with the CFTC. I… pic.twitter.com/MN75M1XUpT — Brian Quintenz (@BrianQuintenz) September 10, 2025 The situation has been complicated by allegations involving Kalshi, a prediction market platform facing scrutiny over its operations, which further fueled calls for caution around Quintenz’s nomination. Officials close to the process say the White House has not officially withdrawn his name, but the administration is actively vetting alternatives. With only two sitting commissioners currently on the five-member panel, the CFTC is operating with limited capacity. Industry advocates warn that further delays in filling the chair could hinder progress on crypto regulation, even as demand for oversight grows. For now, the White House has declined to comment, leaving the future of the CFTC’s leadership uncertain. CFTC Opens Door to Spot Bitcoin and Ether Trading Despite Leadership Vacuum As the White House reconsiders its stalled nomination of Brian Quintenz to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator itself is pressing ahead with a flurry of new crypto initiatives. In August, Acting Chair Caroline Pham unveiled a plan to permit spot cryptocurrency trading on exchanges already registered with the CFTC. CFTC plans to allow spot crypto trading on regulated futures exchanges, advancing efforts to implement US digital asset policy. #CFTC #SpotCrypto https://t.co/g0mdpetrnJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 The move, described as the first step in the agency’s “crypto sprint,” would allow Designated Contract Markets that currently trade futures to also list spot products such as Bitcoin and Ether. The initiative comes as Congress weighs the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, which could formally expand the CFTC’s authority over digital assets. To prepare, the agency has upgraded its market surveillance tools, adopting Nasdaq’s monitoring platform to detect manipulation and fraud in both derivatives and crypto markets. Coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission is also accelerating. In early September, the two agencies released a joint statement confirming that registered exchanges may facilitate spot crypto trading . A revised draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act further calls for a joint advisory committee on digital assets, with explicit protections for developers and decentralized finance participants. With the CFTC advancing reforms under temporary leadership, the search for a permanent chair has become more pressing, leaving the White House under pressure to resolve its stalled nomination process.

The rapid influx of investor demand highlights Pepesnix as one of the fastest-growing crypto presales of 2025, with momentum showing no signs of slowing. A Milestone That Signals Investor Confidence The presale launched just days ago and has already attracted thousands of investors worldwide. Surpassing the half-million mark this quickly places Pepesnix in the same league as early-stage successes like Shiba Inu and Pepe — projects that went on to generate multi-billion-dollar market caps. Key presale highlights so far: $500,000 raised within days of launch Rapidly growing investor base across North America, Europe, and Asia Strong community expansion with thousands joining Telegram and Twitter channels daily Presale stages selling out faster than projected Crypto analysts suggest that Pepesnix’s strong debut signals not just short-term hype, but the foundation of a project capable of sustaining growth through listings and beyond. The Meme Coin to Watch in 2025 Pepesnix is gaining traction thanks to its fair launch mechanics, viral meme branding, and sustainable tokenomics designed for long-term growth. With allocations for liquidity, marketing, and staking, $PEPEX is structured for both immediate excitement and lasting value. “This milestone proves that investors see Pepesnix as more than another meme coin,” said a spokesperson for the project. “Surpassing $500,000 so quickly demonstrates strong confidence in our vision and confirms Pepesnix’s place as one of the most exciting presales of 2025.” Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, Pepesnix is built to balance community energy with structural safeguards like anti-whale and anti-bot protections, giving everyday investors a fair chance to participate. A Perfect Market Moment The milestone comes at a time when crypto presales are heating up in 2025. With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the market into a bullish phase, meme coins have historically been the next sector to rally. Pepesnix is launching at the perfect moment to capitalize on this momentum, drawing parallels to Dogecoin’s rise in 2021 and Shiba Inu’s run in 2022. As market sentiment turns increasingly positive, Pepesnix’s viral branding and growing community could position it as one of the breakout stars of the cycle. How to Join Before the Next Milestone Investors eager to get in before the next stage price increase can still participate in the presale by visiting the official website: https://pepesnix.com/ . Steps to join: Connect a Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Select a payment option (ETH, USDT, USDC, or SOL if supported). Complete your purchase before the current stage sells out. The earlier investors secure their tokens, the more favorable their entry price will be. About Pepesnix Pepesnix ($PEPEX) is a meme coin project that combines viral internet culture with sustainable blockchain tokenomics. Built to be fair, community-driven, and exchange-ready, Pepesnix is positioning itself as the most talked-about meme coin of 2025. With explosive presale momentum and a rapidly growing community, Pepesnix is on track to become one of the year’s defining crypto stories.

While SHIB’s rally is a cyclical reflection of the resurgence of memecoins, Mutuum Finance is creating a completely new narrative based on real utility and sustainable development. As a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, MUTM offers investors access to a platform which is set to create tangible value independent of speculation. With its innovative model and rapidly growing user base, many analysts see Mutuum Finance emerging as one of the next big cryptos. Shiba Inu Pops Up as Support Moves In Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001307, with intraday highs reaching $0.00001361 and lows dipping as low as $0.00001296. The token has been showing gradual upward momentum, driven primarily by community buying, higher social activity, and fresh speculation. Resistance is near $0.000014, and support is floating around $0.0000129–$0.0000131, suggesting SHIB could test higher levels if buying volume increases. Contrasted with SHIB’s largely sentiment-driven action, Mutuum Finance, is viewed by analysts as having more upside potential under current market conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance offers investors an opportunity to be part of the project’s early adopters and buy tokens at a much lower price. Selling for $0.035 per MUTM in presale Phase 6, the token’s price will increase to $0.04 in Phase 7. Presale has been a success, with over $15.9 million raised and more than 16,370 token holders, which indicates good investor sentiment and market confidence. To enhance security, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK, with payouts of up to $50,000 USDT. Publicly open, the program invites white-hat hackers, developers, and researchers to scan for possible vulnerabilities in the codebase. Rewards are tiered by severity to ensure that even minor issues get resolved before release. The program is a testament to Mutuum’s commitment to safety, transparency, and investor confidence. MUTM is a hybrid two-tier lending protocol with Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms for optimal flexibility. With the P2C system, contracts continuously track the market to calculate interest rates. The structure enables investors to gain passive income and borrowers to borrow at competitive interest rates, and transactions are automatically performed by the contracts. The P2P model guarantees direct interaction between borrowers and lenders, eradicating the need for intermediaries. This more hands-on alternative is perfect for riskier assets, such as meme coins, and grants autonomy and effectiveness in a trustless environment. Infrastructure and Price Discovery For receiving accurate and timely price data, Mutuum Finance deploys Chainlink oracles, consolidating valuations for top-cap assets such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain data feeds are also deployed for accuracy even in the scenario of volatile markets. The strong pricing foundation is leveraged in stable collateral management, liquidation, and risk analysis to maintain the protocol stable and efficient in all scenarios. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly turning out to be the next DeFi sensation while Shiba Inu (SHIB) aims for a top 10 position. Stage 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, and will jump 14.29% to $0.04 in Stage 7. The project has recorded $15.9M with 16,370+ holders already in. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a P2C/P2P lending dual framework, and Chainlink-based price discovery, MUTM is scalable and secure.

The South Korean custodian BDACS recently launched KRW1, the country’s first Korean won–backed stablecoin, fully collateralized with deposits at Woori Bank. The stablecoin is in its pilot phase after a successful proof of concept, putting Avalanche at the forefront of Korea’s digital asset integration. Similarly, in Japan, Avalanche is collaborating with industry giants such as SMBC, one of the nation’s largest banks, and retail groups like Densan to develop stablecoin-powered payment systems. AVAX Network Activity and DeFi Boom The expansion of stablecoin utilities coincides with a surge in network activity on Avalanche. In August alone, decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surpassed $12 billion, marking an eightfold increase in just two months. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on Avalanche has also exceeded $450 million, with institutions like Grove Finance and SkyBridge driving adoption. DeFi protocols such as UNI, Pharaoh, Benqi, and LFJ are thriving, pushing Avalanche’s total value locked (TVL) above $2 billion. UNI, for example, has posted a 97% gain in the past month, reflecting growing user activity and liquidity across the network. Avalanche Price Targets $42 as Institutional Interest Grows Currently, AVAX is trading near $33, up over 9.4% in the past 24 hours. The token recently broke above a key pivot at $31.05, supported by bullish technical indicators including an RSI of 68.44 and a positive MACD histogram. Analysts suggest that a decisive breakout above $34.50 could propel AVAX toward its next resistance at $42. Institutional adoption is also on the horizon. With four AVAX ETF filings awaiting regulatory approval, inflows from traditional finance could act as a major catalyst for price growth. Combined with Asia’s growing stablecoin market and Avalanche’s thriving DeFi ecosystem, AVAX aims to become a leading Layer-1 blockchain prepared to challenge rivals in the next crypto bull cycle.

However, recent data from Binance shows that BTC’s current price action is largely supported by retail investors, while whales have been noticeably absent. Bitcoin Holds $117,500 Amid High Retail Inflows According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Bitcoin is hovering around the $117,500 price level, supported by active inflows from retail investors. Notably, large whale inflows have been completely absent, indicating that the current market is being driven by individuals more than by large wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Shift Strategy: Accumulation Over Selling Signals Stronger Bull Cycle Inflows ranging from 0 to 0.001 BTC recorded approximately 97,000 BTC. Similarly, inflows from the 0.001 to 0.01 BTC segment totaled nearly 719,000 BTC. The distribution above suggests that Bitcoin’s current rally is largely driven by retail investors. These investors conduct numerous but small-volume transactions, confirming that individual investors are shaping the market dynamics. Arab Chain added: The figures reveal that the bulk of inflows are concentrated in small and medium-sized transactions, reflecting the dominance of retail activity in Bitcoin trading. This liquidity, despite its limited scale, has helped keep the market balanced at current levels. It is worth emphasizing that there has been almost no whale pressure during the current market rally. Specifically, no significant surges in inflows of more than 100 BTC were observed, mitigating the likelihood of a sharp short-term price correction. To conclude, the current market situation shows that Bitcoin is experiencing a state of equilibrium, largely due to heightened retail investor participation. Such a scenario gives the market an opportunity to steadily surge toward the important $120,000 resistance level. That said, it would be wise to keep an eye on any whale activity, as it could quickly alter the market’s direction. Any sudden entry of whale inflows could trigger a rapid price correction, similar to previous market tops. Experts Divided On BTC Price Action As Bitcoin trades about 5.4% below its all-time high (ATH), there are signs that the top cryptocurrency by market cap may be on the cusp of a fresh rally. For instance, BTC recently broke above the mid-term holder breakeven, reducing the likelihood of an immediate sell-off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Faces Supply Squeeze As Scarcity Index Turns Positive Again Recent positive developments – such as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) reducing interest rates by 25 basis points – could reinvigorate the crypto market. Against that backdrop, crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes recently reiterated his ambitious $1 million BTC prediction. That said, gold bug Peter Schiff opines that BTC has likely already peaked for this market cycle. At press time, BTC trades at $117,523, up 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

The post frames XRP as a tool to handle trillions of dollars sitting idle in nostro and vostro accounts globally, showing the scale of the issue the asset aims to solve. Utility Over Hype In the video, Garlinghouse stresses that the long-term value of any digital asset must stem from its usefulness rather than speculation. He notes that investors and industry participants should ask what problem a token solves, how large that problem is, and how many customers it serves. “There’s no question there’s a lot of hype in this system, and I don’t actually think that’s a good thing,” he says, highlighting Ripple’s approach as grounded in solving tangible financial challenges . #XRP is solving a global payments problem Trillions of dollars are parked in nostro / vostro accounts globally pic.twitter.com/z8nc77plct — XRP_Cro AI / Gaming / DePIN (@stedas) September 16, 2025 XRP’s Use Case Garlinghouse explains that Ripple uses XRP specifically to settle liquidity needs between banks . According to him, about $27 trillion is currently parked at financial institutions around the world so they can facilitate payments with one another. He argued that a digital asset like XRP can handle this process in real time, eliminating the need for such large reserves and revolutionizing this massive cross-border payment market . “Because XRP has been so efficient, it settles a transaction in about three seconds compared to Bitcoin in one hour,” Garlinghouse added. He clarified that XRP “just passes through that currency for that period of time,” highlighting its role as a bridge asset rather than a long-term holding. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential for Growth Garlinghouse’s comments reinforce Ripple’s positioning of XRP as a functional solution rather than a speculative asset. By focusing on liquidity for banks, XRP directly targets a massive existing problem in the global financial system. If banks and financial institutions continue to adopt the technology, XRP’s utility could increase significantly. The emphasis on speed and cost efficiency also aligns with the industry’s push toward instant cross-border settlements, making XRP attractive to institutions looking to modernize their operations. A Utility-Driven Future for Digital Assets The video highlights how Ripple sees its digital asset as more than just a store of value. XRP is an enabling technology that solves problems, and Garlinghouse’s statements indicate confidence that efficiency and utility will drive adoption, especially when dealing with trillions of dollars in global transfers.

The launch started Thursday for Mac and Windows desktop users whose browser language is English. The change is the first step of a broader rollout as the company said that iOS users would soon have Gemini in Chrome, and the move was also coming to Android. Business customers using Google Workspace will have access in the weeks ahead, as will mobile users throughout the United States. The move is the first time Google has seamlessly integrated Gemini into its popular browser. Over half of internet users worldwide use Chrome, meaning the AI could have found a massive audience. Gemini brings new features to Chrome Gemini is built to make browsing smarter and more seamless. Users can type questions into the address bar and receive answers from the service’s artificial intelligence. It can also auto-summarize long articles, fetch past pages, and take on several tasks simultaneously. Google says the integration will also link Gemini with other apps , including Calendar, Maps, and YouTube. In other words, the AI can assist with calendaring, directions, or surfacing video without you needing to exit from Chrome. The company shared new “agentic” features in the works. These will allow Gemini to complete multi-step actions like booking tickets, compiling documents, or collating research from multiple websites. Google is positioning it as a tool that does more than answer; it acts. The browser is receiving additional security tools to help users stay safe. Gemini will also assist in detecting scams, managing passwords, and recommending safer browsing practices. The timing of the launch is especially pointed, coming after a federal judge recently denied a US government request to split Google’s business apart, only weeks ago. Judge Amit Mehta determined that the company will not be required to divest itself of Chrome or the Android mobile system . The ruling is an unusual victory for Big Tech in Washington. However, the court also ruled that Google must share some data with its rivals to foster equal competition. It also limited exclusive contracts, which had assisted Google in keeping competitors off. The decision allows Google to continue developing Chrome on its own terms, but the company will face greater oversight from regulators. The introduction of Gemini in Chrome will likely bring renewed scrutiny to whether the company is wielding its dominant power to gain an edge over smaller rivals. Competition in AI browsers is heating up Google’s move also comes as the competition in AI-driven browser technology heats up. Perplexity, a competitor with investors behind it, has promoted its Comet browser to allow users to complete tasks. In August, it even made a surprise $34.5 billion all-cash bid for Chrome that Google rejected. Apple, meanwhile, has been in discussions with Google about adopting Gemini for its Siri voice assistant, The Information reported earlier this year. That illustrates the demand throughout the tech industry to embed more powerful AI tools in everyday software. By incorporating Gemini into Chrome, Google is not simply trying to protect its search supremacy. It attempts to make AI a central part of people’s web browsing. For everyday users, Gemini on Chrome translates to faster answers, more intelligent organization, and less time spent jumping between apps. It also means browsing could be less about searching and more about having a behind-the-scenes assistant on deck. For rivals, it amps up pressure to innovate quickly. At the same time, for regulators, it crystallizes the question of how much influence one company should have in determining the future of the web. Google’s victory in court provides it room to charge ahead. However, how Chrome manages Gemini will tell whether users consider it a helpful innovation or more of a Big Tech incursion.

If the launch becomes successful, the blockchain network will be positioned as the eighth biggest crypto network for stablecoin liquidity. The announcement came after the network shared a blog entry highlighting that its mainnet beta and the XPL token will be launched next week. The network also mentioned that it will have $2 billion in stablecoins ready for the launch. Interestingly, Plasma has already secured a strong support system from Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer in the crypto market, and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. Plasma intends to upgrade its system to enhance its users’ experience The Plasma stablecoin blockchain has made public its intentions to invest significantly in more than 100 DeFi partners. This includes top DeFi protocols such as Aave, Euler, Fluid, and Ethena. With this investment, the team seeks to provide instant benefits, create savings that maintain value, develop deep USDT markets, and offer the lowest borrowing rates, particularly for USDT, in the industry. In the meantime, it is anticipated that Plasma users will be able to access vault deposits and withdraw USDT from the account when the mainnet beta is launched. Concerning this, the team stated that the event will indicate the end of their final launch phase and grant all its users the privilege to enjoy zero-fee USDT transfers. The network has also vowed to introduce PlasmaBFT, a high-throughput consensus layer responsible for overseeing stablecoin transactions as part of its mainnet beta launch. With this tremendous objective, its users can easily move USDT without being subjected to any fees through authorization-based transfers. Plasma aims at solidifying its position as a leading blockchain network in digital dollars Concerning its mainnet beta and native token, XPL’s launch, Plasma has alerted its users that it will restrict zero-fee transfers to its products. Notably, this will apply during the launch and testing phase. This will, however, not apply to other services. The announcement came after the team said it plans to gradually permit zero-cost transfers for other services. To solidify its position as a leading network for digital dollars, Plasma intends to link with real-life peer-to-peer cash systems to enable digital dollars to extend their reach to more businesses. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, had earlier offered a pre-market perpetual contract for XPL, which supports the Plasma stablecoin blockchain, with prices mounting to about $0.55. Following its launch, the network’s team has stated that at the beginning of the mainnet beta, they will give out an additional 25 million XPL tokens as a reward to its users, particularly those who finished Sonar verification and actively participated in the sale. In addition, they will put aside 2.5 million XPL for current and future members of the Stablecoin Collective. In the case of XPL token distribution, Plasma stated that investors in the US will receive their tokens from July 28, 2026, following legal requirements. Those in other countries who joined the public sale will receive theirs when the mainnet beta is launched.

Laos Turns to Bitcoin Mining for Debt Relief Laos, known as the “battery of Southeast Asia,” is exploring Bitcoin mining to ease its $1.3 billion annual hydropower debt. By using surplus electricity for mining, Laos could convert unused power into globally liquid assets.

Now, as repayment pressures mount, officials are re-evaluating crypto mining as a way to monetize stranded energy. This strategy mirrors Bhutan and Ethiopia, where renewables are being redirected to crypto. It reinforces Bitcoin’s growing narrative as “digital energy money.” Bitcoin Price Forecast – Technical Outlook On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin consolidates inside a rising wedge, trading near $117,366. The 50-SMA at $116,000 and the 200-SMA at $113,243 provide firm support. Candlestick rejections near $115,800 suggest buyers continue to defend key levels, while the RSI at 59 shows cooling momentum without signaling overbought conditions. If BTC closes above $117,978, a climb toward $119,287 and $120,298 is likely, with room for $125K–$130K in the weeks ahead. A break below $116,000 could trigger a pullback toward $114,400 or even $113,200. For now, the bias stays cautiously bullish, with long-term potential for a $500,000 supercycle if liquidity and macro tailwinds align. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $16.8 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012945—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

Officials say Canada needs to quickly implement a regulatory framework for stablecoins, digital tokens linked to traditional money like the Canadian dollar. Ron Morrow, the central bank’s executive director of payments supervision and oversight, said at a conference in Ottawa this week that Canada may have to look at regulating stablecoins nationally. He said Momentum is building not just across the United States but worldwide. And that if Canada were on track and weren’t taking action, it might not matter. The appeal comes as digital payments grow worldwide and stablecoins are becoming inexpensive, swift, and efficient for daily transactions. Morrow emphasized that for stablecoins to work as actual money, they had better be just as safe and stable as the balance in a bank account. Canada urged to lead the way The Bank noted that major economies are moving ahead with digital currencies. The U.S. recently passed the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoin issuers , while the EU is preparing to roll out its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law. Both focus on transparency, robust reserves, and consumer protection. It’s now up to Canadian regulators to follow suit, he and other advocates say. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI ) also subsequently recognized that a regulatory framework for stablecoins that includes licensing, redemption rights, and reserves from issuers is in the works. OSFI also announced that it was prepared to experiment with digital assets as long as they can be easily tracked. Partisan watchers fear that a patchwork, with provinces adopting different rules, would stunt innovation. Now there are calls for federal and provincial regulators to collaborate on a single set of standards. Stablecoins are having a moment, courtesy of something within the industry known as “stablecoin summer.” Cross-border transfers, e-commerce, and instant peer-to-peer payments are some of the causes for their surge in popularity. Users benefit from lower costs and faster speeds than traditional banking rails. However, the Bank of Canada has also raised a warning. If not unlimited, the cost of a stablecoin could be attacked by liquidity-induced crises, credit risks, and ruleless poor governance. Morrow warned that Canadians must be well protected lest stablecoins succumb to the pressure and implode, through the experience of other failed crypto projects across the globe. Bank redirects digital currency strategy toward stablecoin regulation The fight over stablecoins is coming as Canada has internally reconsidered its decision to introduce its central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Bank of Canada researched CBDC with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2022. But the bank said in September 2024 that it was taking a break from its work on the project, citing other priorities, such as an effort to upgrade the country’s real-time payments system. According to surveys, while 42% of Canadians have a positive attitude toward CBDCs, one in five said they either disliked or hated the possibility. Many people in crypto are skeptical about CBDCs because they fear governments can and will deploy them to surveil their citizens and eliminate financial freedom. The central bank has set sights on other private digital assets, such as stablecoins. Advocates say doing so could bring many benefits of digital money without provoking the same public outrage. Moderate Canada is scheduled to release a draft of the stablecoin law in months. That would encompass OSFI, federal politicians, and provincial regulators. If it becomes the industry standard, compliance would guide issuers, create rules protecting consumers, and explain how reserves must be held.

Traders are once again debating whether the meme coin that started it all can reclaim the fabled dollar milestone in the upcoming cycle. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new project combining the energy of meme coins with solid fundamentals is garnering strong interest from analysts. This token is touted by some as one of the gems and undervalued picks of 2025. DOGE Price Action: Building Toward a Breakout Buyers are trying to hold Dogecoin (DOGE $0.2964) above the resistance at $0.26. According to the daily chart for DOGE/USDT, the pair could rise to the $0.29 overhead resistance – a key battleground for bears to defend. If buyers are able to move the price above $0.29 the pair may start a new upward trend towards $0.44 and again speculate on an upward move towards $1 in the next altseason. On the other hand, a rejection at $0.29 for DOGE may see the token remain range-bound for days between $0.29 and $0.14. Analysts are still keeping the prediction for the value of one dollar alive for 2025 due to whale accumulation and ETF speculation. Market Narrative: $1 DOGE Dream Returns In the past, Dogecoin has relied on speculation, community hype, and cycles of accumulation from whales to reach $1. Meme coins are back on the uppers a few months into 2025 which has reinvigorated the Dogecoin $1 dream in the market. Recent reports suggest that deskmoney and high net worth inflows of $300M are whale inflows, which indicates they may be positioning ahead of upcoming catalysts, such as ETF speculation. This background reinforces the argument for DOGE to return to a higher level, as meme coins continue to garner media attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 100x Buzz Meme Coin While Dogecoin fuels discussions about $1, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining 100x buzz as one of the most promising breakout projects of the cycle. Unlike meme coins that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is structured with fundamentals that investors are beginning to recognise: audited smart contracts, a fixed token supply, and a credible presale structure. This foundation supports its scarcity and supply narrative , offering investors a clear alternative to inflationary meme coins. At the same time, the project has become a focal point of community and investor hype , with rapid growth in presale participation and social chatter across X and Telegram. Analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as one of the undervalued picks and hidden gems of 2025 , with a presale entry point still below $0.01. Its ability to combine meme coin energy with structural scarcity has prompted comparisons to early-stage DOGE, fueling speculation that it could deliver significant returns. Conclusion The Dogecoin price prediction of $1 is back on the table, supported by bullish technicals, whale inflows, and ETF speculation. Yet while DOGE carries the weight of history, the market’s appetite for fresh opportunities is fueling new contenders. MAGACOIN FINANCE rise , powered by scarcity-driven fundamentals and vibrant community momentum, is quickly being recognized as one of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. For investors, the strategy may be clear: hold DOGE as the original meme leader, but don’t ignore hidden gems like MAGACOIN FINANCE that could deliver exponential upside in the next altseason.

Price Eyes $4 Retest As Momentum Builds,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/sui-breakout-in-the-horizon-price-eyes-4-retest-as-momentum-builds/,"SUI nears a crucial resistance level as intuitional momentum continues to grow and the network scores major partnerships. Some analysts suggest that the altcoin could see a breakout to new highs if the current levels hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set Up For ‘Promising’ Q4, Next Two Weeks Could Be Decisive SUI $4 Retest In Sight On Thursday, SUI surged 4.2% from its daily opening to reclaim the $3.90 area for the first time in a month. The cryptocurrency has been hovering within the $2.50.00-$4.00 price range after the May breakout, hitting a multi-month high of $4.44 in late July. Since then, the altcoin has failed to reclaim the range’s upper boundary, being rejected twice from this key zone in the past two months. Now, its recent rally has propelled its price back to the range highs, nearing the $4.00 resistance once again. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems asserted that SUI’s low-timeframe structure “is super bullish,” highlighting the recent higher highs (HH). Following its recent breakout from a two-month falling wedge pattern, Sjuul affirmed that the altcoin also confirmed the high-timeframe bullish structure. The market watcher previously suggested that the cryptocurrency could be repeating a similar price action to its early Q3 breakout. Per the post, in Q2, SUI printed a new HH, followed by a correction within a falling wedge formation. Then, the cryptocurrency bounced from the local support and demand area, forming a lower high before rallying to a new HH at the start of Q3. Now, he considers that the price seems “ready to move higher” and that the next leg up could target SUI’s all-time high (ATH) levels. Similarly, Rekt Capital signaled that a successful breakout from the $3.80 would set the stage to revisit the $5.35 ATH. Notably, the current levels coincide with the resistance level of the cryptocurrency’s multi-month downtrend channel. Nonetheless, market watcher CW highlighted that SUI’s current sell wall extends from $3.85 to $4.00, suggesting that the price must hold this crucial area, or it will risk another rejection. What’s Behind The Momentum? SUI’s rally appears to be fueled by institutional interest, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), and positive developments for the network. This week, the Sui Network became one of the launch partners for Google’s Agentic Payments Protocol (AP2). The tech giant’s new standard for AI-driven payments allows AI agents to execute transactions on behalf of users. Moreover, Tuttle Capital joined the Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) buzz and recently filed for a SUI Income Blast ETF to “seek current income” and “exposure to the share price of the daily performance of SUI.” It’s worth noting that at the start of the month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed the final decision on the 21Shares SUI ETF to December 21, 2025. However, many expect that the investment product could be approved as early as October, alongside multiple other crypto-based ETFs that have been delayed for early Q4. Related Reading: BNB Chain Projects Lead Binance Wallet With 2,000x IDO Returns The current DAT strategy trend, which has seen corporations pour billions into cryptocurrencies as treasury reserve assets, has also contributed to SUI’s momentum. At the start of the month, Nasdaq-listed SUI Group Holdings announced it had total holdings of approximately 102 million tokens, worth around $403 million at current prices. The company also authorized a new $50 million stock repurchase program earlier this week. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $3.95, a 10% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Bitcoin, Solana Have Seen A Drop In Perpetual Futures Open Interest In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Open Interest for Bitcoin and other top coins in the cryptocurrency sector. The “ Open Interest ” here refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to a given asset that are currently open on all centralized derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the perpetual futures market. Generally, the total leverage present in the sector rises when this trend develops, so the asset’s price can become more unstable following it. On the other hand, the indicator registering a decline implies holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. Such a trend usually leads to a reduction in leverage, which can make the price act in a more stable manner. Now, first, here’s a chart that shows the trend in the Open Interest for Bitcoin over the past week: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has followed an overall downward trajectory in this period, a sign that a net amount of positions have disappeared. Interestingly, this trend has developed alongside a recovery surge in the BTC price to the $117,000 level. Generally, rallies attract speculative activity so the indicator tends to rise with them, but it would appear that it hasn’t been the case this time around. Solana , the cryptocurrency sixth largest by market cap, has seen a similar trajectory in its Open interest during the past week, as the below chart shows. Thus, it seems both BTC and SOL have seen a cooldown in speculative activity even though their prices have witnessed a net increase over the past week. The same trend, however, hasn’t been seen with some of the other top digital assets. The cryptocurrency number two only to Bitcoin, Ethereum, has witnessed a surge in the Open Interest, implying an increase in demand among the investors for leveraged positioning.

This shift aligns with forecasts from leading analysts, who suggest that the market’s top cryptocurrency may reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months. Some experts even believe that this milestone could be achieved as soon as two weeks from now. Bullish Indicators Emerge Market expert Axel Adler has highlighted key indicators supporting this outlook. He noted on social media platform X that BTC futures are trading at a premium compared to spot prices, with a consistently positive basis. Additionally, the seven-day basis is above the thirty-day average, suggesting a bullish market regime. Related Reading: Coinbase Vs. State Regulators: Crypto Exchange Fights Legal Fragmentation Adler’s analysis suggests a base case probability of around 70% for a continued stepwise uptrend or sideways movement over the next two weeks for the Bitcoin price. He emphasized that if a cluster of bullish signals emerges—such as rising prices, an increasing basis, and growing open interest—this would likely attract fresh long positions and enhance the likelihood of the Bitcoin price achieving a new ATH. Importantly, the Short-Term Holder (STH) Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-scores for both the 155-day and 365-day periods are hovering near zero, indicating that the market is balanced and not in an overheated or oversold state. With the Bitcoin price positioned just above its Short-Term Realized Price, Adler stresses that the stage is set for potential consolidation over the next week or two, followed by a possible surge toward new highs. Adler referred to this anticipated movement as a new “uptober” for Bitcoin and the broader digital asset market. Bitcoin Price Boost Predicted Amidst Strong US Stock Market Performance Adding to the bullish sentiment surrounding the Bitcoin price is the recent performance of US stocks, which have been on a significant uptrend for the past two weeks. Analysts at The Bull Theory have noted a correlation between stock market rallies and the Bitcoin price action, with the analysts suggesting that Bitcoin tends to rise when US equities hit new highs. Related Reading: Next XRP ‘Monster Leg’ Will Start No Earlier Than 2026: Analyst Historical data supports this notion: as seen in the chart below, after an all-time high in the S&P 500, the Bitcoin price has averaged an increase of 12% over 30 days and an impressive 36% over 90 days. If this were to occur again, the Bitcoin price would reach $131,000 and even $178,000 respectively. Similarly, following a Nasdaq all-time high, Bitcoin’s average gains are 16% in 30 days and 46% in 90 days. This scenario would position the market’s leading cryptocurrency at $136,000 and $199,000 if similar price action unfolds from current trading levels of $117,770.

Speaking during a joint interview with Reuters and Bloomberg, Scott made the comments after meetings with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng as part of the U.S.-China trade discussions, which also included talks on TikTok. He made it clear that the yuan, also known as the renminbi, has actually strengthened against the U.S. dollar this year, but collapsed to a record low against the euro. “The RMB is actually stronger this year versus the dollar. Now it’s at an all-time low versus the euro, which is a problem for the Europeans,” Scott, rejecting the idea that Beijing was trying to devalue its currency to gain an unfair edge against Washington. He said Chinese officials haven’t tried anything of the sort with the U.S. and explained the reality behind the currency’s movement: “It’s a closed currency. So they manage the level.” Yuan collapse helps Chinese exports flood europe Since January, the yuan has plunged from 7.5 per euro to over 8.4, triggering concerns across Europe. Meanwhile, against the dollar, it’s gained slightly from 7.3 to 7.1. This divergence has created a lopsided trade dynamic, because while the U.S. has seen its imports from China drop 14% due to aggressive tariffs, Europe has recorded a 6.9% increase in trade with China. So, Scott said the U.S. tariffs are doing what they were meant to do, cutting down the trade deficit. But the redirected flow of Chinese goods is now landing in European markets instead, where the yuan’s weakness is making Chinese exports even cheaper in euro terms. The weakening of the yuan is hitting Europe at a sensitive time, as the European Central Bank (ECB) spent the last year consistently cutting interest rates to support growth across the eurozone. Between June 2024 and June 2025, monetary easing was pushed aggressively, but just as prices were starting to stabilize, cheap Chinese products began flooding the market, triggering deflation. Scope Ratings says EU’s core inflation and wage growth are still above target, even though they’ve cooled slightly. Labor markets remain tight, especially in major economies like Germany, though public spending is up across the continent, especially in defense and infrastructure, which is pushing prices higher again. Plus, a new EU energy trading regime is expected to start in 2027. ECB watches euro strength and deflation risks The ECB has no more rate cuts planned for 2025, according to Scope. But it’s not ruling anything out. The next change in policy will depend on several factors: inflation trends, the growth outlook, US-EU trade relations, and most importantly, the exchange rate. So far this year, the euro has gained 13% against the dollar. If it rises beyond 1.20, it could hurt Europe’s competitiveness and raise fears of deflation. Scott’s comments on the yuan point to a growing divide between how the U.S. and Europe are handling their economic relationship with China. America’s trade strategy under President Donald Trump is designed to push back against Chinese imports, and it’s working by Scott’s count. Europe, on the other hand, is getting hit from two directions—an undervalued yuan and an overvalued euro. The euro is still the second major reserve currency after the dollar.

The well-established crypto exchange partnered with Legion, a European entity focused on initial coin offerings (ICOs), to create Kraken Launch. The partnership allows Legion to distribute selected token sales directly to Kraken’s global user base. Kraken will ensure that those tokens are listed for trading on the exchange shortly after each sale concludes. The companies stated that they will focus on “highest-profile” sales, which are defined as projects with major fundraising milestones. Kraken runs token sales with a dual system Kraken Launch will run sales under a dual system. Around 20% of tokens in each offering will be reserved for users holding a Legion Score. The score measures community loyalty and harmony with project goals. The remainder of the tokens will be available on both Kraken and Legion on a first-come, first-served basis. Each sale will require users to complete Kraken’s intermediate-level KYC verification. And a 0.5% fee will apply to purchases. Kraken Launch will earn revenue through transaction fees collected on token sales. It will also earn revenue from trading fees once new tokens begin trading on the exchange. Kraken and Legion will share this revenue. Brett McLain, Head of Payments and Blockchain at Kraken, said, “Kraken is building the foundation of tomorrow’s financial infrastructure with crypto at its core.” Legion clarified that its token sales are compliant with the European Union’s MiCA framework. The EU requires token issuers to publish a white paper and subjects listed tokens to market-abuse rules. Token sales are inaccessible to users located in the United States, Canada, or Australia. However, Legion has indicated that it is exploring ways to open access in the US by working with the SEC’s crypto task force. Legion builds an ICO underwriting model Legion presents itself as the world’s first ICO underwriter. According to co-founder Matt O’Connor, the model resembles the role underwriters play in traditional IPOs. This includes handling pricing, distribution, compliance, research, and even post-launch support, such as liquidity and market stability. Legion wants to automate regulatory compliance, integrate sell-side research, and provide smoother token distribution. This will create a framework that moves closer to traditional capital markets. Kraken will continue to conduct its own compliance and due diligence reviews before listing tokens. O’Connor stated that, “The next Figma or Reddit won’t IPO. It’ll launch to its community onchain. This partnership is another step toward making that possible.” Kraken has been expanding its product line rapidly during what analysts describe as a more permissive US regulatory climate. Recent expansions include the launch of tokenized stock products in the EU, new perpetuals for retail traders, and the acquisition of trading platform Breakout. Cryptopolitan reported that Kraken is preparing for a public listing by the first quarter of next year. The exchange is working with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to raise up to $1 billion. Kraken Launch is just another milestone for the established exchange as it continues to broaden its business model and reinforce its competitiveness. Get seen where it counts.

This drop makes it the third straight month prices have cooled, and both headline and core inflation are now sitting at that same level. Core inflation, for the record, leaves out the price of fresh food, not because anyone stopped eating, but because it moves too much to be useful for month-to-month analysis. The headline number also came down, falling from 3.1% in July to 2.7% in August, hitting another low not seen since late last year. The “core-core” inflation rate , the one Bank of Japan actually watches when making policy calls, also ticked down — now at 3.3%, after hitting 3.4% in July. That version takes out both fresh food and energy. And if you want to know why this number matters, it’s because it’s the only one they trust to track long-term trends, not just short-term swings. Still, these aren’t big drops. They’re just steady. Bank of Japan holds rates as GDP rises and rice prices slow Rice prices, one of the weirdest but strongest parts of Japan’s inflation problem, finally cooled down a bit. In August, rice inflation was 69.7%, way down from 90.7% in July, but still ridiculously high. People are still paying more for food. No one’s celebrating. But the rate’s drop gave the central bank a little space. The Bank of Japan is making its next rate decision today, and economists in that Reuters survey expect the bank to keep its benchmark policy rate at 0.5%. But some are already calling for change. HSBC analysts, in a note sent out on September 12, said they think the central bank might raise rates by 25 basis points when they meet again in October. The reason? “We believe that the second quarter GDP print, which outperformed market expectations, certainly delivered,” they wrote. They’re referring to Japan’s Q2 GDP, which came in at 0.3% growth quarter-on-quarter, better than the 0.1% expected, and a step up from the revised 0.1% in Q1. The main thing behind it? Exports. The Japanese economy hasn’t exactly been exploding, but it’s showing signs of resilience, and that’s enough for some to think a hike could be coming soon. Trade deal with Trump gives exports relief, Kono pressures BOJ A deal Tokyo reached with Washington in late July gave exporters some breathing room. The U.S. agreed to cut tariffs on Japanese goods to 15%, down from the 25% Donald Trump threatened earlier this year in his “tariff letter.” That deal eased fears in Tokyo, but it didn’t remove all risk. HSBC pointed out that if global trade slows, Japan’s exporters could still feel the pain. Meanwhile, the pressure is rising inside the country too. Taro Kono, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said on September 9 that the BOJ better act fast or prices will keep going up. “If the Bank of Japan delays a rate increase, I think it would mean inflation will continue and everything we import would be higher,” Kono warned. Markets aren’t sitting still either. The Nikkei 225 rose 1.19% on Thursday, hitting a record high for the second straight day. The Topix index also gained 0.84%. Investors are watching the BOJ closely, betting that today’s move — or lack of one — won’t be the last. Over in the bond market, Japan’s 2-year government bond yield climbed to 0.885%, the highest level since June 2008, based on LSEG data. Traders are clearly pricing in a future rate hike. Other markets in Asia moved too. Australia’s ASX/S&P 200 jumped 0.77%. South Korea’s Kospi and Kosdaq were flat at the open. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.4%, and China’s CSI 300 rose 0.13%. Then there’s the wider regional context. The Federal Reserve just cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday and signaled there could be more cuts coming. That move has opened the door for other Asian central banks to follow suit — or get ahead of it. A few already have. The Bank of Korea dropped its rate to a three-year low back in May. Australia’s central bank slashed its rate to a two-year low in August. And India’s central bank cut by 50 basis points in June. All this matters because economies like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore still rely heavily on exports. And despite all the inflation and trade chaos, those three still managed to post better-than-expected GDP growth in Q2. Seoul and Singapore even narrowly dodged technical recessions.

On-chain analytics firm Onchain Lens reported that this wallet had been inactive for nearly two years, making its sudden reactivation a significant signal for traders. According to Arkham Intelligence, the receiving address is shown to be 0x10DF1A308F96a8C653faC87bd161C8A5ae91Dc2b, which traders are closely watching. This shift shows whales moving away from DOGE and potentially targeting other promising meme coins. Here are the top 3 meme coins to buy right now as the market responds to this shift. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The top meme coin to buy The biggest attention grabber in this new meme coin wave is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . It has quickly built a reputation as the meme coin that whales and early investors are rushing toward. Unlike many meme coins that remain vulnerable to bot activity, Little Pepe operates on the only chain where sniper bots cannot interfere, giving fairer opportunities to investors. The project is currently in its twelfth presale stage, with each token selling for $0.0021. Its eleventh stage was sold out earlier than planned, proving that demand is outpacing supply. So far, the presale has already raised an impressive $25.11 million, showing strong confidence in the project’s future. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has also been listed on CoinMarketCap, adding credibility and visibility in the crypto community. Many anonymous experts who have supported some of the most successful meme coins are backing Little Pepe, giving it the type of support that can fuel exponential growth. Market analysts are increasingly pointing to Little Pepe (LILPEPE) as the best meme coin to buy right now. Whales are already shifting capital into the token, and forecasts suggest its price could soar once it lists on major exchanges. Entering the presale stage means investors can secure LILPEPE at a fraction of its projected market value. Adding more excitement, the Little Pepe (LILPEPE) team has launched a mega giveaway between stages 12 and 17 of its presale. The 1st biggest buyer will win 5 ETH, the 2nd biggest buyer 3 ETH, the 3rd biggest buyer 2 ETH, and 15 random buyers will each receive 0.5 ETH. This incentive is attracting more retail participation, further strengthening demand. Its roadmap positions Little Pepe as more than just a meme; it is a movement being “cooked in the cryptowomb” with massive potential to dominate the market. With these foundations in place, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as the number one meme coin to buy during this Dogecoin whale shift. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Strong momentum and breakout signals Following closely is Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), another meme coin gaining strong traction. PENGU’s price has surged 13 percent in the last 24 hours to $0.03475, breaking out of a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. Trading volume has skyrocketed by 300 percent, hitting over $564 million. Meanwhile, open interest rose from $270 million to $310 million, showing heightened participation. PENGU is benefiting from the meme coin hype and strong technical indicators, making it one of the top meme coins to buy. MemeCore (M): Impressive weekly growth The third meme coin on the list is MemeCore (M). Over the last week, it has surged by nearly 194 percent, reaching $1.55 after a 9.3 percent gain in the past 24 hours. The token recently broke through descending wedge resistance, signaling continued upward strength. Trading volume has climbed to $53.7 million, while open interest increased by $10.63 million, showing a surge in retail interest. MemeCore’s consistent performance and strong market activity secure its place as a meme coin to watch closely. Conclusion Among the top three to buy now, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) takes the crown as the top meme coin to buy with its bot-resistant chain, strong presale momentum, and whale participation. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and MemeCore (M) also present solid opportunities, but LILPEPE’s unique advantages and community backing make it the most compelling choice.

In 2025, however, SHIB has struggled to maintain its shine. Trapped within a multi-month trading territory around $0.000012, questions linger about whether Shibarium’s ecosystem can deliver its promises. Amidst Shiba Inu’s struggles, a new meme contender, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , is making waves with a bold new approach, building the first Layer 2 blockchain for memes. With its presale already past $25 million and growing, LILPEPE is proving that the next meme cycle will look very different. Here are three reasons it’s attracting a bigger crowd than SHIB this year. Shiba Inu is stalling while Little Pepe is surging The Shiba Inu price action has been volatile in 2025. Despite a few spikes during broader market breakouts, SHIB has dropped more than 60% from its December highs, and its burn rate has collapsed by over 90%. Shibarium, meant to be SHIB’s growth engine, has failed to generate significant fees or sustain user activity, dampening confidence in the ecosystem. Shiba Inu Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Little Pepe, by contrast, has been accelerating. Its price doubled to $0.0021 in Stage 12 from $0.001 in June, selling 15.5 billion tokens. This rapid rise indicates investor appetite for a meme-focused chain, not another ERC-20 token. While SHIB is battling to regain momentum, Little Pepe is creating it. That difference explains why more new investors are flowing into LILPEPE than Shiba Inu in 2025. A new narrative: Meme Layer 2 vs meme token Shiba Inu grew as a meme token, but its transition into a functional ecosystem has been rocky. Shibarium was pitched as a solution, but has yet to deliver the scalability and token-burning mechanics that investors expected. Little Pepe launches with an entirely new narrative: Meme Layer 2. Instead of trying to retrofit a meme token into a utility chain, it is building a blockchain from the ground up, optimized for meme culture. That means: Ultra-low fees and fast settlement with its zero buy/sell tax model A Meme Launchpad for new projects Bot-proof tech, ensuring sniper bots can’t manipulate launches Little Pepe is positioning itself as the sector leader for this narrative by aligning infrastructure directly with meme coin culture, much like how DeFi and GameFi once defined past bull runs. This fresh angle proves magnetic for investors hungry for the “next big thing.” Community incentives and exchange roadmap Shiba Inu has a large community, but its engagement has weakened in 2025 as holders wait for delayed promises. Little Pepe, meanwhile, is energizing its base with aggressive community-driven rewards. The $777K Giveaway is open to all holders, and a newly launched Mega Giveaway for Stages 12–17 offers more than 15 ETH in prizes to whales and random buyers. These campaigns are maintaining high momentum and onboarding thousands of new participants daily. Additionally, LILPEPE has two top centralized exchange listings confirmed for launch, with a plan already in place to pursue the world’s largest exchange. That gives investors confidence in liquidity, something SHIB had to wait months for during its early days. Why LILPEPE is the smart play over SHIB? Shiba Inu remains one of the better-known meme tokens, but 2025 has exposed cracks in its growth model. Slowing burns, limited Shibarium traction, and falling price action make it harder to convince new investors. On the other hand, Little Pepe is shaping the next meme era with its Layer 2 blockchain for memes, presale momentum, exchange roadmap, and viral community giveaways. That combination explains why LILPEPE is drawing a bigger crowd than SHIB, and why many believe it could be the leading meme play of this cycle.

Now, excitement is shifting to Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a meme-powered Layer-2 that analysts say could deliver Solana-level gains, possibly in just eight weeks. Solana’s journey: A benchmark for crypto wealth Three major factors drove Solana’s meteoric rise: 1. High-Speed, Low-Cost Blockchain – Positioned as an “Ethereum killer,” Solana built an ecosystem capable of supporting NFTs, DeFi, and gaming with ultra-low fees. 2. Community Adoption – Early adopters flocked to the network, creating strong liquidity and network effects. 3. Timing – Launched in a booming cycle, SOL caught the right wave of investor enthusiasm. But here’s the catch: Solana’s explosive 7,200% gain unfolded over five years. For today’s investors seeking faster ROI, the market is shifting attention toward tokens with smaller market caps and higher upside potential. Little Pepe: Solana-level profits on meme speed Unlike most meme coins that rely purely on hype, Little Pepe is engineered for sustainability and utility. It’s more than a meme; it’s a Layer-2 blockchain designed specifically for meme coins, combining viral culture with serious infrastructure. Here’s why analysts believe Little Pepe could compress Solana’s five-year ROI into just two months: Ultra-Low Cap Opportunity – At presale pricing ($0.0021), LILPEPE has enormous upside compared to established giants like SOL. 7,500% Growth Forecast – Projections suggest that early buyers could see 75 times returns once listings go live. Meme Launchpad – The first Layer-2 designed exclusively for meme tokens, ensuring constant demand and activity. Sniper-Bot Resistant—Unlike Ethereum and Solana launches, exploitative bots will not hijack new tokens. CertiK Audit Score : 95.49% – A level of security rarely seen in meme projects. While Solana earned its reputation through speed and scalability, Little Pepe is building the fastest and cheapest chain for memes —a narrative with proven mass appeal. Presale momentum: The window is closing The LILPEPE presale has already raised over $25 million, with Stage 12 nearly sold out at $0.0021 per token. In the next stage, the price increase is projected to set investor gains even before launch, at $0.0022. Only a few recognized their value in the early days of Ethereum and Solana, and listings led to astronomical growth. Those who hesitated missed out on life-changing wealth. Tokenomics that protect holders Unlike meme projects plagued by poor planning, LILPEPE features structured tokenomics designed for long-term sustainability: 26.5% Presale – Rewarding early supporters. 30% Chain Reserves – Ensuring blockchain stability. 10% Liquidity – Smooth exchange trading. 13.5% Staking & Rewards – Incentivizing diamond hands. 10% Marketing – Driving virality with influencer campaigns and strategic branding. 10% DEX Allocation – Ready for decentralized exchange listings. 0% Tax – No hidden costs, fully DeFi aligned. This distribution reflects balance: community-driven, liquidity-ready, and growth-focused. Why 8 weeks could be all it takes The difference between Solana and Little Pepe lies in the speed of adoption. Solana needed years to build its ecosystem; Little Pepe launches with: Exchange Listings Already Confirmed – Two top-tier centralized exchanges at launch. Insider Hints of the Largest Global Exchange – Potentially the same catalyst that helped SHIB explode in 2021. Massive Community Energy – A presale community of tens of thousands, already generating viral buzz. Analysts suggest that LILPEPE could reach $0.15 to $0.20 when trading goes live within weeks. That would transform a $2,500 presale investment into over $183,000, replicating Solana’s five-year ROI in just eight weeks. Meme culture + utility = The perfect storm Dogecoin and Shiba Inu proved that memes alone can make millionaires. Solana proved that Layer-1 blockchains can scale adoption. Little Pepe combines both: the virality of memes and the infrastructure of blockchain utility. That’s a recipe for accelerated adoption, faster than anything we’ve seen in the history of crypto. Final thoughts: Don’t be late again If you missed Solana at $0.20 or Ethereum under $50, you know the pain of watching others turn modest investments into fortunes. With Little Pepe (LILPEPE), investors are given a second chance that could compress years of growth into weeks. 👉 Check out the presale at [LittlePepe.com], join the Telegram , and secure your spot before LILPEPE hits the exchanges.

That beat its old intraday high of 2,466.49, set back on November 25, 2024. It was also about to close above its previous record of 2,442.74, untouched since 2021. The rebound came after months of pressure tied to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs, which had pulled the index down hard back in April. According to data from Bloomberg, this is a full comeback for the small-cap index, which has now bounced roughly 42% from its April 7 low. That April drop came when Trump’s sweeping trade policies spooked global investors, who quickly started dumping anything tied to risk. Small caps took the hit first. But the return of easier Fed policy helped flip the mood. While the S&P 500 usually falls in September, it’s up more than 2.5% so far this month. That’s not typical. Over the last 75 years, it usually drops 0.7% on average during September. This year’s different. Lower rates are keeping the rally alive. Nvidia’s $5 billion Intel deal sends shock across markets The Nasdaq 100 jumped 1% Thursday, led by tech stocks. Nvidia threw down $5 billion into Intel, giving the struggling chipmaker its biggest single-day boost in a while. Intel popped 23%, pulling the whole sector higher. The Russell 2000 followed, adding 2.5% by close. At the same time, FedEx brought its full-year earnings outlook back, a move traders took as a green light to keep buying. Jobless claims also dropped more than expected, the biggest fall in almost four years. That erased earlier gains in the bond market and signaled that companies aren’t laying people off. That’s more fuel for the bulls. Robert Schein, chief investment officer at Blanke Schein Wealth Management, said, “The Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates during a time when stocks are at record highs and the economy is still growing.” That combo, no Fed hawkish shock and solid economic numbers, is keeping people in the market. Traders eye next move as Russell 2000 breaks out Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said the lack of any negative Fed surprises and the start of another rate-cut cycle could cancel out seasonal selling. And for once, September doesn’t look like a landmine. There’s growing confidence the Fed will cut rates by another 75 basis points by Q1 2026. Back to small caps, Matt Maley from Miller Tabak said he’s watching the Russell 2000 more closely than big tech right now. “If they can break above that level in a significant way over the next week or two, it should be very bullish,” Matt said. “If, however, they fail at this level (or slightly above it), it’s going to be quite bearish.” In other words, what happens next with small caps could set the tone for the broader market. While some traders keep talking about a bubble, especially in the S&P 500, others aren’t sold. The top five tech stocks (yes, the usual megacap suspects) have done most of the heavy lifting this year. But their profit growth is still holding up. Critics say it’s a dangerous setup, but there’s no crash yet. Some investors are still underweight on stocks, waiting for better entry points. Others are phasing back in, buying the dips and picking sectors they like. Robert says tech and financials could both benefit from lower rates; tech from valuations, and banks from more mortgage and M&A activity. Meanwhile, data shows the S&P 500 has dropped about 1% on average every September since 1971. But when the Fed’s cutting and the economy’s still standing, it’s different. The index has actually gained 1.2% in those situations.

At the time, the total market cap had sunk below $800 billion. Now, the market has grown 5x, surpassing $3.9 trillion. With the market booming, many undervalued coins are quietly building momentum and offering investors asymmetric upside. Here are four undervalued coins to invest in amid this boom. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme infrastructure with asymmetric upside Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presents a distinct approach from the norm. It’s a Layer-2 meme-focused layer two that prioritizes ultra-low fees, near-instant settlement, and anti-sniper protections. These features may materially reduce the launch-day chaos that has punished earlier meme tokens. Its built-in launchpad, Pepe’s Pump Pad, channels new token launches back into the ecosystem. This infrastructure backing has attracted investors seeking meme coins that don’t just capitalize on hype. The broad interest in Little Pepe is evident in the presale. As of today, the presale is in stage 13. Twelve stages are behind it, and only four are left. The project has raised $25,475,000 in stage twelve, with 15.75 billion tokens sold. The project is supported by meme veterans who have a history of backing prominent meme coins. Their expertise is not just talk. It’s reflected in the project’s roadmap. Currently, Little Pepe has secured a listing on CoinMarketCap, giving it credibility. Two CEXs have already been confirmed ahead of launch. Also, the project’s code has passed the test, passing a Freshcoin and Certik audit with high scores above 95%. Little Pepe combines both narrative and product, and this duality could produce outsized returns if network effects take hold. More launches will lead to more transactions, ultimately resulting in increased demand for LILPEPE. With giveaways driving attention to the presale, Little Pepe has the community backing it needs to scale at launch. For investors seeking asymmetric exposure to meme-driven upside with a stronger technical foundation, Little Pepe may be worth monitoring. Avalanche (AVAX): Institutional moves spark undervalued upside Avalanche (AVAX) is drawing serious attention right now. The Avalanche Foundation is structuring two U.S.-based treasury vehicles with Hivemind Capital and Dragonfly. It’s aiming to raise $1 billion in AVAX token purchases at a discount. AVAX/USD 1 week Price Chart | Source: TradingView This suggests strong institutional demand and potential supply removal from markets. On the technical side, AVAX recently broke out of a 213-day consolidation, with analyst EllioTrades pointing to possible targets north of $50. While AVAX trades significantly below those projected levels, its institutional signal and discount entry make it one of the more asymmetric bets among layer-1s right now. Arbitrum (ARB): Layer-2 dominance comes with upside discount ARB is showing clear signs of being undervalued right now. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged past $19.2 billion, the highest among Ethereum layer-2s. It processed over 2.16 billion transactions, with active wallets exceeding 1.45 million. ARB/USD 1 week Price Chart|Source: TradingView Earlier this week, the Arbitrum DAO launched an $80 million DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP) to boost lending, stablecoin flows, and user retention. This signals both product momentum and growing ecosystem utility. Analysts tracking on-chain metrics and whale accumulation note that ARB remains stuck below its $0.58 resistance while support at $0.47 holds, creating a favorable setup for a breakout. For investors seeking exposure to Ethereum’s scaling future, with upside unlocked by adoption and funding flows, Arbitrum now looks like a “discounted infrastructure bet” rather than just another speculative L2. Sui (SUI): Emerging Layer-1 with undervalued momentum SUI is trading around $3.30–$3.40, with a market cap near US$12B. However, many analysts see it as undervalued given its ecosystem strength. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surpassed $2.1B, driven by DEXs like Cetus and Bluefin. Daily active addresses also hit a three-month high of 3.5 million in August, showing increasing real usage. SUI/USD 1 week Price Chart|Source: TradingView Institutional signals are strong. SUIG (Sui Group Holdings) recently expanded its treasury to 101.8M SUI tokens. This signals long-term confidence and potentially reduces pressure on the circulating supply. Also, a whale wallet opened a leveraged long in SUI (868,196 tokens), aligning with bullish sentiment among large holders. Technicals show SUI is above its 200-day SMA, with resistance near US$3.85–$4.44. Given its strong fundamentals, infrastructure advancements, and current institutional accumulation, SUI appears to be an asymmetric bet with room to run if momentum continues. Conclusion The global crypto market has grown fivefold since 2022, yet some tokens remain overlooked despite clear signals of strength. Little Pepe is leading the charge as a community-driven project with explosive upside. Following Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Sui, it appears that scalability, institutional adoption, and expanding ecosystems can still be achieved at a discount. With a price that doesn’t yet reflect its true potential, they stand out as the best tokens to invest in now. Little Pepe’s presale is still ongoing, providing investors with an opportunity to enter before the price discovery. Visit littlepepe.com to join the presale today.

Ethereum’s ETF-driven strength has triggered a broad altcoin revival, paving the way for emerging names to capture capital flows. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a focal point, smashing through $13.5 million raised from over 13,000 investors. With market analysts flagging whispers of potential 10,000% ROI, it has quickly shifted from a niche community play into a mainstream talking point of this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE presale highlights MAGACOIN FINANCE just smashed $13.5M raised, fueling retail hype as analysts rank it the best crypto presale of 2025. With whispers of 10,000% ROI, FOMO is driving thousands to pile in before listings. More than 75% of its allocation has already sold out, signaling how rapidly capital is rotating into high-upside tokens during this stage of the market. The pace of accumulation has been reinforced by meme coin communities like DOGE and RENDER, as well as whale wallets making six-figure entries. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is not just the headline number but the structure behind it. The team deployed a multi-phase token allocation model that rewards early entrants with lower costs while tightening supply at each stage. With a confirmed listing price of $0.007, analysts suggest this model provides a near-term catalyst as scarcity meets swelling demand. This mix of viral buzz and structured tokenomics has amplified its appeal, positioning it as the frontrunner among 2025’s altcoin launches. Why analysts call it 2025’s best presale Analysts emphasize that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s strength lies in its investor-friendly design and market timing. The Ethereum-based token benefits from both a secure backbone and a community narrative that aligns with retail culture. Its zero-tax smart contract and dual audits provide additional assurance at a time when trust remains a key factor for presale participants. Beyond the technicals, whale signals are telling. Transactions as high as 73 ETH (≈$133,000) have been recorded, reflecting deep conviction among big-ticket investors. This combination of grassroots hype and institutional-style entries is rare, and it explains why research desks are beginning to include MAGACOIN FINANCE in their lists of must-watch early assets. With exchange listings expected soon, momentum could spill over into price discovery phases quickly, historically one of the most powerful triggers for post-launch surges. Recent events and the altcoin revival The backdrop could not be more favorable. After years of sluggish performance, altcoins are resurging thanks to regulatory improvements across the US and Europe, alongside an influx of institutional capital into Ethereum ETFs. Analysts note that once ETH breaks higher, capital often rotates into “next-tier” opportunities that combine narrative strength with affordability. This year’s rotation has spotlighted a variety of projects beyond MAGACOIN FINANCE. BlockDAG, BlockchainFX, BullZilla, Maxi Doge, and Remittix have all gained traction, benefiting from scarcity-driven economics and strong presale buzz. Still, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s viral magnetism has made it particularly effective at pulling in retail liquidity, making it the benchmark against which other early launches are measured. The alignment of macro tailwinds and grassroots demand means altcoin-focused portfolios are finally seeing fresh upside for the first time in years. Outlook for 2025 Analyst consensus suggests the altcoin season of 2025 is just beginning, and MAGACOIN FINANCE could become its emblematic breakout. With projections of up to 11,000% ROI, exchange-driven momentum, and a rapidly closing presale window, urgency has gripped retail audiences. Timing is critical, as the final allocations are nearly depleted, leaving latecomers scrambling to secure entry before open-market trading begins. At the sector level, better regulations, stronger liquidity, and increasing institutional participation underpin confidence that this cycle will produce several outsized winners. But within that basket, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the story of altcoin—already leading capital raised in 2025 and drawing the type of FOMO-driven retail crowds that historically fuel explosive rallies. Final thoughts: MAGACOIN FINANCE leads the charge The broader crypto market revival has set the stage for new stars, and MAGACOIN FINANCE currently sits at the center of that narrative. With more than $13.5M raised, whales and retail investors aligned, and strong fundamentals backing the hype, its trajectory has become difficult to ignore. For those watching from the sidelines, the window is closing fast. As exchange listings approach and capital continues to pour into altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents one of the few high-upside early assets positioned to ride both institutional flows and retail frenzy.

Australia has also granted regulatory relief to stablecoin intermediaries, exempting them from holding separate financial services licenses when distributing these assets. Uniform Standards In Stablecoin Regulation During a speech at an international central bank conference on payments, Deputy Governor Chiara Scotti highlighted the importance of clarity in regulations, particularly concerning stablecoins issued by entities in different jurisdictions. She urged the European Commission to provide guidance on whether stablecoins issued by licensed European Union (Eu) firms could be considered interchangeable with those from non-EU counterparts under a multi-issuance model. Scotti’s remarks come amid ongoing discussions about the regulatory framework for stablecoins in the European Union. She noted that while the EU has established regulations through the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), concerns remain regarding the financial stability risks posed by cross-border issuance. She believes that this model could lead to complications, especially if non-EU issuers face redemption requests from EU holders, potentially creating a mismatch between obligations and reserves. The Deputy Governor pointed out that although a multi-issuance model could enhance global liquidity and scalability, it also introduces significant legal and operational challenges. In her view, it is crucial to restrict stablecoin issuance to jurisdictions that uphold equivalent regulatory standards in consumer protection, transparency, and crisis management. New Class Relief From ASIC In a related development, Australia has taken steps to foster growth in its digital assets sector. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) recently announced class relief for intermediaries involved in the secondary distribution of stablecoins issued by licensed Australian financial services providers. According to the regulator’s statement issued on Thursday as well, this regulatory relief exempts these intermediaries from the need to obtain separate licenses when distributing eligible stablecoins, streamlining the process while ensuring that consumer protections remain in place. ASIC’s initiative is aimed at facilitating innovation in digital asset markets. However, intermediaries benefiting from this exemption are required to provide clients with product disclosure statements for the stablecoins they distribute, reinforcing the importance of transparency. The statement further reads: ASIC is committed to supporting responsible innovation in the rapidly evolving digital assets space, while ensuring important consumer protections are in place by having eligible stablecoins issued under an AFS licence. The relief will take effect once registered on the Federal Registration of Legislation.

The fund performs more in line with Solana than competing products that are either closed-end or C-Corp structures. Solana is a compelling buy with a top 3 stablecoin footprint among public chains and a lower price to fees multiple than Ethereum or BNB. As we approach the potential approval of US-listed spot Solana ( SOL-USD ) ETFs in mid-October, there are a variety of different ways traders may look to speculate on a positive outcome for the US market. One such product is the Solana ETF ( SOLZ ) from Volatility Shares. Unlike most of the other products in the market, SOLZ is a futures-based ETF and has no direct exposure to the underlying asset. In this article, we'll look at the fund details for SOLZ, compare it to alternative products, and assess whether Solana could be an outperforming token in the Digital Asset market at this juncture. Fund Details SOLZ Holdings (Volatility Shares) Launched in March, the Solana ETF from Volatility Shares is a futures-based product that allows traders/investors to get exposure to the price of the SOL token through an easy-to-buy ETF wrapper. The fund has over $231 million in AUM which makes it larger than SOL-proxy products that have been in the market for a longer period of time. Fund Assets $231.7 million Shares Outstanding 9,070,000 Expense Ratio 1.15% Fund Inception 03/10/2025 Source: Volatility Shares, as of 9/16/25 One quick note on the expense ratio: the 1.15% figure is currently discounted by Volatility Shares for the first year of trading and the net expense ratio is currently 0.95%. As of market close on September 17th, the fund shares have a net asset value of $25.54 per share and a closing price of $25.55. For all intents and purposes, this fund trades generally at or close to NAV. This is important because, as we'll see in the next section, not all SOL-proxies can claim this. Peer Comparison Despite the lack of a spot ETF currently, there are several ways investors and traders can play the Solana price in a traditional brokerage account. For the purpose of comparison, we'll be looking at SOLZ relative to the following: Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) Osprey Solana Trust ( OSOL ) REX-Osprey SOL+Staking ETF ( SSK ) Each of the SOL-based products above offers investors exposure to the asset, but they function slightly differently. This table below shows differences in market cap, fees, and structure: Solana Exposure Expense Ratio Market Cap Structure Native Yield? Solana ETF 0.95% $211.83M Futures Fund No REX-Osprey SOL 1.40% $273.34M C-Corp Yes Grayscale Solana Trust 2.50% $62.37M Closed end No Osprey Solana Trust 2.50% $30.33M Closed End No Sources: Seeking Alpha, fund managers The big benefit of a fund like REX Shares-Osprey versus the alternative is it offers investors the ability to have exposure to staked-Solana for native yield. This is important because Solana currently has an inflation rate of 4.9% and staking yield rate of 6.8%. None of the funds mentioned offer shareholders the ability to redeem the assets underlying the fund shares. Given this, one would think the REX-Osprey fund has the best total return after fees. Yet, since the inception of that fund on July 1st, it is actually GSOL that is beating the rest of the pack: Solana Products (Seeking Alpha) Since July 1st, GSOL has had a 69% total return versus a 39% total return for SSK. At 55%, SOLZ has been the closest to the true performance of Solana, by far. The outperformance of GSOL and the underperformance of OSOL are due to the closed end nature of how those products are structured. OSOL vs GSOL NAV Rate YTD as of 9/17/25 (Osprey/Grayscale, Analyst's Chart) The chart above shows the year to date trend in premium/discount to NAV for both funds. Interestingly, they traded at relatively close premiums through the first four months of the year. That changed in May when OSOL started trading at a discount and GSOL continued trending toward a higher premium. The biggest reason why GSOL has outperformed SOLZ is simply because the premium has increased from essentially NAV break-even on July 2nd to a 13% premium as of July 17th. In my view, this makes GSOL a 'sell' relative to funds like SOLZ or OSOL and I've argued that several times in the past . Solana Still Looks Good As a digital asset worth exploring, Solana actually looks pretty good from where I sit. Last month, I argued that Solana would be the next big DAT winner and so far I think that thesis is holding up well. Data by YCharts Since my Solana article on August 28th, SOL has appreciated by more than 20%. This is better than Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and Ripple/XRP ( XRP-USD ); each of which have larger market caps than SOL. Stablecoin Supply (DeFi Llama) In the all important stablecoin race, Solana has the third largest supply of stablecoins minted on the blockchain. With the exception of Tron ( TRX-USD ) which trades a minuscule 7x circulating fees multiple, Solana is the cheapest of the major smart contract chains by circulating P/F with large stablecoin supplies: L1 P/F Comparison (Token Terminal) At an average circulating P/F multiple of 237x in September, Solana is far cheaper than Ethereum or BNB Chain ( BNB-USD ) even though it has more daily active addresses, does more daily transactions, and is comparable in fees. To be sure, Ethereum has a larger stablecoin supply and processes more stablecoin transactions. Still, as an altcoin with a favorable setup, I think Solana is in a good position. Summary I'm of the view that now is a good time to maintain a long SOL position. I take that view for two reasons: first, Solana is a high throughput, fast, cheap chain that maintains a top 3 stablecoin footprint in the public blockchain space. Second, it's cheap relative to major peers and has a DAT bid that I believe is just getting started. I wouldn't overweight it against something like Ethereum, but I do think it's a coin to overweight against Bitcoin. I've said for several months that I think Bitcoin's cycle top is either close to current levels or already in . As I see it, major alts like ETH and SOL are good hedges against that thesis. In the event I'm wrong about Bitcoin being at or near its peak, I suspect the large alts will outperform. If I'm correct that Bitcoin is at or near cycle peak, I think coins with strong utility will weather the storm better than those that are purely speculative. I put Solana in the utility category. As far as playing the Solana bull thesis, I think SOLZ will work perfectly fine until there is a spot ETF in the United States. At that point, I would expect it to underperform. For those who want SOL access through a traditional brokerage, I'm going to initiate SOLZ with a 'buy.'",SOL-USD|SOLZ,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-19 03:10:24

The deal, first reported by CNBC, was paid for using a mix of cash and stock, and closed last week. Rochan is now officially on Nvidia’s payroll. Nvidia now owns access to Enfabrica’s hardware tech, the kind that can hook up 100,000 GPUs to work together like one brain. The details line up with what we’ve seen across Big Tech this year, so this is Nvidia copying the same recruiting blueprint that Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have used to scoop up AI talent without triggering regulatory headaches. Enfabrica was founded in 2019, with its selling point being infrastructure; building the data plumbing that lets GPU clusters run like one unified machine, which is exactly what Nvidia wants. The company’s newest systems don’t just run one chip at a time. They run 72 GPUs in tall racks, all working together. That’s the setup going into the $4 billion data center in Wisconsin that Microsoft just announced. This is all part of Nvidia’s bigger play to sell complete AI systems, and the company is actually already invested in Enfabrica during a $125 million Series B round in 2023, led by Atreides Management. The startup didn’t give a dollar value for its valuation, but said it was five times bigger than it had been during its previous round, per CNBC’s report . Rochan’s move to Nvidia follows a string of similar acqui-hire deals in the AI space. In June, Meta paid $14.3 billion to get Alexandr Wang, the founder of Scale AI, and took a 49% stake in the company. One month later, Varun Mohan, the co-founder of coding startup Windsurf, joined Google in a $2.4 billion deal, which also included licensing terms. Google also acquired the team behind Character.AI last year. Microsoft grabbed Inflection, and Amazon got Adept. Nvidia also closed a $700 million purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli company whose technology helps software makers optimize their infrastructure for AI. Nvidia moves money without buying entire companies Even though Nvidia’s chips are everywhere in the AI world, it hasn’t been on a shopping spree. The company’s only billion-dollar acquisition was back in 2019, when it paid $6.9 billion for Israeli chip designer Mellanox. The networking tech from Mellanox still powers Nvidia’s latest Blackwell lineup. Nvidia did try to buy Arm for $40 billion, but regulators blocked it in 2022. In the last year, it bought Run:ai, a Tel Aviv-based startup, for $700 million. The company helps developers manage and optimize GPU usage for AI applications. Just this week, Nvidia said it had taken a $5 billion stake in Intel, and confirmed that both companies will now build AI processors together. It also revealed a fresh $700 million investment in Nscale, a British startup focused on data center tech. Two years ago, Nvidia was pushing toward a $1 trillion valuation. Now, it’s worth over $4.28 trillion, a quadruple jump since 2023.

The clash broke into public view last week as the twins prepared their company Gemini Space Station for its market debut, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. The feud came to light when Brian posted private messages from Tyler on X. In those messages, Tyler raged over what he called years of pressure from the Biden administration on Gemini and demanded help from Trump’s nominee. “7 years of lawfare trophy hunting. It’s outrageous what they did to us,” Tyler wrote in July. Winklevoss brothers flex political muscle in Washington The 44-year-old twins have poured millions into Trump’s comeback and into pro-crypto groups that want friendlier regulators. They are determined to see the CFTC steered by someone who will ease the rules on crypto. But instead of supporting Brian, a Republican with backing from many industry groups, the brothers are fighting him. Critics were quick to call it personal. Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said , “It’s a total temper tantrum. This is about wanting revenge and wanting to punish people…It’s not necessarily about policy going forward.” The fight caught attention because Brian has been known as pro-crypto, yet the brothers still chose to go after him. The twins have always thrived on conflict. At Harvard, they sued Mark Zuckerberg, accusing him of stealing their idea for Facebook, a story later told in “The Social Network.” They walked away with $65 million in cash and stock. They later bet big on bitcoin, buying in 2012 when the price was below $10. In 2013, they tried to launch the first bitcoin ETF, but the SEC blocked them. Their exchange Gemini, founded in 2014, was supposed to cement their place in the industry. The IPO last week raised $425 million, leaving them with about 75 million shares and 94.7% of the voting power. But after an initial pop, shares fell more than 20% and dropped below the $28 IPO price. The exchange has struggled in recent quarters, losing money while larger players like Coinbase dominate. Trump allies build new networks as nomination stalls The brothers are keeping their political connections close as Gemini weathers losses. Last year they gave Trump’s presidential campaign direct backing. They also handed nearly $5 million to a pro-crypto group that spent on Congressional races. Just last month, they gave $21 million worth of bitcoin to Digital Freedom Fund, a new super PAC built to support crypto and Trump. Trump has made his feelings known. At a bitcoin event last year, he called the twins “male models with a big, beautiful brain,” a moment that marked his turn from doubter to strong supporter of crypto. Earlier this year, the twins teamed up with White House crypto czar David Sacks, Donald Trump Jr., and other investors to start a private D.C. club called Executive Branch. It charges a $500,000 entry fee and ongoing dues, making it one of the priciest political hangouts in town. As for Brian, his path to the CFTC has hit a block. The White House is weighing other names as confirmation slows. On the table are Michael Selig, chief legal counsel for the SEC’s crypto task force, and Tyler Williams, who advises Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and once worked at Galaxy Digital. Both men have crypto backgrounds and are now in the mix to take the chair instead. The Winklevoss brothers’ campaign has left Washington wondering why two of Trump’s richest allies are so determined to sink one of his nominees. Their actions have put pressure on the White House and created another layer of uncertainty around who will end up controlling the CFTC at a time when crypto regulation is already at the center of national politics.

The license—issued by New York’s Department of Financial Services—had been the last major roadblock standing in the way of Bullish’s U.S. expansion. CEO Tom Farley confirmed the approval Wednesday on the company’s first earnings call since going public. Tom said the company had already received regulatory clearance to operate in many U.S. states but refused to open for business nationally until it got this specific license from New York. “While we have already had the ability to operate in many states because of our regulatory approval, we refrained from launching our exchange in the United States until we received the New York State Department of Financial Services BitLicense,” he said. “We received that license yesterday, and we look forward to bringing our exchange and our leading liquidity to the United States imminently, and we believe this to be the largest geographic market by far.” Analysts push up price targets after U.S. approval Bullish is already licensed in Germany and Hong Kong, and its exchange is built for institutional clients, not retail traders. With New York checked off, the company now holds three major regulatory licenses across the biggest crypto jurisdictions. Bullish also owns crypto news site CoinDesk. Its public market debut came just last month after a long wait. Bullish had originally tried to go public through a SPAC merger in 2021, but the deal was killed after regulators started poking around. This time, it listed through a standard IPO, setting its price at $37 per share on August 14. After Thursday’s jump, shares are trading nearly 75% higher than that IPO level. The company also reported its second quarter earnings on Wednesday. Revenue hit $57 million, down slightly from $60.7 million in the same period a year ago. But earnings per share came in at $0.93, a full reversal from a $1.03 loss last year. Analysts didn’t waste time reacting. Ed Engel, analyst at Compass Point, raised his price target from $45 to $56, noting they had only given a 50% chance of New York granting the license. Ed’s rating on the stock remains Neutral. Over at Bernstein, Gautam Chhugani said Bullish’s expansion into the U.S. will be a “key growth catalyst for the coming quarters.” He also pointed out the company now holds multiple tier 1 licenses, adding that “Bullish now holds multiple tier 1 regulatory licenses (German BaFin, Hong Kong SFC and U.S BitLicense) across major crypto markets, strengthening its positioning as global regulated institutional crypto exchange.” Gautam’s target is $60, with a Market Perform rating. Bullish is now one of a small group of crypto companies that have gone public in 2025. That group includes Gemini (GEMI), Circle (CRCL), and eToro (ETOR).

Traders looking at crypto charts are wondering whether ADA can go up a lot in value right now, particularly because investors are becoming more cautious due to worries over why crypto is plummeting. With the buzz over memecoins dying down and classic blue-chip altcoins reaching maturity, investors are seeking crypto investments that will provide them more returns than they put in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a next-generation DeFi protocol that is quietly getting a lot of attention. It is now in Phase 6 of its presale and costs $0.035, which is the type of potential that many traders are looking for. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) mechanics and growth potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and stablecoin platform designed to deliver tangible value to users while keeping the system stable. Overcollateralized borrowing is its main characteristic. This lets people get cash without having to liquidate their underlying assets. In the ecosystem, stablecoins may only be made using permitted collateral like ETH, SOL, AVAX, or bluechip tokens. When loans are paid back or liquidated, the stablecoins are instantly burnt. Governance-driven interest rates keep the $1 peg stable, while arbitrage mechanisms and liquidation incentives make sure the protocol is both secure and solvent. The system also includes mtToken staking with MUTM payouts that come from buybacks. In MUTM, depositors may receive mtToken staking rewards by giving stablecoins or bluechip tokens. The platform’s income supports open-market buybacks of MUTMs, which keeps demand for the token steady. P2C lending accepts institutional capital and stablecoins, whereas P2P lending pools handle more volatile cryptocurrencies like DOGE, SHIB, FLOKI, and PEPE. The amount of collateral you may use depends on how volatile the asset is. For example, highly liquid stable assets can have up to 75% LTV, whereas volatile tokens can only have 35–42%. Liquidation thresholds and reserve factors between 10% and 42% keep all pools solvent, which protects both borrowers and depositors from the danger of contagion. The presale momentum shows how popular MUTM is. Phase 6 has brought in $16million, and 42% of the tokens that were available have been sold to more than 16,400 people. The next step will raise the price to $0.040, which will reward those who got in early and make new investors feel like they need to act quickly. The beta launch will let anyone in the community use Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s borrowing, lending, and staking functions directly. Expected exchange listings and multi-chain growth will also make the currency more liquid and popular. Investment case and security confidence When it comes to investing, MUTM is a far better option than ADA. At $0.035 today, a $1,000 investment will get you 28,600 tokens. If MUTM trades at $0.21 by Q1 2026, the stake will be valued at more than $6,000, which is a 500% return. ADA, on the other hand, would have to rise from its current $0.40 to $2.40 to get equal gains. This would take a lot longer because of its current negative tendencies and slower adoption cycles. Early investors who bought in at the lower presale rounds are already seeing significant gains, which supports the token’s development path. The argument for MUTM is much stronger because of security and trustworthiness. The platform has been audited by CertiK, getting a score of 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet. There is also a $50,000 bug bounty program that encourages people to submit bugs of all severity levels, from $200 to $2,000. Also, a $100,000 giveaway that is still happening gives ten early entrants $10,000 each in MUTM, which encourages people to use the service and become involved in the community. The roadmap for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is meant to help the company expand by giving it real goals to reach. Phase 1 was all about audits, presales, an AI helpdesk, and listings on the platform. Phase 2 is all about developing the main smart contracts and the DApp. Phase 3 finishes up testing and audits, and Phase 4 will turn on the entire live platform with institutional partnerships and support for many chains. These planned changes will make the token more useful in the real world and bring in more users, which will raise demand for MUTM and push the token toward its expected upside. ADA is going down, and memecoins are losing power. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a structured, utility-driven alternative. Its stablecoin ecosystem, staking rewards, and risk-managed loan pools provide investors a clear way to make 500% profits by the first quarter of 2026. This is a great chance for anyone who is wondering what crypto to purchase right now. Even if the overall market is still tough on conventional assets, MUTM’s architecture makes it likely to do better than rivals that aren’t moving and provide early investors with good returns.

The Sätra Brunn well is one of Sweden’s oldest and best-preserved natural spring water wells, located in a 324-year-old Swedish village. Every water source added to the network will be measured according to the pedigree and based on the foundations of the historically reliable Satra Brunn natural spring, a well that has endured since the 18th century. The Satra Brunn well secures the first 66 million liters of the annually replenished mineral water supply, starting in January 2027, for the next 150 years. Each liter of water secured in the Satra Brunn well is fully backed by a corresponding Water150 token, issued on the Ethereum blockchain by the Longhouse Water S.A., a Luxembourg public limited liability company. Hence, the first batch of 66 million Water150 tokens to enter circulation will fully back the annual supply from the Satra Brunn well. The project uses blockchain technology as a barrierless and transparent ecosystem to connect users to naturally filtered, high-quality, and sustainably managed drinking water for at least 150 years, starting in 2027. The amount of Water150 tokens in circulation is a verifiable measure of the volume of annual water flow available within the ecosystem, audited by independent third parties. The W150 token is one of the first real-world asset (RWA) utility tokens to get the full approval of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the body responsible for the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), a cryptocurrency regulatory standard recognized and adopted throughout Europe. Water150 is building a global network of 1,000 premium mineral water sources like Satra Brunn, managed according to the high standards of the Longhouse Water Quality Standard (in line with WHO, FDA, and Swedish National Food Administration recommendations) for purity and sustainability. The tests will be according to ISO 17025, the international standard for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories. At full strength, the 210 billion Water150 tokens in circulation will back the corresponding quantity of water reserved annually for at least the next 150 years, starting in January 2027. According to the Water150 whitepaper published on July 25th, each W150 token automatically issues 1 DROP voucher per year via its smart contract, redeemable for 1 liter of premium spring water within the same year, for at least 150 years starting January 1, 2027. Redemption uses and burns the DROP voucher but does not affect the W150 token, ensuring ongoing access rights. Token holders can opt for self-tapping at certified wells or pay for bottling/distribution at competitive rates, with the process beginning in 2027. “When we set out the roadmap for Water150, every step was based on concepts and visions because no one else has done anything like this, nor at this magnitude, on the blockchain. However, we found the perfect balance when we tethered our futuristic visions to the historical anchor that is the Satra Brunn well. The plan moving forward is to add water sources that build on that legacy and standard to the point that every Water150 token holder has the assurance of quality and security, whether at this early stage of one historic spring or when we have a global reserve of 1,000 wells.” About Water150: Water150 is an innovative blockchain-based project created by the Longhouse Foundation, aimed at securing access to premium spring water through a secure, tokenized ecosystem. Led by Longhouse Water150 S.A. in Luxembourg, it connects certified wells—starting with historic sources like Sätra Brunn—to a network of 1,000 springs, managed under the rigorous Longhouse Water Quality Standard for purity and sustainability. Water150 empowers users to secure long-term water rights, fostering a transparent, 150-year vision of hydration backed by real-world assets.

51957485,https://invezz.com/?p=2888823,1758253470,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"ETH, BTC still safe to invest, yet traders claim MUTM could outperform both with 32x ROI",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/19/eth-btc-still-safe-to-invest-yet-traders-claim-mutm-could-outperform-both-with-32x-roi/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are still the most important cryptocurrencies, giving investors protection and long-term stability in markets that are hard to predict. These big projects generally benefit from crypto ETFs and institutional interest, which makes them even safer. But crypto forecasts say that both BTC and ETH are reaching maturity, which means that they are less likely to rise quickly than they did in their early cycles. More and more traders are looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi token that is now in its presale phase. Analysts now think it might generate up to 32x ROI by the first quarter of 2026. The way Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set up makes it possible for a new kind of utility-driven growth that standard cryptocurrencies can’t match. The platform has a decentralized stablecoin environment where loans are backed by more than one asset, such as ETH, SOL, AVAX, and ADA. When you pay back or sell stablecoins that were made with these assets, they are instantly burnt. Interest rates established by the government maintain the $1 peg. The system stays sustainable and appealing to both borrowers and lenders because of arbitrage dynamics and strict liquidation rules. Users who stake mtTokens get MUTM payouts that come from revenue and buybacks. This creates a self-reinforcing demand loop that helps the token value go up and gives investors confidence. Presale momentum and structural advantages driving MUTM growth Phase 6 of the MUTM presale shows that the token might be used early on. With a price of $0.035, 42% of this phase has been sold, bringing in $16 million from more than 16,400 investors. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, which is a 15% increase and the last chance for early-stage users to get a discount. This presale momentum shows that there is a lot of demand for the token, which means that investors are seeing the token’s unique growth mechanisms before the market as a whole does. Because of its structural benefits, MUTM is expected to expand 32x faster than BTC or ETH. Reserve factors gather interest from borrowers, which creates a safety net that supports treasury-backed incentives tied to mtToken staking rewards. A strong oracle architecture that includes Chainlink feeds, backup oracles, and on-chain DEX TWAP integration is needed for price discovery. This makes sure that values stay correct and can’t be changed by the market. When the market is volatile, liquidity-aware liquidation mechanisms keep the system secure. This lets liquidators make money while keeping user funds safe. This foundation makes MUTM more stable than other high-risk tokens, which gives investors both safety and a lot of room for growth. Future catalysts are in place to speed up growth. The beta platform will go live when the presale is over, giving early users a useful tool. Layer-2 integration will make transactions quicker and cheaper, which will bring in more users and improve their experience. Also, expected top-tier exchange listings would make it easier for more people and businesses to experience the service. These changes make real milestones that support the 32x growth estimate and provide a clear route for the value of the tokens to go up. Early investment math and comparative upside The figures show why traders see MUTM as a better growth proposition. Ethereum (ETH) would have to go from $4,000 to $8,000 to double in value, which is a 2x increase that shows consistent but restricted growth over the same time period. MUTM, on the other hand, is worth $0.035 in Phase 6 and may go up to $1.12, giving investors 32x their money back. For instance, buying $5,000 worth of MUTM tokens at $0.035 would give you around 142,900 tokens, which would be worth $160,000 if the goal price is met. This uneven risk-reward profile shows how MUTM uses structured utility, staking incentives, and a presale-driven demand curve to provide growth chances that are better than those of BTC and ETH in the near future. Security and trustworthiness make investors even more confident. CertiK has audited Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and given it a Token Scan score of 90 and a Skynet grade of 79. A $50,000 bug bounty program pays reports based on how serious they are, and a $100,000 giveaway that is always going on encourages people to get involved early and help the community flourish. These steps make sure that MUTM is not just ready for big returns, but also runs on a safe and open base. Conclusion In the end, BTC and ETH are still good investments, but their growth is slowing down. Traders looking for early-stage exposure with structured upside now have a new option in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM is designed to do better than conventional bluechips, with presale momentum, strong collateral and liquidation restrictions, staking incentives, Layer-2 efficiency, and impending exchange listings. It has the ability to give you 32x your money back by Q1 2026. MUTM is the early-stage token with the growth rocket already going off. It’s good for investors who want to keep an eye on crypto forecasts, understand why crypto is down, or find a high-growth alternative to traditional BTC/ETH methods.

First Won-Pegged Stablecoin Launched On Avalanche Digital asset custody firm BDACS officially launched the first South Korean won-backed stablecoin, KRW1, on the Avalanche blockchain in collaboration with Woori Bank, one of the four largest domestic financial institutions in the country According to the X announcement , the stablecoin is currently in a pilot phase, following a successful proof-of-concept (PoC), and each KRW1 token is 1:1 collateralized with won held in escrow at Woori Bank. BDACS reportedly plans to utilize the won-pegged stablecoin as a “low-cost payment and settlement system for public-sector programs, such as emergency relief disbursements, by significantly lowering payment processing fees.” Additionally, KRW1 is “built for more than markets,” Avalanche’s X thread read, as it could become a “technical standard for stablecoins in Korea,” with the upcoming regulatory framework. “BDACS has developed a comprehensive framework, including issuance and management systems as well as a user-facing app supporting peer-to-peer transfers and transaction verification,” the press release detailed . Harry Ryoo, BDACS’s CEO, affirmed that the digital assets firm is “building the backbone of the digital asset market, serving corporate, institutional, and public-sector partners alike. KRW1 marks a turning point for our company, and we believe it will become a foundational asset for the digital economy.” Banks, Crypto Industry Anticipate October Framework KRW1 launches ahead of the regulatory framework by South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC). As reported by Bitcoinist, the financial authority is expected to release the long-awaited guidelines for the issuance and distribution of won-backed stablecoin at the start of next quarter. On August 18, Park Min-kyu, a member of the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), affirmed that the government’s bill was expected to be submitted to the National Assembly in October. The lawmaker revealed that he had recently received a report from the FSC on the direction of stablecoins. The FSC has been working to develop digital assets legislation and shift its regulatory approach, establishing the Virtual Asset Committee in November 2024 to prepare the next phases of its regulatory roadmap and finalize the second one by the end of 2025. Multiple bills related to the issuance and distribution of won-pegged stablecoins have been introduced in South Korea’s National Assembly, including two rival bills in July by Korea’s ruling and opposition parties. Ahn Do-gil, a member of the Planning and Finance Committee from the Democratic Party, introduced the “Act on the Issuance and Distribution of Value-Stable Digital Assets.” On the same day, Kim Eun-hye, a member of the Land, Infrastructure, and Transport Committee from the People Power Party (PPP), proposed the “Act on Payment Innovation Using Value-Fixed Digital Assets.” In June, Min Byung-deok, a member of the National Assembly’s Government Committee, also introduced the “Digital Assets Basic Act,” which proposes allowing the issuance of won-pegged stablecoins and establishing a Digital Asset Committee under the direct authority of the president. The banking sector has been studying two legalization scenarios, as it’s been unclear whether non-bank entities will be allowed to be stablecoin issuers. Notably, South Korea’s biggest banks have reportedly been in talks with Tether and Circle to discuss potential partnerships. According to local reports , the CEOs of Shinhan Financial Group and Hana Financial Group CEO had separate meetings last month with Heath Tarbert, the president of Circle and a Tether official.

ETH outflows from exchanges spike as holders move coins to cold storage or staking platforms. September staking inflows drop to 8.4K ETH, cooling sharply after August’s record-high deposits. Whale Profit Levels Return to 2021 Highs Ethereum wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have now reached the same unrealized profit levels seen during the 2021 market peak. This data suggests large holders are once again sitting on sizable paper gains. In 2017, whale wallets saw unrealized profits peak at around $15 billion. By 2021, this figure had grown to more than $45 billion. As of September 2025, that level has been matched. Charts tracking whale wallet performance show a clear return to the high-profit zone last seen before ETH’s strongest rallies . Crypto analyst commented, The unrealized profits of $ETH whales holding 10-100k have reached the previous cycle’s peak.

And the rate of increase in this… pic.twitter.com/ZZhK2nGR3D — CW (@CW8900) September 18, 2025 Though similar conditions led to large price increases in the past, it is not guaranteed that the same will happen again. Exchange Flows Point to Lower Selling Pressure During early 2025, Ethereum saw large volumes of ETH moved onto exchanges. In February and March, inflows above 200,000 ETH occurred as the price fell from over $3,000 to around $1,500. This activity typically signals selling. Notably, that trend reversed by mid-2025. From June onwards, more ETH began leaving exchanges than entering. Outflow spikes ranged from 200,000 to 400,000 ETH. This behavior change came as ETH started recovering and climbing past $4,000. Large outflows are often linked to reduced sell-side activity as coins are moved off exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant By August and September, this pattern continued while ETH traded near $4,500. Withdrawals remained high, suggesting that holders were choosing to secure their ETH off platforms, possibly for long-term storage or staking. Staking Inflows Rise, Then Drop in September In late 2024 and the first half of 2025, daily displays of staking deposits would range from 20,000 to 100,000 ETH in amount. November 2024 and March 2025 saw some massive spikes, with ETH trading between $2,000 and $2,500. Big inflows began around mid-2025, as ETH had formed a bottom in April. In August, there were days with staking inflows between 250,000 and 300,000 ETH, the largest in that year. As deposits came in substantial sizes with ETH going above $4,000, this is probably reflective of a stronger commitment to the network on the part of participants. Source: CryptoQuant However, the latest data shows a sharp decline. In September 2025, staking inflows dropped to around 8,400 ETH, based on current chart readings. This marks the lowest daily level since late 2024. The recent pullback could reflect a cooling period after heavy deposits in the previous month. ETH Approaches Key Price Level At press time, ETH was trading around $4,600. It has gained over 4% in the past seven days and is approaching its previous all-time high. This level is now acting as resistance. A report by Milk Road noted, $ETH Update Ethereum is stuck between $4k support and its all time high.

If the same pattern occurs again, the price could move toward $16,500. For now, traders are watching whether ETH can hold current levels and close above resistance. If it does, a new upward phase could follow. If not, the market may remain in consolidation until further signals appear.

51958912,https://cryptonews.com/?p=425626,1758257245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51958912.jpeg,Eric Trump Touts Crypto as Potential Lifeline for the US Dollar,https://cryptonews.com/news/eric-trump-touts-crypto-potential-lifeline-us-dollar-2/,"Eric Trump has claimed that surging demand for cryptocurrencies could “save the US dollar” by drawing global investment flows into America, tying the fortunes of digital assets to the strength of the nation’s currency. The president’s son and outspoken crypto supporter told the Financial Times this week that the digital assets boom would funnel “trillions from around the world in wonky currencies” into the US. He argued that Bitcoin mining and financial independence could power “a kind of financial revolution” rooted in America, adding, “I think it arguably saves the US dollar.” Trump’s remarks came hours after he rang Nasdaq’s opening bell to celebrate the market debut of American Bitcoin Corp , a company where he holds a stake valued at more than $500m, according to FT. @EricTrump , co-founder of American Bitcoin (ABTC) and son of U.S. President @realDonaldTrump , reaffirmed his ultra-bullish stance on Bitcoin. #Bitcoin #Trump https://t.co/nusoChbQFW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 31, 2025 The firm emerged earlier this year from a merger between his family-backed American Bitcoin venture and Gryphon Digital Mining, and now trades under the ticker ABTC. Weaker Dollar Reflects Fed’s Cautious Easing and Mounting Debt Fears The comments land at a time when the US dollar has weakened. President Donald Trump’s trade battles, along with his frequent clashes with the Federal Reserve, have unsettled investors. The Fed cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time this year, reinforcing concerns over inflation and debt levels that continue to pressure the greenback. Donald Trump has repeatedly argued for lower rates since taking office, saying the US benefits more from a weaker currency. He has also pledged to make America the “crypto capital” of the world and encouraged regulators to take a lighter approach to digital assets, fueling record highs in bitcoin and other tokens. Trump Family Expands Crypto Interests From ETFs to Memecoins and Stablecoins The Trump family’s interests in crypto now span a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, memecoins named after Donald and Melania Trump, and a stablecoin venture tied to Trump Media & Technology Group. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 Asia conference in Hong Kong last month, Eric Trump predicted Bitcoin would inevitably reach $1m . He pointed to mounting demand from governments, corporations and wealthy families. “Everybody wants Bitcoin. Everybody is buying Bitcoin,” he said. Further, Trump cast crypto as a challenge to Wall Street. He said he took pride in building companies without the help of America’s biggest banks, describing it as “the ultimate revenge against the big banks and modern finance.” The Trump Organization is currently suing Capital One, alleging it closed its accounts in 2021 for political reasons, which the bank denies. He added that crypto has changed perceptions of financial access. “You realise you just don’t need them. And frankly, you don’t miss them,” he said, referring broadly to Wall Street lenders. Trump Ties to Stablecoins Add Political Weight to Financial Debate Stablecoins in particular are emerging as a flashpoint between crypto and banking. US banking executives have warned they could drain deposits if they offer higher yields than savings accounts. At the same time, the White House has encouraged issuers such as Tether and Circle to buy US Treasury debt, a move seen as key to supporting the bond market as Washington issues trillions of dollars in new debt each year. Eric Trump has his own stake in that trend. Last year, he co-founded World Liberty Financial Inc, which runs a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. According to disclosures, his father held more than 15b WLFI tokens at the end of 2024, a position worth more than $3b at recent prices. The younger Trump, however, downplayed the financial windfall. “If my father cared about monetizing his life, the last thing he would have done is run for president, where all we’ve done is un-monetize our life,” he said.

Over the past twelve years, through market ups and downs, HTX has consistently upheld the principle of “user-first”, continuously refining its products, enhancing security and improving service. On the occasion of its 12th anniversary, HTX is upgrading its “Crypto Gem Hunt” to “HTX Select”, enabling a more comprehensive screening of valuable assets. This edition of “HTX Select” specifically filters out 12 high-quality value projects deserving attention in the near term that are already listed on HTX. They cover both mainstream and emerging sectors like public chains (L1), DeFi, MEME, DeSci, etc. Each selected project has undergone both market testing and HTX’s multi-dimensional risk control evaluation. Behind this “selected” asset change is an adjustment in listing strategy responsive to market shifts: moving from early discovery and rapid listing of high-potential Meme coins toward tokens with large FDV backed by venture capital and smaller market-cap tokens. HTX 12th Anniversary – Top Gainers on HTX Select Equals Value: Curating Quality Cryptos Across Every Sector 1. Rising Stars: Explosive Power in the MEME Sector ● M (MemeCore) : Launched on HTX in July 2025 at a record low of 0.4 USDT, it has since reached a peak of 2.14 USDT, witnessing a gain of 435%. As the first Layer 1 chain built specifically for the Meme 2.0 era, MemeCore seeks to evolve meme coins from pure speculation into engines of culture, value, and community coordination. ● BIO (BIO Protocol) : As a representative of DeSci (decentralized science), it was launched on HTX at the start of 2025 with price rising from 0.05 USDT to 0.32 USDT, registering a 540% rise. BIO’s strong performance reflects both market enthusiasm for innovative narratives and DeSci’s potential in real-world adoption. 2. The Core of DeFi: Dual Verification of Value & Ecosystem ● ENA (Ethena) : Since its launch in April 2024, as a synthetic US dollar protocol combining DeFi and RWA concepts, ENA has used an innovative model featuring treasury equities + rate switches to attract the market attention. Its price has increased from 0.25 to 0.85 USDT, a 240% gain. Its usage logic merits long-term attention. ● RED (RedStone) : Launched in March 2025, it has witnessed the highest increase of 284%. RedStone is one of the fastest-growing oracles, focusing on yield-generating collateral for the loan market. It has already secured over $10 billion in assets as collateral. Previously, HTX Ventures made a strategic investment into RedStone Oracles to support modular DeFi infrastructure. ● PYTH (Pyth) : Launched at the end of 2023 and notable for collaborating with the U.S. Commerce Department, it has recorded an increase of 127%, securing its position among essential DeFi infrastructure. Pyth connects high-fidelity market data from professional traders and exchanges to arbitrary smart contracts, helping solve the oracle problems in DeFi. ● WLFI (World Liberty Financial) : Making its global debut on HTX in September 2025, it has recorded an increase of 50% with strategic support from HTX. World Liberty Financial is a DeFi lending project supported by the Trump family, comprising its governance token WLFI and stablecoin USD1. Its mission is to “make crypto and America great by driving the mass adoption of stablecoins and decentralized finance.” ● BAKE (BakerySwap) : Launched in January 2024 on HTX, from a low of 0.03 USDT, it has climbed to 0.21 USDT, up 600%. BakerySwap is building an integrated AMM + NFT + AIGC multichain ecosystem platform. 3. Leading Public Blockchains: Sustaining Growth Through Market Cycles ● BTC (Bitcoin) : Since the beginning of the year, BTC has increased by approximately 25%. Launched in 2009 as the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin serves as the anchor asset and store of value for the entire crypto market, earning itself the moniker “digital gold”. Its long-term position in the industry remains unshakable. ● ETH (Ethereum) : Without further description, Ethereum has risen from 3,412 USDT to 4,937 USDT, an increase of 44.7%. As the world’s largest smart contract platform, Ethereum serves as the core infrastructure for multiple sectors, including DeFi, NFTs, AI, and RWAs. Its long-term strategic importance is irreplaceable. ● SOL (Solana) : Its price has risen from 123 USDT to a high of 224 USDT, an increase of 82%. Positioned as a high-performance public chain, Solana is a powerful open-source blockchain platform. It serves as the underlying chain for several popular Meme projects, boasts a rich ecosystem and active developers, and leverages its permissionless architecture to deliver powerful decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. ● WLD (Worldcoin) : Launched in 2023, WLD has seen its price rise from 0.8 USDT to a peak of 2.2 USDT, an increase of 175%. Worldcoin is a global cryptocurrency with a unique identity verification mechanism, aiming to become the world’s largest and most inclusive crypto network by offering free Worldcoins to everyone. ● ADA (Cardano) : Its price has risen from 0.52 USDT to 1.01 USDT, an increase of 94.2%. As a public chain that has consistently adhered to a research-driven approach, Cardano aims to provide more advanced functions than any previously developed protocol. HTX Select: 12 Years of Consistent Commitment to the Industry and Users In summary, among the 12 high-quality projects selected, five have seen an increase of over 200%, with projects like BAKE and BIO achieving over 500% gains. Mainstream public chains such as ETH, SOL, and ADA have demonstrated long-term resilience through steady growth against market fluctuations. Cryptos under HTX Select bear high value that speaks for itself. For 12 years, HTX has steadfastly upheld security standards. As of September 2025, HTX has disclosed its Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves (PoR) for 35 consecutive months, with reserve ratios consistently maintained at or above 100%. Adhering to the principle of “User First”, HTX continues to empower users through initiatives such as new token incubation and high-yield token earnings with subsidies. Looking ahead, HTX remains committed to selecting high-quality projects through its strict selection criteria and global perspective, accompanying users through each phase of the crypto market cycle with a long-term vision.

51960166,https://invezz.com/?p=2888935,1758257829,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Expert says no meme season this year and advises traders to look for $0.035 crypto for quick 23x,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/19/expert-says-no-meme-season-this-year-and-advises-traders-to-look-for-0-035-crypto-for-quick-23x/,"As excitement around meme coins fades, experts are urging traders to look toward utility-driven DeFi projects that offer tangible returns. Analysts note that hype-driven tokens may dominate headlines but rarely deliver sustainable gains. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at $0.035 during its presale, is emerging as a platform with real mechanics capable of generating quick and meaningful returns. Its design centers on lending, borrowing, and stablecoin utilities, providing a foundation for growth beyond mere speculation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Utility over hype Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineered to support a robust decentralized finance ecosystem. Its stablecoin mechanics rely on overcollateralized minting, ensuring that new tokens are issued only when sufficient approved collateral is provided. Governance-driven interest adjustments will maintain the peg to $1, while arbitrage across trading channels will stabilize market imbalances. Automatic liquidation mechanisms will safeguard solvency by closing risky positions before they endanger the system. Layer-2 integration will enable faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional Layer-1 networks, increasing adoption and utility. Borrowers will have the ability to access liquidity without selling their assets. For example, a $12,000 SOL deposit can unlock $6,000 USDT at a 50% loan-to-value ratio, preserving exposure to SOL while gaining operational liquidity. Depositors can earn passive income by contributing to liquidity pools. A $15,000 USDT deposit in mtUSDT at 1:1 will yield around 15% APY, creating $2,250 in yearly returns while supporting platform lending activity. Collateral thresholds are dynamically managed: high-liquidity assets receive higher LTVs, while volatile tokens face stricter limits, with automatic liquidations executed by professional liquidators to protect the system. Presale momentum and market mechanics Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has brought in $16 million. Over 16,400 people now own 42% of the 170 million tokens that were available. The price right now is $0.035. Phase 7 will boost it to $0.040, which is a 15% increase. The presale is the final chance to get MUTM tokens at a lower price before more people learn about them and demand rises. The beta launch coming soon will let early investors use the lending, borrowing, and staking functions directly, which will help adoption and price growth even more. Chainlink is the main feed for Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s advanced oracle system for price discovery. It also has backup systems and data from DEXs. This makes sure that all the values on the platform are correct. Borrowing interest is linked to how much money is available: low rates attract borrowers when there is a lot of money available, while high rates encourage depositors when there isn’t much money available. This creates a self-balancing financial system. Also, mtToken staking and the buy-and-distribute mechanism work together to keep MUTM demand high. The money made via lending and borrowing will be used to buy back tokens from the open market, which will then be given to mtToken stakers. This constant buying pressure will help keep prices steady while rewarding those who stay in the market for a long time. This makes MUTM a good choice for both aggressive and cautious investors who are following crypto charts and trying to figure out why crypto is down. The roadmap is set up so that the platform’s features may be added one at a time. Phase 1 has finished setting up the presale, external audits, and AI-powered helpdesk. The second phase is all about building smart contracts, DApp infrastructure, and liquidity pools. In Phase 3, testnets will be launched, audits will be finished, and beta demonstrations will be shown. In Phase 4, the whole platform will be released, it will be listed on major exchanges, integrated with several chains, and used by businesses. Credibility and security are still the most important parts of the ecosystem. CertiK audits show that the token scan score is 90 and the Skynet score is 79, which means that smart contracts are reliable. The $50,000 bug bounty program encourages people outside the system to reveal security holes, while the continuing $100,000 giveaway gives $10,000 each to ten early believers. Conclusion People who buy early will get a lot of benefits. For example, if you swapped $5,000 worth of BTC for MUTM at $0.01, you would get 500,000 tokens, which are worth $17,500 at the current presale price of $0.035. This investment would be worth $30,000 when it was listed at $0.06. The coin has the potential to make 23X its value since the platform is growing and more people are using it. This shows that investors may take advantage of real demand-driven growth instead of speculative hype in the present crypto pricing environment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines lending and borrowing, stablecoin use, staking rewards, the need to buy before the presale closes, and strong Layer-2 integration. Meme currencies are losing steam this year, but MUTM is a smart and high-growth option for crypto investors who want to make money in a safe and disciplined DeFi environment. People who keep an eye on crypto charts and look at market trends will find MUTM’s structure interesting since it focuses on genuine use and quick acceptance.

The breakout has reignited confidence in Ripple’s long-term growth and placed XRP firmly back in the spotlight. At the same time, attention is also shifting toward emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , increasingly viewed as one of the hidden gems and undervalued picks of 2025. With an intense scarcity and supply narrative and surging community and investor hype , MAGACOIN FINANCE is tipped by analysts as a project with 75x ROI potential. XRP Breaks $3 on Institutional Flows XRP’s rally past the $3.00 psychological threshold has set the stage for further upside. The token advanced from $2.96 to $2.99 within 24 hours, with bulls holding firm at $2.98 and defending support zones despite resistance near $3.02. Market structure suggests accumulation is underway, as traders build positions ahead of possible extensions higher. Long-Term Outlook: $5 by 2026 Analysts predict that XRP could be worth $5 by 2026 due to its increased use in cross-border payments, increasing clarity in regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies, and an increase in institutional investors. Many major banks are deploying Ripple’s technology. This positions XRP to ride the wave of tokenised finance in the coming years. XRP is among the top long-term outlook plays in large-cap crypto as it is witnessing strong on-chain accumulation alongside favourable derivatives positioning and ETF speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Hidden Gem With 75x ROI Potential As XRP heads towards $5, analysts are increasingly highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as a project that could deliver large returns early on. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not a typical meme coin: audited contracts, fixed supply, and a growing ecosystem of presale supporters is its built fundamentals. The narrative surrounding its scarcity and supply acts as a foundation for the project, which allows it to attract investor interest in the first place. The hype from community members and more experienced investors is simultaneously intensifying as presale participation increases, and social engagement on X and Telegram trends upward. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being rated as one of those undervalued picks and hidden gems by analysts for 2025, with predictions providing upward of 75x ROI. Furthermore, it is starting to look like more of a must-have alongside heavyweights like XRP. Conclusion XRP’s breakout above $3 has reignited bullish sentiment, with price predictions targeting $5 by 2026 as institutional inflows and ETF speculation provide a strong foundation. But while XRP holds its place as a large-cap leader, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE rise represent the next wave of asymmetric opportunities. With a strong scarcity-driven design, community momentum, and 75x ROI buzz , MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming one of the best altcoins to watch as investors position for the next bull cycle.

Solmate Raises $300 Million To Push Solana Adoption Nasdaq-listed sports club owner, Brera Holdings – now known as Solmate – is set to foster Solana adoption as it became the latest DAT to raise as much as $300 million to buy and stake the SOL token. Notably, the PIPE offering was sponsored by Pulsar Group, a UAE-based technology and blockchain advisory firm. It was also backed by the Solana Foundation, RockawayX, and other investment firms like ARK Invest. Solmate aims to increase shareholder value by accumulating and staking SOL, and developing new revenue streams from the rapidly expanding Solana staking infrastructure. The firm also stated it plans to cement the UAE as the global capital of the Solana ecosystem. The firm added that Marco Santori, former Chief Legal Officer at Kraken, will become Solmate’s first Chief Executive Officer. Solmate intends to invest some proceeds from the funds into bare metal servers in Abu Dhabi, configured to outperform typical DAT validator strategies. Santori noted: Solmate is not just another treasury. It will execute on a durably differentiated strategy in a crowded field of look-alike DATs by building real crypto infrastructure in the UAE. Our stakeholders have deep, long-term conviction in the SOL ecosystem and will demand that we accumulate SOL through bull markets and bear markets alike. Solmate is well-positioned as Solana adoption accelerates across institutional markets, DeFi, NFTs, and AI. Solmate’s planned SOL validator would enable regional investors to leverage SOL’s native yield-generating capability with a performant SOL validator in the Middle East. Interestingly, the Solana network is expected to outgrow both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) networks in the next three years due to its high monthly developer additions. Following the development, Brera Holdings’ shares spiked significantly, trading at $32.32 according to data from Yahoo! Finance. Similarly, SOL surged beyond $250, trading about 14.8% below its all-time high (ATH) at the time of writing. Can SOL Compete With ETH? While BTC remains the largest digital asset by market cap, SOL’s main competitor is ETH due to them both being smart contract platforms, unlike the Bitcoin network. Currently, ETH’s market cap is about $558 billion, compared to SOL’s $137 billion, but recent developments in the Solana ecosystem promise to bridge this gap. For instance, publicly-traded firm Forward Industries recently bought $1.58 billion worth of SOL tokens as part of its treasury strategy. A recent report noted that close to 1.55% of Solana’s total circulating supply is now held by institutional investors. SOL also received another nod of approval from Mike Novogratz recently, calling it the blockchain of choice for financial markets. At press time, SOL trades at $251.66, up 7.8% in the past 24 hours.",Solana|Altcoin|ARK Invest|bitcoin|blockchain|btc|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ethereum|Solmate|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|ETH|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-19 05:00:45

Conservative investors may like XRP’s steady rise, but those who are looking forward are more interested in a new DeFi project that has a lot more potential for growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is discreetly establishing itself as a high-growth alternative, aimed to generate a 100x run by mid-2026 via genuine utility, superior risk management, and a presale-driven surge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Redefining DeFi utility Mutuum financial (MUTM) is a decentralized financial platform that aims to create a stablecoin environment with low risk, a safe way to lend and borrow money, and a long-lasting token economy. Its stablecoin architecture lets certified issuers produce coins up to a certain amount, while governance-driven interest rate changes maintain the $1 peg. Arbitrage mechanisms across several trading channels and automatic liquidation regulations make sure that everyone can pay their bills and keep the platform stable. This protects users and maintains the platform’s reputation. Layer-2 integration will make the user experience even better by cutting transaction costs and speeding things up. This is a big benefit over Layer-1 networks. People who borrow money on the marketplace may get cash without selling their possessions. For instance, a user may put up $12,000 ETH as collateral and borrow $9,000 USDT at a 75% loan-to-value ratio. This lets them keep their exposure to ETH while freeing up funds for strategic positions. At the same time, depositors add to liquidity pools and get mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio, which gives them an annual percentage yield of around 15%. For example, a $15,000 USDT deposit would make $2,250 a year, which is passive income that helps people borrow money. Collateral management is always changing. High-liquidity assets like ETH have larger LTVs, whereas volatile tokens have restricted levels. If collateral falls below safety levels, liquidations happen automatically. Liquidators then close positions in a way that makes money to stop the spread of the problem. Presale momentum and investment opportunity The presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 6 has already brought in $16 million. 42% of the 170 million tokens have been sold to more than 16,400 holders. The price to get in is $0.035, but in Phase 7, the price will go up to $0.040, which is a 15% increase. This shows how important it is for early investors to get MUTM at a lower price. The beta launch coming up will let people try out lending, borrowing, and staking for themselves, which will increase demand and visibility, which is likely to lead to more price movement. Chainlink feeds are the main references for the platform’s price discovery architecture, while backup oracles and DEX TWAP aggregation make it more reliable and redundant. Utilization-based borrowing rates will keep liquidity in check, bringing in new users and keeping the protocol’s income streams stable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) encourages long-term participation in ways other than loans, such as mtToken staking and a MUTM buy-and-distribute system. When people use the platform, it makes money that it uses to buy back MUTM from the open market and give it to stakers. This keeps pressure on the token, which helps it go up in value. The roadmap for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well thought out. The first phase included the presale, an AI-powered helpdesk, and initial audits. In Phase 2, the main emphasis will be on building smart contracts and backend infrastructure. In Phase 3, external audits will be finished, the testnet will be launched, and a working demo will be released. Phase 4 will include the live debut, listings on prominent exchanges, growth to many chains, and cooperation with institutions. This will make the MUTM ecosystem bigger and provide it with a lot of liquidity. Trust and safety are still very important for the platform’s success. CertiK audits provide ratings of 90 and 79, which show that smart contracts are reliable. A $50,000 bug bounty program encourages people to disclose vulnerabilities responsibly, and a $100,000 giveaway that is happening right now will offer ten winners $10,000 in MUTM tokens, which will bring in more people and keep them interested. Final words At the current presale price of $0.035, a Phase 1 investor that traded $10,000 SOL for MUTM at $0.01 would now have 1 million tokens worth $35,000. After being listed at $0.06, the investment would have grown to $60,000. If the price keeps going up at the same rate, the same investment might be worth $300,000 by mid-2026. This shows that there is a chance of a 100x return, whereas XRP investors are still waiting with a token that could only provide them with small multiples over the same time period. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a utility-driven platform that may make huge profits. It has a strong stablecoin ecosystem, Layer-2 efficiency, presale momentum, staking incentives, and a comprehensive roadmap. XRP is still in a holding pattern, while MUTM is designed to develop quickly, which attracts investors looking for big profits in the DeFi space. If you’re following crypto charts, wondering why crypto is down, or just watching crypto pricing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great way to become involved with a platform that’s about to grow quickly before mid-2026.

This investment strengthens Grvt’s pioneering position as the global blueprint for the future of finance, accelerating its mission to disrupt the fragmented onchain finance ecosystem by addressing longstanding industry challenges, including privacy vulnerabilities, security, scalability and accessibility. As Wall Street embraces blockchain technology, the next chapter of global finance is being written, and it’s happening onchain. In August, Ethereum’s onchain volume reached over $320 billion, its highest level since mid-2021. Research also projects the DeFi sector to surge from $32.36 billion in 2025 to over $1.5 trillion by 2034. However, this potential remains untapped due to critical concerns raised by a surge of issues on decentralized platforms. These issues include “whale hunting”, where large trades are front-run or exploited by sophisticated actors scanning the mempool. Such tactics lead to billions in annual losses from maximum extractable value (MEV) attacks and other manipulative tactics. Further challenges include smart contract exploits, compliance hurdles on public chains, a siloed onchain ecosystem, and a lack of ease of use for everyday people. Grvt is the only player in the field with a solid head start and tech infrastructure to change that. The Series A round was co-led by Grvt’s foundational technology partner ZKsync; Further Ventures, a leading capital markets infrastructure investment firm based in Abu Dhabi, which also led the strategic investment round into Grvt (deal closed last December); EigenCloud (fka EigenLayer), a verifiable cloud platform that lets developers build any application; and 500 Global (formerly 500 Startups), a venture capital firm with $2.3B in AUM investing in founders with a global outlook building fast-growing startups. Majority of the funds raised will accelerate Grvt’s multi-pronged product strategy, designed to serve both active traders and passive investors. This unique approach is absent from the current exchange scene, solidifying Grvt’s unrivaled position to dominate and unify the fragmented onchain financial landscape and bring it to mainstream. Key pipelines include: Fixed Yield Generation Flywheel : An industry-first yield vehicle that lets users effortlessly move funds between their funding, trading, and vault accounts, and maximize returns. Infrastructure : Keep strengthening Grvt’s privacy-by-default infrastructure which is lacking in the industry. Stablecoin-Enabled System : A robust stablecoin business foundation, including cross-exchange vaults and real-world asset (RWA) integrations. The remaining funds will fuel community initiatives and talent acquisition to drive global expansion. Hong Yea, co-founder and CEO at Grvt , commented: “Onchain finance has been held back by privacy gaps that expose users to exploitation. By building a privacy-driven, scalable, and trustless DEX that offers a wide array of structured products, Grvt exemplifies how ZK-powered solutions will become the new normal for everyone, realizing the vision of an open and secure onchain finance world.” Alex Gluchoski, co-founder and CEO at Matter Labs , commented: “We believe ZK is the ‘HTTPS moment’ for crypto. Just as HTTPS took the internet mainstream by adding a layer of trust and privacy, ZK will do the same for Web3. Grvt is uniquely positioned to be the most liquid and impactful application layer to help realize this vision, their dedication and progress excellently demonstrates how ZK can bring onchain finance to mainstream.” Faisal Al Hammadi, Managing Partner, Further Ventures, “Further Ventures is committed to backing the next generation of financial infrastructure from Abu Dhabi to the world. Grvt’s application of zero-knowledge proofs demonstrates how cutting-edge cryptography can underpin markets at institutional scale, and we are proud to support their vision for a truly borderless financial system.” Sreeram Kannan, Founder and CEO at Eigen Labs , “Verifiable data powers verifiable compute, and with EigenDA now at 100 MB/s, the bottleneck has shifted from data to compute. Grvt is tackling that frontier head-on. Their ambitious vision is matched by the caliber of their team, and we’re thrilled to back them alongside ZKSync in bringing onchain finance to cloud scale with the security and privacy it requires.” Min Kim, General Partner at 500 Global , commented: “We believe the next frontier of finance will be built onchain, and privacy is a foundational element to unlock its full potential. Grvt’s vision of combining ZK technology with institutional-grade infrastructure aligns strongly with our thesis of backing global founders who are re-architecting core financial systems. We’re excited to partner with Grvt as they set a new standard for secure, private, and accessible onchain markets.” A Collective Charge to Lead and Consolidate Onchain Finance By implementing zero-knowledge (“ZK”) technology and integrating with the ZKsync technology which has been explored in proofs-of-concept by leading institutions like Deutsche Bank, UBS and more, Grvt is uniquely positioned as a blockchain-native global blueprint for what ZK is able to achieve for finance, making everyday trading and investing secure, fast, private, and accessible. This is how the ZKsync Stack helps solve key bottlenecks when bringing finance onchain: Privacy : Grvt runs a ZKsync Validium L2 blockchain that validates L2 state without publishing it, thereby ensuring privacy, an issue that has long plagued most DeFi protocols. Ethereum-level Security : With ZK proofs, L2 transactions inherit Ethereum-level security. Every batch of transactions is verified directly on Ethereum, this means that even though transactions are processed off-chain for speed and low cost, their validity is mathematically guaranteed. If any transaction were invalid, the proof would fail and Ethereum would reject it. Scalability: The ZKsync Stack improves scalability by operating as a L2 solution, enabling the processing of significantly more transactions than Ethereum’s base layer. Accessibility : ZKsync technology makes transactions cheaper by handling them off-chain in bulk and only posting the essential proofs to Ethereum’s base layer, cutting settlement costs dramatically. As a key investment arm of Abu Dhabi’s strategic push into the blockchain space, Further Ventures’ co-leadership of the Series A round consolidates its leading position as a critical force in shaping onchain finance globally. As one of the fastest-growing developer ecosystems in crypto, EigenCloud’s EigenDA, the #1 data availability solution for Ethereum rollups, provides Grvt with the scale and security needed to operate at cloud speed. By anchoring data to a decentralized validator network, EigenDA ensures that Grvt’s ZK stack remains both verifiable and scalable. Looking ahead, Grvt will also tap into EigenDA’s programmable privacy features, which resolve the long-standing paradox between data availability and privacy. This breakthrough allows Grvt to combine data availability with privacy guarantees, an achievement once thought impossible. Looking Ahead Building on Grvt’s innovative foundation, which has already delivered several industry firsts – such as a -1 bps maker fee rebate for all maker orders (a benefit traditionally reserved for institutions) – the immediate next step is the launch of our fixed-yield product. This product will ensure a 10% interest rate return for all users. We will also introduce our flagship market-making strategy, the Grvt Liquidity Provider (GLP), a fund strategy that provides high double-digit APRs, which was once inaccessible to retail traders. Amid the industry’s rapid growth, this funding round establishes a robust, multi-layered foundation. It combines cutting-edge technology, institutional-grade infrastructure, and a secure data framework to create a platform that solidifies its strong position in the increasingly crowded onchain financial space.

Together, the partners are introducing QCDT—the world’s first DFSA-approved (Dubai Financial Services Authority) tokenised money market fund (MMF)—into Bybit’s platform as a collateral asset, marking a breakthrough in bridging traditional finance and digital assets. Bybit is the first global crypto exchange to accept QCDT as collateral, setting a new benchmark for the integration of Real World Assets (RWAs) in digital finance. QCDT is powered by DMZ Finance’s tokenisation expertise and managed by Qatar National Bank, with custodian supported by Standard Chartered Bank. Backed by U.S. Treasuries and regulated within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), QCDT combines institutional-grade security with regulatory clarity. Unlocking Institutional Capital with QCDT Collateralisation The deployment of QCDT as collateral on Bybit creates up to USD 1 billion in borrowing capacity, providing new opportunities for institutions: For Established CEX-Trading Institutions: A secure, compliant channel to deploy institutional funds that would typically remain idle in traditional bank accounts into exchange-based yield strategies. For Traditional Financial Institutions: A safe, regulatory-aligned entry point into digital assets, combining U.S. Treasury-backed yields with low-risk, collateralised participation in the crypto ecosystem. Strengthening Bybit’s Institutional Role This collaboration significantly advances Bybit’s commitment to be the trusted bridge between the crypto economy and traditional financial institutions in the Middle East and globally. Bybit’s adoption of QCDT accomplishes: Institutional Credibility: Bybit becomes the first to support a DFSA-approved, institutional-grade tokenised fund as collateral. Capital Inflows: Unlocks billions of dollars in potential institutional liquidity currently sitting idle in banking systems. Strategic Alignment: Builds trust and confidence through strategic collaboration with QNB, DMZ, and custodian, supported by Standard Chartered Bank. Future Growth: Opens the door to new RWA-linked products, including QCDT-backed stablecoins and yield strategies. Yoyee Wang, Head of Business-to-Business Unit of Bybit, said: “This collaboration is a pivotal step for Bybit’s evolving institutional strategy. By recognising QCDT as collateral, we are opening the gateway for traditional financial institutions and established trading players to participate in the digital asset ecosystem with security, compliance, and efficiency. Our role as the bridge between traditional and digital finance has never been clearer.” Silas Lee, CEO of QNB Singapore, said: “QCDT, a tokenized money market fund, is a pioneering step of using blockchain technology to token real-world assets such as US Treasury securities and USD-denominated deposits, thereby empowering investors to seamlessly integrate high-quality, yield bearing assets from traditional finance into the digital economy. This partnership with DMZ Finance and Bybit allows us to further extend the reach of institutional capital efficiently across traditional and digital markets, backed by a DFSA-approved framework and world-class partners.” Nathan Ma, Co-founder & Chairman, DMZ Finance, added: “At DMZ Finance, our mission is to build powerful infrastructure that makes real-world assets accessible in digital form. Working with Bybit and QNB on QCDT demonstrates how tokenization can bring innovation to institutional markets while bridging liquidity and access for more TradFi investors.” #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, listed on the CBOE under the ticker XRPR, registered a trading volume of $37.7 million, marking the largest debut volume of any ETF launch this year, according to data shared by Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. This first-day tally outpaced the previous record holder, Dan Ives’ Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (IVES), signaling strong investor appetite for alternative investment vehicles linked to coins beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). XRP’s market capitalization recently surpassed that of traditional banking giant Citigroup. Furthermore, Ripple, the company behind XRP, which facilitates cross-border transactions, has applied for a banking license in the U.S. Traders also embraced the REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, ticker DOJE, which generated a first-day volume of $17 million. This placed DOJE among the top five ETF debuts of the year. DOJE’s strong performance is notable given Dogecoin’s reputation as a non-serious meme token. The successful launch of these two ETFs follows the SEC’s decision to approve a new, streamlined listing standard for crypto ETFs, reducing approval times to approximately 75 days from 240 days. First-day net inflow figures are expected to be released later Friday.",Markets|XRP|Dogecoin|DOGE|ETF|Markets|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|XRP|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-19 05:15:12

Trump's emergency appeal today has brought discussions about the independence of the central bank back to the agenda, and this step is said to be of historic importance for the US economy. The request, notably, came just one day after the Fed cut interest rates for the first time in months. If Trump's request is accepted, it would be the first time in the 111-year history of the Fed that a president has removed a sitting member from office. The Trump administration alleged ethical violations by Cook in its filing. Allegedly, Cook claimed to have obtained more favorable mortgage terms by declaring two separate homes as his “primary residence.” Some documents also revealed that he had declared his second property as a “vacation home.” Trump announced his dismissal of Cook on August 25, but on September 10, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb invalidated the dismissal. Cobb stated that Trump had failed to prove that Cook had caused any harm to his position at the Fed or to the public good. Related News: The First Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP ETFs Have Hit the Market - Here's What You Need to Know and a Bloomberg Analyst's Take The Trump administration quickly appealed the decision, but an appeals court also rejected the request to halt the process. The case, which now stands before the Supreme Court, could set a precedent for both the Fed's independence and the power the president can wield over the central bank. Meanwhile, Trump has long criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for his high-interest rate policies. Critics argue that the real purpose of Cook's ouster is to put pressure on the Fed and accelerate the rate cut process. *This is not investment advice.

The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) institutes uniform EU market rules for crypto-assets that are not currently regulated by traditional financial services legislation. The new legal framework will support market integrity and financial stability by regulating public offers of crypto-assets and by ensuring consumers are better informed about their associated risks. The MiCAR standard provides the backing for Water150 to issue its W150 tokens and ensure holders can access the 150 years of premium quality spring water that the digital asset assures in a transparent and legally supervised environment. W150’s fully-regulated status also means it may be listed on trading platforms compliant with MiCAR in the future. The Water150 token is a crypto utility token issued on the Ethereum blockchain by Longhouse Water S.A., a Luxembourg public limited liability company. Each W150 token intends to represent the right to one liter of premium quality spring water per year, for at least 150 years from one of 1,000 planned wells managed under the Longhouse Water Quality Standard, starting January 1, 2027. The maximum supply of W150 tokens is capped at 210 billion units, where each token represents one liter of premium, quality spring water securely reserved and independently verified in Water150’s 1,000-well ecosystem. For the next 150 years, starting from January 2027, Water150 tokenholders will receive a DROP voucher for each Water150 token they hold. The DROP serves as a voucher that can be redeemed for one liter of water within that same year from any well of the holder’s choice. Currently, the DROP token is only intended to be redeemed for liters of water at a 1:1 ratio, with no immediate listing plans, unlike the Water150 token. “Water150’s achievement as Europe’s first MiCA-regulated utility token is a personal assertion of our commitment to credibility, accountability and transparency. On a larger scale, it is a milestone moment for the 30 billion-dollar RWA sector, especially when you consider that the full framework was only implemented at the end of last year. The regulatory standard was advertised as a watertight framework that any of the 27 nation-states in the European Economic Area (EEA) could just superimpose over their specific domestic markets. We welcomed the legal scrutiny that came with the rigorous approval process, and we’re happy to thrive in a regulatory environment that protects the consumer and gives us the legal backing to explore every expansion opportunity supported throughout Europe.” – Sören Müller (COO Web3) The Water150 token is backed by a whitepaper that has been ruled to comply with Title II of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council. About Water150: Water150 is an innovative blockchain-based project created by the Longhouse Foundation, aimed at securing access to premium spring water through a secure, tokenized ecosystem. Led by Longhouse Water150 S.A. in Luxembourg, it connects certified wells—starting with historic sources like Sätra Brunn—to a network of 1,000 springs, managed under the rigorous Longhouse Water Quality Standard for purity and sustainability. Water150 empowers users to secure long-term water rights, fostering a transparent, 150-year vision of hydration backed by real-world assets.",Press Release,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-19 05:41:02

The company, however, still operates exclusively in the U.S. market. According to the Block Data Dashboard, the company has already seen $1.3 billion in monthly trading volume, outpacing rival Polymarket, which stands at $773 million. The last time the prediction platform saw monthly volume topping $1 billion was in November 2024, amid U.S. elections. Kalshi is currently facing state lawsuits Kalshi now takes roughly two-thirds of the global prediction market volume, with 37% going to Polymarket and whatever is left picked up by Limitless and Myriad. Its trading particularly grew in August, partly driven by the NFL season kickoff and its enhanced focus on sports markets. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour, in his statement on the platform’s market share, said, “It’s remarkable to see how fast the platform is growing.” Still, it faces multiple lawsuits accusing it of operating as an unregistered sports betting platform. Authorities in Maryland, Nevada, and New Jersey have all ordered it to stop operations, arguing its markets qualify as sports betting. The cases are now in federal court, with early rulings issued, but final judgments are still pending. Massachusetts took an even tougher stance last week, suing the platform and branding its sports contracts illegal and unsafe sports wagering. The state’s 43-page filing asks the court to block local users from participating, similar to the limitations imposed on Coinbase’s staking programs in some states. Andrea Campbell, the state’s attorney general, claimed that the prediction platform effectively runs a sportsbook without following the licensing and regulatory framework required in Massachusetts. Kalshi, however, pushed back on the allegations, stating, “Kalshi offers its users a fair, transparent, federally-regulated, and nationwide marketplace. Rather than engage in dialogue with Kalshi as many other states have done, Massachusetts is trying to block Kalshi’s innovations by relying on outdated laws and ideas.” Bettors are also leaning toward predictions unrelated to sports So far, Polymarket and Klshi remain the go-to platforms for users betting on real-world events , though the two operate under very different models. Polymarket is a decentralized platform focused on crypto and working to return to the U.S. market through its QCEX acquisition. Kalshi, by contrast, operates as a licensed U.S. exchange and has recently been deepening its ties to the crypto ecosystem by adding support for chains. Kalshi, in partnership with Solana and Base, launched the KalshiEco hub to drive prediction market innovation. The prediction market platform announced the new initiative through its social media channels. The hub is a part of its move to develop prediction market infrastructure based on blockchain, in conjunction with the Solana network and Base, a layer-2 solution by Coinbase. The venture marries Kalshi’s regulatory know-how with Solana’s blockchain infrastructure and Base’s layer-2 scaling tech stack. Base is Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 solution that seeks lower transactional costs and faster processing speed. Analysts at Bernstein see prediction platforms as the next big interface where crypto, AI, and news converge. Sports betting is already a multibillion-dollar industry in the U.S., but the action goes far beyond the playing field. Users are now betting on everything from corporate earnings and key economic announcements to crypto prices. Bernstein even pointed out that more than $200 million on Polymarket and $85 million on Kalshi were traded around the Fed’s 25-bps rate cut. Recent reports indicate that investors may soon buy into both firms. Polymarket is considering a new funding round at a $9–$10 billion valuation, and Kalshi is reportedly close to securing financing that would value it at $5 billion.

This expiry event is pretty close to last week’s , so there is unlikely to be any impact on spot markets, which have moved higher this week. The US Federal Reserve’s first rate reduction of the year was largely priced in by markets, which have taken a minor dip this Friday morning. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.2, meaning that there are more short contracts expiring than longs, as bearish speculation increases. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has reached $2.7 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There is also around $2.2 billion OI at $120,000, but $95,000 is a popular strike price for short sellers with $2 billion in OI. Additionally, total Bitcoin futures OI currently stands at $86 billion, which has climbed back toward all-time highs, according to CoinGlass. Bitcoin options OI by expiration. Source: Deribit “Recent actual volatility has also been substantial, showing a marked increase compared to last month, yet actual trading volume has declined instead; volatility levels and trading volume have diverged,” said crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live earlier this week. In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 177,500 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring, with a notional value of $815 million, and a put/call ratio of 1. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $4.3 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Total crypto market capitalization has retreated slightly over the past few hours, but remains near peak levels at $4.2 trillion. Zooming out shows that overall digital asset markets have been trading sideways since mid-July. Bitcoin inched toward $118,000 in late trading on Thursday, took a wild swing down to $116,750 before recovering to reclaim $117,000 in Friday morning trading in Asia. The asset is around 5.6% away from its all-time high and is maintaining its gains with no major September slump yet. Ethereum has held steady around the $4,600 level for the past 24 hours and remains 7% away from its all-time high. The altcoins have had a solid week with Hyperlink (HYPE) and Binance Coin (BNB) hitting all-time highs. Chainlink, Avalanche, and Sui are today’s top performers while the rest of the high-cap alts remain flat.

Researcher Says XRP Holders Must Listen to This,https://timestabloid.com/they-just-hacked-the-etf-system-researcher-says-xrp-holders-must-listen-to-this/,"Crypto Commentator Ripple Van Winkle posted a message on X saying, “They Just Hacked the ETF System.” The post included a video in which he explained that REX-Osprey had found what he described as a “regulatory side door” through the Investment Company Act of 1940, which he referred to as the “40s Act loophole.” According to Van Winkle, while other companies are “waiting in line for ETF approvals” through the Securities and Exchange Commission’s usual process, REX-Osprey has managed to bypass delays using this alternative route. They Just Hacked the ETF System Must Listen $XRP Holders! pic.twitter.com/70tTtEp1BA — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) September 16, 2025 In his explanation, he compared the traditional approval process to waiting at the DMV and said that this new path allows the issuer to effectively “skip the line.” He emphasized that the importance of this development lies in the role exchange-traded funds play as a bridge for institutional investors, highlighting retirement accounts, pension funds, and hedge funds as the types of capital most likely to enter through these vehicles. He argued that by using the 1940 Act structure, the fund may come to market more quickly than many anticipated, which could accelerate broader access to digital assets such as XRP . Implications for Institutional Capital Van Winkle emphasized that ETFs are crucial for institutional participation in crypto markets, as they offer a regulated framework for large capital pools. He noted that the SEC has historically taken years to approve crypto-based ETFs, creating delays for investors seeking exposure. By pointing to the REX-Osprey filing , he suggested that this new approach changes expectations around timing and could bring what he called “bigger money flowing in sooner than anyone thought.” He went further to explain that once one entity gains approval through such a mechanism, other market participants are likely to follow, which may lead to a wider opening of the market. Van Winkle concluded by asking viewers whether this should be viewed as a “genius move” or a “dangerous act,” leaving the matter open for interpretation but underscoring that the consequences could be significant. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Reaction and Additional Commentary The post received engagement from users offering different interpretations. One user, Edward, commented that the move may represent “a way for the SEC to give gentle approval” and described it as a method for the regulator to “carefully open the door now for the other ETFs without fanfare.” This perspective frames the development not as a circumvention but rather as a deliberate step by the SEC to introduce such products into the market gradually. Industry coverage of REX-Osprey’s filing under the Investment Company Act of 1940 supports the factual basis of Van Winkle’s remarks, noting that the structure does provide a route to market that can, under certain conditions, become effective without extended delays. Analysts have also observed that this may encourage faster institutional access. Still, caution remains about how regulators may ultimately respond and whether similar filings will be permitted to proceed without challenge.

The Houston Rockets forward, who begins his 18th NBA season this year, successfully reset his account with help from Coinbase support tools, CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed on X. The issue dated back to 2016, when Durant and his agent Rich Kleiman first bought Bitcoin after attending a birthday party hosted by venture capitalist Ben Horowitz. Kleiman recounted the story at CNBC’s Game Plan conference in Los Angeles this week. “I just heard the word ‘Bitcoin’ 25 times this evening, and the next day, we started investing in Bitcoin,” Kleiman recalled at the event. He did not disclose how much Bitcoin was bought. We got this fixed. Account recovery complete! https://t.co/TWYFpQkXsb — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 19, 2025 With Account Restored, Durant Gains Access to Soaring Bitcoin Holdings Bitcoin was trading at about $600 when Durant first bought in. Today, the price hovers near $117,000. This marks an almost 200-fold jump in value. Because Durant could not access his account for years, those holdings remained untouched. As a result, they sat through one of the most dramatic bull runs in financial history. The problem stemmed from lost login credentials, something Kleiman joked about on stage. “But Bitcoin keeps going up … so, I mean, it’s only benefited us,” he said. That process is now resolved. Durant’s Venture Bets and Coinbase Ties Span Nearly a Decade Durant has been closely tied to Coinbase for years. He and Kleiman invested in the company in 2017 through their venture firm Thirty Five Ventures. Since 2021, Durant has also been a brand partner for the exchange. Durant’s crypto journey began just as his basketball career reached new heights. He had joined the Golden State Warriors in 2016 and won his first NBA championship the following season. Now with the Rockets, he is the league’s seventh all-time leading scorer. He is also part of a growing group of NBA players who have embraced digital assets. Cleveland Cavaliers center Tristan Thompson launched a Web3 fan engagement project this week, while Charlotte Hornets guard Spencer Dinwiddie once tried to tokenize his NBA contract.

In a press release issued on Thursday, Ripple announced that the collaboration would utilize tokenized money market funds (TMMFs) and the blockchain payment firm’s stablecoin, RLUSD, to provide new financial solutions. DBS Explores Liquidity Solutions With sgBENJI Tokens Under this agreement, DBS Group, Singapore’s largest lender, will list Franklin Templeton’s sgBENJI token, which represents the asset manager’s tokenized US dollar money market fund, on the DBS Digital Exchange. This partnership marks a new milestone in the maturation of the digital asset ecosystem, which has been garnering increased interest from institutional investors—87% of whom are expected to invest in digital assets by 2025. For context, crypto MMFs, or tokenized money market funds , are blockchain-based digital versions of traditional MMMFs that offer investors high liquidity, low-risk, short-term yield and ability to manage cash more efficiently. The collaboration aims to enable clients to manage their digital asset portfolios more effectively, particularly in response to the increased volatility seen in the broader digital asset industry over the past couple of months. By listing sgBENJI alongside RLUSD on the DBS Digital Exchange, eligible clients can quickly trade RLUSD for sgBENJI tokens. This allows for portfolio rebalancing into a more stable asset within minutes and around the clock. Looking ahead, DBS plans to explore further liquidity options for clients by using sgBENJI tokens as collateral. This could involve facilitating credit through repurchase transactions (repo) or collaborating with third-party platforms, with DBS acting as a trusted agent holding the collateral. Ripple’s XRP Ledger Chosen For sgBENJI Tokenization To enhance the tokenization ecosystem, Franklin Templeton will utilize the XRP Ledger (XRPL), designed for low-cost global financial transactions, for tokenizing sgBENJI. Per the announcement, the choice of Ripple’s blockchain is driven by its speed, efficiency, and low transaction costs, making it an ideal platform for managing high-volume, low-latency assets like tokenized money market funds. Lim Wee Kian, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange, emphasized the need for solutions that cater to the demands of a continuously evolving digital asset landscape. He stated that this partnership exemplifies how tokenized securities can enhance efficiency and liquidity in global financial markets. Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, echoed Kian’s statement on the new partnership, highlighting the potential of blockchain and tokenization in reshaping the financial ecosystem. Lastly, Nigel Khakoo, VP and Global Head of Trading and Markets at Ripple, noted that this collaboration represents a significant advancement in the utility of tokenized securities. He described the partnership as a “game-changer” for investors, who will now be able to seamlessly rebalance their portfolios between stablecoins and yield-generating money market funds within a single, trusted framework. At the time of writing, Ripple’s associated token, XRP, is trading at $3.10, capitalizing on the market’s new uptrend with a 3.2% surge over the last 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency remains 14% below its all-time high of $3.65.

While the price of BNB reached an all-time high of $1,000, the prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum remained largely flat. Analysts say this suggests investors lack confidence that the Fed is truly shifting to a looser monetary policy path. Wave Digital Assets CEO David Siemer stated that he expects the effects of the interest rate cut to be seen over time, saying, “Bitcoin could rise to approximately $130,000 by the end of the year, while Ethereum could rise to $6,000.” Related News: Big Day Tomorrow: ETF Including Bitcoin and 4 Altcoins to Hit the Market However, experts say a single interest rate cut wasn't enough to generate market excitement. “A rate cut is a tailwind, but it doesn't create a paradigm shift in the market,” said Ira Auerbach, president of Tandem, a subsidiary of Offchain Labs, and a former Nasdaq executive. “The direction is in crypto's favor, but a single move doesn't determine the trend.” Stocktwits market strategist Tom Bruni, however, stated that investors had already priced in the news, interpreting the current stagnation as a sell-off.

Dieser Bereich hatte schon in den letzten Tagen für Stabilität gesorgt. Der Bounce brachte den Kurs zurück in die Zone, die der Experte Mario von Krypto Trading und Investing bereits seit einer Woche als entscheidend markiert hatte. Dort entscheidet sich, ob es erneut in Richtung 100.000 US-Dollar nach unten geht oder ob der Markt die Rally fortsetzt. Kurzfristig bleibt es damit ein klassisches „Wenn-dann-Spiel“. Sollte Bitcoin den Bereich nach unten verlassen, wäre eine Short-Strategie denkbar. Noch ist das aber nicht der Fall – im Gegenteil: aktuell liegt der Fokus eher auf der Möglichkeit eines Ausbruchs nach oben. Auf Tagesbasis wartet bei 120.000 US-Dollar der nächste harte Widerstand. Schafft es der Kurs, diese Marke zu überwinden, stehen die Chancen gut, dass die Reise direkt in Richtung neues Allzeithoch führt. Aktuell sieht der Analyst eher die wahrscheinlichkeit für einen Ausbruch, Quelle: https://www.youtube.com/ Solange diese Schwelle jedoch nicht auf Tagesschlussbasis gebrochen wird, sehen viele Trader keinen klaren Trade. Der Markt befindet sich sprichwörtlich im Niemandsland – zwischen einem stabilen Support und einer massiven Widerstandszone. Ethereum mit klaren Marken Auch bei Ethereum gab es in den letzten Stunden Bewegung. Der Kurs sprang deutlich nach oben und schloss damit offene Gaps. Die Bewegung wirkt sauber, doch ein echter Ausbruch fehlt noch. Aktuell notiert ETH knapp unter der diagonalen Widerstandslinie und testet den Bereich rund um 4.480 bis 4.700 US-Dollar. Ein Bruch nach oben würde Platz für eine Rally in Richtung neues Allzeithoch schaffen. Scheitert Ethereum jedoch erneut, könnte es schnell wieder nach unten gehen. Unterhalb von 4.350 US-Dollar wäre ein Rückfall von 15 bis 20 Prozent nicht ausgeschlossen. Auch hier gilt: noch ist der Markt neutral, und Trader warten auf das nächste klare Signal. Ethereum bleibt immer wieder im Bereich, Quelle: www.coinmarketcap.com Viele Marktteilnehmer bleiben vorsichtig. Zum einen, weil große Events wie die Zinsentscheidung der Bank of Japan und der bevorstehende Hexensabbat zusätzliche Volatilität bringen könnten. Zum anderen, weil sowohl Bitcoin als auch Ethereum aktuell unter Widerstand und über Support handeln – ein Zustand, der selten klare Einstiege erlaubt. Trader warten auf das Signal Der Experte fasst die aktuelle Lage pragmatisch zusammen: Wer bereits Long-Positionen hält, sollte sie sichern, solange die wichtigen Supports intakt bleiben. Neue Short-Positionen sind derzeit nicht sinnvoll, solange keine zentrale Unterstützung fällt. Auf der anderen Seite gilt: Ein Tagesschlusskurs über 120.000 US-Dollar bei Bitcoin oder über 4.700 US-Dollar bei Ethereum wäre das Startsignal für neue Long-Trades. Bis dahin heißt es: abwarten. Denn oft zeigen die Märkte ihre wahre Richtung erst ein bis zwei Tage nach großen Notenbank-Events. Dass die kommenden Tage turbulent werden, scheint ausgemacht. Aktive Trader gehen daher derzeit eher den Weg, Alternativen im Altcoinsektor zu suchen. Sollte der Altcoin Markt wie erwartet explodieren, wären mit Tools wie Snorter bei vielen Coins Steigerungen von 1.000 Prozent und mehr möglich. SNORTER Bot im Vergleich zu anderen Trading Bots, Quelle: https://snortertoken.com/de Snorter ICO mit rasantem Wachstum Snorter setzt mit sienem nativen Token $SNORT als Krypto Handelsbot auf Solana als Heimatnetzwerk. Das ermöglicht schnelle Transaktionen bei geringen Gebühren, ein klarer Vorteil gegenüber vielen Ethereum-basierten Bots. Neue Features wie MEV-Schutz, automatisiertes Copy-Trading und erweiterte DEX-Unterstützung sind bereits live. Besonders spannend: die Integration von Pump.fun und PumpSwap, zwei der aktivsten Launchpads für neue Meme-Coins. Damit können Trader Token extrem früh erkennen und handeln, bevor sie auf dem breiteren Markt landen. Der eigentliche Clou: Snorter nutzt private RPC-Endpunkte, die wie Datenautobahnen direkt mit der Blockchain verbunden sind. So erkennt der Bot Liquidität, Wallet-Bewegungen und neue Verträge, noch bevor diese im öffentlichen Orderbuch sichtbar werden. Trades laufen in Sekundenbruchteilen direkt in Telegramab, ein Feature, das gerade für Retail-Trader den Unterschied machen kann. Die Nachfrage nach dem nativen Token wächst entsprechend. Mit einer Gebührenstruktur von nur 0,85 Prozent, Staking-Rewards und Governance-Rechten bildet SNORT das Zentrum des Ökosystems. Mehrere Krypto-Portale haben dem Projekt bereits das Potenzial für bis zu 30x Gewinne zugesprochen. Ob sich diese Prognose erfüllt, bleibt wie immer bei risikoreichen Memecoins offen. Doch die Dynamik im Presale zeigt, dass Trader nach Chancen suchen, die über die etablierten Blue Chips hinausgehen. Der Telegram-Trading-Bot Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) nähert sich der Marke von 4 Millionen US-Dollar an eingesammeltem Kapital. Parallel dazu rollt das Projekt schon jetzt Updates aus, die es zu einem ernsthaften Konkurrenten etablierter Bots machen. Hier Snorter Bot Token im Presale kaufen.

In an interview with The Block, the Ethereum co-founder said, “The Mask token is coming.” “It may come sooner than you would expect right now. And it is significantly related to the decentralization of certain aspects of the MetaMask platform,” Lubin added.

You’ll be able to find a link directly in the wallet,” he said at the time. Further, the current relaxed regulatory environment makes the token launch safer, Finlay added.

More liquidity for the XRP ecosystem…” His comment came shortly after CME Group announced that it would be expanding its cryptocurrency derivatives offering to include options on XRP and Solana (SOL) futures. Gilbertie’s remark reflects the increasing recognition that regulated derivatives markets contribute to deeper liquidity, broader participation, and greater institutional accessibility for digital assets such as XRP. BOOM! More liquidity for the XRP ecosystem… pic.twitter.com/2Zq2OXF8iK — Sal Gilbertie (@GilbertieSal) September 17, 2025 CME Group’s Plan to Launch Options on XRP Futures CME Group confirmed that it will introduce options on both standard and micro-sized XRP futures beginning October 13, 2025, pending regulatory approval. These contracts will offer daily, monthly, and quarterly expirations and will be available on CME’s established trading infrastructure. The addition of options complements the existing futures launched earlier in 2025, providing institutional and retail traders with additional instruments to manage risk and refine exposure to XRP. The decision to expand the product suite is backed by strong trading performance in the futures market. Since their launch in May 2025, XRP futures have recorded more than 370,000 contracts traded, representing approximately $16.2 billion in notional value. In August 2025, XRP futures posted an average daily volume of approximately 6,600 contracts, equal to roughly $385 million in notional terms, with open interest reaching about 9,300 contracts valued at nearly $942 million. These figures illustrate the steady growth of XRP derivatives activity within CME’s marketplace. Link Between Market Structure and Liquidity By pointing to liquidity in his post, Gilbertie highlighted the practical effect of CME’s expansion. Liquidity is a central concern for institutions, market makers, and asset managers, as it directly impacts the ability to enter and exit positions efficiently. The introduction of options is widely seen as a step toward enhancing this condition because it enables more sophisticated hedging and trading strategies than futures alone. For the XRP market , the presence of standardized options contracts in a regulated venue is expected to attract additional participation from professional traders who seek secure and transparent environments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Impact on the XRP Ecosystem The introduction of micro contracts further extends access to a wider range of participants by lowering capital requirements. This is significant because it opens CME’s options market to smaller trading firms and retail investors, contributing to a broader base of activity. Increased derivatives participation not only supports liquidity but can also improve price discovery and risk management. For XRP specifically, the expansion of listed derivatives strengthens its presence within traditional financial infrastructure. While price movements will continue to depend on multiple factors, CME’s step to list options on XRP futures confirms rising institutional interest and demand for structured exposure to the asset. Pending regulatory approval, the October rollout is positioned to increase liquidity and broaden participation in XRP trading, aligning with the outlook Gilbertie highlighted in his remark.

Speaking to CNBC, Gary Gensler said he has no regrets about regulating the cryptocurrency market and the actions he took for it. While Gensler stated that his views on Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies have not changed, he argues that cryptocurrencies are still speculative. Gensler stated that he does not regret the strong sanctions and regulations imposed on the cryptocurrency sector during his tenure, as fraud was rampant at the time. Gensler, seen as a key figure in the crackdown on the crypto sector, stated that the SEC has filed approximately 100 lawsuits against crypto companies under his leadership, a number comparable to his predecessor's tenure. “During my time in office, the cryptocurrency market was rife with scams. I do not regret the sanctions I imposed on cryptocurrencies and the regulation I implemented.” Only Bitcoin Will Be Permanent! Gensler, who continues to stand by his ideas, argued that most cryptocurrencies survive on speculation and hype rather than value creation. He emphasized that cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are fundamentally devoid of fundamentals and are highly speculative, risky assets. Gensler stated that while BTC may survive for a long time, the rest of the cryptocurrency market may not.

Key Takeaways: Nubank plans to pilot dollar-pegged stablecoin payments through its credit cards. Campos Neto says crypto is gradually shifting from a store of value to a payment tool. Stablecoin adoption is accelerating across Latin America amid high inflation and currency instability. Speaking at the Meridian 2025 event on Wednesday , Nubank vice-chairman and former Brazilian central bank governor Roberto Campos Neto revealed the bank’s plans to pilot stablecoin-based payments. He emphasized the growing importance of blockchain technology in bridging digital assets with the traditional banking system. Nubank Sees Shift in Stablecoins Use Campos Neto noted that while many people are buying crypto as a store of value rather than for transactions, this behavior is gradually shifting. “We need to understand why this is happening,” he said, pointing to the need for banks to evolve by accepting tokenized deposits and enabling credit issuance backed by digital assets. Nubank’s move into stablecoins reflects its ongoing expansion into the crypto space. The São Paulo–based bank, which serves over 100 million customers across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, entered the market in 2022 with a Bitcoin allocation and crypto trading services. It later added support for altcoins such as Cardano, Cosmos, Near Protocol, and Algorand in early 2025. The stablecoin trend is particularly strong in Brazil. In February, the country’s central bank president revealed that 90% of crypto activity there was tied to stablecoins. High inflation and currency volatility have made dollar-pegged tokens like USDT and USDC attractive alternatives. Neighboring countries are seeing similar adoption patterns. In Argentina, where inflation has surged past 100%, stablecoins accounted for over 70% of all crypto purchases in 2024, according to Bitso. In Venezuela, where annual inflation hit 229% in May, tokens like USDT are increasingly used in daily commerce, with nearly half of all sub-$10,000 crypto transactions made in stablecoins. Even Bolivia has shifted its stance, lifting its crypto ban in 2024 and signing an agreement with El Salvador to promote crypto adoption. The Bolivian central bank now supports Bitcoin and stablecoin payments within its financial system.

Tether’s latest move underscores a pragmatic shift toward that future. As reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, projecting the market could balloon from its current $250 billion capitalization to as much as $2 trillion in the near future. “Many people think it will reach $1 to $2 trillion in a handful of years,” Garlinghouse said, adding that Ripple is positioned to benefit from that trajectory. Meanwhile, Western Union is positioning itself for a new phase of digital transformation, signaling strong interest in using stablecoins to modernize its global remittance operations.

For those deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro shifts is paramount. A stronger U.S. dollar, for instance, can often impact risk appetite, influencing capital flows and, by extension, the sentiment around digital assets. Currently, we are witnessing a crucial juncture where the dollar’s resurgence is creating a distinct dynamic, particularly within Asian currency markets, while the Japanese Yen carves out its own path. Let’s delve into the intricacies of these developments and what they signify for the broader financial landscape. Understanding the Dollar Recovery : What’s Driving the Greenback’s Resurgence? The U.S. dollar, often seen as the global reserve currency and a safe haven, has been staging a notable recovery. This resurgence isn’t accidental; it’s a confluence of several powerful economic forces. Primarily, robust economic data emerging from the United States has played a pivotal role. Strong employment figures, resilient consumer spending, and an inflation rate that, while moderating, remains a concern for policymakers, have all contributed to a narrative of U.S. economic exceptionalism. Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s commitment to maintaining a restrictive monetary policy stance, even as other central banks consider easing, creates attractive yield differentials. Higher interest rates in the U.S. make dollar-denominated assets more appealing to global investors, increasing demand for the greenback. Safe-Haven Demand: Global geopolitical uncertainties and economic slowdowns in other major economies often lead investors to seek refuge in the perceived safety of the U.S. dollar. This flight to quality strengthens the dollar, especially during periods of market volatility. Economic Resilience: Compared to many other developed nations, the U.S. economy has shown remarkable resilience, defying recession fears. This positive outlook attracts foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows, further bolstering the dollar. This strengthening dollar has profound implications, not just for traditional assets but also for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where a stronger dollar can sometimes signal a ‘risk-off’ environment, potentially leading to outflows from riskier assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Navigating Muted Asia FX : How Are Regional Currencies Faring? Against the backdrop of a recovering dollar, currencies across Asia have largely remained muted, experiencing varying degrees of pressure. The strength of the U.S. dollar makes imports more expensive for Asian nations and can lead to capital outflows as investors seek higher returns in dollar-denominated assets. This dynamic puts central banks in a challenging position, balancing the need to support economic growth with the imperative to maintain currency stability. Consider the performance of key Asian currencies: Currency Performance Snapshot (Illustrative) Currency Recent Trend Against USD Key Influencing Factors Korean Won (KRW) Slightly weaker Export performance, semiconductor cycle, domestic inflation. Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) Modestly weaker Commodity prices (oil, palm oil), U.S. rate expectations. Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) Relatively stable, some pressure Commodity exports, robust domestic demand, foreign portfolio inflows. Chinese Yuan (CNY) Carefully managed, some depreciation pressure Economic growth concerns, PBoC policy, trade balance. The muted response in Asia FX reflects a delicate balancing act. While some economies benefit from strong export demand, the overall sentiment is tempered by the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates and the potential for reduced global trade volumes. Central banks in the region are closely monitoring these developments, often intervening in markets to prevent excessive volatility, which could destabilize their economies. The challenge lies in managing inflation without stifling economic growth, all while contending with external pressures from the dollar’s strength. The Surge of Yen Strength : What’s Behind Japan’s Currency Revival? While much of Asia FX faces headwinds, the Japanese Yen (JPY) has shown a distinct firmness, standing out from its regional counterparts. For years, the Yen was a poster child for weakness, battered by the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) ultra-loose monetary policy and significant interest rate differentials. However, recent developments suggest a potential turning point, leading to notable Yen Strength . Shifting BOJ Stance: The primary driver behind the Yen’s recent appreciation is the growing market expectation of a hawkish pivot from the Bank of Japan. For a long time, the BOJ maintained negative interest rates and a strict yield curve control (YCC) policy, capping long-term bond yields. However, persistent inflation, even if modest by global standards, is putting pressure on the BOJ to normalize policy. Speculation on Policy Adjustments: Traders are increasingly betting that the BOJ will either scrap its negative interest rate policy, adjust its YCC framework, or both, in the near future. Any move away from its long-standing dovish stance would narrow the interest rate differential with other major economies, making the Yen more attractive. BOJ ETF Sales Ring Hawkish: A particularly significant signal came from reports of the BOJ reducing its holdings of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While not a direct monetary policy tool in the same vein as interest rates, the BOJ’s historical purchases of ETFs were part of its unconventional easing measures aimed at supporting asset prices and the economy. A reduction in these holdings is interpreted by some market participants as a subtle, yet significant, step towards unwinding its massive stimulus program. This action, coupled with other subtle shifts in communication, is being read as a distinctly hawkish signal, fueling expectations of further policy normalization and contributing to Yen Strength . This shift is not just about the Yen; it represents a significant potential change in one of the world’s most influential central banks, with ripple effects across global financial markets. Decoding BOJ Policy : A Hawkish Turn or Strategic Maneuver? The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has long been an outlier among major central banks, steadfastly maintaining an ultra-loose monetary policy even as its peers aggressively hiked rates. However, the narrative around BOJ Policy is rapidly evolving. The recent firmness in the Yen, particularly following reports of ETF sales, suggests that markets are interpreting the BOJ’s actions and communications as increasingly hawkish. Is this a definitive hawkish turn, or a carefully calibrated strategic maneuver? Key Aspects of BOJ’s Evolving Stance: Inflationary Pressures: Japan has experienced sustained inflation above the BOJ’s 2% target, driven by higher import costs and a weakening Yen. While the BOJ has long argued that this inflation is cost-push and not demand-driven, the persistence of price increases is becoming harder to ignore. Wage Growth: Crucially, there are signs of stronger wage growth in Japan, a key prerequisite for the BOJ to consider sustainable inflation and policy normalization. Significant wage hikes agreed upon in recent labor negotiations have fueled optimism. Yield Curve Control (YCC) Adjustments: The BOJ has already made subtle adjustments to its YCC policy, widening the band within which 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields are allowed to fluctuate. This was seen as a precursor to further normalization. ETF Sales as a Signal: The reported reduction in BOJ ETF holdings is particularly telling. While the BOJ may frame it as a technical adjustment, the market sees it as a withdrawal of stimulus, aligning with a more hawkish posture. It signals a readiness to reduce its massive balance sheet, a step towards normalization that many have awaited. The challenge for the BOJ is to manage expectations without causing undue market disruption. A sudden, aggressive shift could lead to excessive Yen appreciation, harming Japan’s export-oriented economy, and potentially destabilizing global bond markets. Therefore, any move is likely to be gradual and well-communicated, but the direction of travel appears increasingly clear: away from ultra-dovishness towards a more normalized BOJ Policy . Impact on the Global Forex Market : What Lies Ahead for Traders? The interplay of a recovering U.S. dollar, muted Asia FX, and a firming Yen creates a complex and dynamic environment for the global Forex Market . These shifts have far-reaching implications for international trade, capital flows, and investment strategies. Traders and investors need to be acutely aware of these trends to navigate the coming months successfully. Challenges and Opportunities: For Exporters and Importers: A strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive and imports cheaper. For Asian nations, a strong dollar and a relatively weaker local currency make imports pricier, potentially fueling domestic inflation. Conversely, a stronger Yen could make Japanese exports less competitive but reduce the cost of imports for Japanese consumers and businesses. For Global Investors: The divergence in monetary policies (Fed tightening, BOJ potentially normalizing, other central banks contemplating easing) creates opportunities in currency pairs. Carry trades, where investors borrow in a low-interest-rate currency to invest in a high-interest-rate currency, could see renewed interest, particularly with a hawkish BOJ. Capital Flows: A strong dollar tends to attract capital to the U.S., potentially drawing funds away from emerging markets in Asia. However, a more stable or appreciating Yen could attract foreign investment into Japan, particularly if accompanied by positive economic reforms. Volatility: Periods of significant policy shifts or economic divergence often lead to increased currency volatility. This presents both risks and opportunities for short-term traders. Actionable Insights for the Forex Market: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, and other Asian central banks. Their forward guidance is crucial. Track Economic Data: Key economic indicators (inflation, GDP, employment) from the U.S. and Japan will continue to drive currency movements. Diversify Portfolios: Given the evolving landscape, diversification across different currencies and asset classes can help mitigate risks. Consider Hedging Strategies: Businesses engaged in international trade should review their hedging strategies to protect against adverse currency movements. The coming months promise to be dynamic in the Forex Market as these powerful forces continue to unfold, shaping the global financial architecture. Conclusion: A Shifting Global Currency Landscape The current state of the global Forex Market is a testament to the intricate dance of monetary policy, economic fundamentals, and geopolitical factors. The U.S. dollar’s robust recovery, fueled by economic resilience and hawkish Federal Reserve expectations, is exerting pressure on many Asia FX currencies, leading to a largely muted performance across the region. However, the Japanese Yen stands as a notable exception, experiencing significant Yen Strength . This appreciation is largely driven by growing market conviction that the BOJ Policy is on the cusp of a significant hawkish shift, with recent ETF sales ringing as a particularly strong signal. For investors and traders, understanding these divergent trends is crucial. The implications range from altered trade dynamics and capital flows to new opportunities in currency pairs. As central banks continue to navigate inflation and growth challenges, the global currency landscape remains a fascinating and vital area of focus, directly influencing broader financial stability and investment decisions.

Recently, Gary Gensler, the former Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), made headlines again with his resolute stance on the industry. Speaking on CNBC, Gensler declared he has absolutely no regrets about the robust enforcement actions and regulations imposed on the cryptocurrency sector during his tenure. He firmly believes these measures were crucial, citing rampant fraud as a primary concern at the time. Why is Strong Crypto Regulation Essential, According to Gensler? Gensler, often viewed as a pivotal figure in the industry’s crackdown, underscored the SEC’s proactive approach under his leadership. He highlighted that the SEC initiated approximately 100 lawsuits against various crypto firms during his term, a figure he noted was comparable to that of his predecessor. His core argument centers on the fundamental nature of most cryptocurrencies: Momentum and Hype: Many digital assets, in Gensler’s view, thrive on speculative momentum and market hype rather than genuine value creation. Lack of Fundamentals: He emphasized that, with the notable exception of Bitcoin, most other coins lack solid underlying fundamentals. High Risk: Consequently, these assets are deemed highly speculative and inherently risky for investors. Gensler’s unwavering commitment to investor protection was the driving force behind these regulatory implementations. He consistently argued that robust oversight was not about stifling innovation but about safeguarding the public from potential harm in an often-untransparent market. Understanding Gensler’s Perspective on Speculative Assets The distinction Gensler draws between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is key to understanding his regulatory philosophy. While he acknowledges Bitcoin’s potential for long-term survival, he views the vast majority of the altcoin market differently. His comments in April, where he suggested that while BTC might endure, the rest of the cryptocurrency market would not, echo his recent statements. This perspective is rooted in a traditional finance framework, where assets are typically evaluated based on their utility, underlying technology, or revenue generation. For many altcoins, Gensler perceives these traditional metrics as absent or insufficient, leading to his classification of them as highly speculative ventures. The need for clear crypto regulation becomes paramount in such an environment to mitigate systemic risks and protect retail investors. What Challenges Did Unregulated Crypto Markets Pose? During Gensler’s leadership, the crypto landscape was characterized by rapid growth alongside significant regulatory ambiguities. This created fertile ground for various challenges, including: Fraudulent Schemes: Numerous instances of Ponzi schemes, rug pulls, and deceptive practices emerged, leading to substantial financial losses for investors. Market Manipulation: The absence of comprehensive oversight made markets susceptible to manipulation, further endangering investor capital. Lack of Disclosure: Many crypto projects operated without adequate disclosure requirements, leaving investors with incomplete information about the risks involved. These challenges underscored the urgency for the SEC to act. Gensler’s enforcement actions were, therefore, presented as a necessary response to a market that, in his opinion, often operated outside established investor protection frameworks. His consistent message has been that if a crypto asset functions like a security, it should be regulated as one, irrespective of its technological novelty. This principle guides his approach to crypto regulation . The Future of Crypto Regulation: A Glimpse from Gensler Having returned to his professorship at MIT, Gensler’s influence on the discourse around digital assets remains significant. His continued emphasis on investor protection and the speculative nature of most cryptocurrencies suggests a future where regulatory scrutiny will likely persist. While the industry yearns for clearer guidelines and perhaps a more tailored approach, Gensler’s tenure has undeniably set a precedent for a more assertive regulatory environment. His insights highlight a fundamental tension: the innovative, decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency versus the established principles of financial oversight designed to protect the public. Moving forward, the balance between fostering innovation and ensuring market integrity will remain a central theme in the ongoing evolution of crypto regulation globally. Summary: Gensler’s Unwavering Stance Gary Gensler’s recent comments reinforce his consistent belief in the necessity of strong crypto regulation . His tenure at the SEC was marked by a proactive stance against what he perceived as rampant fraud and speculative behavior within the cryptocurrency market. With no regrets about the enforcement actions taken, Gensler continues to advocate for investor protection, distinguishing Bitcoin from the vast majority of altcoins due to their perceived lack of fundamental value. His legacy will undoubtedly influence future regulatory discussions and shape how digital assets are integrated into the broader financial system. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why does Gary Gensler believe most cryptocurrencies are speculative? Gensler argues that most cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, lack strong underlying fundamentals and primarily survive on market momentum and hype rather than genuine value creation, making them highly speculative and risky assets. What was the primary goal of the SEC’s enforcement actions under Gensler’s leadership? The primary goal was to protect investors from rampant fraud and the inherent risks associated with speculative crypto assets, ensuring that if an asset functions like a security, it is regulated as such. How many lawsuits did the SEC file against crypto firms during Gensler’s tenure? Under Gary Gensler’s leadership, the SEC filed approximately 100 lawsuits against various cryptocurrency firms, a figure he noted was comparable to his predecessor’s term. Does Gensler distinguish between different cryptocurrencies? Yes, Gensler notably distinguishes Bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies (altcoins). He suggests Bitcoin might endure long-term, while most other digital assets lack the fundamentals for sustained survival and are highly speculative. What is Gary Gensler’s current role? After his tenure as SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler has returned to his professorship at MIT, where he continues to share his insights on finance and technology.

This is the third round of Vision Fund layoffs since 2022, but it comes after the fund’s best quarter in more than two years. The move shows Son is turning away from many small startup bets and focusing on big, concentrated AI projects. SoftBank cuts Vision Fund staff to sharpen AI focus One in five employees out of the 300+ that SoftBank’s Vision Fund hires worldwide will lose their jobs to AI. Earlier layoffs happened when the fund struggled with heavy losses from risky bets on companies like WeWork that failed to deliver long-term value. The group had to sell its assets and reduce its activities to rebuild trust with investors. All that has changed now because the Vision Fund announced its strongest results since mid-2021, thanks to gains in companies like Nvidia and Coupang. So the fact that these job cuts are coming after strong results shows that the company is planning something big for the long term. A spokesperson for the Vision Fund said the company wants to focus on “bold, high-conviction investments in AI and breakthrough technologies,” which means it will put its money on fewer projects but with bigger risks. This differs from when it invested in hundreds of startups and tried to capture growth wherever possible. Founder Masayoshi Son even said the company’s future depends on AI and wants to move more people, time, and money into that area. The cysts aren’t just about saving money, but also preparing the Vision Fund to play a new role in AI and rebuild its position as one of the most influential investment funds worldwide. Son leads $500B push into data centers and AI models Masayoshi Son announced a $500 billion plan called the Stargate project to build a large network of data centers across the United States. The company aims to work with OpenAI to ensure these data centers can provide the huge amount of computing power that modern artificial intelligence systems need. SoftBank has also been investing a lot of money into OpenAI. Vision Fund invested $9.7 billion into OpenAI through Vision Fund 2 (controls around $65.8 billion in assets overall). Son believes OpenAI and its foundation models will transform many different industries and create brand-new markets that don’t exist yet. Son also wants to build an ecosystem with AI chips that provide raw computing power and data centers that host the models and the foundation models that power applications. SoftBank has invested in chip design companies like Graphcore and Ampere Computing, and bought shares in companies like Intel and Nvidia to access the most advanced chips. It also owns its own chip design company, Arm, whose technology is used in billions of devices worldwide. There are still risks involved with Son’s vision because the Stargate project in the United States needs large amounts of money, land, power, and advanced technology. Reports have already shown that the project faces delays. A similar joint project in Japan with OpenAI has also experienced problems, and these delays prove that even a company as experienced and well-funded as SoftBank can face unexpected challenges that slow down progress. Financial leaders at SoftBank have tried to convince investors that the company was always ready to handle such challenges. Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said SoftBank holds about 4 trillion yen (around $27 billion) in cash reserves ready to invest in new projects while leaving enough behind to deal with delays.

This significant development brings fresh opportunities for traders looking to diversify their portfolios and explore emerging digital assets. Mark your calendars for September 19, because that’s when Ether.fi (ETHFI), Resolve (RESOLV), Initia (INIT), and Spark (SPK) will officially become available for trading against both Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) at 6:00 a.m. UTC. This strategic move by Upbit is set to energize the market and offer its users access to a new wave of innovative blockchain projects. What Do These Upbit New Listings Offer Traders? Upbit, a major player in the global crypto exchange landscape, consistently seeks to expand its offerings to meet the evolving demands of its user base. These latest additions are no exception. The inclusion of ETHFI, RESOLV, INIT, and SPK reflects a growing interest in various sectors of the blockchain ecosystem, from decentralized finance to infrastructure solutions. Each of these projects brings unique propositions to the table, potentially attracting different segments of the trading community and fostering broader market participation. Let’s take a closer look at what each of these Upbit new listings represents: Ether.fi (ETHFI): This project is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol for Ethereum. It allows users to stake their ETH while retaining control over their keys, and receive eETH, a liquid staking token. This innovation addresses a key demand in the DeFi space, offering flexibility and utility for staked assets within the Ethereum ecosystem. Resolve (RESOLV): Details about Resolve are less publicly known at the moment of the announcement. However, new listings like RESOLV often emerge from areas such as data privacy, decentralized finance solutions, or supply chain management. Traders will need to conduct thorough research into its whitepaper and use cases to understand its core value proposition and market potential. Initia (INIT): Initia is building an “omninetwork” of interconnected blockchains, specifically designed for modular rollups. Its goal is to simplify the creation and deployment of application-specific blockchains, thereby fostering a more scalable and interoperable ecosystem. This could be a significant development for developers and users alike, promising enhanced efficiency and connectivity across different blockchain environments. Spark (SPK): Spark is a token associated with the Flare network, a layer-1 blockchain designed to bring smart contract capabilities to various blockchains that typically lack them, such as XRP Ledger. SPK tokens are often used for governance, transaction fees, or as collateral within its ecosystem. Its listing could enhance liquidity and visibility for the Flare network, expanding its reach and utility. Navigating the Upbit New Listings: Smart Strategies for Success The arrival of new tokens on a prominent exchange like Upbit always generates excitement and draws significant attention. However, it also calls for careful consideration and a strategic approach. Traders often look for early opportunities, but it is crucial to balance potential rewards with inherent risks. Understanding the market dynamics surrounding these Upbit new listings is paramount for making informed decisions. Consider these essential points before diving into trading these new assets: Thorough Research is Key: Before making any investment, thoroughly investigate each project. Understand its whitepaper, the team behind it, its underlying technology, specific use case, and current market capitalization. Do not rely solely on market hype or speculation. Prepare for Market Volatility: New listings, especially on major exchanges, can experience significant price volatility shortly after launch. Be prepared for rapid price swings and consider implementing risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Embrace Diversification: Avoid putting all your capital into a single new asset. Diversifying your portfolio across different assets, including established cryptocurrencies and other promising projects, can help mitigate overall risk. Practice Prudent Risk Management: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently risky, and new tokens can be particularly speculative due to their nascent nature and limited historical data. What’s Next for Upbit New Listings and the Broader Market? Upbit’s decision to add these four distinct projects underscores a broader trend in the crypto market: continuous innovation and the expansion of specialized blockchain solutions. From liquid staking to modular rollups and smart contract layers, these tokens represent diverse areas of growth within the digital asset space.

Analysts are looking for other options with more growth potential because of worries about network failures and centralization threats, even if Solana (SOL)’s speed, scalability, and lively ecosystem have gotten a lot of attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a token that was designed to provide investors huge profits. It has both new DeFi utilities and a presale-driven momentum that makes it a better investment alternative for those who want to make a lot of money before the end of 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending, borrowing, and collateral safeguards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a lending and borrowing system that uses P2C mechanics and strict risk control. For example, a user who puts up $10,000 ADA as collateral may get $6,000 USDT at a 60% loan-to-value ratio. This keeps their ADA exposure while giving them access to cash for other options. Depositors who put in $20,000 USDT get mtUSDT tokens at a 1:1 ratio and earn an average of 15% APY, which means they get $3,000 a year in passive income. This two-sided structure makes sure that capital is used efficiently and encourages people to stay involved for a long time. Keeping the platform stable depends on collateral and liquidation protections. Assets that are unstable, like ADA, have limited LTVs at 60%. If the value of the collateral goes below a certain level, liquidators step in at a discount to stop losses from spreading. There are stiffer limitations for tokens that aren’t traded often, and reserve factors that range from 10% to 42% match risk with asset volatility. Market liquidity is very important for smooth liquidations since it makes sure that the system stays solvent without losing money. Layer-2 integration speeds things up and lowers transaction costs by a lot. All of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s business is based on security. The CertiK audit shows that the platform is safe, with a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. A $50,000 bug reward program fosters ethical testing and makes investors more confident. These steps, together with the Layer-2 foundation, make the platform more reliable and provide a space where lending, borrowing, and using stablecoins may grow. Presale momentum and investment potential The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale exhibits great early traction. Phase 6 has now collected roughly $16 million, with 42% of the 170 million token allotment sold and more than 16,400 holders actively engaging. The current price is at $0.035, while Phase 7 is predicted to grow to $0.040, marking a 15% hike. With over 12,000 Twitter followers and strong community participation, MUTM is ready for huge demand once exchange listings are verified. Investment examples illustrate the scope of possible returns. An investor who traded $10,000 in AVAX during Phase 1 would have 1 million MUTM tokens, presently worth $35,000 at the current presale price. At the estimated $0.06 listing price, the portfolio climbs to $60,000. With MUTM perhaps reaching $1.60 by 2026, the same holding goes up to $1.6 million, which is a 160x return. Compared to SOL’s expected 5–10x potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers a degree of growth unreachable by other large-cap cryptocurrencies. The coming beta launch will enable investors to experience MUTM’s lending and borrowing mechanisms firsthand, significantly raising demand. Layer-2 integration, the stablecoin project, and roadmap milestones will enhance usability, while listings on key exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken will extend visibility and market access. Together with the platform’s purchase-and-distribute mechanism, which allocates a percentage of income to repurchasing MUTM tokens for mtToken stakers, these aspects provide persistent buy pressure and long-term value for early players. Solana (SOL)’s present velocity and technical attractiveness cannot be disregarded, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built to produce remarkable returns via structured lending, liquidation protections, Layer-2 efficiency, and presale momentum. For investors seeking exposure beyond the conventional crypto investment spectrum, MUTM offers a rare combination of utility, security, and high-growth potential, positioning it as the altcoin most likely to deliver 160x returns before the end of 2026 while maintaining a robust framework for ongoing user adoption, liquidity, and market trust.

Investors felt official listing would cement DOGE’s place in the market, and open the way towards greater adoption. Unfortunately, even with the hype surrounding the launch, Dogecoin Price trends have indicated that sentiment will be perhaps not enough to fuel sustained momentum. Traders now wonder whether DOGE can transition from a community-driven asset to one with more utility, especially as newly minted tokens like Remittix with genuine use cases begin to gain more attention. Dogecoin Price and Investor Shifts Dogecoin Price saw an unexpected drop after the latest ETF launch, even as early hopes among traders remained high. At the time of writing, DOGE trades at $0.2807, up by 4.77% in the past day, with a market cap of $42.38 billion and a trading volume of $5.48 billion, showing a strong 33.93% surge. While this growth highlights short-term interest, investors are increasingly diversifying into alternative projects. Among the most talked-about is Remittix (RTX), which goes for $0.1080 per token and is being seen more and more as a serious contender in the international payments market. Dogecoin Price has long been subject to social mood, memes, and sporadic retail waves. Although DOGE has ETF exposure now and wider adoption, there are some traders hesitant about whether it can continue to have long-term sustainability in an increasingly unstable market. Why Remittix is Called ‘The Next XRP’ Remittix has already managed to raise $26 million+ in presale and sell more than 665.7 million tokens, proof of the strong demand for this Remittix DeFi project. Its standout feature is an instant bank-to-crypto transfer system active in 30+ countries, making RTX one of the leading crypto presales 2025. The major forces behind its momentum are: CertiK Verified: #1 ranked pre-launch token, giving investors confidence. Exchange Listings Coming Soon: Official BitMart and LBANK integration confirmed plans. Remittix Wallet Beta: Testnet made available to the public for direct cross-border payments. Giveaway $250,000: Rewarding early participation and expanding community involvement. This combination of innovation and adoption is why some traders compare RTX to XRP, but with several advantages like a deflationary tokenomics model and focus on low-gas-fee crypto solutions. The Road Ahead for RTX The impending CEX listings mark a very important milestone, taking RTX to greater liquidity on major centralized exchanges. Besides that, the referral program for the project, giving 15% in USDT per referral during presale, has made growth in the community more encouraged. Unlike meme coins, Remittix is standing among crypto that is tackling real world problems, so it has the appeal of next big altcoin 2025. With its presale already outpacing most low cap crypto gems, RTX could be a benchmark for best DeFi projects 2025. For Dogecoin Price watchers, RTX’s surge shows the kind of capital flowing out of speculative coins and towards potential crypto initiatives that merge financial tech with usability. That makes Remittix not just a presale to watch but one of the top under $1 cryptos that could establish the next wave.

After a brief period of outflows, these innovative investment vehicles have made a remarkable comeback, signaling renewed investor confidence in Ethereum and its foundational technology. This latest surge offers a fascinating glimpse into the evolving dynamics of institutional and retail interest in the crypto market. A Powerful Return: What’s Fueling Spot ETH ETFs’ Resurgence? The U.S. market for Spot ETH ETFs just delivered a compelling message: investor appetite for Ethereum-backed products is undeniably strong. On September 18, these exchange-traded funds collectively recorded an impressive $213.07 million in net inflows. This positive shift, according to precise data compiled by TraderT, marks a significant return to growth after two consecutive days of outflows. It’s a clear signal that the market is recalibrating, and confidence is building. This surge indicates a renewed interest from a diverse range of investors, spanning both institutional players and individual retail participants. It suggests a potential turning point in market sentiment, moving past recent hesitations and embracing Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Leading this impressive charge was Fidelity’s FETH, which alone attracted a substantial $159.38 million. Grayscale’s Mini ETH also saw strong performance, adding $22.9 million in net inflows. Crucially, no individual Spot ETH ETFs experienced net outflows on this particular day, painting a picture of broad-based positive sentiment across the board. This collective buying power highlights a growing comfort level with Ethereum as a mainstream, regulated investment. Why Are Investors Gravitating Towards Spot ETH ETFs Now? The return to significant inflows for Spot ETH ETFs isn’t merely a random event; it reflects deeper, more strategic market dynamics. Investors are increasingly seeking regulated and accessible ways to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum without the inherent complexities and risks often associated with direct ownership. Simplicity and Accessibility: ETFs offer a familiar, traditional investment structure, making it considerably easier for conventional investors to participate in the dynamic crypto market. They remove the need for managing private keys or understanding complex blockchain mechanics. Regulatory Clarity and Security: Operating within a clearly defined regulatory framework provides a crucial layer of security, transparency, and trust that many investors, particularly institutions, highly value. This reduces counterparty risk and offers greater peace of mind. Portfolio Diversification: For many, strategically adding Spot ETH ETFs to their portfolio offers a sophisticated way to diversify beyond traditional assets. It allows them to potentially capitalize on the growth and innovation within the digital economy, leveraging Ethereum’s robust ecosystem. While the benefits are clear and attractive, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent potential challenges. The cryptocurrency market, including Ethereum, remains inherently volatile, subject to rapid price swings. Regulatory landscapes can shift unexpectedly, and broader market sentiment can change quickly. However, the recent inflows strongly suggest that for a growing number of investors, the perceived potential rewards currently outweigh these acknowledged risks. What Does This Mean for the Future of Spot ETH ETFs and Ethereum? The strong performance and renewed investor confidence in Spot ETH ETFs have broader, far-reaching implications for both Ethereum and the wider digital asset ecosystem. This influx of capital can contribute significantly to increased market liquidity for Ethereum and could potentially influence its price trajectory in a positive direction. Enhanced Market Validation: Consistent and substantial inflows into Spot ETH ETFs serve as a powerful validation of Ethereum’s long-term potential. It underscores its critical role in the burgeoning fields of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the broader Web3 movement. Accelerated Institutional Adoption: The active participation and leadership of major financial players like Fidelity and Grayscale in these ETFs unequivocally underscore the growing institutional acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. Catalyst for Future Growth: Continued positive flows could act as a powerful catalyst, paving the way for the development of even more innovative crypto-backed financial products. This, in turn, could lead to further mainstream integration and widespread adoption of digital assets globally. Investors watching this evolving space should diligently monitor not only inflow data but also broader macroeconomic indicators, global regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the Ethereum ecosystem. Understanding these interconnected factors can provide crucial, actionable insights into the future direction of Spot ETH ETFs and the underlying asset itself, enabling more informed investment decisions. Conclusion: A Bright Horizon for Ethereum Investments The recent $213.1 million net inflow into U.S. Spot ETH ETFs is a compelling indicator of robust and growing investor confidence in Ethereum. This significant positive trend, led by substantial contributions from Fidelity and Grayscale, powerfully highlights the increasing appeal of regulated crypto investment vehicles. As the digital asset landscape continues its rapid evolution, Spot ETH ETFs are proving to be a crucial and effective bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain. They offer a more accessible, transparent, and trusted pathway for investors to engage with Ethereum’s immense potential. This resurgence suggests a potentially bright and prosperous horizon for Ethereum investments and, by extension, the broader cryptocurrency market.

A substantial Pendle Binance deposit has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, sparking discussions about its potential implications for the PENDLE token and the broader DeFi ecosystem. This isn’t just a routine transfer; it’s a multi-million dollar transaction that warrants a closer look. What Exactly Happened with the Pendle Binance Deposit? Just recently, a multi-signature address associated with the Pendle (PENDLE) project executed a notable transaction. Approximately 1.2 million PENDLE tokens, with an estimated value of $6.44 million, were deposited to the Binance exchange. This significant Pendle Binance deposit was reported by the on-chain data analytics firm Aftermath, confirming the details of the transfer. For those unfamiliar, a multi-signature address requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. This setup is often used by projects for enhanced security and collective decision-making, ensuring that no single individual can unilaterally control large sums of assets. The transfer of such a considerable amount to a major exchange like Binance naturally raises questions about the project’s intentions and strategy. Why Does a Large PENDLE Deposit to Binance Matter? When a project makes a substantial deposit to an exchange, it can signal several potential strategic moves, each with different market implications. A significant Pendle Binance deposit could be interpreted in various ways: Increasing Liquidity: Projects sometimes deposit tokens to exchanges to enhance trading liquidity, making it easier for users to buy and sell PENDLE. This can be beneficial for market health and price stability. Treasury Management: The funds might be moved for operational expenses, development costs, or rebalancing the project’s treasury. Converting tokens to stablecoins or other assets often requires using an exchange. Market-Making Activities: The Pendle team might be engaging in market-making to ensure orderly trading and tighter spreads for PENDLE on Binance. Potential Selling Pressure: While not confirmed, large deposits can sometimes precede selling activities, which could temporarily increase supply and potentially put downward pressure on the token’s price. However, this is speculative without further information. Understanding the context behind this particular Pendle Binance deposit is crucial for investors. It highlights the importance of monitoring on-chain movements as they often provide early insights into a project’s financial activities and strategic direction. Navigating the PENDLE Market After This Crucial Transfer Given the recent Pendle Binance deposit , what should PENDLE holders and interested investors consider? It’s essential to approach such events with a balanced perspective and avoid impulsive decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Official Announcements: The most reliable information will come directly from the Pendle project. Keep an eye on their official communication channels (e.g., Twitter, Discord, blog) for any statements regarding this transfer. Observe Price Action: While not always a direct correlation, observing PENDLE’s price movements on Binance and other exchanges in the coming days can offer clues about market reaction. Analyze Trading Volume: A spike in trading volume accompanying price changes could indicate increased market activity, whether buying or selling. Broader Market Context: Remember that individual token movements are also influenced by the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. A large Pendle Binance deposit might have less impact if the broader market is experiencing strong trends. Staying informed and conducting your own research remains paramount. Large transfers are a regular occurrence in crypto, but their significance lies in the context and the project’s long-term vision. What Does the Future Hold for PENDLE After This Deposit? The recent Pendle Binance deposit is a reminder of the dynamic nature of decentralized finance. Pendle, known for its innovative approach to yield tokenization, continues to evolve. Such treasury movements are often part of a larger strategy aimed at strengthening the project’s foundation, supporting its ecosystem, or adapting to market conditions. While the immediate implications of this specific transfer are subject to interpretation, the underlying utility and growth potential of the Pendle protocol remain key factors for its long-term outlook. It’s an exciting time to observe how these strategic financial decisions play out in the vibrant world of DeFi. In conclusion, the substantial Pendle Binance deposit of $6.44 million in PENDLE tokens to Binance by a project multi-signature address is a noteworthy event. While the precise reasons are yet to be officially disclosed, such transfers are typically part of a project’s strategic financial management, whether for liquidity provision, treasury operations, or other market-related activities. For investors, the key is to remain calm, seek official communications, and analyze market reactions within the broader crypto landscape. This move underscores the transparency of on-chain data and the constant evolution of projects like Pendle within the DeFi space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding the recent Pendle Binance deposit and its implications: What is Pendle (PENDLE)? Pendle is a DeFi protocol that allows users to tokenize and trade future yield. It splits yield-bearing assets into two components: Principal Token (PT) and Yield Token (YT), giving users flexibility in managing and speculating on future yield. Why did the Pendle project deposit PENDLE to Binance? While the exact reason for the Pendle Binance deposit has not been officially stated, common reasons for such large transfers include increasing liquidity for trading, treasury management, funding operational costs, or engaging in market-making activities to support the token. Does a large deposit to an exchange always mean the project is selling tokens? Not necessarily. While it can precede selling, it’s also a common practice for projects to move tokens to exchanges for various strategic reasons like providing liquidity, rebalancing portfolios, or facilitating partnerships. It’s important to await official communication from the project. How can I stay updated on Pendle’s activities? To get the most accurate and timely information, it’s best to follow Pendle’s official channels, such as their official website, Twitter account, Discord server, and blog. Monitoring reputable crypto news outlets and on-chain analytics firms can also provide insights. Did you find this analysis of the Pendle Binance deposit insightful?

The post, which was shared on the TradingView website, showed a possible path that the Bitcoin price could follow this period, showing both bounce-off and resistance points. Now, with Bitcoin already clearing $117,000, it seems that the next phase of the analysis could be playing out from here, and the crypto analyst is quite bullish. What Happens After The Bitcoin Price Touched $117,000? In the analysis, Thomas pointed out that the Bitcoin price had successfully cleared out local highs and was able to take out the liquidity above the previous range . However, there were inefficiencies that had been left behind after the previous move that were inadvertently filled by a temporary fakeout. After the market correction that saw the Bitcoin price move toward $112,000, there is now a clearer structure forming. Right now, the Bitcoin price is moving toward the demand zones on the higher timeframes, and this could push the price higher. The analysis points out that the correction from the liquidity sweep pushed the Bitcoin price to test key imbalances, with a bullish shift happening since then. Also, there is an inverted daily gap that has already been tested several times at around $114,000, and with this level holding, it shows that there is a lot of support here. Another thing that the liquidity sweep has shown is that the buy-side pressure has now been cleared. This has led to a reset of the market, and from here, any moves in any direction will be more purposeful. But the price rising higher from here looks to be the most likely path. How High Can BTC Go? If the structure outlined by the crypto analyst holds, then the Bitcoin price could see another small correction from its current local peaks. Once this is done, the next step is the creation of the balance that would help to drive the digital asset’s price higher. The analyst explains that if the Bitcoin price holds up the inverted daily gap, then the next target would put it above the $120,000 level, where the next resistance zone lies. However, a loss of this inverted gap and subsequent trendline support would be very bearish for the price . This would trigger another correction back toward the $111,000-$112,000 territory. “Bitcoin has absorbed liquidity, filled inefficiencies, and inverted a daily gap that is now holding as support,” Thomas explained. “Combined with the ongoing daily uptrend, this strengthens the bullish outlook with a clear target toward the 120,000 USDT resistance zone.”",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-19 07:30:13

The vote split was 7 to 2, and literally no one was surprised—all 50 economists polled by Bloomberg expected the hold. But the real development wasn’t the rate. The real story? For the first time ever, the central bank said it’s going to start dumping its exchange-traded funds. The ETF stash, built up during Japan’s wild pandemic-era monetary easing campaign, is valued at around ¥37 trillion on the books. Back in 2020, the BoJ became the largest single owner of Japanese stocks, but that buying spree ended last year. Meanwhile, Japan’s core inflation dropped to 2.7% in August, the lowest reading since November 2024. This was the third straight monthly decline, so its not the kind of trend that gets the BoJ in a hurry to hike anything. Ishiba exit stalls BoJ as inflation dips and yen stays firm Friday’s decision came just days after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation, throwing the ruling party into a sudden race to replace him. The political shakeup added yet another layer of uncertainty to an already murky economic outlook. It’s been less than a year since the last leadership vote, and once again, Japan is without a clear political direction. That was one reason the BoJ didn’t move on rates; it’s waiting to see who takes over and where they’ll steer policy. There’s also the U.S. tariffs that the BoJ is watching. Even though Japan recently wrapped up a trade deal with the United States, central bank officials are still trying to figure out how the tariffs will play out, both domestically and abroad. That’s another reason they’re staying on the sidelines. Markets didn’t love the decision. After surging to a new record earlier in the day, the Nikkei 225 lost 0.59% by close, while the yen gained 0.36%, sitting at 147.45 per dollar as of press time. Hiroaki Amemiya, investment director at Capital Group, told Bloomberg: “The Bank of Japan’s decision to hold rates steady underscores its cautious stance amid slowing inflation and global uncertainty – prioritizing stability over premature tightening.” He added : “By preserving policy optionality, the BoJ is signaling its readiness to respond to external volatility while continuing to assess the strength of Japan’s economic recovery.” He also said the current approach fits the early stage of a reflationary cycle, not a reversal. Bond yields climb, stocks mixed Not everyone stood still. Yields on Japan’s 2-year government bonds rose to 0.885%, their highest level since June 2008, according to LSEG. That spike came even with the central bank holding steady. Meanwhile, the Topix rose 0.84%, showing traders are still playing both sides of the fence. Across the region, we see Australia’s ASX/S&P 200 edged by 0.77%, South Korea’s Kospi and Kosdaq opening flat, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.4%, while China’s CSI 300 added a modest 0.13%, according to data from Yahoo Finance. In India, the Nifty 50 index dipped 0.55%, but Adani Enterprises surged over 4%. That spike followed news that India’s market regulator had absolved Gautam Adani and the Adani Group of key misconduct allegations from Hindenburg Research. That fight’s not over, but at least for now, Adani is breathing easier. Back in the United States , the Federal Reserve’s signal that it’s leaning toward easing rates helped push markets higher. On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 0.48%, closing at 6,631.96. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.94% to 22,470.73, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 124 points (or 0.27%) to finish at 46,142.42. All three indexes hit new all-time intraday highs on Thursday. That came after a chaotic Wednesday session, triggered by the Fed’s rate cut. Investors clearly liked what they heard, and smaller stocks especially got a boost. In the middle of all this, Japan is still playing defense.

Altcoins have had a solid week with record highs for Hyperliquid (HYPE), which hit a peak of $59.30 on Thursday, and Binance Coin (BNB), which topped $1,000 on the same day. There are only two high-cap tokens that are close to record highs: Ethereum, which is 8% away, and the iFinex Leo Token (LEO), which is just 6% away from a new peak. XRP and Solana (SOL) are next in the list at 16% down from their peaks, while Tron (TRX) is 19% away from a new high. The rest of the top thirty altcoins are still languishing between 55% and 85% down from their all-time highs, so it appears that Ethereum is likely to hit a new peak first, given its recent momentum. Analyst ‘Colin Talks Crypto’ observed that the “Total3,” which represents altcoins and stablecoins, is breaking out, and the altcoins without including stablecoins are on the cusp of a breakout. Meanwhile, ‘0xNobler’ said that every altseason has started in September, “and this one won’t be any different.” Other analysts noted different cyclical chart patterns that appeared to be repeating, suggesting that altseason is imminent.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points and signaled an additional 50 basis points of easing expected by year-end. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled a new generic listing standard for crypto ETFs, which is set to accelerate the approval process. Meanwhile, Deribit's DVOL index, which measures the 30-day implied volatility, remains subdued at around 24%, the lowest in two years. Historically, bullish sentiment is strong in such situations, causing call options – bets on price increases in BTC – to become more expensive than put options, which provide insurance against price declines. However, on Deribit, put options continue to trade at a premium across all time frames. “Skew across all time frames remains flat to negative,” Strijers explained. “We continue to see demand for puts to hedge downside exposure, while call overwriting flows are pressuring the topside.” Deribit is the world's largest crypto options exchange, accounting for over 80% of the global activity. Options skew measures the implied volatility difference between call and put options for a given expiration. A negative skew indicates bearish sentiment, with investors expecting a price drop; a positive skew reflects bullish expectations. Currently, the seven, 30, 60, and 90 day skews are slightly negative, with the 180 day skew neutral, according to data source Amberdata. This indicates persistent concerns about a possible BTC correction. Investors buying puts may be concerned that the Fed’s easing was already factored into the market ahead of the decision and that a deteriorating economic outlook could reduce demand for riskier assets, such as bitcoin. ""After the Fed’s decision, some of the earlier optimism has faded. The market now seems to be waiting for the next catalyst — whether macro or crypto-specific — to break the stalemate and push option positioning out of its current balance between caution and optimism,"" Strijers said. Sidrah Fariq, global head of retail sales and business development at Deribit, said the persistent put bias represents market maturity. ""In some sense, BTC options are behaving more like S&P index options - a sign of maturity, but also of market caution,"" Fariq said. Additionally, traders writing covered calls – selling call options against their spot holdings to collect premium – which may be contributing to the put bias, particularly in longer-dated options. This strategy generates additional income but can cap upside potential. Covered call has emerged as a popular strategy among BTC, ETH and XRP traders in recent years.",Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Deribit|Markets|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-19 07:34:02

This isn’t just a number; it’s an event that often brings heightened volatility and significant attention from traders and investors alike. Understanding what this Bitcoin options expiration means for the market is crucial, as it can influence short-term price movements and sentiment. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Options Expiration? When we talk about Bitcoin options expiration , we’re referring to a specific date and time when options contracts become void. An options contract gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset – in this case, Bitcoin – at a predetermined price (strike price) on or before a certain date. Today, a substantial volume of these contracts reaches their expiry on platforms like Deribit, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. Call Options: Give the right to buy Bitcoin. Holders profit if Bitcoin’s price rises above the strike price. Put Options: Give the right to sell Bitcoin. Holders profit if Bitcoin’s price falls below the strike price. The expiration of these contracts can lead to increased trading activity as participants either exercise their options, let them expire worthless, or roll them over into new contracts. This flurry of activity often contributes to price fluctuations. Understanding Max Pain Price and Put/Call Ratios for Bitcoin Options Two key metrics help us gauge the potential impact of an options expiration: the max pain price and the put/call ratio. For today’s Bitcoin options expiration , the max pain price is noted at $114,000, with a put/call ratio of 1.23. What is Max Pain Price? The max pain price is a theoretical level at which the greatest number of options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option holders and maximum profit for option writers (sellers). While it’s a theoretical concept, the market sometimes gravitates towards this price point as expiration approaches. For today’s Bitcoin options , a max pain of $114,000 suggests a significant number of contracts would be out-of-the-money if Bitcoin were to trade at that level. What Does the Put/Call Ratio Tell Us? The put/call ratio is a sentiment indicator. It compares the volume of put options to call options. A ratio above 1, like the current 1.23 for Bitcoin, indicates that more put options are open than call options. This often suggests a bearish sentiment, as more traders are betting on a price decline or hedging against one. Conversely, a ratio below 1 suggests a more bullish outlook. Ethereum Options Also Face Expiration Today: What’s the Impact? It’s not just Bitcoin in the spotlight. Ethereum options with a notional value of $816 million are also set to expire today. These contracts carry a put/call ratio of 0.99 and a max pain price of $4,500. A put/call ratio near 1, like Ethereum’s 0.99, suggests a relatively balanced sentiment between bullish and bearish bets, indicating less extreme directional bias compared to Bitcoin’s options. The simultaneous expiration of both Bitcoin and Ethereum options could amplify market movements, making today a particularly dynamic period for crypto traders. These events highlight the growing maturity and complexity of the crypto derivatives market, offering sophisticated tools for hedging and speculation. What Can We Expect After This Massive Expiration? The immediate aftermath of a large Bitcoin options expiration can be varied. Sometimes, the market sees increased volatility as positions are closed or adjusted. Other times, the impact is minimal if the market has already priced in the event. Traders often watch for potential “gamma squeezes” or shifts in market maker hedging strategies that can influence price action. For investors, understanding these events provides insight into market sentiment and potential areas of support or resistance. It’s a reminder that while the spot market is about direct buying and selling, the derivatives market adds layers of complexity and influence. Key Takeaways: A substantial $3.53 billion in Bitcoin options and $816 million in Ethereum options expire today. The Bitcoin options have a max pain price of $114,000 and a put/call ratio of 1.23 (bearish leaning). Ethereum options show a max pain price of $4,500 and a more balanced put/call ratio of 0.99. Expect potential short-term volatility as positions are settled or rolled over. Today’s significant options expiration events serve as a powerful reminder of the intricate mechanisms at play in the cryptocurrency market. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a curious observer, keeping an eye on these developments can offer valuable insights into the market’s pulse and future directions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “notional value” mean in the context of options? A1: Notional value refers to the total value of the underlying asset that an options contract controls. For example, if one Bitcoin option contract represents one Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is trading at $X, then the notional value of that contract is $X. Q2: How does a high put/call ratio impact Bitcoin’s price? A2: A high put/call ratio (above 1) indicates more traders are buying put options than call options. This generally suggests a bearish sentiment, as traders are either expecting a price drop or hedging against one, which can contribute to downward pressure or increased caution in the market. Q3: Is the max pain price a guaranteed price target for Bitcoin? A3: No, the max pain price is not a guaranteed target. It’s a theoretical calculation representing the strike price where the most options contracts would expire worthless, causing the maximum loss for option holders. While the market can sometimes gravitate towards it, it’s just one of many indicators. Q4: Should I be concerned about Bitcoin options expiration as a long-term investor? A4: For long-term investors, options expirations typically have less direct impact on their core strategy. However, they can cause short-term volatility, which might present buying opportunities or brief dips. It’s good to be aware of these events, but they usually don’t alter the fundamental long-term outlook for Bitcoin. Q5: Where can I find data on crypto options expirations? A5: Data on crypto options expirations is typically available from major crypto derivatives exchanges like Deribit, CME, and Bakkt, as well as from crypto analytics platforms that aggregate this information.

Bitcoin, the leading crypto by market cap, has dropped below $117k after losing 1% of its value in the last 24 hours. Ether and XRP are also in the red, with the market giving away some of its recent gains. The retracement from the broader crypto market is also affecting ZRO, the native coin of the LayerZero ecosystem. ZRO hits $2 on LayerZero’s partnership with PayPal ZRO rallied by more than 2% on Thursday to hit the $2.0 mark for the first time this week. The rally comes after the LayerZero team announced its partnership with the payments giant PayPal. The partnership sees PayPal working with LayerZero to extend its PYUSD stablecoin from its native deployments on Arbitrum, Ethereum, Solana, and Stellar to other blockchains, including Abstract, Aptos, Avalanche, Ink, Sei, Stable, and Tron.

Prior to the news, ZRO was trading around $1.85 per coin, but it immediately rallied to hit the $2.08 mark a few hours ago. However, the market is showing signs of exhaustion, and ZRO could undergo further correction, similar to the broader cryptocurrency market. ZRO could dip below $2.0 as market shows signs of exhaustion The ZRO/USDT 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient, thanks to ZRO’s positive performance since the start of the week. The momentum indicators are still bullish but beginning to show signs of exhaustion heading into the weekend. The RSI has dropped to 55 from the high of 69 on Thursday. The declining RSI and the possible convergence of the MACD lines below the neutral zone could signal a possible correction in the near term. At press time, ZRO is trading at $2.016 per coin. If the correction continues, ZRO could drop to the nearest support and TLQ level at $1.883. The bulls will likely defend this support level extremely, as failure to do so could see ZRO drop to the monthly low of $1.767. ZRO could resume its upward movement in the near term if the market recovers. If the bullish trend continues, ZRO could hit the $2.28 high for the first time since August 29. An extended bullish run would allow ZRO to test the $2.60 level once again. However, it would need the support of the broader crypto market to do so.

This development could reshape how users interact with the popular Web3 wallet and the broader decentralized ecosystem. It signals a significant step forward for one of the most widely used tools in the blockchain space. What’s Fueling the MetaMask Token Buzz? Joseph Lubin, the CEO of ConsenSys, the company behind MetaMask, recently shared insights that ignited this excitement. According to reports from The Block, Lubin indicated that a MetaMask token could launch ahead of previous expectations. This isn’t the first time the idea has surfaced; Dan Finlay, one of MetaMask’s founders, had previously mentioned the possibility of issuing such a token. ConsenSys has been a pivotal player in the Ethereum ecosystem, developing essential infrastructure and applications. MetaMask, their flagship wallet, serves millions of users, providing a gateway to decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and various blockchain networks. Therefore, any move to introduce a native token is a major event for the entire Web3 community. Why is a MetaMask Token So Anticipated? The prospect of a MetaMask token generates immense interest because it could introduce new layers of utility and community governance. Users often speculate about the benefits such a token could offer. Here are some key reasons for the high anticipation: Governance Rights: A token could empower users to participate in the future direction and development of MetaMask. This means voting on new features, upgrades, or even changes to the platform’s policies. Ecosystem Rewards: Tokens might be distributed as rewards for active participation, using certain features, or contributing to the MetaMask community. This incentivizes engagement and loyalty. Enhanced Utility: The token could unlock premium features, reduce transaction fees, or provide exclusive access to services within the MetaMask ecosystem or partnered dApps. Decentralization: Introducing a token often aligns with the broader Web3 ethos of decentralization, distributing control and ownership among its users rather than centralizing it within ConsenSys. Consequently, a token launch is seen as a way to deepen user involvement and foster a more robust, community-driven ecosystem around the wallet. Exploring the Potential Impact of a MetaMask Token The introduction of a MetaMask token could have far-reaching implications for the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Firstly, it could set a new standard for how popular infrastructure tools engage with their user base. By providing a tangible stake, MetaMask might strengthen its position as a community-governed platform. Moreover, a token could significantly boost the wallet’s visibility and adoption, attracting new users eager to participate in its governance or benefit from its utility. This could also lead to innovative integrations with other blockchain projects, creating a more interconnected and efficient Web3 experience. Ultimately, the success of such a token will depend on its design, utility, and how effectively it engages the global MetaMask community. What Challenges Could a MetaMask Token Face? While the excitement is palpable, launching a MetaMask token also presents several challenges that ConsenSys must navigate carefully. One primary concern is regulatory scrutiny. The classification of cryptocurrency tokens varies across jurisdictions, and ensuring compliance is crucial for long-term success. Furthermore, designing a fair and equitable distribution model is paramount. Ensuring that the token provides genuine utility beyond mere speculation will be another hurdle. A token must integrate seamlessly into the MetaMask experience and offer clear value to its holders. Additionally, managing community expectations and preventing market manipulation will require robust strategies. Addressing these challenges effectively will be key to the token’s sustainable growth and positive reception. What’s Next for the MetaMask Ecosystem? The prospect of a MetaMask token signals an evolving strategy for ConsenSys and the future of Web3 wallets. It reflects a growing trend where foundational tools seek to empower their communities through tokenization. Users are keenly watching for official announcements regarding the token’s mechanics, distribution, and launch timeline. This development could solidify MetaMask’s role not just as a wallet, but as a central pillar of decentralized identity and interaction. The potential for a sooner-than-expected launch adds an element of urgency and excitement, encouraging users to stay informed about every new detail. It represents a significant milestone for a platform that has become synonymous with accessing the decentralized web. Conclusion The hints from ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin regarding an earlier launch for the MetaMask token have undoubtedly captured the attention of the entire crypto world. This potential development promises to bring enhanced governance, utility, and community engagement to millions of MetaMask users. While challenges exist, the underlying potential for a more decentralized and user-driven ecosystem is immense. The coming months will likely reveal more about this highly anticipated token, marking a new chapter for one of Web3’s most vital tools. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a MetaMask token? A MetaMask token would be a native cryptocurrency issued by ConsenSys, the company behind the MetaMask wallet. It is expected to offer various utilities, including governance rights, rewards, and access to special features within the MetaMask ecosystem. Q2: Why is ConsenSys considering launching a MetaMask token? ConsenSys is likely exploring a token launch to further decentralize the MetaMask platform, empower its user community with governance rights, incentivize active participation, and potentially unlock new forms of utility and growth for the ecosystem. Q3: What benefits could users gain from a MetaMask token? Users could gain several benefits, such as the ability to vote on MetaMask’s future developments, earn rewards for using the wallet, access exclusive features, or potentially reduce transaction fees. It also provides a direct stake in the platform’s success. Q4: When is the MetaMask token expected to launch? While no official launch date has been confirmed, ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin has indicated that the launch could happen sooner than previously expected. The exact timeline remains subject to official announcements from ConsenSys. Q5: How would a MetaMask token impact the broader Web3 ecosystem?

Large Wallets Add DOGE Ahead of Price Rise More than 158 million Dogecoin (DOGE) have been added to wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million coins, according to on-chain data shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez.

Trading volume over the last day crossed $3.95 billion. $0.29 Resistance Level Still in Play DOGE has tested the $0.29 price level several times since March without a confirmed breakout. Charts posted by Martinez show four separate price peaks around this point that were followed by a pullback. The asset is again approaching this area. He said , “Breaking $0.29 will send Dogecoin $DOGE flying to $0.36 and even $0.45.” This view is based on the following areas where price previously stalled. These levels are being watched by traders looking for follow-through if $0.29 is breached. Source: Ali Martinez/X DOGE is currently trading just below this level. A breakout would mark the first close above $0.29 in months. Until then, it remains a major resistance zone. Buyers Defend Support Near $0.263 Trader Tardigrade posted a chart showing how DOGE has been reacting to the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, which sits close to $0.263. In their analysis, three daily candles showed sharp dips to this level, followed by quick recoveries. They noted : “Nice wicks down to Fib 0.382,” referring to price rejection at that level. All three attempts to push below $0.263 were met with buyers stepping in before the candle closed. The zone has so far held as support.

The previous local peak near $0.31–$0.32 remains the next area to watch if the uptrend continues. DOGE ETF Launch Draws Volume On Thursday, the REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (ticker: DOJE) launched in the US, bringing DOGE to public markets in a new format. The product drew $17 million in trading volume on its first day, putting it among the five biggest ETF launches of the year. This came alongside the debut of another crypto ETF tied to XRP. Both listings suggest growing demand for spot crypto funds beyond just Bitcoin or Ethereum. While DOGE is often known as a meme-based coin, this ETF shows there’s growing interest in tracking it through traditional financial products.

Market watchers now wonder if a bigger jump could be next. Momentum has shifted, and excitement is building around the next price level. The question on everyone’s mind: is a run toward $300 now within reach for SOL? Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView Solana trades between 213.85 and 257.95 after a hot run. The coin is up 9.26% in 7 days, 33.79% in 30 days, and 90.64% in 6 months. Momentum stays firm and keeps drawing fresh bids.

Buyers now watch 275.87, about 11% above the top of the current band. Clearing that level could spark a run to 319.97, another 25% higher. If energy fades, price may retreat to 187.67, roughly 14% under the lower edge, with 143.57 as the deeper backstop. Charts favor more gains as long as SOL stays above 187.67. A push through 257.95 could lift the coin 20-30% in coming weeks, echoing its recent monthly pace. Failure to beat 275.87 may cool the advance and shave 8-12%.

This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a stark reminder that the booming world of digital assets faces a critical juncture, especially for those relying on the stability of stablecoins. JPMorgan’s recent research note suggests that unless the broader cryptocurrency market expands dramatically, stablecoin issuers are heading towards a fierce ‘zero-sum game’ scenario. The Alarming Truth About the Stablecoin Market What exactly does a ‘zero-sum game’ mean for the stablecoin market ? Essentially, it implies that for one stablecoin to gain market share, another must lose it. This isn’t about overall growth where everyone benefits; it’s about a fixed pie where new entrants only succeed by taking a slice from existing players. JPMorgan analysts point to a rapidly increasing number of new stablecoin projects vying for attention. Tether recently announced its unregulated stablecoin, USAT. Hyperliquid plans to launch USDH, aiming to reduce its dependence on Circle’s USDC. Even traditional fintech powerhouses like Robinhood and Revolut are developing their own stablecoins. This surge of new issuers intensifies competition significantly. While the overall stablecoin market capitalization has reached an impressive $278 billion, its share of the total crypto market has remained stagnant, averaging below 8% since 2020. This stagnation, according to JPMorgan, is a key indicator of the brewing zero-sum challenge. Why is the Stablecoin Market Becoming So Crowded? The influx of new players into the stablecoin market isn’t accidental; it’s driven by various strategic motivations. Many projects aim to gain greater control over their financial infrastructure and reduce reliance on third-party stablecoins. For instance, Hyperliquid’s move to USDH is a clear example of a platform seeking self-sufficiency and potentially lower operational costs. Furthermore, established fintech firms like Robinhood and Revolut see stablecoins as a natural extension of their existing services. They can integrate these digital assets into their platforms, offering new functionalities and potentially attracting a broader user base. However, this expansion comes with a caveat: if the overall crypto market doesn’t grow proportionally, these new offerings will merely fragment the existing demand, making profitability and widespread adoption harder to achieve for all. The core challenge remains the limited expansion of the total crypto market relative to the growing supply of stablecoins. This dynamic creates an environment where innovation must go hand-in-hand with genuine market expansion, not just internal competition. Navigating the Competitive Stablecoin Market Landscape So, what does this intense competition mean for users and the broader crypto ecosystem? For one, it could lead to increased innovation as issuers strive to differentiate their offerings through better features, lower fees, or enhanced security. However, it also presents potential risks, particularly if some stablecoins fail to gain traction or face liquidity issues in a highly competitive environment. Users should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence when choosing stablecoins. For existing giants like USDC, the entry of new competitors means they must continue to innovate and maintain their market leadership. Regulatory clarity also plays a crucial role here. As more entities enter the space, the demand for clear, consistent regulations will only grow, potentially shaping the future landscape of the stablecoin market significantly. Ultimately, the long-term health of the stablecoin ecosystem hinges on the ability of the entire cryptocurrency market to attract new capital and users. Without this broader expansion, JPMorgan’s warning of a zero-sum game could become a stark reality. In conclusion, JPMorgan’s recent warning serves as a potent reminder of the escalating competition within the stablecoin market . While innovation and new entrants are exciting, the core challenge lies in the stagnant growth of the broader crypto market. For stablecoins to truly thrive beyond a zero-sum dynamic, a significant influx of new capital and users into the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem is paramount. The future success of these digital anchors depends on collective market expansion, not just internal rivalry. Frequently Asked Questions About the Stablecoin Market Q1: What is a ‘zero-sum game’ in the context of the stablecoin market? A1: A ‘zero-sum game’ means that for one stablecoin to gain market share, another stablecoin must lose an equivalent amount. It implies that the overall market size for stablecoins is not growing, forcing issuers to compete for a fixed pool of users and capital. Q2: Why is JPMorgan concerned about the stablecoin market? A2: JPMorgan is concerned because despite the stablecoin market’s growth in total value, its share of the overall crypto market capitalization has stagnated. With many new entrants, they believe competition will intensify, leading to a zero-sum dynamic unless the broader crypto market significantly expands. Q3: Which new stablecoin issuers are mentioned in the warning? A3: The warning highlights new entrants such as Tether’s unregulated stablecoin USAT, Hyperliquid’s planned USDH, and stablecoins being developed by fintech firms Robinhood and Revolut. Q4: What could be the implications for users of stablecoins? A4: For users, increased competition could lead to more innovative features, potentially lower fees, and better services. However, it also means a greater need for due diligence to assess the stability and reliability of various stablecoins, especially if some struggle in a crowded market. Q5: How can the stablecoin market avoid a zero-sum outcome? A5: According to JPMorgan, avoiding a zero-sum outcome requires significant expansion of the broader cryptocurrency market. This means attracting new capital and users into the entire crypto ecosystem, thereby growing the ‘pie’ rather than just re-dividing existing slices.

The bill , introduced in February, aims to establish a strategic bitcoin (BTC) reserve by authorizing the state treasury to invest up to 10% of its reserves in the largest cryptocurrency and possibly others. It has now been referred to the Committee on Government Operations. If approved, Michigan would join the three states — Texas, New Hampshire and Arizona — that have enacted bitcoin reserve laws. While Texas allocated $10 million to purchase BTC in June, the other two have yet to fund the reserve with state money. Recently, the U.S. House directed the Treasury Department to study the feasibility and governance of a strategic bitcoin reserve, including key areas such as custody, cybersecurity and accounting standards. Sovereign adoption of bitcoin has emerged as one of the defining trends of 2025, with several U.S. states and countries considering or implementing BTC reserves as part of their public finance strategy. That's in addition to the growing corporate adoption of bitcoin in company treasuries . This institutional embrace has contributed to a significant boost in bitcoin’s market valuation. The BTC price has increased 25% this year, and touched a record high near $124,500 in August, CoinDesk data show.

He has officially unveiled SunPerp , a groundbreaking decentralized perpetual futures exchange (perp dex) designed to revolutionize how traders engage with digital assets. This innovative platform marks a significant expansion for the Tron ecosystem, bringing sophisticated trading tools to a broader audience. What Exactly is SunPerp and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the concept, a perpetual futures exchange allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiration date, often using leverage. SunPerp aims to democratize access to these powerful financial instruments, offering a robust and secure environment for trading. Built natively on the high-throughput Tron network, it promises fast transactions and lower fees, directly addressing common pain points in the DeFi space. This means more efficient and accessible trading for everyone. Decentralization: Trades occur directly on-chain, enhancing transparency and security without intermediaries. Leverage Trading: Opportunities for amplified gains, allowing traders to control larger positions with smaller capital (understanding inherent risks is crucial). No Expiration: Unlike traditional futures, perpetuals don’t expire, offering continuous trading flexibility. Lower Fees: Leveraging Tron’s efficient architecture for significantly more cost-effective trading. Accessibility: Open to anyone with a Tron wallet, fostering greater financial inclusivity across the globe. Justin Sun’s Vision: Expanding Tron’s DeFi Horizons with SunPerp Justin Sun has long been a prominent figure in the blockchain world, consistently pushing the boundaries of what’s possible within the Tron ecosystem. The launch of SunPerp aligns perfectly with his broader vision to establish Tron as a leading hub for decentralized applications and comprehensive financial services.

It provides users with a comprehensive suite of financial tools, ranging from stablecoins to lending protocols, and now, advanced derivatives trading. This holistic approach strengthens the network’s appeal for both seasoned traders seeking sophisticated options and new entrants looking for robust, yet user-friendly, platforms. It’s a strategic play to enhance the ecosystem’s utility and depth. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Challenges for SunPerp While the launch of SunPerp presents immense opportunities, it also comes with its share of challenges. The decentralized perpetuals market is highly competitive, with established players already vying for market share across various blockchains. For SunPerp to truly thrive, it will need to differentiate itself through superior user experience, innovative trading features, and strong community engagement. Security, as always, will be paramount in the DeFi space, requiring continuous smart contract audits and robust risk management protocols to protect user assets. Furthermore, user education will be key. While leverage trading offers exciting potential, it also carries significant risks. SunPerp will need to provide clear resources and tools to help users understand these complexities. Building and maintaining deep liquidity pools will also be crucial for ensuring seamless and efficient trading operations, attracting more professional traders to the platform. Potential Opportunities: Attracting new users and significant capital to the Tron ecosystem, fostering growth. Driving innovation in decentralized derivatives, potentially setting new industry standards. Establishing Tron as a leader in high-performance and accessible DeFi solutions. Increasing the overall utility and demand for TRX, Tron’s native token. Key Challenges: Intense competition from well-established existing perp dex platforms on other chains. Ensuring robust security and mitigating smart contract risks through ongoing vigilance. Educating users on the complexities and inherent risks of leverage trading to promote responsible participation. Building and maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate seamless and efficient trading at scale. The Road Ahead for SunPerp The unveiling of SunPerp by Justin Sun marks a pivotal moment for the Tron network and the wider DeFi landscape. By offering a decentralized perpetual futures exchange, Tron is solidifying its position as a versatile and powerful blockchain for financial innovation.

Market watchers now wonder if SHIB has the strength to reach new heights, as XYZ gains ground fast. Investors are eager for insight on these trending coins and what could shape their paths in the days ahead. Shiba Inu: The Meme Dog That Sniffed Out a Spot on Ethereum Shiba Inu burst onto the scene in 2020, barking at Dogecoin’s heels. Built on Ethereum, it plugs into a huge network of apps and wallets. Its maker, known only as Ryoshi, unleashed one quadrillion tokens. Half went to Vitalik Buterin, who later gave much away and burned the rest. That bold move grabbed headlines and trust. At the same time, it showed the coin was more than a joke. Today, SHIB powers ShibaSwap, a place to trade tokens without a middleman. Soon, holders may vote on new changes and even mint art pieces called NFTs. This wider plan gives SHIB tools that Dogecoin still lacks. The market cycle now rewards coins with clear stories and active teams. Meme coins often ride big waves, and Ethereum-based ones get extra attention because they fit with popular chains like Uniswap and OpenSea. SHIB also has a huge, vocal fan base that can drive fast moves. Prices are still far below last year’s peak, so some see room for a fresh run if the next bull phase appears. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.0055. Adding to its growing recognition, XYZVerse has been chosen as #1 in the "" best memecoin presale "" category by besticolist , further validating its potential in the competitive meme coin space. At the next stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.0056, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Conclusion Both SHIB and XYZVerse look good in the 2025 bull run; yet the sports memecoin’s presale, community rewards, and GameFi plan hint at sharper upside.

Key Takeaways: Michigan has revived a bill to allocate up to 10% of state funds into Bitcoin and crypto assets. The move aligns Michigan with states like Texas and New Hampshire pursuing Bitcoin reserve strategies. A global shift is underway, with countries like Pakistan and the Philippines also introducing strategic Bitcoin reserve plans. House Bill 4087, which would authorize the state to allocate up to 10% of its general and stabilization funds into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has been formally referred to the Government Operations Committee. Introduced in February by Republican Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson, the bill cleared procedural hurdles on Thursday and was placed on the House’s second reading calendar. Michigan Joins Growing List of States Pursuing Bitcoin Reserve Strategy The move positions Michigan alongside a growing list of states eyeing Bitcoin as a hedge and strategic reserve asset, joining early movers like Texas, New Hampshire, and Arizona. The timing may be notable. With Bitcoin trading around $117,000, critics have warned that Michigan could be buying at a market peak. If passed, Michigan’s move could accelerate regional pressure. States like Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, once exploring their own digital asset reserves, may feel compelled to revive their efforts to avoid falling behind. More than 25 U.S. states are actively reviewing similar proposals, according to BitcoinLaws.io. In early August, the US House advanced a federal bill that directs the Treasury Department to study the feasibility of a national Bitcoin reserve, focusing on custody, cybersecurity, and accounting standards. International momentum is building as well. The Philippines recently introduced a bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve with a 20-year lockup period.

It would allow 10% of state funds to be invested in Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/Akdhyj9Ggx — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) September 18, 2025 Meanwhile, El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender , is reportedly adding gold to its national reserves. Pakistan has also taken a major policy turn with its plans to establish a government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, announced in May 2025 by Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council. The reserve is intended to be held indefinitely, not for speculation, and forms part of a broader push to build crypto regulation, harness surplus energy, and attract investment in digital infrastructure. The government has pledged 2,000 megawatts of electricity toward Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, and it is setting up a dedicated regulatory authority (PVARA) to oversee digital asset activity. One in Four Bitcoin Treasury Firms Now Trade Below Their BTC Holdings A report by K33 Research reveals that 25% of public companies holding Bitcoin now trade at market values lower than their actual BTC reserves, highlighting a growing disconnect between corporate treasuries and investor confidence. Smaller firms like NAKA, Semler Scientific, and Twenty One are trading well below net asset value (NAV), raising concerns about dilution and limited capital-raising ability. K33’s Vetle Lunde warns that trading below NAV hampers funding, as issuing new shares becomes increasingly dilutive. While giants like MicroStrategy still trade at a premium, average NAV multiples have dropped from 3.76 in April to 2.8, and BTC accumulation by treasury firms is slowing, with September seeing the lowest daily inflows since May. Despite treasury demand cooling, spot ETFs and retail investors are stepping in as the new demand engines.

The token rallied to a three-month peak, following the release of a new white paper. Trust Wallet Token (TWT) rallied vertically, reaching a three-month peak at $1.19. The token rode the general altcoin hype, showing its price would react to positive comments. TWT expanded after Binance’s co-founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao mentioned the token’s new use cases. TWT launched in 2020 and went through multiple boom and bust phases, based on the general market volatility. Trust Wallet also expanded its usage as a Web3 hub, tapping the hottest crypto trends, including DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and others. At that time, TWT tokens were not essential, as multiple other wallets were tokenless. However, TWT responded to general hype, rising to $2.25 in December 2022. TWT token started as an experiment. The FDV got too high quickly. They burned 99% of the supply, but didn’t have too many use cases for it. Now that’s expanding. https://t.co/muNXgM14tX — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) September 19, 2025 TWT breaks out on the Binance effect The recent TWT rally showed the Binance effect was still one of the biggest factors during altcoin seasons. TWT expanded just days after APX rallied by 400%, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. Over 30% of the TWT volume hinges on a single Binance trading pair, allowing for concentrated orders to move the price quickly. The short-term rally, however, is underscored by the general wallet-based token trend. Web3 wallets are becoming key hubs for activity, offering seamless access to new projects. Recently, MetaMask also mentioned the potential to launch a token soon, following the announcement of a native stablecoin. TWT tokens rallied after the mention by CZ Zhao, with additional influence from the new litepaper suggesting TWT may be locked for premium wallet services. | Source: CoinGecko . TWT to become incentive token In a recently released litepaper, the Trust Wallet team showed its plans to boost TWT usage and turn the asset into an incentive token. The platform will offer a mix of utility and loyalty use cases, boosting TWT turnover. TWT has a total supply of $1B and a circulating supply of around $416M, following the initial burn of 99% of the supply. After avoiding dilution, TWT is also facing a higher price range, returning some of the rewards to users. In 2025, Trust Wallet showed robust results based on engagement with the DeFi ecosystem. The token facilitated the staking of 102,169 ETH , as well as over 67M staked TWT. The platform also has $3.49M in on-chain reserves. Based on internal reports, Trust Wallet reaches 210M clients, giving access to over 100 chains. The wallet has also collected over $45M in fees for the year to date, raising the issue of potential buybacks. For the whole year, fees are projected to exceed $63M, based on Dune Analytics data . TWT tokens will have utility for all wallet users, depending on the tier selected. With no TWT staked, users can still get gas fee discounts. Locking TWT and engagement will give access to rewards and early features. More TWT locked will give access to premium features, support, marketing access, and special events. Advanced trading, airdrops, staking, and rewards will require locked TWT for each account, potentially pushing TWT to a higher valuation and discouraging selling. While actual TWT may be held closely, TWT may continue its speculative trading on futures exchanges.

I n his latest analysis , he points to a fractal formation pattern that suggests XRP could reach the $6–$7 range by mid-November. This projection has quickly caught the attention of traders and long-term investors, as XRP’s current price remains well below this target. Fractals, often used in technical analysis, are recurring chart patterns that can help predict future price action by identifying historical similarities in market behavior. Therefore, EGRAG CRYPTO argues that XRP is currently mirroring a previous structure that led to a notable rally. If this fractal setup plays out as expected, it could mark one of the most significant price surges for the digital asset in recent years. If XRP reaches $6–$7 by mid-November, it would mark a major win for investors and a symbolic breakthrough for a token that has endured regulatory battles and market volatility, validating its resilience and cementing its relevance in the evolving digital finance ecosystem. Meanwhile, a recent cup-and-handle pattern signalled that XRP had the potential of soaring to $15 by year-end with the altcoin presently trading at $3.04 per CoinGecko data. DLT-Based Solutions: How Ripple and Stellar are Redefining Cross-Border Banking According to crypto observer SMQKE, distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based solutions are increasingly challenging the traditional correspondent banking model. For decades, cross-border payments have relied on a chain of intermediaries, often resulting in slow settlements, high costs, and limited transparency. But with the rise of blockchain networks such as Ripple and Stellar, the industry is experiencing a seismic shift. The correspondent banking model depends on trust and pre-funded accounts, locking up liquidity and exposing banks to counterparty risk. Transactions often take days to settle, with fees compounding at every step, an inefficiency that hampers global trade and remittances, especially in emerging markets lacking affordable, reliable payment infrastructure. Ripple and Stellar are redefining cross-border payments with DLT-based solutions that eliminate intermediaries and enable near-instant peer-to-peer transactions. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity leverages XRP as a bridge currency, allowing financial institutions to settle in seconds while unlocking capital tied in nostro/vostro accounts. Stellar, meanwhile, builds an open network linking banks, payment providers, and individuals to deliver low-cost transfers, especially in underserved regions. The impact is profound because faster settlements free up capital and strengthen cash flow, while lower costs make remittances more affordable for millions of families worldwide. At the same time, DLT’s real-time transparency reduces fraud and simplifies reconciliation, cutting operational risks across the board. Conclusion Ripple and Stellar highlight how DLT-based solutions are no longer experimental but real alternatives capable of addressing the inefficiencies of correspondent banking. By delivering speed, transparency, and cost efficiency, they are setting new standards for global payments and remittances.

A prominent analyst suggests there’s a significant 70% probability that Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high within the next two weeks. This forecast, reported by Cointelegraph, has investors and enthusiasts keenly watching the market. What’s Driving the Next Bitcoin All-Time High? Adler Junior, the analyst behind this compelling prediction, points to several market dynamics. He believes that the conditions are aligning for BTC to push past its previous peak. This isn’t just a hopeful guess; it’s based on market observation and historical patterns. Market Momentum: Current buying pressure and investor sentiment appear strong. Increasing Adoption: Broader acceptance and institutional interest continue to grow, providing a solid foundation. Limited Supply: Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity remains a key factor in its value appreciation. However, Junior also cautions that the path to a new Bitcoin all-time high might not be entirely smooth. A short-term correction could occur before the major breakthrough. Is a Correction Necessary Before the Bitcoin All-Time High? According to Adler Junior, a brief market correction of one to two weeks is a distinct possibility. Such pullbacks are often healthy for markets, allowing for consolidation and providing a stronger base for the next upward move. Think of it as the market taking a deep breath before a big sprint. This period of adjustment can: Shake out weaker hands, leading to more stable ownership. Allow new investors to enter at slightly lower price points. Reset technical indicators, preventing the market from becoming overheated. Understanding these potential fluctuations is crucial for any investor looking to capitalize on the next Bitcoin all-time high . Understanding Seasonal Rallies and the Bitcoin All-Time High Another significant factor highlighted by the analyst is the expectation of a seasonal rally. Historically, certain periods of the year have shown stronger performance for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. These seasonal trends can be influenced by various factors, such as: Year-end investment flows. Increased retail interest during holidays. Macroeconomic shifts affecting investor behavior. A seasonal rally could provide the extra impetus needed to propel Bitcoin past its previous record. This confluence of factors – strong underlying momentum, a potential healthy correction, and seasonal tailwinds – paints an optimistic picture for a new Bitcoin all-time high . How Can Investors Prepare for the Next Bitcoin All-Time High? While no investment is without risk, preparing for a potential new Bitcoin all-time high involves strategic thinking. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news and analyst reports. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider regular, smaller investments to mitigate volatility. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on Bitcoin’s long-term potential rather than short-term fluctuations. Remember, market predictions are probabilities, not certainties. Always conduct your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor. In conclusion, the prospect of a new Bitcoin all-time high within two weeks is generating considerable excitement. With an analyst placing a 70% probability on this event, supported by potential seasonal rallies and healthy corrections, the coming weeks could be pivotal for Bitcoin. While the journey may involve some volatility, the overall sentiment points towards significant upward movement. Staying informed and approaching the market strategically will be key for navigating these exciting times. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin? A1: An all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin refers to the highest price point Bitcoin has ever reached in its history. Q2: Who is Adler Junior, the analyst mentioned in the report? A2: Adler Junior is an analyst whose market observations and predictions regarding Bitcoin’s price movements were reported by Cointelegraph. Q3: Why might Bitcoin experience a correction before reaching a new all-time high? A3: Corrections are often healthy market movements that allow for profit-taking, consolidation, and the establishment of a stronger base before a further upward trend. It can prevent the market from becoming overextended too quickly. Q4: What are seasonal rallies in the crypto market? A4: Seasonal rallies are periods during the year when certain assets, like cryptocurrencies, tend to show stronger price performance due to various factors such as increased investor activity, holiday spending, or specific market cycles. Q5: Is a 70% probability a guarantee that Bitcoin will hit a new ATH? A5: No, a 70% probability indicates a high likelihood based on the analyst’s assessment and market conditions, but it is not a guarantee.

Risk assets whipsawed on the headlines before settling, with markets now handicapping further cuts into year-end. For the analyst, the decision was “pretty much a nothing burger” in isolation, but it sharpened the focus on micro drivers inside crypto—namely flows and policy. Related Reading: Next XRP ‘Monster Leg’ Will Start No Earlier Than 2026: Analyst On policy, he highlighted what may prove the most consequential regulatory pivot since US spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs: the SEC’s approval of generic listing standards for spot commodity ETPs across major exchanges, a change that streamlines the path for crypto ETFs beyond BTC and ETH. In the same sweep, the agency cleared Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap product—a multi-asset ETP holding Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana and Cardano—signaling a new phase for regulated crypto baskets. “ He also pointed to deepening derivatives infrastructure. CME Group announced it will list options on Solana and XRP futures, extending regulated hedging tools beyond the BTC/ETH duopoly and potentially drawing new institutional basis and vol sellers into those order books. Yet it was Ripple’s new institutional initiative that the analyst treated as the week’s sleeper story. Ripple, DBS and Franklin Templeton unveiled a plan to enable accredited and institutional clients to toggle between Ripple’s dollar stablecoin (RLUSD) and Franklin Templeton’s tokenized money-market fund (sgBENJI) on DBS Digital Exchange—with the bank exploring the use of sgBENJI as repo collateral and Ripple’s stablecoin as transactional grease. Franklin Templeton will issue the sgBENJI token on the XRP Ledger. In his view, the significance is two-fold: a credible on-chain cash-and-collateral market and a concrete, regulated venue for RLUSD utility. Related Reading: Facts Vs. Hype: Analyst Examines XRP Supply Shock Theory To underscore the potential scale, he cited RLUSD executive Jack McDonald’s estimate that “repo transaction volume is well into the 10s of trillions globally (nearly $12T in the US in 2024 itself).” The analyst did not claim that flow will migrate wholesale to the XRP Ledger; rather, he framed it as an addressable ceiling for tokenized collateral markets if custody, compliance and counterparty rails mature around them. Why XRP Won’t Reach $100 This Cycle The technicals in his rundown served more as risk-management context than price calls. He flagged Bitcoin dominance’s recent weakness as the tell for an early-stage altcoin rotation while noting that short-term structures remain choppy. The analyst referenced BNB’s push toward a 1.618 Fibonacci extension and observed that XRP, by his drawings, remains below a comparable extension level—thereby allowing for catch-up dynamics should capital rotate. He reiterated that speculation typically “moves price further than utility does, at least initially,” and cautioned that traders should not confuse institutional news with a settled valuation model for base-layer settlement tokens. Where does that leave XRP? His thesis is deliberately conservative relative to social-media targets. He said he still believes utility “is going to come,” especially as US market-structure language evolves and institutional rails—ETFs, CME derivatives, tokenized cash and collateral—proliferate. However, the analyst continues to uphold his long-stated thesis that the $12 region will mark the cycle top for XRP. Until there is a widely accepted framework to price “base utility” for throughput, he intends to sell into strength if XRP hits his personal range for this cycle, keep a 10% “moon bag” above that, and reassess. The discipline, he argued, is psychological as much as mathematical: “If you were afraid of losing $1,000 … and it’s now worth $20,000, you should be 20 times more afraid of losing $20,000.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.03.

News recently broke that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to speak by phone at 1:00 p.m. UTC on Friday. While this might appear to be purely political, such high-level discussions between two of the world’s most influential leaders carry significant weight for investors. Understanding the potential Geopolitical Crypto Impact of these talks is crucial for anyone navigating digital asset markets. These interactions often set the tone for global economic policies and trade relations, which in turn can directly influence investor sentiment and the trajectory of digital currencies. What Drives Geopolitical Crypto Impact in Today’s Market? When leaders like President Trump and President Xi engage, their dialogue often touches upon critical economic and trade policies. These discussions can directly influence global stability, investor sentiment, and capital flows. For the cryptocurrency market, which is notoriously sensitive to macro-economic shifts, any hint of cooperation or tension can trigger notable price movements. Investors are constantly seeking clarity in an uncertain world, and these high-stakes conversations provide important signals. Consider the historical context: periods of heightened US-China trade tensions have often coincided with increased volatility in traditional markets. Cryptocurrencies, while sometimes seen as a hedge against traditional finance, are not immune to these broader trends. They can react both as a safe haven asset during instability or as a risk-on asset during periods of optimism. The impending call is a prime example of an event that could significantly shape the immediate market narrative, highlighting the direct Geopolitical Crypto Impact . Past Precedents: Decoding the Geopolitical Crypto Impact Looking back, we can observe clear patterns where geopolitical events have directly influenced crypto valuations. For instance, when trade negotiations between the US and China faced breakdowns, traditional equity markets often dipped. Sometimes, Bitcoin (BTC) would see either a surge as investors sought alternatives or a dip alongside other risk assets due to overall market fear. This demonstrates the multifaceted nature of Geopolitical Crypto Impact . Trade Policy Discussions: Any progress or stalemate on tariffs and trade agreements can affect global supply chains and economic growth forecasts. This directly impacts investor confidence across all asset classes, including digital currencies. Technological Rivalry: Talks often involve intellectual property and technological dominance. Decisions made here can influence the future of blockchain innovation and regulatory environments for crypto globally. Currency Stability: Discussions around currency valuations and stability between the dollar and yuan can indirectly affect the appeal of decentralized digital currencies as alternatives. The market’s reaction isn’t always straightforward. Sometimes, bad news for traditional markets can be good news for crypto, positioning it as a non-sovereign alternative. Other times, a broad risk-off sentiment can drag everything down. Therefore, vigilance is key for those tracking the Geopolitical Crypto Impact . Navigating the Future: Anticipating Geopolitical Crypto Impact As Friday’s call approaches, market participants will be closely watching for any official readouts or leaks regarding the tone and substance of the conversation. Will it signal a de-escalation of tensions, or will it hint at new challenges? Each scenario carries different implications for digital asset markets. A positive outcome, suggesting greater cooperation, might foster a risk-on environment, potentially benefiting certain altcoins or driving broader crypto adoption. Conversely, renewed friction could lead to increased market uncertainty and potential downward pressure. For crypto investors, this isn’t just about political news; it’s about understanding the macro forces at play. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources for updates on the call and its immediate aftermath. Understand that timely information is power in volatile markets. Observe Market Sentiment: Pay attention to how traditional markets react, as this often precedes or accompanies crypto movements. Global equities and commodities can offer early indicators. Diversify Wisely: Consider how different assets in your crypto portfolio might react to varying geopolitical scenarios. A well-diversified portfolio can mitigate risks. Risk Management: Be prepared for potential volatility and adjust your strategies accordingly. Setting stop-loss orders or reducing exposure might be prudent during uncertain times. The Geopolitical Crypto Impact is a continuous factor, and high-level diplomatic engagements are significant milestones within this ongoing narrative. Being prepared allows for more informed decision-making. What Does This Mean for Digital Assets? The upcoming phone call serves as a potent reminder of how deeply interconnected the global economy is, and how digital assets, despite their decentralized nature, operate within this complex ecosystem. While the direct topics of discussion might not explicitly mention Bitcoin or blockchain, the broader implications for trade, technology, and international relations are undeniable. The stability or instability fostered by these talks can either encourage investment in perceived safe havens like Bitcoin or drive capital towards riskier, higher-growth assets. Ultimately, the true measure of the Geopolitical Crypto Impact from this specific interaction will unfold in the days and weeks following the call. What’s clear is that savvy investors will integrate geopolitical analysis into their broader market strategies, recognizing that events far removed from the blockchain can still significantly influence its trajectory. It’s a dynamic interplay that demands constant attention and a nuanced understanding. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. How do US-China talks influence crypto markets? US-China talks can influence crypto markets by affecting global economic stability, investor sentiment, and capital flows. Positive outcomes might lead to a risk-on environment, while increased tensions can cause market uncertainty and volatility, impacting digital asset prices. 2. Is crypto a safe haven during geopolitical tensions? Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes seen as a safe haven due to their decentralized nature and limited supply. However, their role can vary; they might surge during instability as an alternative asset, or they could decline alongside traditional risk assets during broad market fear. The Geopolitical Crypto Impact is not always uniform. 3. What specific topics in US-China talks impact crypto? Key topics include trade policy (tariffs, agreements), technological rivalry (intellectual property, blockchain innovation), and currency stability. Decisions in these areas can significantly shape the global economic climate, indirectly affecting the regulatory landscape and investor appeal of digital currencies. 4. How can investors prepare for geopolitical crypto impact? Investors can prepare by staying informed through reliable news, observing traditional market sentiment, diversifying their crypto portfolios wisely, and implementing robust risk management strategies like setting stop-loss orders to mitigate potential volatility. 5. Will this specific Trump-Xi call have a lasting impact on crypto? The lasting impact of any single call depends on its substance and the follow-up actions.

Just two weeks after launch, $GUSD has crossed $130M in mints . Unlike most stablecoins, GUSD isn’t just a digital dollar. It’s a financial certificate backed by real-world assets (RWA), primarily U.S. Treasury bonds. That backing sets it apart from USDT, USDC, and even DAI. Payment Talk highlighted the milestone… Gate最近推出的 GUSD有点强，它不是普通稳定币，而是背靠美国国债等 RWA（真实世界资产）的理财凭证，简单说，用 USDT/USDC 1:1 兑换铸造 GUSD，就能间接投资低风险美债，享受稳定的美元利息回报 基础年化收益高达… pic.twitter.com/PqO3w552VW — 番人说 (@Payment_Talk) September 18, 2025 calling GUSD “the most innovative stablecoin of 2025.” What Makes $GUSD Different? The pitch is simple but powerful. Swap USDT or USDC at a 1:1 ratio to mint GUSD. In doing so, you indirectly invest in low-risk Treasuries, while earning stable USD interest. The base annualized yield sits at 4.4%, compounded daily. Compare that with the 2-3% from traditional banks, or the 2-5% on centralized lending platforms. GUSD isn’t just stable, it’s productive. There’s no lock-up, no hidden clauses. GUSD can be traded, used as collateral, or withdrawn anytime. Liquidity stays intact, returns flow consistently. Jun Shao explained it well… 最近大家都在热谈GUSD的福利，今天闲时也翻了翻资料，果然让自己眼前一亮。 目前GUSD铸造量飙升至1.37亿美元，个人认为Launchpool给的福利一定要抓住，白拿的！ 首先恭喜Gate平台的GUSD稳定币铸造量正式突破1.37亿美元大关！这不光是个数字里程碑，更证明了大家对这种背靠真实资产的稳健玩法的认可。… pic.twitter.com/gPqzr3n4BW — Crypto_君少 (@JunShao_666) September 18, 2025 “GUSD combines the best of stablecoin liquidity with RWA-backed yield. It’s a safe way to get paid for holding USD on-chain.” Stablecoin Comparison Here’s how GUSD stacks up against the big names: USDT / USDC: Backed by USD reserves. Huge liquidity. Yields of 2-5% if lent on CeFi platforms. But returns are low and depend heavily on third parties. DAI: Backed by DeFi collateral. Yields of 4-6%. Decentralized, but exposed to high volatility risk when collateral prices swing. GUSD: Backed by U.S. Treasuries and other RWAs. Transparent audits, regulatory compliance. 4.4% base yield with daily compounding, plus deep integration into the Gate ecosystem. The difference is clear. GUSD isn’t just another stablecoin to hold. It’s a yield-bearing asset with multiple use cases, positioned at the intersection of CeFi, DeFi, and RWA finance. Launchpool, Where the Real Magic Happens If 4.4% sounds good, Launchpool takes it much further. After minting, GUSD can be staked in three major pools. These pools reward stakers with new tokens on top of the base yield. The result? Total annualized returns can skyrocket 10x or more depending on pool incentives. For example: Mint 10,000 USDT → 10,000 GUSD Earn ≈440 USDT annually from the base 4.4% yield Stake into the BOT Pool on Launchpool Collect additional rewards that could multiply earnings There’s no lockup. Staking is flexible. Users can pull funds anytime while still farming rewards. That flexibility makes GUSD both a savings product and a DeFi yield tool. Why Retail is Excited Crypto retail loves simple math. And GUSD delivers. 4.4% guaranteed yield from Treasuries Launchpool incentives stacked on top 1:1 liquidity with USDT and USDC That’s why the mint numbers spiked so quickly. $130M in two weeks is not a soft start. It’s a signal that users want more than “digital cash.” They want digital yield certificates. The psychology matters here. Holding USDT or USDC feels like standing still. Holding GUSD feels like progress, a safe asset that actually works for you. RWA Narrative Heats Up 2024-2025 has been the year of real-world assets (RWA). Institutions, DeFi protocols, and exchanges have rushed to tokenize bonds, treasuries, and even real estate. GUSD lands perfectly in that narrative. It turns the most trusted RWA, U.S. Treasuries, into a liquid, tradable, yield-bearing stablecoin. This is more than a product. It’s a bridge between crypto users and traditional finance yields. It’s a way for retail to access instruments once reserved for banks, hedge funds, or accredited investors. Compliance and Transparency Another big selling point: compliance. Gate designed GUSD with audits and regulatory transparency in mind. Unlike algorithmic stables, GUSD isn’t fragile. Unlike offshore CeFi schemes, GUSD isn’t murky. The RWA reserves backing the stablecoin are on-chain auditable and held in secure structures. That credibility matters for institutions looking to deploy capital at scale. Multi-Purpose Utility What separates GUSD from competitors is its multi-purpose use case. It’s not just a stablecoin. It’s: 1. A yield-bearing savings product. 2. A collateral asset for trading and lending. 3. A Launchpool farming token with amplified returns. 4. A bridge into RWA finance for everyday users. That multi-layered utility ensures adoption isn’t siloed. Traders, yield farmers, institutions, all have a reason to hold GUSD. Stablecoins are the backbone of crypto. But until now, most have been passive. You hold them, you trade with them, but they don’t do much else. GUSD changes that dynamic. Backed by U.S. Treasuries, delivering a 4.4% base yield, and supercharged by Launchpool rewards, it positions itself as the next-generation stablecoin. The $130M minted in just two weeks is proof of demand. Users don’t just want stability. They want stability with yield. As the RWA narrative accelerates and Gate doubles down on ecosystem integration, GUSD could become the most important stablecoin launch of 2025.

This figure, reported by DL News and citing data from DefiLlama, represents a nearly fivefold increase from the $84 million raised in 2024. It’s a clear signal that investors are placing significant bets on the future of stablecoins, seeing them as a cornerstone of the evolving crypto economy. What’s Fueling This Massive Stablecoin Funding Influx? This dramatic uptick in investment isn’t happening by chance. Several factors are contributing to the growing confidence in stablecoins. Firstly, stablecoins offer a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the volatile cryptocurrency market. They provide stability, which is highly attractive to institutional investors and everyday users alike, who seek to mitigate price fluctuations while still participating in the digital economy. Moreover, the increasing demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and cross-border payments heavily relies on efficient and reliable stablecoins. As the DeFi ecosystem expands, the need for robust, liquid, and well-supported stablecoins becomes paramount. Developers are innovating to create more secure and transparent stablecoin solutions, attracting substantial stablecoin funding . How Does Increased Stablecoin Funding Impact the Crypto Market? The influx of capital into stablecoin development has profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency landscape. It suggests a maturation of the market, where utility and stability are gaining prominence alongside speculative assets. This increased stablecoin funding can lead to: Enhanced Liquidity: More stablecoins mean greater liquidity across various exchanges and DeFi protocols, making trading and transactions smoother. Broader Adoption: As stablecoins become more reliable and accessible, they lower the barrier to entry for new users and businesses looking to engage with digital currencies without exposure to extreme volatility. Innovation in DeFi: The capital fuels research and development, leading to new types of stablecoins, improved underlying mechanisms, and more sophisticated DeFi products. This growth underscores a shift towards more practical applications of blockchain technology, moving beyond just speculative trading. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of This Stablecoin Funding Boom? While the surge in stablecoin funding brings numerous benefits, it also introduces certain challenges that developers and regulators must address. Key Benefits: Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins can provide access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked populations globally. Efficient Transactions: They enable faster, cheaper, and more transparent international remittances and payments compared to traditional banking systems. Risk Mitigation: For crypto traders, stablecoins offer a safe haven during market downturns, allowing them to preserve capital without exiting the crypto ecosystem entirely. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased adoption and funding will inevitably lead to greater regulatory oversight, which, while necessary, can sometimes stifle innovation if not carefully balanced. Transparency and Reserves: Ensuring that stablecoins are fully backed by verifiable reserves remains a critical concern for maintaining trust and stability. Market Concentration: A few dominant stablecoins could lead to centralization risks, making the ecosystem vulnerable to single points of failure. Navigating these challenges responsibly will be key to the long-term success of the stablecoin sector. What’s Next for Stablecoin Funding and Development? The future of stablecoin funding looks promising, with ongoing innovation driving the sector forward. We are seeing projects exploring various backing mechanisms, from fiat-backed to crypto-backed and even algorithmic designs, each with its own set of advantages and risks. For instance, new entrants are focusing on achieving greater transparency in their reserve audits and exploring multi-chain compatibility to expand their reach. For individuals and businesses, understanding the different types of stablecoins and their underlying mechanisms is crucial. Choosing a stablecoin that aligns with your risk tolerance and intended use case is an actionable insight. As the market matures, we can expect more clarity from regulators, potentially leading to even greater institutional adoption and continued investment in this vital segment of the crypto world. The remarkable increase in stablecoin funding to $540 million this year signifies a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It highlights a growing recognition of stablecoins as essential tools for stability, utility, and innovation within the digital economy. While challenges related to regulation and transparency persist, the overwhelming investment indicates a strong belief in their transformative potential. Stablecoins are not just surviving; they are thriving, laying a robust foundation for the next wave of crypto adoption and financial evolution. Frequently Asked Questions About Stablecoin Funding What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or to a commodity like gold. This stability makes them ideal for transactions, savings, and as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto market. Why is stablecoin funding increasing significantly? The increase is driven by several factors, including the growing demand for stability in the crypto market, the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi), the need for efficient cross-border payments, and increasing investor confidence in their utility and potential for broader adoption. Who are the main investors in stablecoin development? Investors include venture capitalists, institutional funds, and private equity firms who recognize the foundational role stablecoins play in the future of digital finance. They are backing startups focused on innovation, security, and regulatory compliance. What are the risks associated with stablecoins? Key risks include regulatory uncertainty, concerns about the transparency and sufficiency of reserves backing the stablecoins, and potential centralization issues if a few stablecoins dominate the market. How does increased stablecoin funding benefit the average crypto user? For the average user, increased funding can lead to more reliable and liquid stablecoins, innovative DeFi products, lower transaction fees, and greater accessibility to digital financial services, making crypto more practical for everyday use.

The token has surged 377.4% in 24 hours, trading at $0.528 according to CoinMarketCap. Volume hit $345M as over 330K new wallets joined in, sending TVL above $1B for the first time. The spark? A single tweet from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), his first-ever endorsement of a coin outside of BNB. And it wasn’t just any coin. It was Aster, the perp DEX built as a direct competitor to Hyperliquid. CZ’s tweet… Well done! Good start. Keep building! pic.twitter.com/oMfOxfsBRS — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) September 17, 2025 has already sent Crypto Twitter into overdrive. What is Aster? Aster is what happens when two powerful engines collide. Astherus: focused on yield machines, staking, liquidity, and stable returns. APX Finance: a perp engine built for deep leverage and serious infrastructure. The two merged in late 2024. Out of that merger came Aster, a platform that does both, yield and perpetuals. Aster runs multichain, backed by YZi Labs (an entity with CZ’s fingerprints all over it). The backing is strategic. It’s not just capital. It’s total alignment. Aster’s official announcement… A significant first step for $ASTER on BNB Chain. • $345M traded in 24h • Price reached $0.528 (~1,650%) • 330K new wallets joined • TVL $660M → $1.005B • Platform volume near $1.5B Thanks to our community for the trust and support.

Why Aster Could Flip Hyperliquid Crypto Twitter is buzzing with reasons why Aster could surpass Hyperliquid. Here are the main ones: 1. US Stock Perps Aster is the only DEX offering 24/7 US stock perpetuals. That’s a funnel no competitor currently owns. 2. Yield-Bearing Margin $USDF, Aster’s native stable, acts like USDe but with yield on margin. Traders earn while they trade, a unique hook. 3. CZ’s Ruthlessness CZ has a track record. FTX, LUNA, countless other rivals, all neutralized. He doesn’t act unless he’s already sure of victory. 4. Full Alignment CZ controls YZi Labs. Majority backer. Majority control. The legal and structural setup is designed for speed. 5. Retail Funnel 90% of retail traffic touches Binance. Aster plugs directly into that funnel. Hyperliquid, meanwhile, is invisible to most new users. 6. Social Reach While Hyperliquid whales spin narratives in a CT echo chamber, Aster has 100x more social reach. Retail ownership ensures alignment. 7. Capital & Strategy Jeff (Hyperliquid’s founder) is smart. But CZ has more capital, more political leverage, and more ruthlessness. Rebates, vampire attacks, employee poaching, regulatory pressure, he’ll use all of it. 8. Liquidity Depth CZ can match Binance’s pool depth inside Aster. Once that flywheel spins, algos, MMs, and retail follow. HL gets starved of oxygen. 9. Market Cap Advantage $ASTER sits at $500M MCap. Supply is tightly controlled by CZ. Price, onboarding, marketing, all coordinated. 10. Ego and Revenge This is personal. CZ claims he invented perp DEX ideas back in 2019. He believes Jeff and others siphoned market share. Now, he’s here to reclaim it. Asparagoid’s thread… 10 reasons $ASTER will flip Hyperliquid: 1) The only DEX with 24/7 US stock perps 2) Yield Bearing margin: $USDF is native and functions similar to USDe, with additional yield based on activity 3) CZ doesn't tolerate competitors and historically has neutralized all competition… — Dr. Shin Geon-yeong (神建永), Ph.D. (@asparagoid) September 18, 2025 breaks down exactly why Aster could dominate. Traders didn’t wait. Once CZ tweeted, wallets flooded in. 330K new addresses in 24h isn’t organic, it’s coordinated funneling. Social buzz confirmed it. ASTER trended across X within hours. Influencers with millions of followers carried the same line: this isn’t just another coin, this is CZ’s coin. Aster went from niche merger product to global spotlight in a single day. Hyperliquid’s Challenge Hyperliquid has the tech edge, for now. Their execution is clean, their perps engine is battle-tested. But distribution is weak. They live in the CT bubble. The problem is simple: funnel control. Hyperliquid must win on merit alone. Aster doesn’t. With Binance’s funnel, Aster decides what retail sees, then wins with deeper liquidity and incentives. Jeff is brilliant, but he can’t match CZ’s warchest or his willingness to play dirty. Regulation, politics, BD, CZ has the upper hand in every angle outside of pure tech. And in crypto, funnels and incentives matter more than tech. This isn’t just a pump. It’s a turning point. For the first time, CZ publicly picked a project outside BNB. And not just any project, one designed to dismantle a rising rival. Aster is a multichain DEX with a war general at the helm. Hyperliquid is a tech-first upstart with no retail funnel. The clash isn’t fair. Today’s 377% move is likely just the beginning. CZ has proven across a decade that when he picks a fight, he fights to win. The market just witnessed something historic. CZ’s entrance into the perp DEX wars changes everything. $ASTER is now a Binance-backed weapon. Hyperliquid just became target 1. Retail flow, liquidity depth, and social dominance are about to shift. The question isn’t if Aster challenges Hyperliquid. It’s how quickly. With CZ’s tweet, the battle line is drawn.

Source: CoinMarketCap If Ethereum were to hit a $1 trillion market cap, each ETH would be valued at about $8,286. That’s an 82% increase from current levels. Given Ethereum’s role in decentralized finance, tokenization, and enterprise blockchain adoption, and the continued inflows from institutional players such as Fidelity, Bitmine, and BlackRock, it remains the most likely candidate to join Bitcoin in the trillion-dollar bracket by 2030. XRP higher upside potential XRP is currently the third-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $181.5 billion and a circulating supply of 59.77 billion tokens. At its peak in July 2025, XRP briefly reached a market cap of $210 billion, but it trades today at $3.03. XRP highest ever market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap At a $1 trillion valuation, each XRP would be worth approximately $16.73. That would represent a 5.5x increase from current prices. To reach such levels, XRP would need significant institutional adoption. The recent REX-Osprey XRP ETF launch provides regulated access for U.S. investors, but further involvement from major asset managers and deeper integration of Ripple’s technology within the banking system would be required to drive liquidity and demand. Ethereum would need to nearly double to hit $1 trillion, while XRP would need to multiply more than fivefold. Both face different challenges, but if institutional adoption continues, both assets could realistically join Bitcoin in the trillion-dollar market cap club by 2030.

While seemingly distinct, the strength or weakness of the US Dollar often sends ripples across all asset classes, including digital assets, influencing investor sentiment and capital flows. Recently, the dollar has shown an astonishing ascent, driven by pivotal economic data and the nuanced decisions of central banks. Let’s dive into the core drivers behind these significant shifts and what they mean for the broader financial landscape. Why is the US Dollar Gaining Momentum? The recent strengthening of the US Dollar has largely been attributed to a series of robust economic indicators, particularly from the labor market. A strong jobs report typically signals a healthy economy, which in turn gives the central bank, the Federal Reserve (Fed), more room to maintain or even tighten monetary policy without fear of stifling growth. This expectation of higher interest rates makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to global investors, increasing demand for the currency. Interest Rate Differentials: Higher interest rates in the US compared to other major economies make the dollar a more appealing currency for carry trades, where investors borrow in a low-interest currency and invest in a high-interest one. Safe-Haven Demand: In times of global uncertainty or economic slowdowns elsewhere, the US Dollar often acts as a safe haven, attracting capital seeking stability. Economic Resilience: Data suggesting the US economy is performing better than its peers can lead to capital inflows, further bolstering the dollar. Analyzing the Latest Jobs Report : What Does it Mean for the Economy? The latest Jobs Report , specifically the Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) data, delivered a powerful boost to the dollar. The numbers indicated stronger-than-expected job creation, coupled with a stable or even declining unemployment rate. This data point is crucial because it provides a snapshot of the labor market’s health, which is a key component of economic activity and inflation pressures. Let’s consider the typical components of a compelling jobs report: Indicator Significance Recent Trend (Example) Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) Number of new jobs created (excluding agricultural, government, private household, and non-profit organization employees). A high number indicates strong employment growth. +272,000 (Exceeded expectations) Unemployment Rate Percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment. A lower rate suggests a tight labor market. 3.8% (Remained low) Average Hourly Earnings Measures the average change in hourly wages. Growth here can signal inflationary pressures. +0.4% MoM (Slightly higher than expected) When these figures come in strong, it often prompts market participants to anticipate a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve, meaning interest rates might stay higher for longer, or even see further increases. This expectation directly feeds into the dollar’s strength. The Japanese Yen ‘s Resilience: A Closer Look at Central Bank Policy While the dollar surged, the Japanese Yen also found some footing, largely due to developments surrounding the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Unlike many other major central banks that have aggressively raised rates, the BoJ has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy for years, grappling with persistent deflationary pressures and aiming to achieve sustainable inflation. However, recent signs suggest a potential shift. The BoJ’s approach has been characterized by: Negative Interest Rate Policy (NIRP): Keeping short-term rates below zero to stimulate lending and investment. Yield Curve Control (YCC): Capping long-term government bond yields to keep borrowing costs low. Asset Purchases: Extensive buying of government bonds and other assets to inject liquidity into the economy. The recent BoJ meeting, while not delivering a dramatic policy shift, hinted at future adjustments, particularly concerning bond purchases and the YCC framework. Even subtle signals of normalization can provide support for the Yen, as they suggest a move away from the extreme dovishness that has weighed on the currency for so long. The market is keenly watching for any definitive moves towards tightening, which would likely lead to a more sustained appreciation of the Japanese Yen. Navigating the Volatile Forex Market : Key Trends and Outlook The Forex Market is a dynamic arena, constantly reacting to a confluence of economic data, geopolitical events, and Central Bank Policy decisions. The current environment is marked by divergence among major central banks, creating both opportunities and risks for traders and investors. Understanding these overarching trends is critical for anyone looking to navigate currency fluctuations. What are the major forces shaping the Forex Market right now? Inflationary Pressures: While some economies are seeing inflation cool, others are still grappling with elevated price levels, forcing central banks to remain vigilant. Economic Growth Differentials: The relative strength of economies directly impacts currency valuations. A stronger economy typically supports its currency. Geopolitical Tensions: Events like conflicts or trade disputes can trigger flight-to-safety moves, often benefiting currencies like the US Dollar or Swiss Franc. Central Bank Policy Divergence: As seen with the Fed and BoJ, differing monetary policy paths are a primary driver of currency pair movements. For investors, these trends highlight the importance of staying informed about economic calendars and central bank communications. The interplay between these factors determines the relative attractiveness of one currency over another. What Did the Recent Central Bank Policy Meetings Reveal for Global Investors? The recent string of Central Bank Policy meetings, particularly from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, has painted a clear picture of divergent strategies. The Fed, armed with strong jobs data, has maintained a hawkish stance, emphasizing its commitment to bringing inflation down to its target. This implies that interest rates could remain elevated, or even see further hikes, which is a significant tailwind for the US Dollar. Conversely, the Bank of Japan, while acknowledging rising inflation, has been more cautious about altering its long-standing accommodative stance. While they have made minor adjustments to their yield curve control, a full pivot to aggressive tightening remains elusive. This contrast in policy paths creates a stark difference in interest rate differentials, directly impacting currency pairs like USD/JPY. Key Takeaways from Recent Central Bank Actions: Fed’s Data Dependency: The Federal Reserve continues to closely monitor economic data, particularly inflation and employment, to guide its policy decisions. Strong data empowers a more restrictive stance. BoJ’s Gradualism: The Bank of Japan is proceeding with extreme caution, preferring to observe sustained inflation before making significant policy shifts. This slow approach contrasts sharply with its Western counterparts. Interest Rate Outlook: The market is now pricing in a higher-for-longer interest rate scenario for the US, while Japan’s rates are expected to remain low, at least in the near term. These policy decisions are not made in a vacuum; they reflect each nation’s unique economic challenges and objectives, and their combined effect reverberates throughout the global financial system. Challenges and Actionable Insights While a strong dollar might seem like a benefit for the US economy, it also presents challenges. It can make US exports more expensive and imports cheaper, potentially widening trade deficits. For other countries, a strong dollar can make their dollar-denominated debt more expensive to service and can import inflation. For investors, particularly those in the crypto space, understanding these dynamics offers actionable insights: Diversification: Consider how currency movements might impact your overall portfolio, especially if you hold assets priced in different currencies. Hedging Strategies: For businesses or individuals with significant international exposure, hedging against currency volatility might be prudent. Market Sentiment: A strong dollar often reflects a risk-off sentiment globally, which can sometimes correlate with downturns in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a weaker dollar can signal increased risk appetite. Stay Informed: Regularly follow economic calendars, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments. These are the primary drivers of currency markets. Conclusion: Navigating the Currency Crossroads The recent surge in the US Dollar , fueled by robust jobs data, and the nuanced positioning of the Japanese Yen following the BoJ meeting, underscore the complex and interconnected nature of the global Forex Market . Central Bank Policy decisions, particularly from the Fed and BoJ, are setting divergent paths that profoundly impact currency valuations and, by extension, global financial flows. As investors, staying attuned to these macroeconomic shifts is not just about understanding currency pairs; it’s about grasping the underlying currents that influence everything from commodity prices to cryptocurrency valuations. The astonishing ascent of the dollar and the careful steps of the BoJ serve as a powerful reminder that vigilance and informed decision-making are key to navigating today’s volatile markets.

These risky investments, which flourished on excitement, now seem to be trapped as serious investors look for altcoins with better fundamentals and real-world use. Crypto prediction analysts are pointing to XRP, Solana (SOL), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as projects that are growing in a way that is quite different from memecoins that aren’t going anywhere. Traders are wondering why certain cryptocurrencies are rising higher while others stay the same. The reason is that some are more innovative, adopted, and useful than others, like DOGE and PEPE. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is different from others as it is preparing for a beta launch that will include lending and borrowing through both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models. These characteristics are going to make people want its token, which will give it a bigger upside than its rivals. The project has now generated over $16 million in presale Phase 6, selling 42% of its allotment at $0.035 with more than 16,400 holders. The price of the token will go up by 15% in Phase 7; therefore, investors who want to buy crypto at a lower price are seeing this as their final opportunity to do so. We can already see an example of its growth. People who moved $1,000 from DOGE or PEPE to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 4 at $0.025 currently have almost $1,400 worth of tokens. Analysts expect this allocation to grow to $25,000 in the next year, with a predicted 25x return that memecoins can’t match. This is because of the beta release, stablecoin integration, and major exchange listings that are coming soon. XRP strengthens through institutional adoption XRP has been gaining a reputation via institutional use, unlike DOGE and PEPE. By focusing on international payments, it has built an ecosystem that doesn’t depend as much on speculation, which means investors should expect steadier growth. XRP doesn’t guarantee quick price jumps, but it does stay stable, which is appealing to those who want to invest in things other than memecoins that are known for their volatility. XRP’s growth is still slow compared to Solana (SOL) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), nevertheless. Analysts who keep an eye on crypto pricing think XRP will keep going in the same direction. However, investors who want bigger multiples are looking for projects that combine acceptance with fresh technological advancements. This is where Layer-1 improvements like Solana (SOL) and DeFi improvements like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) really stand out. Solana delivers 3x Solana (SOL) has been one of the most powerful Layer-1 projects in the last several years, giving investors a clear 3x return as its use grew in NFTs, DeFi, and gaming. A $2,000 investment at lower entry prices has grown to $6,000, suggesting that SOL is still a good choice for anyone who is watching why crypto is going up. It is one of the best competitors to Ethereum (ETH) since it has quick transaction speeds and a large community. Still, Solana (SOL)’s network has had problems, such as interruptions and rising gas prices, as more people use it. These limits make it tougher for the asset to keep making 3x gains. That’s why many are now looking for Layer-2 platforms, where transaction costs are lower and more people can utilize them without the same problems. Layer-2 shows greater potential To solve these problems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) connects directly with Layer-2 solutions. This makes overall lending functions quicker and cheaper. With P2C lending, users may borrow against significant assets like ETH, BTC, and SOL at loan-to-value ratios of up to 75%. They can pay back the loan in stablecoins like USDT and USDC. P2P lending, on the other hand, will let investors lend or borrow tokens like DOGE and PEPE, which will provide them with real use and chances to make money. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes it easy for people to use by integrating this system with Layer-2 efficiency. This drives the demand for MUTM tokens. Security and community involvement help this development route. There has already been a CertiK audit, and a $50,000 bug reward program encourages developers to make the ecosystem stronger. The organization is also holding a $100,000 giveaway campaign in which 10 winners will each get $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This will help the project get even more attention during the presale. Investors who used to just care about memecoin speculation are now backing ventures whose utility backs up crypto forecasts. These three cryptocurrencies are the most interesting in the market right now: XRP is steadily being adopted by institutions, Solana (SOL) is still doing well on Layer-1, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready to launch a full DeFi ecosystem on Layer-2. MUTM has the most potential for growth among them. It provides a way to parlay cheap presale allocations into life-changing rewards once the beta launch and exchange listings go live.

According to Ethereum researcher Christine D. Kim, who reported the development, the first rollout phase is set to begin on Dec. 3, followed by a second upgrade around Dec. 17 that will increase blob capacity. A third blob capacity hard fork is scheduled for Jan. 7, 2026, and together, these three upgrades will more than double Ethereum’s current blob throughput. For those unaware, blobs are temporary off-chain data chunks that were first introduced in the Dencun upgrade to help rollups post large volumes of data more efficiently without congesting the main chain. By storing this data separately and only referencing it on-chain, blobs significantly reduce transaction fees on layer-2 networks and, therefore, have been touted as a key part of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap. Initially, developers were targeting a November rollout, but those plans have since been delayed. Before the hard fork begins, Ethereum developers plan to run three public testnets starting in early October and continuing through mid-November. The idea is to trial the upgrade in separate phases to ensure the transition to mainnet is without any hiccups. According to the Ethereum developer community, ethPandaOps, the plan is to implement phased blob parameter changes, referred to as BPO (Blob Parameter Only) forks, which adjust blob limits without requiring client-side updates. As a result, developers can safely gauge the upgrades’ impact on the network ahead of full mainnet deployment. What is the Ethereum Fusaka hard fork? Fusaka follows closely on the heels of the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7. Unlike the Pectra hard fork, which introduced end-user features such as account abstraction and higher validator limits, Fusaka focuses on backend improvements. The hard fork is built around 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) bundled together, all with the goal of optimizing performance and scalability without affecting how smart contracts behave. Among the planned changes are new safeguards to make nodes more resilient against spam or harmful messages, alongside a significant increase in Ethereum’s block gas limit from 30 million to 150 million units. Still, the move comes with tradeoffs; higher gas limits could slow block propagation and increase storage demands, which developers are weighing carefully before final rollout. While Pectra was more visible to end users, Fusaka’s role is more foundational. Developers describe it as a “performance-and-security” release that continues Ethereum’s six-month upgrade cadence. Discussions around Fusaka began just weeks after Pectra shipped, with its final EIP bundle locked in by early August 2025. Holešky testnet retired as Hoodi takes over Fusaka’s arrival also marks the end of Ethereum’s Holešky testnet, which is set to be fully retired by mid-September. Initially launched in 2023, Holešky was designed to simulate mainnet conditions at a massive validator scale and proved useful for testing upgrades like Dencun and Pectra. Ethereum’s Protocol Support team has introduced the Hoodi testnet as Holešky’s successor, which is an optimized testnet specifically geared for infrastructure providers and validator lifecycle testing.

With a ‘triple witching’ options expiry due on Friday, could Bitcoin drop to much lower levels? Triple witching event - $5.3 trillion options expiry In traditional finance, triple witching is the name given to the quarterly event where stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options all expire on the same day. This particular witching event is due to be a record-breaker, with more than $5.3 trillion in options expiring. Given the sheer size of Friday’s expiration, trading volume is likely to spike, leading to huge volatility, and there is a chance that some kind of sell-off could take place in US markets. With Bitcoin probably feeling any sizable downward moves in traditional financial markets, its recent rejection from the major $117,500 resistance could turn into a steeper downside move. All this is without even discussing the crypto market’s own options expiry. While this expiration is ‘only’ a notional $3.4 billion, it could also cause a sharp drop in the Bitcoin price . Max pain is around the $112,000 level. Critical rejection for Bitcoin? Source: TradingView The short-term time frame chart for $BTC shows that while the price is being rejected, at least so far, the rejection has not been definitive. Instead of a general 45 degree angle correction, the price has chosen to drift sideways, perhaps suggesting that there could even be another attempt at the critical overhead resistance. If the price does continue down, a strong area of support would be the bottom of the ascending channel, plus the $115,700 horizontal support level. If this does not hold, the $112,000 support level could even be a possible target. Looking at the bottom of the chart, both the Stochastic RSI indicators, and the RSI indicator are trending down, while the price action is trending up - a classic case of bearish divergence. A good reason for an eventual fall in the Bitcoin price . A positive daily chart Source: TradingView The daily chart is still favouring the bulls at this point in time. The price is holding support above the 50-day SMA and is well above the strong $115,700 horizontal support level. An inverse head and shoulders is still very much in play, the measured move for which would potentially take the price close to the $120,000 resistance. The Stochastic RSI is showing its indicators to be nicely at the top of their range, while the RSI indicator is not only just above the 60.00 support level, but has also broken above the downtrend line. Bitcoin taps critical resistance again - when will it break? Source: TradingView The 2-week chart for the $BTC price illustrates how critical the $117,500 resistance is. This is the 6th tap on this particular pane of glass from a 2-week candle. The more one taps on the glass, the weaker it gets. This does not look like a typical market top. Most market tops would have some kind of a spike which would leave a long candle wick to the upside. All this said, it just may be that the bears could hang on to this resistance a bit longer. Although, even if the price came all the way back down to $108,000, there is very strong support there to send it back up again. One way or another, the odds are that this critical resistance will eventually break, whether that is over the next week or so, or whether it could take a bit longer, no one knows.

The proposed legislation, known as House Bill 4087, moved to a second reading on Thursday and was referred to the Committee on Government Operations. It was introduced in February by Republican Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson, who are asking the House to amend the Michigan Management and Budget Act. “Michigan can and should join Texas in leading on crypto policy by signing into law my bill creating the Michigan Crypto Strategic Reserve,” Posthumus wrote on X at the time of its introduction. If passed, the state treasurer’s authority will be allowed to allocate up to 10% of funds from Michigan’s countercyclical budget and economic stabilization fund into crypto. Michigan government could become crypto holders House Bill 4087 allows the state to maintain its digital assets in three possible ways: through a secure custody solution, through a qualified custodian such as a bank, trust company, or state-regulated firm, or by acquiring exchange-traded products (ETPs) from registered investment companies. House Bill 4086 and 4087. Source: Michigan legislation website. Security procedures for the crypto holdings include exclusive government control over private keys, end-to-end encryption of all data, and the prohibition of access via smartphones. Michigan-owned digital assets’ information will be stored in secure data centers in different locations within the state. At the same time, transactions would require multiparty authorization, in addition to regular independent security audits. The bill allows the state to loan out crypto to generate additional revenue, provided that such activity does not increase exposure to financial risk. House Bill 4086 , which was also introduced during the same month by Representatives Alabas Farhat, Ron Robinson, and Bryan Posthumus, would create the office of a Michigan bullion depository within the Department of Treasury. Opposition from state Bitcoin Trade Council The Michigan Bitcoin Trade Council, a local advocacy group for Bitcoin adoption, is opposing House Bill 4087 for lacking a “clear market capitalization” threshold to restrict the reserve exclusively to Bitcoin. Representatives who forwarded the proposal did not specify which digital assets will be acquired and kept. Without such a safeguard, the council argues, the state could invest in smaller, more speculative cryptos that are centralized and prone to collapse, which could expose Michigan’s finances to unnecessary volatility. “The idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve is an interesting one, but it must be crafted very carefully,” the group stated. “Other cryptocurrencies will attempt to use the state as a piggy bank to prop up risky projects that are doomed to fail.” The council insists Bitcoin is the only digital asset with a proven track record of stability and security, and the “sole instrument that would be prudent for a state-level reserve.” Strategic crypto reserve talks in American states grow Michigan’s crypto reserve bill comes on the backdrop of legislative conversations around crypto reserves in the United States. According to Bitcoin Laws, Michigan joins Massachusetts and Ohio as states where similar proposals have reached the committee stage. Some states like New Hampshire, Arizona, and Texas have already enacted laws that authorized their treasurers to invest in Bitcoin and other crypto assets. However, other states have not been as receptive, as Bitcoin reserve bills have been rejected in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania. 46 states have been part of the discussion so far, but aside from the 3 aforementioned jurisdictions, only 17 are in the “pending” column, according to figures from Bitcoin Reserve Monitor. Earlier this month, the US Congress moved forward with an appropriations bill that had sections asking the Treasury Department to determine the feasibility and governance of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

They are preparing to issue a substantial $200 million in tokenized products on the Stellar network. This bold move highlights a growing trend where traditional assets are transformed into digital tokens, opening up new investment avenues for a broader audience. It is a clear signal that the future of finance is becoming increasingly decentralized and accessible. What Are These Revolutionary Tokenized Products on Stellar? Mercado Bitcoin’s decision to leverage the Stellar network for these tokenized products is strategic. Stellar is known for its fast transaction speeds, low costs, and robust scalability, making it an ideal platform for issuing and managing a wide array of digital assets. These tokenized products are essentially digital representations of real-world assets, such as stocks, bonds, or even real estate, that exist on a blockchain. The exchange aims to democratize access to investments that might otherwise be out of reach for many. By tokenizing these assets, Mercado Bitcoin can offer fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy a small piece of a high-value asset. This approach reduces the entry barrier, enabling more individuals to participate in markets previously dominated by institutional players. Mercado Bitcoin’s Broader Strategy: Expanding Tokenized Products Across Blockchains This announcement is not an isolated event. It follows a separate, equally ambitious plan revealed in July. Mercado Bitcoin had previously announced its intention to place another $200 million in real-world assets , including tokenized stocks and bonds, on the XRP Ledger. This dual-blockchain strategy underscores the exchange’s commitment to exploring multiple robust platforms for its digital offerings. The move onto both Stellar and the XRP Ledger showcases a versatile approach to asset tokenization. It demonstrates Mercado Bitcoin’s ambition to become a leading player in the global tokenized economy. By diversifying its blockchain infrastructure, the exchange can cater to different types of assets and investor preferences, ensuring a broad and resilient ecosystem for its tokenized products . The Tremendous Advantages of Investing in Tokenized Products The rise of tokenized products brings several compelling benefits to the financial landscape: Increased Accessibility: Investors can access a wider range of assets, often with lower minimum investment requirements. Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenized assets can be traded 24/7 on global markets, potentially increasing their liquidity compared to traditional assets. Greater Transparency: All transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent ledger. Fractional Ownership: High-value assets can be divided into smaller, more affordable units, making them accessible to more investors. Reduced Intermediaries: The blockchain infrastructure can streamline processes, potentially reducing fees and speeding up transactions. These advantages collectively aim to make investing more efficient, transparent, and inclusive for everyone. What Challenges Await Tokenized Products? While the potential for tokenized products is immense, it is also important to consider the challenges. Regulatory frameworks for digital assets are still evolving globally, which can create uncertainty. Market adoption also requires significant education, as many potential investors are still unfamiliar with blockchain technology and its applications. Furthermore, security remains a paramount concern in the digital realm. Ensuring the integrity of smart contracts and protecting against cyber threats are ongoing priorities for platforms issuing these assets. However, as the ecosystem matures, these challenges are being actively addressed by industry leaders and regulators, paving the way for a more secure and standardized future for digital assets. Mercado Bitcoin’s proactive steps are setting a precedent in the Latin American market and beyond. Their commitment to expanding the availability of tokenized products on robust networks like Stellar is a testament to the transformative power of blockchain technology. This initiative is not merely about creating digital assets; it is about reshaping how we perceive and interact with value in the digital age. In essence, Mercado Bitcoin is at the forefront of a financial revolution, making sophisticated investment opportunities more accessible and efficient. The integration of real-world assets into blockchain ecosystems promises a future where financial inclusion is not just a concept, but a tangible reality for millions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are tokenized products?

A3: The primary benefit for investors is increased accessibility. Tokenized products allow for fractional ownership and lower investment minimums, enabling more people to invest in assets that were traditionally out of reach. Q4: How does this move by Mercado Bitcoin impact the traditional financial market? A4: This move signifies a convergence of traditional finance with blockchain technology. It pushes for greater transparency, efficiency, and inclusivity in financial markets, potentially disrupting traditional investment models by making assets more liquid and accessible globally. Q5: Are tokenized products safe to invest in? A5: While tokenized products offer many advantages, like any investment, they carry risks.

A significant development is underway that could reshape investment in the Solana ecosystem. A former Pantera Capital partner is establishing Solmate, a substantial Solana-focused treasury worth $300 million right in the heart of the UAE. This move highlights a growing institutional interest in Solana and its potential. What is Solmate’s Solana-Focused Treasury All About? Solmate, the new entity, is set to become a major player in the digital asset investment landscape. Spearheaded by a seasoned veteran from Pantera Capital, this initiative aims to strategically deploy $300 million into projects built on the Solana blockchain. The treasury will primarily target investments within the Solana ecosystem. This includes decentralized applications (dApps), infrastructure projects, and promising new protocols. The goal is to foster innovation and growth, providing crucial capital to developers and entrepreneurs. This dedicated fund signals strong confidence in Solana’s technological capabilities and its long-term viability as a leading blockchain platform. It represents a strategic allocation of capital designed to maximize returns by focusing on a specific, high-potential sector of the crypto market. Why the UAE and Why Solana? The choice of the United Arab Emirates as the base for this new Solana-focused treasury is not coincidental. The UAE has rapidly emerged as a global hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation, attracting talent and capital with its progressive regulations and supportive environment. The UAE offers a clear regulatory framework, which provides certainty for large-scale crypto investments. Its strategic geographical location bridges Eastern and Western markets, enhancing global reach. Solana, on the other hand, is renowned for its high throughput, low transaction costs, and scalability, making it an attractive blockchain for developers and investors alike. The combination of a crypto-friendly jurisdiction and a high-performance blockchain creates a powerful synergy. This setup positions Solmate to capitalize on both regional growth and Solana’s technological advantages, aiming for substantial returns. What Benefits Could This Solana-Focused Treasury Bring? The launch of a $300 million Solana-focused treasury is expected to have a ripple effect across the entire Solana ecosystem. The influx of capital can accelerate development, enhance liquidity, and attract more talent to the network. Key benefits include: Increased Innovation: Funding for cutting-edge projects can lead to new applications and services. Ecosystem Growth: Strengthens Solana’s position against competitors by fostering a robust developer community. Market Confidence: A large institutional investment signals legitimacy and stability to the broader market. Job Creation: New projects often lead to new roles in technology, finance, and marketing. Moreover, this initiative could serve as a blueprint for other institutional investors looking to enter the digital asset space with a focused strategy. It demonstrates a sophisticated approach to crypto investment, moving beyond simple token speculation. Are There Any Challenges or Future Prospects? While the prospects are exciting, any large-scale investment comes with its own set of challenges. Market volatility, regulatory changes, and competition from other blockchains are factors that Solmate will need to navigate. However, the expertise of a former Pantera Capital partner suggests a well-thought-out strategy to mitigate these risks. Looking ahead, this Solana-focused treasury could catalyze further institutional adoption of Solana. If successful, it might encourage other traditional finance players to establish similar dedicated funds, driving more capital into specific blockchain ecosystems. This trend could lead to a more mature and diversified crypto investment landscape globally. The establishment of Solmate’s $300 million Solana-focused treasury in the UAE marks a significant milestone for both the Solana blockchain and the broader cryptocurrency investment community. It underscores the growing confidence in digital assets as a legitimate and profitable investment class, especially when backed by strategic, focused capital. This venture is poised to fuel innovation and accelerate the development of the Solana ecosystem, cementing its place as a key player in the future of decentralized finance.

This update aims to fix a flaw discovered in its advanced driver assistance technology in around 40% of the SU7 electric sedans it sold. To completely address this issue, the tech company, popularly known for its smartphone and electric vehicles manufacturing, will recall approximately 116,800 standard versions of the SU7. Notably, almost all these vehicles were manufactured between February 6, 2024, and August 30, 2025. However, like most tech systems, the car’s driver assist system has a defect. In a notice posted on the State Administration for Market Regulation’s website on Friday, September 19, the regulator pointed out that there is a likelihood that the system might not effectively detect and alert drivers in the event of a crisis. This has raised worries as it could lead to serious accidents if drivers do not regain vehicle control. Xiaomi’s SU7 sedan encounters a tragic accident amid a tech defect On March 28, 2024, Xiaomi launched the Xiaomi SU7 , its first EV model . In July this year, the tech company sold out about 305,055 SU7 models. During its sale, people noticed that the standard version did not come with lidars, a sensing technology that helps vehicles to observe the surroundings and offer extra safety accurately. Following this, recent reports revealed that Xiaomi’s stock in Hong Kong drastically decreased close to 2% but later rebounded, ending the day down by 1.1%. The shares, however, have surged by 64% since the beginning of the year. Gary Tan, a fund manager at Allspring Global Investments LLC, commented on the topic of discussion. He said the market response to the situation was calm because EV buyers do not consider assisted driving a crucial selling feature for the SU7. This is because in the Chinese competitive electric vehicle market, its consumers view assisted driving features as more of a “nice-to-have” rather than an essential factor. Concerning Xiaomi’s recall, the event happened about six months after a fatal accident involving a regular SU7 sedan with its autopilot feature activated, which led to three fatalities. This incident triggered the Chinese authorities to restrict the use of advanced driver assistance technology and engage themselves in assessing EV designs of other parts, including door handles that are set back into the body. To illustrate the seriousness of the situation, reliable sources have highlighted that Beijing is currently establishing regulations that clearly detail what driver-assist technologies are allowed and not allowed to do. Tech analysts urge companies to take measures into account of a rising issue In its official EV Weibo account, Xiaomi mentioned that its upcoming over-the-air update will focus on strategies to improve how its vehicles adjust their driving speed in the case of a tricky situation, such as nighttime driving or rain. However, Kelvin Lau, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets (Hong Kong) Ltd., urged that a physical recall may not be a suitable solution to fix the problem. According to him, the problem can be fixed remotely. The analyst made this remark after pointing out that the issue was not mechanical and the cost was low. In the meantime, it is worth noting that apart from Xiaomi, other car manufacturers have had similar recalls, according to reports from analysts led by Steven Leung, an executive director at UOB Kay Hian Hong Kong Ltd. Based on their analysis, they stressed that tech companies should resolve rising issues before any tragic accident occurs. Despite the recent issues, Xiaomi revealed plans to take on Tesla and BYD in the European EV market by 2027. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , this came after an increase in sales in Q2 2025. Xiaomi’s President, Lu Weibing, said the firm’s business model in China could be applied globally, including in Europe. According to President Lu , the company’s quarterly revenue rose by over 30%, leading to its second EV’s stellar performance, which was launched during the summer. He said that this helped counter dwindling smartphone demand. Still, Lu pointed out that the firm was still researching European expansion to prepare for the 2027 entry. Xiaomi delivered more than 81K cars in Q2 2025 to set a new quarterly record; however, it is still struggling to meet the local demand.

Aster’s token gained listing on Binance Alpha within hours of launch, while the platform expanded perpetual trading offerings with up to 50x leverage across four new assets. A significant first step for $ASTER on BNB Chain. • $345M traded in 24h • Price reached $0.528 (~1,650%) • 330K new wallets joined • TVL $660M → $1.005B • Platform volume near $1.5B Thanks to our community for the trust and support.

The platform has also enabled spot withdrawals, previously scheduled for October, via BNB Chain with 30-second processing times. It has also implemented multi-dimensional scoring in its Genesis Stage 2 program to reward smart traders beyond volume metrics. Current metrics position Aster as a serious Hyperliquid competitor, with total users reaching 1.848 million and 7-day new user additions hitting 617,379. At the time of writing, platform data reveals $449.8 million in total TVL, $517.2 trillion in cumulative trading volume, and 695,559 total traders. Source: Dune Daily metrics show 53,332 new users, $1.53 billion in 24-hour trading volume, and $466,838 in daily income. The platform’s liquidity pools maintain substantial holdings, including $275.7 million in asBNB TVL and $41.2 million in USDF TVL. Open interest also reached $255.3 million while maintaining competitive APY rates of 25.79% on BSC and 21.28% on Arbitrum. Platform income metrics show $49.2 million in total earnings with consistent growth patterns across weekly and monthly timeframes. Source: Dune Technical Architecture Positions Aster as Hyperliquid Challenger Aster’s multi-chain approach differentiates it from Hyperliquid’s single Layer 1 strategy. The protocol offers native support across BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, and Arbitrum without requiring bridging or asset conversions. The platform combines Simple Mode for MEV-free one-click trades with Pro Mode featuring advanced tools, including hidden orders, grid trading, and professional order books. It also introduces unique stock perpetual contracts enabling 24/7 trading of major US equities like Tesla and Nvidia, fully settled in crypto. This feature particularly makes it powerful, as it expands beyond traditional crypto derivatives, potentially attracting traditional finance users. 10 reasons $ASTER will flip Hyperliquid: 1) The only DEX with 24/7 US stock perps 2) Yield Bearing margin: $USDF is native and functions similar to USDe, with additional yield based on activity 3) CZ doesn't tolerate competitors and historically has neutralized all competition… — Dr. Shin Geon-yeong (神建永), Ph.D. (@asparagoid) September 18, 2025 Additionally, it has a hidden order functionality that addresses concerns CZ previously raised about trader manipulation on transparent order books. Aster also leverages zero-knowledge proofs on its dedicated Aster Chain for confidential trade validation, while integrating Pyth Network oracles for tamper-resistant pricing data. The platform’s capital efficiency features include liquid staking through collateral tokens like asBNB and USDF, enabling users to generate yields while trading. Source: Dune Community ownership also exceeds 50% of the token supply through rewards, governance participation, and buyback programs. Current trading data reveals sophisticated user behavior with top traders already achieving realized profits exceeding $645,000 . The platform maintains deep liquidity across trading pairs while processing substantial daily volumes comparable to established centralized exchanges. Market Position Against Hyperliquid’s Dominance Hyperliquid’s August performance established incredible benchmarks with $106 million in revenue, $383 billion monthly trading volume, and $1.25 billion annualized revenue while capturing 70% of the DeFi perpetuals market share. The platform operates with just 11 employees, processing $330.8 billion annually, creating efficiency ratios surpassing traditional payment giants like PayPal and Visa. Hyperliquid smashes revenue record with $106M in August, dominating 70% of the DeFi perps market as lean 11-employee team outperforms financial giants. #HyperLiquid #DeFi https://t.co/EsYDUloLz8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 2, 2025 However, Aster’s current trajectory suggests potential for rapid market share capture, particularly given CZ’s track record with previously backed projects. MYX Finance, another CZ-supported DEX, delivered 1000% returns in three days, while BNB surged from $0.09 to a new ATH of over $1000 under his leadership. Analysts project potential 10x rallies for ASTER, citing the current $1.5 billion FDV compared to Hyperliquid’s $55 billion valuation. The competitive landscape is further intensifying as both platforms target institutional adoption. Hyperliquid secured Anchorage Digital Bank custody services and Circle’s native USDC deployment. It has also recently closed Native Markets for its USDH stablecoin . However, Aster’s multi-chain strategy and traditional asset integration could capture market segments unavailable to Hyperliquid’s specialized approach. The platform’s community-driven token distribution and governance model also greatly differentiates it from Hyperliquid’s more centralized structure.

The REX-Osprey ETF (XRPR), a collaboration between REX Shares and Osprey Funds, went live on the Cboe BZX Exchange on September 18. Explosive First Day Volumes XRPR was a fast gainer from the word go, with the product raking in $24 million in volume within its first hour and a half on the market. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the figure is way more than he had expected. He explained that it was up to five times higher than the first-day totals of any XRP futures ETF. The same can be said about its counterpart, the Dogecoin-tracking REX-Osprey DOGE ETF (DOJE), which debuted on the same day. On Thursday, Balchunas initially projected that it would likely reach about $2.5 million in daily volume, calling that a decent but unremarkable figure. However, within the first hour of it going live, trading activity surged to nearly $6 million. “That’s shockingly solid,” he commented , adding that most ETFs see less than $1 million on their opening day. Greg King, CEO of the company, said in a statement that investors view ETFs as tools for trading and access, noting that the “digital asset revolution is already underway.” He added that they are proud to offer exposure to popular digital assets within the protections of the U.S. ’40 Act ETF framework, a goal it has worked diligently to achieve. Unique Spot Crypto ETFs REX Shares and Osprey Funds operate independently but work together strategically to launch spot crypto ETFs. Their latest filings stand out because they were submitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a federal law that governs pooled investment funds and is designed to protect investors from conflicts of interest and fraud. This approach is different from the legal framework used by most existing crypto-linked ETFs. The XRPR fund is set up similarly to the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF launched in June, using specific legal methods to operate under U.S. regulations. The Solana fund was the first in the country to track SOL prices and also offer staking rewards. In another related development, the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also gave a go-ahead to the first multi-asset crypto ETF that gives investors exposure to the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index. Grayscale’s Digital Large-Cap Fund (GDLC) was officially approved for listing and trading on September 18, following a previous stay order by the agency that had delayed its debut. Elsewhere, the financial watchdog made the ETF listing process easier for issuers by adopting generic registration standards that remove the long 19 (B) filing process.

A truly momentous event is unfolding as Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) makes its highly anticipated transition into a spot crypto exchange-traded fund. This isn’t just a name change; it’s a pivotal moment for the broader cryptocurrency market, bringing a new era of accessibility and institutional participation through the Grayscale ETF . What’s Happening with the Grayscale ETF Conversion? Tomorrow marks a historic day for Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). This existing spot crypto basket is officially scheduled to begin trading under its new identity: the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto5 ETF. This exciting development comes directly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave its stamp of approval to Grayscale’s application for this conversion. As Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted, this move has been keenly watched. The approval and subsequent launch underscore a growing acceptance of crypto-backed financial products within traditional markets. For investors, this conversion of the Grayscale ETF represents a more streamlined and regulated way to gain exposure to a diversified basket of large-cap digital assets. Why is the Grayscale ETF a Game-Changer for Investors? The conversion of GDLC into a Grayscale ETF offers several compelling benefits, fundamentally changing how investors can access the crypto market. Firstly, ETFs are known for their ease of trading. They can be bought and sold on traditional stock exchanges, just like company shares, making them incredibly accessible to a wider range of investors who might be hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. Consider these key advantages: Enhanced Accessibility: Investors can gain exposure to a diversified crypto portfolio without needing to set up crypto wallets or manage private keys. Increased Liquidity: Trading on major exchanges typically means higher liquidity, allowing for easier entry and exit points. Regulatory Oversight: As an SEC-approved product, the Grayscale ETF operates under a regulated framework, potentially offering greater investor protection and confidence. Diversification: The Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto5 ETF tracks a basket of large-cap cryptocurrencies, offering immediate diversification rather than exposure to a single asset. This development is a strong indicator of the maturation of the digital asset space. It signals a bridge between the innovative world of crypto and the established financial system. Navigating the New Grayscale ETF Landscape While the launch of the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto5 ETF brings exciting opportunities, it’s also important for investors to understand its implications. The shift from a closed-end fund structure (GDLC) to an open-ended ETF means that the fund’s shares can now be created and redeemed daily. This mechanism helps keep the ETF’s market price closely aligned with the net asset value (NAV) of its underlying holdings. Historically, closed-end funds like GDLC could trade at significant premiums or discounts to their NAV. The ETF structure is designed to mitigate these discrepancies, providing a more efficient pricing mechanism. This change offers a more transparent and potentially less volatile investment experience for those looking to invest in a Grayscale ETF . What’s Next for Crypto ETFs and Grayscale? The successful conversion and launch of the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto5 ETF could pave the way for similar transformations of other Grayscale products. It also sets a precedent for how existing crypto investment vehicles might evolve to meet market demand for regulated, accessible products. The increasing number of spot crypto ETFs, including this new Grayscale ETF , reflects a growing institutional appetite for digital assets. This trend suggests a future where cryptocurrency investing becomes an even more integrated part of mainstream financial portfolios. As regulatory clarity continues to improve, we can anticipate further innovation and expansion in the crypto ETF landscape, offering investors diverse options to participate in the digital economy. The launch of the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto5 ETF is more than just a new product; it’s a testament to the persistent efforts to bring digital assets into the mainstream financial fold. By offering a regulated, accessible, and diversified investment vehicle, Grayscale is not only expanding opportunities for investors but also reinforcing the legitimacy and staying power of the crypto market. This momentous step truly reshapes the investment landscape, making it easier for a broader audience to engage with the exciting potential of cryptocurrencies through a trusted Grayscale ETF . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto5 ETF? The Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto5 ETF is the new name and structure for Grayscale’s former Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). It’s a spot crypto basket that holds a diversified portfolio of large-cap digital assets, now trading as an exchange-traded fund. When will the Grayscale ETF begin trading? The Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto5 ETF is scheduled to begin trading tomorrow, following its approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). How does an ETF differ from the previous GDLC fund? As an ETF, the fund’s shares can be created and redeemed daily, which helps keep its market price closely aligned with the value of its underlying assets. The previous GDLC fund was a closed-end fund that could trade at significant premiums or discounts to its net asset value. What are the benefits of investing in the Grayscale ETF? Benefits include enhanced accessibility (trading on traditional exchanges), increased liquidity, regulatory oversight by the SEC, and immediate diversification into a basket of large-cap cryptocurrencies. Is the Grayscale ETF suitable for all investors? While the Grayscale ETF offers a regulated and accessible way to invest in crypto, all investments carry risks. Investors should conduct their own research and consider their financial goals and risk tolerance before investing in any ETF, including this Grayscale ETF . Did you find this article informative?

Bloomberg Analyst Comments!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/first-day-data-for-us-dogecoin-doge-and-xrp-etfs-arrives-bloomberg-analyst-comments/,"A historic development took place in the cryptocurrency market, with spot ETFs directly tracking the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP starting trading in the US for the first time yesterday. Products launched in collaboration with REX Shares and Osprey Funds include the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) and the REX-Osprey DOGE ETF (DOJE). These two funds offer spot-based access to the two assets, allowing investors to invest directly in DOGE and XRP via the exchange. XRP and DOGE Exceed Expectations! Investors flocked to the first Dogecoin and XRP exchange-traded funds in the US, as these ETFs were long-awaited, exceeding analysts' trading volume expectations. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) reached $37.7 million in volume on its first day of trading, while the DOGE ETF reached $17 million. “The XRP ETF XRPR reached $37.7 million in first-day trading volume, surpassing IVES for the largest first-day volume for any launch in 2025. DOJE didn't perform badly at all, with a trading volume of $17 million among 710 launches, which would rank in the top 5 of the year. XRPR and DOJE were among the best performing ETFs launched this year.” Eric Balchunas said that the XRP and DOGE ETF inflows are a positive signal for altcoin ETFs to be approved in the near future. He had kept expectations low! Balchunas said before the ETFs were launched that he expected the REX-Osprey DOGE ETF (DOJE) to reach a volume of $2.5 million on the first day, which would be a significant figure but “not something very special.” However, Balchunas later said that his expectations were shattered in the first hour of trading, as the DOGE ETF's volume approached $6 million. “This is surprisingly strong and exceeded my expectations. Most ETFs trade below $1 million on the first day,” the analyst said. Balcuhasn had also kept his expectations low for XRP. At this point, the analyst said that XRPR achieved $24 million in volume in the first hour and a half of its launch, marking a very fast start. “Much more than I thought. For context, XRPR saw 5x more volume on its first day than XRP futures ETFs did on their first day, and it did so in just 90 minutes.” https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1968794374285725826 *This is not investment advice.

The round was co-led by ZKsync, its foundational technology partner, along with Further Ventures, EigenCloud (formerly EigenLayer) and 500 Global, the company announced via email on Thursday. Built on the ZKsync Validium L2, Grvt uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to ensure transactions inherit Ethereum-level security while keeping trade details private and settlement costs low. The company says this architecture addresses long-standing barriers to mainstream adoption of on-chain finance: privacy, scalability and accessibility. ZK technology is a cryptographic method in which one party can demonstrate to another that a certain piece of information is true, without revealing anything about said information. This is an important facet of blockchain-based finance as it allows users to verify transactions and transfers without revealing anything about the sender, receiver, amount. “Privacy is uncompromising for the future of on-chain trading and investing,” said co-founder and CEO Hong Yea, adding that Grvt aims to set the standard for how zero-knowledge cryptography powers financial markets. The raise comes amid a resurgence in Ethereum activity, with August’s on-chain volume topping $320 billion , its highest since mid-2021. Backers see Grvt as a potential liquidity hub for a trillion-dollar on-chain finance market, with applications spanning cross-exchange vaults, cross-chain interoperability, real-world assets, and structured options, according to the announcement.",Finance|Funding Rounds|Privacy|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ZK|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-19 09:50:41

All will be achieved through Stargate, a bridge service that connects over 80 blockchains. LayerZero, which acquired Stargate last month, used its Hydra model to expand $PYUSD to these nine networks. With crypto adoption accelerating, now’s a prime time to buy $BEST . As the native token of Best Wallet , it’s a great way to stay ahead of this mainstream shift. PayPal Debuts Permissionless Version of $PYUSD Stablecoin Yesterday, LayerZero announced that $PYUSD will expand into a permissionless version dubbed $PYUSDO. It’ll be fully fungible with the original version and interoperable across multiple networks. Beyond Tron and Avalanche, the rollout covers Aptos, Abstract, Ink, Sei, and Stable. Existing permissionless versions on Berachain ($BBYUSD) and Flow ($USDF) will upgrade to $PYUSD0. ‘As the stablecoin market continues its rapid growth beyond $270B, innovations like this are essential for creating the seamless, interoperable financial infrastructure that users and developers demand.’ — David Weber, Head of Ecosystem, PayPal USD . In another update, PayPal also confirmed that $PYUSDY has launched on Stellar . This way, you can benefit from five-second transaction finality and easier dollar-denominated savings. Following these developments, $PYUSD has surpassed $1.3B in market capitalization for the first ever time.

Even more functions are on the way, including market intel analytics, an NFT gallery, and a rewards hub. Each of these new enhancements is powered by $BEST , the official Best Wallet Token. That’s because 25% of its total token supply is set aside for product development. $BEST also unlocks governance rights, reduces gas fees, and offers staking rewards at an 83% APY. Given its perks, it’s no wonder $BEST has nearly raised $16M on presale, backed by whales investing significant amounts of capital (including eye-boggling amounts of $70.2K , $50.9K , and $49.5K ). This is even more impressive when considering that you can currently buy $BEST for just $0.025665. To join the presale at this ultra-low price, you’ll want to act fast. After the new app developments launch, the token’s anticipated to spike to $0.072 by the end of the year. Check out our Best Wallet review for more information.

BTC Eyes $175K Before Catastrophic 80% Drop,https://cryptopotato.com/boom-then-bust-btc-eyes-175k-before-catastrophic-80-drop/,"TL;DR Bitcoin may climb to $175K before falling 70–80%, based on four past market cycles. $4.9T in expiring options today could bring sharp volatility across crypto and equities. Inverse head-and-shoulders pattern suggests a bounce from $112K could push BTC toward $130K. Bitcoin’s Past Cycles Show Repeated Deep Drops Bitcoin has seen major corrections after each bull market cycle. Data reviewed by market analyst EGRAG CRYPTO shows that in 2011, the cryptocurrency fell around 93% from its peak. In 2013, the drop was around 86%, followed by 84% in 2017, and roughly 77% in 2022 after the 2021 top. Notably, the average drawdown across these four cycles comes to around 85%. Based on this, EGRAG suggests a possible 70% to 80% decline in the next bear market. This is not guaranteed but is based on how Bitcoin has behaved over more than a decade of price history. According to EGRAG’s market model, BTC may still have room to move higher before any major correction begins. The chart shared projects a possible peak at around $175,000. This is once again based on price structures that have formed in previous cycles. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO/X If that high is reached, and a 70–80% pullback follows as in past cycles, Bitcoin could fall into the range of $35,000 to $52,000. Timing remains uncertain. The model shows that in previous cycles, peaks formed several months after similar patterns developed. $4.9 Trillion in Expiries Could Move Markets Around $4.9 trillion worth of stock and ETF options are set to expire today. This amount is more than 1.2 times the total crypto market cap. These large quarterly expiries, often called triple witching, have a history of driving sharp moves in both traditional and crypto markets. Crypto Rover noted that past expiries this year were followaed by clear market reactions. After the March 2025 expiry, Bitcoin dropped by about 17% over the next few weeks. The June expiry saw BTC fall below $100,000 shortly after. With the current expiry in play, some traders are preparing for increased volatility in the days ahead. TODAY, $4.9T in stock and ETF options expire. This is 1.2x the entire crypto market cap. Historically, these expirations trigger heavy volatility. March 2025 saw a crash weeks later, while June pushed $BTC below $100K. pic.twitter.com/Uox3DI4fEk — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) September 19, 2025 Technical Pattern Could Signal Short-Term Path Ali Martinez shared a chart that shows a potential inverse head-and-shoulders formation on Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart. The left shoulder formed in late August, the head in early September, and the right shoulder may be developing now. He noted that Bitcoin might dip to around $112,000–$113,000 before rebounding. He added that “a rally to $130,000” could follow if the price breaks above the $117,950 neckline. Key resistance levels to watch in that case are $121,000, $125,000, and $127,000. Source: Ali Martinez/X At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at around $116,800, with a slight 24-hour drop and a 7-day gain of 1%. Trading volume over the last day stood at $36.7 billion.

According to the police authority, the platform was allegedly involved in money laundering activities for criminal organizations. RCMP revealed that it was the first incident of dismantling a cryptocurrency exchange, citing that the exchange had been operating outside Canadian laws. The police statement showed that TradeOgre failed to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Canada (FINTRAC) as a money services business and ignored identity verification of its clients. Due to the lack of basic safeguards, investigators were led to believe the exchange was the preferred tool for criminal activities involving money laundering. RCMP action against TradeOgre highlights risks of unregulated crypto platforms Europol, a European Union law enforcement cooperation agency, alerted the Canadian police authority in June 2024 of suspicious activities connected to the TradeOgre platform, triggering the investigation. During the investigation, Canadian authorities were led to believe that TradeOgre’s anonymous behavior was the main lure for laundering operations by allowing new users without background or identity checks. According to the police authority statement, such features enabled users to hide the origin of funds, describing the technique as often used by organized crime groups. Investigators alleged that most of the transactions across the platform were related to criminal proceeds; hence, the seizure is pending further investigation. NEWS RELEASE 📰 The largest cryptocurrency seizure in Canadian history has just taken place. An estimated sum of 56 million dollars was recovered from the illegal platform Tradeogre. ➡️ https://t.co/zr7B3Qr67I pic.twitter.com/p0aDDP35dc — Quebec RCMP (@rcmpqc) September 18, 2025 The RCMP online post confirmed that the seizure was carried out by the RCMP Federal Policing Eastern Region, which investigators from the financial crime department supported. The RCMP revealed that dismantling the exchange was a step forward in disrupting criminal organizations using digital platforms to move illicit funds. The TradeOgre platform posted a warning message informing its users of the seizure by Canadian police authorities. As of now, investigations remain ongoing with a possible indictment along the way. The police confirmed that the operation has shed more light on the activities of the criminal networks exploiting unregulated exchanges. It also urged the public to share any information related to illegal activities with the authorities, with direct contacts available through dedicated hotlines or local police departments. Cryptocurrency exchanges are required to register with FINTRAC and enforce Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements to comply with Canadian laws. According to the authorities, such measures are critical to preventing virtual assets from being misused for laundering schemes. TradeOgre will therefore remain inactive pending further investigations. Global authorities target digital assets’ criminal activities The latest dismantling of TradeOgre’s exchange mimics the wider trend of law enforcement agencies targeting criminal organizations worldwide involved in financial crimes via digital assets. Cryptopolitan recently reported a similar case in which the Taiwan authorities indicted 14 individuals involved in a major cryptocurrency fraud valued at approximately $75 million. The report showed that the group led by Shi Qiren operated more than 40 franchise outlets under the umbrella of CoinW and BiXiang Technology Co, Ltd, which lured over 1500 victims into false investments. The scheme was initiated last year when the group began channelling funds through unlicensed money service providers. The Taiwan police were able to seize cash and digital assets, including $1.97 million and 640,000 USDT tokens. They were also able to seize luxury vehicles and another $3.25 million. The Taiwan police insisted that the case should serve as a warning to future actors and restore investor confidence. RCMP demonstrated their ability to target not just individuals but also infrastructures used in financial crime. Such incidents of laundering activities via unlicensed crypto exchanges show how gaps in regulatory frameworks and compliance may affect the success of fraudulent activities. Therefore, law enforcement is expected to evolve in the scope of its efforts to target online infrastructures used by criminals. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Recently, South Korean crypto giant Upbit made a pivotal announcement: a temporary Upbit IQ suspension for deposits and withdrawals. This move, set to begin at 3:00 a.m. UTC on September 24, is in direct support of a crucial network transition for the IQ token. For many users, understanding the implications of such an event is paramount to managing their digital assets effectively. Understanding the Upbit IQ Suspension and Its Timing Upbit’s decision to implement a temporary Upbit IQ suspension is a proactive step to facilitate a significant network upgrade for the IQ token. This means that starting on September 24 at 3:00 a.m. UTC, users will temporarily be unable to deposit or withdraw IQ tokens from the Upbit platform. It’s vital to recognize that such suspensions are not uncommon in the fast-paced crypto landscape, often preceding major technological advancements for a token. Network transitions are fundamental to the long-term health and performance of any blockchain project. They typically involve upgrading the underlying protocol to introduce new features, improve scalability, enhance security, or optimize transaction speeds. While these upgrades are ultimately beneficial, they require careful coordination, and exchanges like Upbit play a crucial role in ensuring a smooth transition by pausing related services. Why This IQ Network Transition Matters for Users You might be wondering, ""Why is this temporary halt necessary?"" The answer lies in the technical complexities of blockchain networks. Imagine a major software update for your computer or phone; you wouldn’t want to be in the middle of a critical task when it happens. Similarly, pausing deposit and withdrawal services during an IQ network transition prevents potential issues such as: Loss of Funds: Transactions initiated during an unstable transition period could be lost or corrupted. Inaccurate Balances: Network changes can temporarily affect how balances are reflected, leading to confusion. System Instability: Attempting to process transactions on a network undergoing a significant upgrade can cause system errors for the exchange. By implementing the Upbit IQ suspension , the exchange is safeguarding user assets and ensuring that once the transition is complete, all IQ-related services will resume with enhanced stability and functionality. This proactive measure reflects Upbit’s commitment to providing a secure and reliable trading environment. Essential Actions for Upbit Users During the IQ Suspension For those holding IQ tokens on Upbit, or planning to interact with them, taking proactive steps before the September 24 deadline is essential. Here’s what you should consider: Manage Your Funds: If you need to deposit or withdraw IQ tokens, ensure these transactions are completed well before the 3:00 a.m. UTC cutoff on September 24. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Upbit regarding the progress of the network transition and the expected resumption of services. Upbit typically communicates updates through their official channels. Avoid Initiating Transactions: During the suspension period, refrain from attempting any IQ deposits or withdrawals, as they will likely fail and could lead to complications. This temporary Upbit IQ suspension is designed to be a brief inconvenience for a long-term gain. The exchange aims to minimize disruption while ensuring the integrity of the network upgrade. Patience and adherence to official guidelines will be key during this period. The Broader Impact: Security, Scalability, and the Future of IQ Beyond the immediate implications for Upbit users, this network transition signals a positive development for the IQ token itself. Such upgrades are often precursors to significant improvements that can boost a token’s utility, security, and scalability. An enhanced network can attract more developers, foster greater adoption, and ultimately contribute to the token’s value proposition. Exchanges like Upbit play a vital role in supporting these ecosystem-wide upgrades, acting as a bridge between token developers and their user base. Their decision to halt services for the Upbit IQ suspension underscores the collaborative effort required to maintain a robust and evolving cryptocurrency market. Users can anticipate a more resilient and potentially feature-rich IQ token experience post-transition. In conclusion, the temporary Upbit IQ suspension of deposits and withdrawals, effective September 24, is a necessary and proactive measure by Upbit to support a crucial network transition for the IQ token. While it requires a brief pause in service, this action is designed to ensure a seamless, secure, and enhanced experience for all users in the long run. Stay updated with Upbit’s official announcements and manage your IQ holdings accordingly to navigate this period smoothly. This strategic pause is an investment in the future stability and growth of the IQ ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Upbit IQ suspension?

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-and-xrp-gain-major-advantage-in-singapore-heres-the-latest/,"Singapore has moved decisively in recent years to modernize its financial infrastructure, prioritizing frameworks that encourage both innovation and compatibility with existing systems. Among the most important steps has been its adoption of ISO 20022 , the global messaging standard increasingly recognized as the foundation for the next generation of cross-border payments. Ripple and ISO 20022 SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a prominent crypto researcher, posted about this development in connection with Ripple. He shared an image stating that “Singapore’s alignment with ISO 20022, the same messaging standard supported by Ripple, facilitates interoperability that legacy systems like Swift have long dominated.” The post also highlighted that “Ripple achieves this with near-instant transactions, making it a potentially superior alternative for time-sensitive cross-border transfers.” This places Ripple directly within the conversation on interoperability and speed, reinforcing the case for XRP as a practical solution where established systems have limitations. SINGAPORE’S ALIGNMENT WITH ISO 20022 UNLOCKS INTEROPERABILITY WITH RIPPLE “Moreover, Singapore's alignment with ISO 20022, the same messaging standard supported by Ripple, facilitates interoperability that legacy systems like Swift have long dominated. However, Ripple… pic.twitter.com/4UhKyJyBJu — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 18, 2025 Why This Matters for Ripple and XRP ISO 20022 enables financial institutions to communicate with greater clarity and precision, reducing errors and improving settlement efficiency. SWIFT, the traditional intermediary for global payments, has long dominated this space but has faced criticism for slow and costly processes. Ripple’s support of the same standard means it can integrate with legacy networks while offering near-instant settlement as a competitive differentiator. This creates new momentum for XRP, which functions as a bridge asset within Ripple’s ecosystem. The ability to align with standards while surpassing them in speed gives the cryptocurrency a clearer role in addressing cross-border liquidity needs. The message shared by SMQKE reflects this opportunity, presenting Ripple’s approach as both forward-looking and firmly anchored in existing compliance structures. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Singapore’s Position in the Global Landscape Singapore’s adoption of ISO 20022 demonstrates its broader strategy of staying at the forefront of financial technology. By choosing a standard that Ripple already supports, the country provides a platform for faster settlement systems to prove their value under recognized regulatory and operational conditions. This positions Singapore as a hub where legacy institutions and newer technologies can interact seamlessly. The move also represents the increasing importance of jurisdictions that set clear rules for digital financial services. Singapore’s regulatory clarity reduces barriers for companies like Ripple to demonstrate their advantages, contrasting with regions where uncertainty still slows adoption. For XRP, this means an environment where its role as a liquidity solution in cross-border payments can gain further traction.

The spike followed a rush of buy orders across major exchanges and arrived alongside a broad pickup in spot trading volume, suggesting fresh capital inflows rather than short-covering. Analysts pointed to a softer dollar index and a string of upbeat economic data as possible contributors to the sudden burst of demand. At the same time, Ethereum held close to the $4,500 mark, showing relative calm despite the sharp moves in its larger peer. Attention is turning toward Friday’s batch of Solana contracts set to expire, a quarterly event that often stirs price swings as traders adjust positions or roll them forward. Open interest in those contracts has climbed to a five-month high, heightening expectations that tomorrow’s settlement could inject another round of volatility across leading digital assets. Bitcoin: The Digital Gold Rush of the 21st Century Born from the vision of the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin introduced a new kind of money that lives entirely online. Instead of being printed by governments, each coin exists as a line of code secured by a globe-spanning network of volunteers. Every movement of funds is recorded on a public digital ledger, making the system open for anyone to inspect and nearly impossible to falsify. This peer-to-peer design lets value travel as easily as an email, sparking interest from tech fans, investors, and people seeking an alternative to traditional cash. Picture a neighborhood where every resident keeps a copy of the community’s bookkeeping. When Alice sends a coin to Bob, everyone updates the ledger together, so no single authority can freeze accounts or quietly change the records. New entries are added by “miners” who bundle recent payments into blocks and earn freshly minted coins for their effort. Over time the reward shrinks by half, limiting total supply to 21 million coins and inviting comparisons to scarce assets such as gold. Ethereum: The Digital Engine Powering a New Wave of Online Activity Dreamed up in 2013 and launched two years later, Ethereum is an open network where coins called Ether keep the record straight instead of a single authority. Smart contracts—self-running bits of code—sit at its core, letting builders launch trading hubs, lending pools and countless other apps that run around the clock without middlemen. This first-mover advantage has made Ethereum the busiest playground in the blockchain world. Flexibility sets the chain apart. Fresh tokens, labeled ERC-20, are spun up daily for voting, paying fees or storing value, yet every action is still paid for with Ether. To keep crowds moving, helper networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon bundle or reroute transactions, trimming cost and wait times. The 2022 switch to a greener stake-based system cut power use sharply, and the coming “sharding” upgrade will slice the database into 64 easy-to-manage pieces, opening the door for more everyday computers to join the action. Solana’s Lightning Pace: Why the Fifth-Largest Coin Is Grabbing Headlines Born in 2017 from the vision of former Qualcomm and Dropbox engineer Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana set out to fix the sluggish feel of earlier blockchains. Its secret sauce is a rapid‐fire time-stamping system paired with energy-saving staking, letting the network settle more than 50,000 transactions every second at almost no cost. Since the mainnet-beta launch in 2020, thousands of apps, games, and finance tools have flocked to its rails, helped along by bridges that link Solana with other chains. The SOL token powers fees, voting, and in-app payments, and its market value of about $100 billion places it among the crypto elite. Price action has been just as speedy. A six-hundred-percent climb from mid-2021 to late-2024 pushed SOL to a record $263.83, eclipsing most rivals and fueling talk of an “Ethereum killer.” Fans cheer the low fees and swift confirmation times; critics point to past outages and security hiccups. Forecasts mirror this split mood: some models picture $500-plus by 2025, while a well-known fund sketches a slide under $10 by 2030. Competition is fierce, with Ethereum’s vast community, Cardano’s research-driven approach, Avalanche’s sub-nets, and others all courting the same developers. No More Losses From Crypto Volatility — Earn From It With Zexpire Crypto's greatest challenge has always been its volatility. Bitcoin can swing hundreds of dollars within hours — trading above $115,000 one day, plunging below $112,000 the next. For most traders, these swings mean painful losses. Zexpire turns that volatility into opportunity. No need to predict if the price will rise or fall: the platform reduces the trade to a binary choice: will Bitcoin stay within a set range today, or break out of it? Get it right, you win. Get it wrong, your loss is capped at the stake. No leverage. No margin calls. No liquidation spirals. Just a clear, fixed-risk play on the one thing crypto always delivers — volatility. $ZX Powers the Volatility Play Every prediction on Zexpire runs on $ZX, the platform's native token. It fuels the gameplay, and holders benefit from discounts, cashback, and governance rights. Zexpire is running an initial funding round, offering $ZX at $0.003, with prices stepping gradually to $0.025 before listing. The structure means early participants secure the lowest entry, while later buyers pay more as demand builds. Early participants also unlock perks including: 5% APR staking before TGE Cashback on gameplay losses Referral rewards and loyalty bonuses Exclusive airdrops and beta access Zexpire's tokenomics reinforce long-term value: 20% of platform fees are burned, while buybacks support price stability and scarcity. Gain Exclusive Access to Zexpire Why $ZX Could Be a Breakout Zexpire directly addresses one of traders' biggest frustrations: losing money to volatility. Instead of punishing them, volatility becomes the core play. Zexpire matches the market as it truly is: fast, wild, and unpredictable. That's why adoption potential is high: traders finally have a way to earn from volatility, not lose because of it. And because every play runs on $ZX, the demand grows with user activity. Fee burns and buybacks tighten supply, while the seed stage offers the lowest price — all this forms a setup for exponential $ZX growth if adoption accelerates. Buy $ZX now before its value explodes Conclusion BTC holds its new ground above 117,000 dollars and keeps trading close to session highs. ETH stays calm near the 4,500 mark, showing a steady tone. SOL waits on the edge as expiry contracts come due, with traders eyeing a possible spike in flow. The trio keeps the broader market mood upbeat and signals that demand for major coins remains strong. The upbeat tape is good, but Zexpire offers a fresh angle on the same story. The platform lets users pick one simple path each day: will BTC stay inside a set range or break out. Losses stop at the entry cost, with no calls for extra funds. Each move uses $ZX, the native token that also gives fee cuts and routine buybacks. Buying $ZX now brings early access to a token wired for constant demand, and this represents a promising opportunity too.

The platform already offers trading in 34 digital assets, serving retail and institutional investors. Further, the exchange posted A$35.3 million revenue in the 12 months to June, nearly double the previous year. The acquisition deal follows an extensive assessment of the crypto exchange industry, IG Group said in an official statement . “This acquisition marks an important step in IG’s crypto strategy in a key region,” Matt Macklin, IG’s Managing Director, noted. “Independent Reserve is one of Australia’s largest and fastest-growing digital asset exchanges with established regulatory foundations, proven technology and strong leadership. I am delighted that the Independent Reserve team will join IG as they embark on their next phase of growth.” IG to Initially Acquire 70% of Independent Reserve The company noted that it will initially acquire 70% of the Aussie-based company, with the option to buy the remaining 30% based on the performance in the financial year 2027 and 2028. “Completion is subject to regulatory approvals from MAS in Singapore and FIRB in Australia and currently expected in early 2026,” the release read. Further, the deal is expected to be accretive to cash earnings per share in the first full financial year post-closing. In June, IG Group became the first UK-listed company to let UK retail investors trade BTC, ETH, XRP, and 35 other tokens. Under the new offering, the company’s retail clients will be able to trade 38 cryptocurrencies via a partnership with crypto platform, Uphold. Besides, effective 2026, the UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen oversight in the digital asset sector.

He has advocated for the establishment of a national-level Bitcoin mining facility, signaling a bold step into the digital economy. This move, as reported by Bitcoin Historian, suggests Armenia is keenly observing the potential of blockchain technology and its flagship asset, Bitcoin. Armenia’s Bold Vision: Pioneering National Bitcoin Mining Prime Minister Pashinyan’s proposal isn’t just about individual entrepreneurs mining crypto; it’s about a strategic, state-backed initiative. Imagine a country leveraging its resources to participate directly in the global digital asset landscape. This vision aims to position Armenia as a forward-thinking nation ready to embrace the future of finance. The call for a national Bitcoin mining facility underscores a growing trend among nations to explore new avenues for economic growth and technological advancement. It represents a potential shift in how countries view and interact with decentralized technologies, opening up unprecedented opportunities. Why National-Level Bitcoin Mining? Exploring the Potential What drives a nation to consider such a large-scale venture into Bitcoin mining ? The reasons are multifaceted and compelling: Economic Boost: A national facility could attract foreign investment, create jobs, and generate revenue through mining operations. It positions the country within the burgeoning digital economy. Energy Utilization: Countries with abundant and underutilized energy resources, especially renewable ones, can convert this surplus into a valuable digital asset. This can turn a cost into a profit center. Technological Hub: Investing in large-scale mining infrastructure fosters technological development and expertise within the nation. This can lead to innovation in related fields like data centers and AI. National Influence: By participating directly in the network, a nation gains a stake in the global decentralized financial system. This could enhance its geopolitical standing in the digital realm. Such an initiative could provide a stable and predictable revenue stream, diversifying the national economy beyond traditional sectors. Moreover, it signifies a commitment to digital transformation and future-proofing. Navigating the Challenges of Large-Scale Bitcoin Mining While the potential benefits are significant, establishing a national Bitcoin mining operation comes with its own set of challenges. These are crucial considerations for any government: Energy Consumption: Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive. Ensuring a sustainable and affordable power supply without impacting national grids or environmental goals is paramount. Regulatory Framework: Developing clear and stable regulations for a state-backed crypto venture requires careful thought. This includes taxation, operational guidelines, and security protocols. Environmental Concerns: Addressing the carbon footprint associated with large-scale mining is vital. Utilizing renewable energy sources or carbon offsetting programs will be key to public acceptance and sustainability. Infrastructure Investment: The initial capital outlay for specialized hardware, cooling systems, and secure data centers can be substantial. This requires significant upfront investment and ongoing maintenance. These hurdles are not insurmountable, but they demand strategic planning and robust policy development. Governments must balance innovation with responsibility to ensure long-term success. Global Precedents: Lessons from Other Nations in Bitcoin Mining Armenia is not alone in exploring the potential of cryptocurrencies at a national level. Other countries have already ventured into this space, offering valuable lessons: El Salvador: Known for making Bitcoin legal tender, El Salvador is also utilizing geothermal energy for its own Bitcoin mining operations. This demonstrates a clear link between energy resources and digital asset generation. Kazakhstan: Previously a major hub for mining, Kazakhstan experienced both economic benefits and infrastructure strains due to the influx of miners. Its experience highlights the need for managed growth and robust energy policies. These examples show that while opportunities are vast, careful foresight and adaptive policies are essential for success. Armenia can learn from these experiences to build a resilient and beneficial national mining strategy, avoiding common pitfalls. In conclusion, Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s call for national-level Bitcoin mining is a significant statement of intent. It highlights a growing global recognition of digital assets as a transformative tool for national development. While the path ahead involves both immense opportunities and considerable challenges, a well-planned and strategically executed approach could position Armenia as a leader in the evolving digital economy. This initiative could truly be a game-changer, fostering innovation, attracting investment, and securing a unique position for the nation in the future of finance.

In partnership with Backed, Kraken is collaborating with Trust Wallet to integrate xStocks directly into one of the most widely used self-custody crypto wallets, bringing interoperable tokenized equities to over 200 million users across the world. Seamless access through Trust Wallet Trust Wallet’s intuitive, multi-chain design and global reach make it a natural platform for xStocks to integrate with. Soon, Trust Wallet users will be able to seamlessly buy 60 different xStocks using a range of fiat local currencies. In addition, Trust Wallet users will be able to deposit and withdraw xStocks from popular crypto exchanges, including Kraken, across a wide range of blockchains including Solana, BNB Chain, TRON and Ethereum. As part of the integration, Backed will continue to issue xStocks as fully collateralized, on-chain tokens, maintaining strict 1:1 backing for each tokenized equity that a Trust Wallet user purchases. Trust Wallet’s user-friendly interface and expansive ecosystem support will ensure that tokenized equities are easily accessible for both retail investors and builders looking to incorporate them into DeFi and Web3 applications. Driving mass adoption of tokenized equities Arjun Sethi, Kraken co-CEO : “For xStocks to achieve true mass adoption, seamless integration with the world’s most popular self-custody wallets is vital. Bringing xStocks to Trust Wallet places open and interoperable tokenized equities directly into the hands of millions, alongside the crypto, stablecoins and DeFi assets they already use every day.” “This is more than integration — it’s a paradigm shift. We’re accelerating the move to a future where global markets operate without borders, without barriers, and with the same openness and accessibility as the internet itself.” Eowyn Chen, Trust Wallet CEO : “Trust Wallet has always been about unlocking access — not just to crypto, but to the future of global finance. By integrating xStocks, we’re bridging the gap between Web3 and traditional markets in a way that’s intuitive, borderless and user-first. This collaboration brings tokenized equities directly into the hands of millions, no brokerage account needed.” Adam Levi, Backed co-founder : “This is a monumental step in realizing our vision for universal access. As the standard for tokenized equities, xStocks should be available to individuals across whatever blockchain they choose, and having over 200 million users being able to access tokenized equities through Trust Wallet reaffirms its role as a public good.” Since launching in late June, xStocks have already surpassed $4 billion in combined CEX and DEX volume, underscoring strong market demand for this new asset class. Designed to meet users where they are, xStocks offer a transparent, open and borderless pathway to gain exposure to U.S. capital markets through tokenization. What’s next for xStocks Trust Wallet’s integration is the latest milestone in xStocks’ rapid expansion beyond the Kraken platform.

While these tokens have historically captured headlines with their social media-driven rallies, they often lack fundamental utility, leaving investors exposed to unpredictable swings. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi platform built with real financial utility, structured mechanisms, and a transparent roadmap. Analysts are projecting that Mutuum Finance (MUTM ) is positioned to reach $1 well before DOGE, offering investors a measurable path to growth rather than relying solely on hype. Currently, BTC and ETH remain the bedrock of crypto investing, providing stability and capital safety. However, with BTC consolidation occurring, historically such phases signal a rotation of capital into high-potential altcoins. Investors who are scanning the market for asymmetric growth opportunities are turning to projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is designed to combine sustainable demand drivers with utility-focused mechanisms. Unlike meme-driven crypto coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leverages a combination of stablecoin functionality, staking incentives, and technological upgrades to ensure both adoption and price appreciation. The ongoing presale highlights the momentum behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 6 is priced at $0.035, and to date, it has raised approximately $16 million, with 42% of the token allocation already sold. Over 16,400 holders have entered the ecosystem, demonstrating broad investor interest. With Phase 7 set to raise the price by 15% to $0.040, early buyers are presented with a clear window to secure discounted tokens before a significant price adjustment. The presale success not only reflects investor confidence but also lays a strong foundation for Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s trajectory toward $1. Layer-2 Integration and Beta Launch Create Real-World Demand A key catalyst for Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s anticipated growth is its Layer-2 integration. By facilitating faster transactions with lower fees, the platform will significantly improve the user experience, enabling both retail and institutional participants to engage more efficiently. The reduced friction in transaction execution is expected to attract higher daily usage, staking, and trading activity, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a practical, high-demand asset in contrast to speculative crypto coins that rely purely on market sentiment. Adding to the excitement, the beta launch of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform will allow investors early access to the platform’s core functionalities, including borrowing, lending, and stablecoin interactions. This first-hand experience will showcase Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s tangible utility, creating demand based on real usage rather than speculative hype. The beta phase is anticipated to serve as a crucial demonstration of the platform’s capabilities, driving adoption and validating investor confidence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s integrated stablecoin is another core component of its growth story. It operates on a mint-and-burn model to maintain a $1 peg, governed by dynamic borrow interest rates and reserve factors. This mechanism ensures systemic safety while encouraging adoption through predictable, reliable financial instruments. The stablecoin, combined with the ongoing roadmap execution—including upcoming Layer-2 deployment, beta launch, and exchange listings—sets the stage for a token that can grow sustainably and attract broader institutional participation. Revenue Mechanisms and Structured Price Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s buy-and-distribute mechanism is designed to reinforce long-term price growth. Platform-generated revenue will be used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This creates a continuous buying loop, supporting the token’s price floor while rewarding active participants. Unlike purely speculative crypto coins, this mechanism provides a tangible foundation for upward price pressure, aligning investor incentives with platform activity. The combination of Layer-2 adoption, beta launch engagement, stablecoin utility, and structured buy pressure ensures that Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s growth is grounded in measurable fundamentals. Analysts have calculated that a move from the current presale price of $0.035 to $1 represents a 28x increase, offering substantial returns for early participants. For instance, a $1,000 investment today would secure approximately 28,500 tokens, which could be valued at $28,500 by the time Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaches $1. This structured upside makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a compelling choice for investors seeking a balance of utility, security, and high growth potential. Further enhancing investor confidence is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap toward expected top-tier exchange listings, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and MEXC. These listings will increase liquidity, widen market access, and drive both trading volumes and user activity. The combination of presale demand, Layer-2 technological upgrades, beta adoption, stablecoin functionality, and exchange exposure positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a rare opportunity in crypto investing, where real utility underpins anticipated price growth. Conclusion In conclusion, the “race to $1” in the crypto market is no longer dominated solely by hype-driven coins like DOGE. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a structured, utility-focused alternative with measurable growth levers. Presale performance, Layer-2 integration, beta engagement, stablecoin mechanics, and buy-and-distribute incentives all contribute to a clear path toward $1. For investors seeking both security and asymmetric upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned as the standout altcoin that can outperform speculative crypto coins, providing early participants with a well-supported opportunity to maximize returns in the evolving crypto market.

Commenting on the launch, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said that he was in “semi-shock,” as the debut volume was five times greater than XRP futures ETFs managed on their first day. “SEMI-SHOCK: Rex XRP ETF XRPP is already at $24m in volume. That is way more than I would have thought. For context it’s 5x more than any of the XRP futures ETFs did on Day One and it’s only been 90min,” wrote Balchunas on X. Unsurprisingly, traders are already speculating on the trajectory of not just XRP but crypto in general, with Balchunas himself interpreting the situation as a “good sign for the onslaught of 33 Act ETFs coming soon.” XRP price prediction Weighing both the key drivers this week and the most important technical indicators , Finbold consulted ChatGPT-5 regarding potential XFP price targets for the end of the year. The artificial intelligence ( AI ) concluded that “the asset could be heading for a decisive year-end rally.” Trading at around $3.04 at press time, XRP could close 2025 at a price between as low as $2.50 in the most bearish and $10 in the most bullish scenario, implying a potential upside of 230% from the current levels, according to the language learning model (LLM).

Google, a titan in the tech world, is now bringing its formidable artificial intelligence directly into the hands of millions with the rollout of Gemini in Chrome for US users. This isn’t just an update; it’s a paradigm shift, promising a more intuitive, intelligent, and proactive browsing experience that parallels the smart automation we’ve come to expect from cutting-edge tech. Gemini in Chrome: Your New Intelligent Browsing Companion Starting now, all Mac and Windows desktop users in the U.S. can tap into the power of Gemini in Chrome . This widespread rollout, previously limited to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers, marks a significant step towards democratizing advanced AI tools. Imagine reading a complex article and instantly asking Gemini to clarify specific points, or even modifying a recipe on the fly – for instance, transforming a standard banana bread recipe into a gluten-free version with a simple command. This direct integration streamlines information processing, making your web interactions more efficient and personalized. The beauty of Gemini’s integration lies in its accessibility. A dedicated icon in the top-right corner of your Chrome window serves as your gateway to this intelligent assistant. This immediate access empowers users to: Clarify Information: Quickly understand intricate details on any webpage. Modify Content: Adapt recipes, instructions, or other text-based content to your specific needs. Enhance Productivity: Reduce the need to open new tabs for simple queries or modifications. Beyond Simple Commands: The Era of Revolutionary Agentic Browsing Google is not stopping at simple queries; it’s pushing the boundaries with upcoming Agentic Browsing capabilities. This advanced form of AI interaction allows Gemini to perform tasks autonomously, working across multiple tabs and even remembering your past browsing sessions. Think of it as having a highly capable personal assistant embedded directly into your browser, ready to tackle complex, multi-step tasks. Consider these transformative examples: Multi-Tab Comparison: Planning a vacation? Gemini can summarize and compare flight, hotel, and activity options across various open tabs, helping you organize your entire trip effortlessly. Similarly, when shopping for a new mattress, Gemini can compile a comparison of different models from multiple retailers. Recalling Past Sessions: Ever struggle to find that specific webpage you visited last week? Soon, you’ll be able to ask Gemini, “On which site did I see the walnut desk last week?” or “What was that blog I read on back-to-school shopping?” – retrieving information without sifting through your browser history. Deeper App Integration: Future updates will integrate Gemini with other Google apps like Calendar, YouTube, and Maps. This means you could schedule meetings, check location details, or even jump to a specific timestamp in a YouTube video, all without leaving your current page. Automated Tasks: The most exciting aspect of agentic capabilities is the ability to complete tedious tasks. Imagine asking Gemini to book a haircut or order your weekly groceries. The AI assistant will navigate to the site, add items to your cart, and present you with the final action – checking out with your payment option. This level of automation is set to redefine online convenience. This move positions Google squarely in the race for advanced AI agents, following similar innovations like OpenAI’s Operator. The arrival of these agentic capabilities in Chrome promises to transform how users interact with the web, making browsing less about searching and more about achieving. AI Mode Search: Redefining Your Address Bar for Deeper Insights The humble Chrome address bar is also getting a significant upgrade with the introduction of AI Mode Search . This isn’t just for typing URLs anymore; it’s becoming a powerful conversational AI interface for your search queries. Instead of generic keyword searches, you can now pose complex questions directly in the address bar, initiating a dynamic dialogue with Google’s AI. Here’s how it changes the game: Complex Queries: Forget typing “best mattress.” With AI Mode, you can input a detailed request like, “I’m a side sleeper with occasional lower back pain, make me a table comparing different mattress types.” The AI will then generate a comprehensive overview. Follow-Up Questions: The conversation doesn’t end there. You can ask follow-up questions, such as, “How long do memory foam mattresses typically last?” to delve deeper into your topic without starting a new search. Contextual Page Queries: Chrome will also suggest relevant questions based on the page you’re currently viewing, helping you kickstart your research with an AI Overview and options for further exploration. This update, rolling out later this month in English for U.S. users and expanding globally, signifies a shift from passive information retrieval to active, intelligent inquiry, making your search experience far more intuitive and productive. Enhanced Security and Productivity with Proactive Google AI Beyond browsing and searching, Google AI is also being leveraged to bolster user security and streamline essential online tasks. In an era where digital threats are increasingly sophisticated, Google is deploying its AI models to proactively protect users. Combatting AI-Generated Scams: Chrome will soon integrate Gemini Nano, Google’s on-device AI model, to detect and protect against evolving scams. This includes sophisticated phishing attempts that impersonate trusted brands and leverage generative AI to create highly convincing fake virus alerts or fraudulent giveaways. By identifying these malicious patterns, Chrome aims to provide a robust shield against digital deception. Automatic Password Resets: Password management, often a tedious task, is getting an AI-powered overhaul. If Chrome detects that one of your passwords has been exposed in a data breach, it can now automatically create and save a new, secure password for you on supported sites like Spotify, Duolingo, Coursera, and H&M. This feature significantly enhances online security by making it easier to maintain strong, unique passwords across your accounts. These security enhancements underscore Google’s commitment to creating a safer online environment, utilizing the very technology that sometimes fuels new threats to build more resilient defenses. Unlocking New Possibilities: How Chrome AI Features Transform Your Browsing The collective rollout of these advanced Chrome AI Features represents a monumental leap forward in web browsing. From contextual understanding to autonomous task execution and proactive security, Google is embedding intelligence at every layer of the user experience. The goal is clear: to make the web more intuitive, productive, and secure for everyone. These features promise to: Boost Efficiency: Spend less time searching and more time understanding and accomplishing tasks. Personalize Experience: Get tailored information and assistance based on your specific needs and context. Enhance Security: Benefit from AI-driven protection against scams and automated password management. Streamline Workflows: Integrate browsing with other apps and automate routine online activities. As these capabilities roll out in the coming months, users can expect a fundamental shift in how they interact with the internet. The browser is evolving from a mere window to the web into an intelligent partner, capable of anticipating needs and executing complex commands, truly bringing the future of AI into everyday digital life. Google’s ambitious deployment of Gemini and its suite of AI capabilities within Chrome signals a new era for web browsing. By integrating powerful AI directly into the browser, Google is not just enhancing existing features; it’s fundamentally redefining the digital experience. For US users, the immediate access to Gemini and the promise of future agentic capabilities, intelligent search, and robust security measures mean a web that is more intuitive, productive, and secure than ever before.

As Bitcoin consolidates near recent highs and Solana experiences selling pressure, Ripple’s native token has emerged as the preferred choice for traders seeking leveraged short-term opportunities. The analyst pointed out , “This trend is evidenced by rising open interest for XRP perpetual swaps simultaneously with declines in Bitcoin and SOL contracts, suggesting XRP became the preferred vehicle for traders seeking short-term momentum.” Market data reveals a sharp shift in derivatives positioning whereby open interest in Bitcoin and Solana futures is falling as traders retreat, while XRP perpetual swaps surge, signaling a strong influx of speculative capital. This shift underscores the rotational flow of capital in crypto, as traders chase momentum across tokens. With Bitcoin stuck in consolidation and Solana losing steam, XRP has emerged as the preferred vehicle for leveraged bets. Surging open interest in XRP futures signals intensifying speculative activity, fueling the potential for sharp rallies as well as swift corrections, depending on sentiment. This development comes at a pivotal moment for XRP. Ripple remains relevant as both a payments-focused blockchain and a highly liquid trading asset, while recent legal clarity in the U.S. has bolstered market confidence. Though long-term investors remain cautious, rising futures activity shows momentum traders are seizing on XRP’s volatility as a near-term opportunity. Therefore, rising XRP futures open interest highlights its growing appeal as a tactical play in crypto derivatives. Continued momentum could drive heightened short-term volatility as leveraged traders push prices further. XRP Surges as First U.S. Spot ETFs for Dogecoin and XRP Launch According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP extended its rally on September 18, adding more than $5 billion in market value in less than 24 hours. The token’s price soared to $3.13, driving its market capitalization from $180.47 billion to $185.79 billion at the time of publication. The sharp increase coincided with a landmark development in the U.S. crypto market: the launch of the first-ever spot Dogecoin and XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by investment firm REX-Osprey. The launch of these ETFs is a milestone for XRP, enhancing its legitimacy and accessibility. U.S. investors can now gain regulated exposure without directly holding the token, paving the way for broader participation, including institutional players previously deterred by regulatory and operational hurdles. Analysts say the rally was no coincidence. ETF launches boosted demand for XRP, sparking speculative buying and short-term momentum. As Bitcoin consolidated and other altcoins saw mixed sentiment, capital flowed into XRP, driving a surge across spot and derivatives markets, resulting in one of the token’s strongest single-day gains this year. While Dogecoin gained from the ETF launch, XRP dominated with a surge in market cap. For the broader crypto market, the dual spot ETFs mark a major step toward mainstream adoption, offering a transparent, investor-friendly alternative to futures-based products. Therefore, XRP’s rally hinged on broader market trends and sustained ETF interest. While skeptics warn short-term hype may fade, supporters see regulated ETF access as a catalyst for new liquidity and stronger long-term positioning. Conclusion XRP’s dramatic surge yesterday underscores the growing influence of regulated investment products in the crypto market. The launch of the first U.S. spot ETFs for XRP and Dogecoin by REX-Osprey not only boosted market confidence but also opened the door for broader institutional and retail participation. This milestone highlights how strategic financial innovations can drive both short-term momentum and long-term adoption, positioning XRP as a key player in the evolving digital asset landscape. On the other hand, the recent rotation of speculative capital into XRP futures highlights the token’s rising prominence as a short-term momentum play in the crypto market with increasing open interest signaling growing trader confidence.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-19 10:08:18

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis We’re only halfway through this month, and it’s already Bitcoin’s best-ever September. So far, it has gained a solid 8%, thanks to a powerful combination of technical and fundamental tailwinds. On the chart, Bitcoin looks well-positioned to charge toward its all-time highs. It’s currently forming an inside candle on the daily timeframe, suggesting a brief accumulation phase (think of it as a breather after a long rally) before a potentially explosive move upward. On the 4-hour chart, $BTC is also holding support at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. This further strengthens the outlook that $BTC is gearing up for an aggressive leg higher. Fundamentally, Bitcoin has received a strong boost from the Fed’s recent rate cut. And with more cuts expected later this year, $BTC looks poised to gain momentum and break into new ATHs. Bitcoin Hits 1-Month High as Experts Predict $123,288 Soon, Fueling Bitcoin Hyper’s $16.8M Presale September 19, 2025 • 10:09 UTC Bitcoin just hit a new 1-month high after pushing near $118K yesterday, which prompted analysts to predict a price point of $123,288 soon. Analyst Michael van de Poppe believes $119K is Bitcoin’s most critical resistance point, with a potential breakout giving long investors the buy signal. JDK Analysis believes that Bitcoin’s sustained performance links to the order flow data which suggests buying pressure created by an increase in long positions . Bitcoin’s chart movements could bring more eyes on Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , its official Layer 2 upgrade, which promises faster and cheaper transactions. Learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper is right here. Poland Debuts First Bitcoin ETF, Setting the Stage for Bitcoin Hyper Dominance September 19, 2025 • 10:09 UTC The Warsaw Stock Exchange launched its first Bitcoin ETF , giving investors indirect exposure to the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. This means anyone in Poland can now invest in Bitcoin in a regulated environment without actually owning the coin itself. Growing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin is a huge plus not only for the crypto itself but for related projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . That’s because more Bitcoin investors means potentially more interest in projects that aim to improve it. In Bitcoin Hyper’s case, it’s about creating a Bitcoin Layer 2 that will make transactions cheaper and faster, while finally allowing $BTC to be used in applications such as staking and interacting with dApps.

Dogecoin Bulls Face Crucial Test On the weekly DOGE/USDT chart shared by Rekt Capital, price has rallied back into the $0.27–$0.28 area and is attempting to flip it into support. At the time of the screenshot, the active weekly candle sat near $0.28410 with 3 days and 6 hours left, directly atop a green horizontal level plotted at $0.27884. Above, the next clearly marked resistance is the prior range high at $0.33817, with a psychological waypoint at $0.30000. Beneath the immediate “springboard,” intermediate supports are drawn at ~$0.23000 and $0.22014, while the higher-time-frame safety net remains the pre-halving high region around $0.15901, which also coincides with an ascending trendline that price successfully retested in July. Related Reading: Dogecoin Down 13% As Whales Distribute $181 Million In DOGE Rekt Capital framed the setup succinctly: “If Dogecoin is able to turn $0.27 (green) into support then price will break out to at least $0.33. Retest is in progress, the Daily and/or Weekly Closes need to continue above $0.27 to solidify this level as a new support and springboard.” Five days earlier, he noted, “Looks like Dogecoin has finally turned the Pre-Halving highs into new support,” marking the July reclaim with a green circle on his chart. Structurally, that sequence resembles a classic higher-low off trendline support followed by a return to the range midpoint; sustaining closes above the midpoint converts it into a launchpad toward the range high. The chart’s geometry reinforces that logic. The rising black trendline from late 2024 underpins a series of higher lows into June–July, where DOGE rebounded from the ~$0.16 area (black label: 0.15901). The current blue-circled cluster shows repeated weekly interactions with the $0.27–$0.30 band: initial rejection at the level, a pullback to ~$0.22–$0.23, and a renewed push that is now testing for a flip. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? Confluence Of Signals Says Yes In practical terms, a confirmed weekly close north of ~$0.27884 reduces the risk of a “failed breakout” and opens the path for a measured move into the $0.33 resistance. Failure to hold would likely re-expose $0.23000/$0.22014 as the magnet, with the rising trendline keeping the higher-time-frame uptrend intact unless the market revisits the ~$0.16 pre-halving pivot. What Else To Watch: Macro Conditions And USDT Dominance Whether DOGE gets follow-through quickly may hinge on macro liquidity and the broader crypto risk-cycle Kevin (Kev Capital TA) tracks via USDT dominance. In his 2-week/1-month USDT.D chart, tether’s market-cap share has carved a three-year descending triangle defined by a series of lower highs under a sloping yellow resistance and a flat demand shelf near ~4%–5%. “It has helped me call the lows on #BTC back in 2022/2023 and it has helped me identify every top and bottom in this market since then,” Kevin wrote, citing the March 2024 highs, late-summer 2024 lows, December/January highs, and April lows as examples of the pattern’s signal quality. The current monthly candle hovers around 4.23% within that base, with multiple prior touches on both the downtrend line and support. He also points to confluence at the “2W 200 SMA/EMA plus major structured support,” underscoring why this area is an inflection. Mechanically, a decisive breakdown in USDT dominance from the triangle’s floor would imply capital rotating out of stablecoins into risk assets, a regime that has historically favored altcoins. Conversely, another bounce at support would preserve the range and keep liquidity preference defensive, which has tended to cap alt strength. Momentum panels on Kevin’s chart reinforce the “inflection” message rather than a conclusion: a stochastic-style oscillator has rolled down from elevated territory, and MACD-like readings are compressing near the zero line, both circled to emphasize how close the market is to a regime shift. Macro guidance from the Federal Reserve is another lever. “The Fed laid the pathway clearly and concisely. We now have full guidance as to what they want to do and that is to continue easing slowly,” Kevin said. “As long as the data comes in favorable via inflation/labor then there is no more excuses for the crypto market to not head higher into the end of the year.” In the very near term, though, he cautioned that September is behaving true to form: “No volume and no liquidity flowing in. Mostly leverage driven at the moment. Touch grass and wait it out. Bigger volatility is coming soon.” For Dogecoin, that mix translates into crisp levels and clean triggers. The technical job now is simple but binary: manage the weekly close above ~$0.27–$0.28 to validate the “springboard” and keep focus on $0.30000 and $0.33817, or relinquish the flip and reset into the mid-$0.22s where buyers have recently defended. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.27339.

First US Doge ETF Generates Buzz, Trades $6M in One Hour, Setting Up Maxi Doge as the Next Crypto to Explode September 19, 2025 • 10:09 UTC REX-Osprey’s $DOJE ETF saw nearly $6M in trading volume just in its first hour of trading. It’s a stellar performance for the first Dogecoin ETF in the US, as Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said ETFs typically only have a trading volume under $1M on their first day. However, Balchunas added that its status as a 40 Act ETF could limit investor interest as it’s more restrictive and only offers indirect exposure to the asset, unlike 33 Act ones. Despite this, $DOJE holds a lot of excitement not just for Dogecoin but also its degen cousin Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . As a meme coin that’s all about maximum gains, Maxi loves taking everything several notches higher. He has also gained a lot of loyal followers who poured in over $2.3M to his ongoing token presale, giving it the potential to be the next crypto to explode.

Bitcoin Hyper is the Next Crypto to Explode as Bitcoin Becomes More Boring Than the Nasdaq September 19, 2025 • 10:09 UTC Remember when Bitcoin was the wild west of finance? Well, those days might be over, and surprisingly, that’s a win. New data from CEX.io shows that Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped below that of nearly every stock on the Nasdaq 100. It’s now more stable than companies like Amazon and Microsoft. The calming of the wild price swings is all about market maturity. Bitcoin’s value has grown so much that it’s harder for any one person to cause a huge stir. And, it’s still a powerhouse , outperforming most of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocks. This new calmer version of Bitcoin is also getting a powerful upgrade from new projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Layer-2 solution that aims to give Bitcoin the speed and low fees it needs to be useful for everyday payments and apps. With over $16M raised in its presale, see how far we think it can really go in 2025.

Recently, a Bank of Canada deputy governor made a significant statement, calling for the establishment of federal-level stablecoin regulation . This isn’t just a technical discussion; it’s about safeguarding Canada’s financial future and ensuring that innovative payment methods are also secure for everyone. While stablecoins present a unique opportunity to modernize Canada’s payment infrastructure, their adoption must be approached with considerable caution. The official emphasized a critical point: before stablecoins see widespread use, regulators must ensure they are as safe and reliable as traditional bank accounts. This proactive stance highlights the nation’s commitment to both innovation and consumer protection in the burgeoning crypto space. Why is Federal Stablecoin Regulation So Crucial for Canada? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility, typically by pegging their value to a stable asset like the Canadian dollar or a basket of currencies. They offer the promise of faster, cheaper, and more efficient payments, potentially transforming how Canadians conduct daily transactions and businesses operate. However, without clear rules, stablecoins could introduce new risks. These include potential for market instability, consumer fraud, and money laundering. A federal regulatory framework would provide: Clarity: Defining legal status and operational requirements for stablecoin issuers. Protection: Ensuring that consumers’ funds are secure and accessible, similar to deposits in traditional banks. Stability: Mitigating risks that could affect the broader financial system. The Bank of Canada’s call underscores the importance of a unified approach to manage these digital assets effectively. What Challenges Does Canada Face in Implementing Effective Stablecoin Regulation ? Developing comprehensive stablecoin regulation is no simple task. Canada, like many other nations, grapples with several complexities in this rapidly evolving sector. One major challenge is balancing the need for innovation with the imperative for financial stability and consumer protection. Regulators must understand the intricate technology behind stablecoins and how they interact with existing financial systems. Furthermore, the global nature of cryptocurrencies means that domestic regulations need to consider international standards and cross-border implications. Crafting rules that are flexible enough to adapt to future technological advancements, yet robust enough to withstand current risks, requires significant expertise and collaboration across various governmental bodies and industry stakeholders. How Can Robust Stablecoin Regulation Protect Consumers? The primary goal of any effective stablecoin regulation is to safeguard the public. By establishing clear guidelines, authorities can ensure that stablecoins are genuinely stable and transparently backed by reserves. This means that if you hold a stablecoin, you can trust that its value will remain consistent and that you can redeem it for its underlying asset when needed. Key protections would include: Reserve Requirements: Mandating that stablecoin issuers hold sufficient, high-quality reserves. Auditing and Reporting: Regular, independent audits to verify reserves and operational integrity. Consumer Redress: Mechanisms for users to resolve disputes and seek compensation if issues arise. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) Measures: Preventing illicit use of stablecoins. These measures aim to build public trust, making stablecoins a viable and safe option for everyday transactions, much like the secure banking services Canadians rely on today. Looking Ahead: The Future of Payments in Canada The push for federal stablecoin regulation in Canada is a proactive step towards integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system responsibly. It signals a commitment to harnessing the benefits of innovation while rigorously addressing potential risks. As the conversation continues, it will be crucial for policymakers, industry leaders, and the public to collaborate, ensuring that Canada remains at the forefront of financial modernization with a secure and trusted payment infrastructure. The journey towards widespread stablecoin adoption is complex, but with thoughtful and robust regulation, Canada can pave the way for a more efficient, secure, and inclusive financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, such as a fiat currency (like the Canadian dollar) or a commodity, to avoid the high volatility often seen in other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Q2: Why does the Bank of Canada want federal stablecoin regulation? The Bank of Canada sees stablecoins as an opportunity to modernize payment systems but emphasizes the need for federal regulation to ensure they are as safe and reliable as traditional bank accounts before widespread adoption, protecting consumers and financial stability. Q3: How would stablecoin regulation benefit consumers? Regulation would protect consumers by ensuring stablecoins are backed by sufficient reserves, requiring transparency through audits, establishing mechanisms for dispute resolution, and preventing their use in illicit activities, thereby building trust in digital payments. Q4: What are the main challenges in implementing stablecoin regulation? Challenges include balancing innovation with risk management, understanding complex technology, addressing the global nature of cryptocurrencies, and creating flexible yet robust rules that adapt to future advancements. Q5: Will stablecoins replace traditional bank accounts in Canada? While stablecoins could offer new payment options and modernize infrastructure, it’s unlikely they will entirely replace traditional bank accounts. Instead, they are more likely to complement existing financial services, offering an alternative for specific types of transactions once robust regulation is in place.

In particular, this performance makes $XRPR the largest day-one “natural” dollar volume of any ETF debut in 2025, edging out the previous leader $IVES, and placing it ahead of hundreds of other new listings. By comparison, the $DOJE ETF logged $17 million on launch day, which still ranked among the year’s top five out of over 710 ETF launches. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the milestone on X (formerly Twitter): “$XRPR traded $37.7m on Day One, which edges out $IVES for the biggest day one (natural) $ volume of any 2025 launch. $DOJE is no slouch at $17m, which would be Top 5 for year.. out of 710 launches. Good sign for the onslaught of 33 Act ETFs coming soon.” XRP exposure in the U.S. market The strong debut signals pent-up demand for regulated XRP exposure in the U.S. market. Unlike spot ETFs that directly hold underlying assets, $XRPR operates under a Registered Investment Company (RIC) structure, holding a mix of XRP , cash, and Treasuries. This design allows investors to gain regulated XRP exposure without directly handling the tokens. With XRP trading above $3 and a market cap over $181 billion, the ETF’s successful launch adds to the growing narrative of institutional adoption.

The project is a $0.035 altcoin that has been bought by more than 16,400 investors. Its lending and borrowing ecosystem that aims to bridge the traditional and blockchain financial systems continues to make MUTM the investment of choice among investors who prefer to earn more ROI in 2025. In contrast to XRP, Mutuum Finance is getting its attention through innovation, trustworthiness, and fast uptake. To the investors searching the top crypto to purchase at the moment, the shift towards Mutuum Finance should be the next destination. XRP Records Minimal Returns as Investors Explore Elsewhere XRP is at present in the market at $3.05 and its prices are showing a slight movement with the latest highs of around $3.20 and lows at $2.90. The sentiment of the market regarding XRP is still rather optimistic with a degree of caution, as its established infrastructure in the field of cross-border payments and the growing number of institutional users are frequently mentioned among the arguments. Nevertheless, the advancement beyond the resistance stages has been gradual and the majority of its gains could be reliant on some external triggers such as regulatory changes or macroeconomic changes. In comparison with the comparatively stagnant XRP path, some investors are considering Mutuum Finance as having higher returns potential in this cycle. Acceleration of Presale at Mutuum Finance In Stage 6 of the presale, investors are purchasing MUTM at a price of $0.035. Over 16,400 investors have already purchased tokens and the project itself has raised over $16 million which is a clear indication that the market demand is increasing and launch hype is also increasing. Mutuum Finance makes use of Chainlink oracles to ETH, MATIC, and AVAX token borrowings, lending and liquidity insurance premiums. Fallback oracle parameters, composite data feeds and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages are being used using redundant security. In this regard, the multi-step method will mean that the price data will be normalized regardless of the level of the intensity of the market conditions. The market variation has a direct impact on collateral management of the protocol. LTV and liquidation values are split on the asset stability. The amount of risk tokens or assets are permitted to be lower and the amount of risk-free tokens is permitted to be higher. The reserves multiplier is applied proportionally 10% during the low-risk and 35% during the highest risk as a buffer, which does not impair the diversification. Liquidity Management The protocol is efficient in managing liquidity and in risk management in order to be successful in transfer of illiquid positions. Exposures to risk are tightly limited, and the degree of liquidation is established. Stablecoins and ETH are used as collateral assets to allow the increasing of the ancillary LTV levels to collateralise risk assets with safer assets. Asset class proportional deployment of reserve factors maximizes the opportunity and risk and protocol reserve protection. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining popularity among investors who want to make high returns in 2025 compared to the returns that Ripple (XRP) will provide. Stage 6 tokens are only $0.035 and Stage 7 is going to increase, making this the ideal point of entry. The presale is closing in on the $16M mark.

Fundamentals such as the new SEC rule also provide a bullish outlook for the foremost meme coin. Shiba Inu’s Bullish Setup Hints At 138% Rally In an X post, Marks said that Shiba Inu’s setup is still hinting at a rally of over 138%, which would send the SHIB price back to around $0.000032. He added that it is only a matter of time for this move to materialize as a bull signal holds confirmed, hinting at this move for the top meme coin. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bulls Are Back: Here’s The 512 Billion SHIB Accumulation That Triggered A Spark Before now, Marks had highlighted a divergence confirmation for Shiba Inu, which led to his prediction that a bullish reversal could still be in the cards for the meme coin. SHIB has underperformed up till now, with a year-to-date (YTD) loss of around 38%. However, the analyst has claimed that SHIB could still rally to as high as $0.000081, which would bring it close to its current all-time high (ATH). The potential launch of a Shiba Inu ETF could be one of the catalysts that spark a parabolic run for the SHIB price. Marketing lead Lucie noted that SHIB has regulated futures on Coinbase, which makes it eligible for an ETF listing under the generic listing standards that the SEC just approved. Lucie stated that the big picture for Shiba Inu is that SHIB now joins the “ETF-watchlist club” with other futures-backed cryptos. She added that even before a SHIB-only ETF, the meme coin could be bundled into a multi-asset-backed ETF. A Shiba Inu ETF would inject new liquidity into the meme coin’s ecosystem and could spark higher prices. New ATH Incoming For SHIB In an X post, crypto analyst Shib Spain declared that a new ATH is incoming for Shiba Inu. He stated that the meme coin will bounce “hard” off the support zone around $0.000013 and rally to new highs. Crypto analyst Ragnar Shib remarked that SHIB is heating up, having recorded a 19% gain in the last 90 days. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Diamond Hands Are Refusing To Sell, Bulls Eye $0.00009 ATH The analyst stated that Shiba Inu remains the number one meme token on Ethereum and is fully decentralized, boasting a growing ecosystem that includes the layer-2 network Shibarium, as well as DeFi and NFT products. Crypto analyst Investing Haven highlighted that auto burns and the Shibarium upgrades continue within the SHIB ecosystem, which has helped reduce the circulating supply. However, he warned that the risk associated with the Shiba Inu ecosystem remains high. He also noted that SHIB is witnessing a tactical pullback, although the bull structure is still evolving. In line with this, he advised investors to track the burn rate and fixes in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.00001325, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Potential breakout LINK is attempting to break the $24.85 resistance, which could lead to further gains. In the consolidation phase, the price is holding above $24.15, indicating a wait for a breakout or pullback. Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $24.33 on September 19, 2025, marking a modest upward movement of 0.56%. The market has seen a steady increase in price over the past 24 hours, with the highest point reaching $24.85 and the lowest touching $24.15. These key price levels define the immediate resistance and support zones, highlighting the asset’s current trading range. Chainlink’s recent performance reflects a continued trend of price stabilization as LINK seeks to break out of the established range. Chainlink daily price chart: LINK stability with key resistance and support levels The market has experienced steady price action with resistance at $24.85 and support at $24.15, reflecting a stable price range. This development follows a period of price stabilization, as LINK continues to hold above the critical support level at $24.15, suggesting buying interest in the market. The overall trend on the daily chart is bullish, with higher lows and higher highs, signaling continued upward pressure. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView Recent price movements show LINK attempting to break the $24.85 resistance, which could lead to further gains if surpassed. However, failure to break above this level may result in a retracement toward $24.15. The daily chart indicates consolidation within a narrow range, with traders needing to monitor key levels for a potential breakout or pullback. Chainlink 4-hour price chart: LINK range-bound action with resistance at $24.85 On the 4-hour chart, LINK is showing a more detailed picture of the market’s intraday price action. The current price sits between the $24.15 support and the $24.85 resistance, with price action within this range indicating indecision in the market. Each attempt to break above $24.85 has been met with selling pressure, but the price has managed to maintain above $24.15, suggesting a support level that could hold in the short term.

LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The recent price action shows that LINK is attempting to establish a bullish trend within this range, though the resistance at $24.85 remains a key obstacle. If LINK manages to break above this level, it could trigger a more significant upward movement. However, without a clear breakout, the price may retrace back to $24.15 or lower, especially if sellers gain control.

Shiba Inu remains steady amid upgrades and community strength, while Cardano continues to push technological improvements, such as Hydra scaling and Plutus updates. Into this mix comes Remittix , which is being positioned not just as another altcoin but as a serious competitor offering utility, metrics, and momentum that may allow it to outshine ADA, DOGE and SHIB in late 2025. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Surging Beyond SHIB Dogecoin has recently broken through resistance around $0.29, with analysts pointing to potential for further gains. Reports highlight a breakout toward $0.32, then possibly revisiting highs near $0.50 by year’s end if institutional and ETF pressure continues. Whales are accumulating DOGE, signalling confidence, even as retail investors react to volatility. The US DOGE ETF has added legitimacy and may attract flows that could boost volume and sentiment. Risks include failing to clear resistance and macro headwinds that might drag DOGE down toward $0.15 if momentum reverses. Shiba Inu And Cardano: Where They Stand Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing signs of strength through community engagement and protocol developments. Some forecast a rally if its recent resistance zones hold, targeting an upside of perhaps 15% to 25%. However, due to its large supply and meme status, SHIB may lag if utility demand shifts toward tokens with clearer use cases. Cardano (ADA) has been active on the development front. Forecasts vary widely: optimistic models predict ADA could reach $1.50 to $2.50 by the end of 2025, while conservative ones see ADA staying in the $0.60 to $1.00 range given competition and execution risks. Remittix is Poised To Trump Cardano When comparing Remittix to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Cardano in Q4 2025, key differences emerge. DOGE and SHIB remain meme-driven to a large extent, though DOGE has begun gaining infrastructural backing via ETF interest. ADA’s strength is its academic approach, protocol upgrades and institutional partnerships. Remittix is emerging with a combination of utility and metrics that may let it outperform tokens like ADA under certain scenarios. Remittix has sold over 666 million tokens, is priced at $0.1080 and has raised over $261 million. It holds CertiK verification and is ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens on CertiK. Its wallet beta is active with community testers. There is a 15% USDT referral program for users referring new buyers via the Remittix dashboard every 24 hours. Remittix has secured CEX listings on BitMart and LBank, with a third listing in view. A $250,000 giveaway is also underway. Here are features that give Remittix an edge in late 2025: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Ideal for freelancers, remitters and global earners Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd These strengths show Remittix is not relying purely on hype. If ADA’s upgrades face delays or complexity, and if DOGE or SHIB miss resistance or lose momentum, Remittix may capture capital from investors who seek practical use, verifiable security and real adoption. Who Wins Q4 2025? Remittix is shaping up to be the story to watch in Q4 2025 as Dogecoin seeks its breakout, Shiba Inu tries to sustain its community-fueled strength and Cardano pushes development and institutional credibility. Should DOGE clear resistance and leverage ETF flows, it could reach toward $0.50 to $0.73, leaving SHIB trailing unless its utility narrative improves. But Remittix presents a different bet: one grounded in utility, security and growth potential. Remittix may not only compete with ADA but could become a trump card for investors seeking something beyond meme value.

Bitcoin’s strong performance has driven a broad market rebound, with XRP’s price fluctuating between $3.01 and $3.11 over the past 24 hours—a volatility range exceeding 6%. This trend suggests that even with supportive macroeconomic factors, XRP’s short-term outlook remains uncertain. Regulatory Delays and Market Caution The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again postponed its decision on approving XRP ETFs submitted by institutions such as Franklin Templeton, pushing the ruling to mid-November.

The financial world is buzzing with discussions around the future of monetary policy, and a recent statement from a key Federal Reserve official has added fuel to the fire. Investors, businesses, and consumers alike are keenly watching for signals regarding potential Fed interest rate cuts and their broader economic implications. What’s Driving Talk of Fed Interest Rate Cuts? Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, recently made headlines by stating his belief that two additional Fed interest rate cuts would be appropriate this year. This isn’t the first time Kashkari has shared this perspective; he expressed a similar view back in August. His comments offer a glimpse into the ongoing internal debates and varying outlooks among policymakers regarding the optimal path for the nation’s economy. Understanding the context behind such statements is crucial. The Federal Reserve uses interest rates as a primary tool to manage inflation and support employment. When inflation is high, the Fed typically raises rates to cool down economic activity. Conversely, when economic growth slows or inflation targets are met, the Fed might consider cutting rates to stimulate spending and investment. How Do Fed Interest Rate Cuts Impact You? The prospect of Fed interest rate cuts carries significant weight for everyone. For instance, lower interest rates generally translate to: Cheaper Borrowing: Mortgages, car loans, and credit card interest rates can decrease, making it more affordable for consumers to borrow money. This can encourage home buying and larger purchases. Business Investment: Companies find it less expensive to borrow for expansion, new projects, and hiring, potentially boosting economic growth and job creation. Stock Market Performance: Lower rates can make bonds less attractive, pushing investors towards stocks, which might see increased valuations. This can also signal a more optimistic economic outlook. Savings Account Returns: On the flip side, interest rates on savings accounts and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) might also fall, offering lower returns for savers. These ripple effects touch various sectors, from housing to retail, and even extend into the cryptocurrency markets, where investor sentiment is often influenced by broader economic conditions and liquidity. Navigating the Economic Landscape: Why Are Policymakers Divided on Fed Interest Rate Cuts? While some policymakers, like Kashkari, see the appropriateness of multiple Fed interest rate cuts , others may hold different views. The Federal Reserve’s decisions are complex, balancing the need to control inflation with the goal of maintaining maximum employment. Key factors influencing these decisions include: Inflation Data: The pace at which inflation is returning to the Fed’s 2% target is a primary concern. Sustained progress is needed. Employment Figures: A strong job market might give the Fed more leeway to keep rates higher for longer, whereas signs of weakness could prompt cuts. Global Economic Conditions: International economic trends and geopolitical events can also influence the Fed’s domestic policy decisions. Market Expectations: The Fed also considers how financial markets are pricing in future rate movements, aiming to avoid undue volatility. The path forward is rarely straightforward, and the Fed’s approach is often described as data-dependent, meaning decisions can shift as new economic information becomes available. The Outlook for Future Fed Interest Rate Cuts Kashkari’s consistent view on two Fed interest rate cuts this year provides an important perspective, but it’s essential to remember that he is one voice among many on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The committee as a whole determines monetary policy through a consensus-driven process. As the year progresses, market participants will be closely monitoring upcoming inflation reports, employment data, and official Fed statements for further clarity. The timing and magnitude of any potential rate adjustments will significantly shape the economic environment, influencing everything from investment strategies to everyday household budgets. In summary: Neel Kashkari’s consistent advocacy for two Fed interest rate cuts this year highlights a potential shift in monetary policy. These cuts, if they materialize, could offer relief to borrowers, stimulate economic activity, and impact various markets. However, the ultimate decision rests with the broader Federal Reserve committee, which weighs a multitude of economic indicators before acting. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when the Fed cuts interest rates? When the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, it generally means they are reducing the cost for banks to borrow money. This, in turn, often leads to lower interest rates for consumers and businesses on loans like mortgages, car loans, and credit cards, aiming to stimulate economic activity. Q2: Why would the Fed consider two Fed interest rate cuts this year? The Fed might consider two interest rate cuts if they believe inflation is consistently moving towards their 2% target, or if there are signs of slowing economic growth that could benefit from stimulation. Policymakers like Kashkari may feel the current rates are too restrictive given the economic outlook. Q3: How quickly do Fed interest rate cuts affect the economy? The effects of Fed interest rate cuts can be seen relatively quickly in financial markets, but they typically take several months to fully filter through to the broader economy, impacting consumer spending, business investment, and inflation. Q4: Will Fed interest rate cuts impact my cryptocurrency investments? While not a direct impact, Fed interest rate cuts can indirectly affect cryptocurrency markets. Lower traditional interest rates might make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive to investors seeking higher returns. Additionally, a more liquid and stimulated economy can sometimes boost overall market sentiment, benefiting crypto assets. Q5: Who is Neel Kashkari? Neel Kashkari is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. He is one of the twelve regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents who contribute to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) discussions, which set the nation’s monetary policy.

Maybe Not Today,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824330-wgmi-when-is-it-better-than-bitcoin-maybe-not-today?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary WGMI works with a well-defined active investment strategy that selects the most representative companies in the Bitcoin mining field. In a dynamic sector, this makes WGMI competitive compared to passive competitors and/or stock picking. However, miners are heavily affected by the cyclical nature of BTC, alternating hyper-expansion cycles with hyper-correction cycles. The mistake lies in the fact that the market is considering as growth stocks those that can never truly be growth. CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF ( WGMI ) offers an intriguing direct exposure to the shares of mining companies . I underline intriguing, because the management does not simply allocate resources with a market-weighted exposure in public companies in North America, but actively selects the most representative ones. The problem is the cyclicality, in my view extreme, of the sector it operates in, which makes WGMI a speculative and/or tactical instrument for certain market phases; So the question is: are we in “those” market phases? Yes, the cycle is positive, but the irrationality of the market lies in pricing WGMI’s holdings as growth, when they have a very divergent business model. Let me explain better. What does WGMI do With its $225M of AUM, it invests at least 80% in companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues or profits from Bitcoin mining activity, excluding direct investment in Bitcoin BUT (attention) leaving up to 20% the possibility of investing in companies that hold BTC on their balance sheet (and up to 5% exposure in bonds of these companies). It is therefore a pure play mining ETF that offers this service at a TER of 0.75%. WGMI - Fund profile (Seeking Alpha) Its composition WGMI has less than 30 holdings , where the top 3 positions cover 43% of the portfolio, which gives it a unique verticality towards the Bitcoin mining sector. Here is its top 10 holdings: WGMI - top 10 holdings (Seeking Alpha) But let’s remember that the fund has a portfolio turnover of over 45%, as it is actively managed, and therefore rotates its holding distribution based on opportunistic logics. A recognition to WGMI If there is one thing to recognize about CoinShares, it is that the strategy, although not complicated from the prospect, captures opportunities in the sector well when they arise, and although less distributed in number of holdings, I consider it a step above competitors ( FDIG ), but also compared to stock picking. Data by YCharts For example, it well intercepted the expansion of IREN: a company that went from a loss in 2024 to an accounting net income of $86.9M, with F25 revenue growing 168% YoY thanks to the development of its contracted renewable capacity in the USA and Canada, and indeed the AI cloud expansion. IREN - net income (Seeking Alpha) And note well, it has not always been among the top picks of WGMI. And in this sector, I think we all agree that it is not enough to simply take the top picks of the last halving cycle and put them in a portfolio. Data by YCharts A dynamic approach to WGMI The monitoring drivers are always the same: energy-saving capacity – mining capacity – and % of product holding. These are 3 components that give extreme cyclicality to mining companies; simply because they are based on a continuous demand for CAPEX but with scalability limited by the halving reward cut and therefore by the increase in hash rate. Then, having BTC in holding, (in theory) companies expand the % of net income (accounting) in bull markets, and expand the guidance, and then shrink these variables in bear markets. Data by YCharts For example, RIOT, one of the main holdings of WGMI, is an easy example to bring up: it held in total HODL for 13 months (Feb 2024–Mar 2025), moving to positive accounting net income. But if you exclude BTC revaluation, RIOT remained operationally in loss (even without derivatives and settlement cost, -$50M). Then, it so happened that in Q2 2025 the company sold most of the production (Apr–Jun). Data by YCharts But this move theoretically exposed the company to strong cyclicality due to BTC fluctuations. Just like a precious metals mining company with gold . In practical terms, during bull markets it outperforms, because the market adjusts expectations (which were extremely low), and in bear markets instead it does the exact opposite. Bitcoin Following the same logic used so far, WGMI’s holdings will certainly be closely connected with the Bitcoin cycle. And it is logical to think that in order to predict WGMI’s performance, one must be able to interpret the phase in which BTC is positioned. Data by YCharts And as you will have understood from my research on Bitcoin, I maintain an optimistic view, especially looking at the long term. Simply, the institutionalization process , at the base of which there is the GENIUS Act. But looking more in the short term, simply also the Fed’s move . Monetary easing with inflation still above target lowers the real yield of US Treasuries, makes the dollar weaker, and strengthens the role of scarce assets such as BTC and gold. Data by YCharts Risk Miners should outperform Bitcoin in bull markets like gold miners, the problem is the cyclicality of the sector, which shows up in bear markets, and let me say … in bull markets people don’t talk much about bear markets. Data by YCharts Beyond the fact that they are a highly energy-intensive sector, the problem is technological obsolescence and the halving, which respectively increase CAPEX and impact miners’ profitability. If you assume a growing hash rate, higher competition, margins remain compressed even while the price of BTC increases, but if the price goes up, the P/E goes up too, which typically in cyclical companies tends to remain more contained. Well, today it is above 39x , but this is unusual for a cyclical sector, it is as if the market uses multiples (relative valuations) typical of a growth stock, when the accounting features would not place it in this category. Which is why, in my opinion, exposing yourself to WGMI today does not ensure you a wide margin of safety, and exposes you to a more aggressive rotation risk, which makes it less attractive than its underlying commodity, Bitcoin. Conclusion I think the business model of miners makes WGMI an extraordinarily high-beta tactical allocation instrument for the portfolio, but not a strategic fund in a portfolio perspective, as in my opinion the underlying, Bitcoin, could be instead. Today there is no concrete reason to assume the start of a negative cycle, but the lack of a “margin of safety” in WGMI makes it less attractive. Which is why I think the right rating is HOLD, or rather HODL.",BTC-USD|WGMI,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-19 11:38:25

World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is making headlines with its recent governance proposal, a decision set to implement a robust mechanism for WLFI token buybacks and burns . This initiative, as reported by Cointelegraph, signals a strong commitment to enhancing token value and fostering a more engaged community. Understanding WLFI Token Buybacks and Burns: A Strategic Move For those new to the concept, a token buyback involves a project repurchasing its own tokens from the open market. A token burn, on the other hand, permanently removes these tokens from circulation. Together, WLFI token buybacks and burns create a deflationary pressure, aiming to increase the scarcity and, consequently, the value of the remaining tokens. Buybacks: WLFI will acquire its own tokens using protocol fees. Burns: The acquired tokens are then sent to an inaccessible address, removing them permanently. This approach is a powerful tool in tokenomics, often seen as a direct benefit to existing token holders. How Do WLFI Token Buybacks and Burns Strengthen the Ecosystem? The implementation of WLFI token buybacks and burns offers several compelling advantages for the World Liberty Financial ecosystem and its participants: Increased Scarcity: By reducing the total supply of WLFI tokens, the mechanism inherently makes each remaining token more valuable, assuming demand remains constant or grows. Enhanced Value Proposition: This move can attract new investors looking for projects with strong deflationary models and a clear strategy for value accrual. Community Confidence: Demonstrates WLFI’s dedication to its token holders and the long-term health of the protocol, reinforcing trust and encouraging participation in governance. Price Stability: While not a guarantee, consistent buybacks can help stabilize token price by creating a floor for demand. Ultimately, this strategy aims to create a more robust and attractive asset for the DeFi community. The Mechanics: Funding WLFI Token Buybacks and Burns The core of WLFI’s proposal is its innovative funding mechanism. The protocol plans to utilize all of its protocol-owned liquidity fees for these operations. This means that as the WLFI protocol generates revenue through its various services, a portion of that revenue will be directly reinvested into the token ecosystem. Moreover, World Liberty Financial isn’t stopping there. The project is actively seeking additional revenue sources to amplify the scale and impact of future WLFI token buybacks and burns . While the size of the initial buyback has not yet been disclosed, the commitment to expanding these efforts highlights a forward-thinking approach to sustainable growth. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for WLFI? While the prospect of WLFI token buybacks and burns is exciting, like any strategic initiative, it comes with its own set of considerations. One challenge will be maintaining consistent protocol-owned liquidity fees, especially in volatile market conditions. The effectiveness of buybacks and burns is often tied to the overall health and activity of the protocol. However, this also presents a significant opportunity. By linking token value directly to protocol performance, WLFI incentivizes innovation and growth within its ecosystem. A transparent and well-communicated strategy will be crucial for maintaining community trust and ensuring the long-term success of this initiative. Looking Ahead: The Future Impact of WLFI Token Buybacks and Burns WLFI’s decision represents more than just a financial maneuver; it’s a statement about the project’s vision for a sustainable and community-centric future. By strategically implementing WLFI token buybacks and burns , the protocol is setting a precedent for how DeFi projects can actively manage their tokenomics to benefit their users and strengthen their market position. This move could inspire other protocols to explore similar value-accretion strategies, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized finance. The WLFI community will undoubtedly be watching closely as these plans unfold, eager to see the long-term impact on their holdings and the broader ecosystem. World Liberty Financial’s bold step to implement WLFI token buybacks and burns using protocol fees is a significant development for the DeFi space. This strategy aims to create scarcity, enhance token value, and build stronger community confidence. As WLFI continues to explore additional revenue streams, the potential for sustained growth and a robust token economy looks promising. It’s a clear signal that WLFI is committed to delivering tangible value to its holders and shaping a more prosperous decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly are WLFI token buybacks? WLFI token buybacks involve World Liberty Financial repurchasing its own WLFI tokens from the open market. This process reduces the number of tokens available for trading, which can positively influence the token’s price by creating demand. How do WLFI token burns work? After tokens are bought back, WLFI performs a token burn. This means the repurchased tokens are sent to a ‘dead’ or inaccessible wallet address, permanently removing them from the total circulating supply. This action further enhances scarcity. Where do the funds for WLFI token buybacks and burns come from? According to the passed governance proposal, WLFI will use all of its protocol-owned liquidity fees to fund these buybacks and burns. The project also plans to seek additional revenue sources to increase the scale of these efforts in the future. What is the main benefit of WLFI token buybacks and burns for token holders? The primary benefit for WLFI token holders is the potential for increased token value due to reduced supply. As tokens are bought back and burned, the remaining tokens become scarcer, which can lead to higher demand and appreciation in price over time. When will the initial WLFI token buyback occur? The specific size and timing of the initial buyback have not yet been disclosed by World Liberty Financial. Updates will likely be communicated through their official channels as the implementation progresses. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Major WLFI investments could impact token price and retail investors. SEC questioned over possible conflict of interest after Trump election. Potential Conflicts and Investor Risks Highlighted On September 17, 2025, US lawmakers sent an official letter to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and the acting director of the SEC’s Corporate Finance Department regarding the activities of TRON founder Justin Sun. According to the letter, Sun has been under investigation by the US Department of Justice since 2021, and in 2023, the SEC filed a lawsuit against him for alleged fraud involving the cryptocurrency TRX. Additionally, FinCEN reported that TRON had been used by criminal groups for financial operations. Amid these allegations, Sun reportedly avoids entering the United States due to the risk of arrest. After Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 elections, Sun became the largest investor in the DeFi project World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which is linked to the Trump family. According to the letter, he invested at least $75 million, generating an estimated $400 million profit for Trump. Sun also supported the meme coin TRUMP. The SEC, under the new administration, reportedly dropped its lawsuit against Sun after these investments, raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns among lawmakers. Investor Risks and Market Implications Since September 2025, WLFI tokens have been available on major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, reportedly adding up to $5 billion to Trump’s wealth. Lawmakers warned that, as a major investor, Sun could potentially manipulate the token’s price, posing risks for retail investors. Congress has requested that the SEC respond by October 2, 2025, to questions including: Whether SEC officials communicated with the White House or Trump family members regarding Sun Direct communication with Sun before dropping the lawsuit The number of complaints filed against Sun and their processing Consideration of a potential TRON ban in the US Earlier, Arkham experts reported that World Liberty Financial blacklisted Sun’s Ethereum address due to a possible transfer of $9 million in WLFI tokens.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-19 11:40:23

Within the first 24 hours of its Token Generation Event (TGE), the token’s exclusive spot listing on Aster DEX established the platform as the sole global venue for $ASTER trading, attracting significant capital inflows and trading activity. According to on-chain data, $ASTER recorded $371 million in trading volume on its first day. After opening at $0.03015, it climbed to a daily high of $0.528, an increase of roughly 1,650%.

Top candidates like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are in the limelight, with both giants breaking out of multi-month trading ranges and set to rally. However, a new wave of meme tokens is gaining traction beyond these giants, boasting strong communities, exchange listings, and even institutional attention. For investors scanning the horizon, here are the top 5 meme coins to watch right now. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe is quickly emerging as a top contender in the meme coin sector. Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which rely solely on hype, LILPEPE blends meme culture with real utility. Its presale has already raised over $25.5 million, with 15.7 billion tokens sold, putting it far ahead of most early-stage meme projects. The project is building a meme-only launchpad, creating a sustainable ecosystem that ties growth back to the LILPEPE token. Additionally, it’s designed with sniper-bot resistance, zero buy/sell taxes, and near-zero fees, all of which make it a trader-friendly asset. Here’s why Little Pepe is a must-watch: Massive presale success: With Stage 13 now live, LILPEPE is closing on the final stages of its presale. Strong fundamentals: unique utilities, a Certik-audited smart contract, and tier-1 CEX listings in view. Community incentives: Stage 12-17 presale investors can tap into its newly introduced Mega Giveaway , which promises over 15 ETH in rewards. With a launch price of $0.003, early buyers at $0.0022 have clear upside before trading even begins. Should the dots connect, analysts believe Little Pepe is a meme coin with 100x potential this cycle. Pump.fun (PUMP) Pump.fun (PUMP) is a meme coin that has doubled as a launchpad for Solana-based tokens. Its recent surge in popularity comes after Binance listed PUMP with a seed tag , instantly spiking the price by nearly 10%. Its market cap now hovers around $2 billion, with daily trading volumes above $500 million. PUMP Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The seed tag signals risk but also reflects the potential of early-stage meme rallies. PUMP benefits from Binance exposure and Solana’s strong meme coin ecosystem, giving it a runway for future growth. PUMP is a top meme coin to watch for investors seeking massive gains this cycle. Bonk (BONK) Bonk has carved out its place as Solana’s flagship meme coin. It recently cleared a key milestone when its ETF application, filed through Rex-Osprey, survived the SEC’s 75-day review window . That brings BONK closer to becoming one of the first meme coins with an ETF in the U.S., a huge credibility boost. BONK’s price surged 23% this week, outpacing other Solana meme tokens despite a broader monthly decline. Its community remains highly active, and ETF speculation draws fresh interest from retail investors. BONK Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The coin has faced corrections in recent years, but its strong community base and expanding market presence keep it firmly in the conversation as one of the top meme coins to watch. Pudgy Penguin (PENGU) Pudgy Penguin (PENGU) is riding high on momentum after a 20% weekly price surge and a 359% spike in trading volume. Built on Solana, it has captured attention thanks to its unique branding and strong narrative. Traders are eyeing a potential breakout if it can sustain above $0.045. PENGU Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko One key driver is speculation around a spot PENGU ETF , with analysts suggesting approval odds are high. It could unleash a new wave of mainstream demand for PENGU if approved. With Solana meme tokens attracting liquidity again, PENGU is positioning itself as a community favorite and an ETF-driven play this cycle. Rekt (REKT) Rekt (REKT) is one of September’s most surprising meme coin performers, delivering a 20% rally in the past day. Trading at just $0.0000009494 appeals to speculative buyers hunting for micro-cap gems with outsized upside. REKT Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Technical indicators suggest strong momentum. The Parabolic SAR sits below the candlesticks, pointing to an active uptrend. Analysts say REKT could push toward $0.0000053 if conditions hold, representing a huge percentage gain. Though still risky, REKT is proving that fresh meme tokens can capture investor attention and ride strong market sentiment better than established projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Beyond Shiba Inu and Dogecoin: September Top Meme Coin Watchlist The meme coin market has moved far beyond just Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Tokens like Little Pepe, Pump.fun, Bonk, Pudgy Penguin, and Rekt are reshaping the space by combining culture, infrastructure, and exchange momentum. Among these, Little Pepe stands out for its mix of meme power, presale success, and ecosystem vision. With its Mega Giveaway fueling community hype and a launch price already set above its presale, it offers one of the clearest paths to substantial early gains. Join the Little Pepe presale today and be part of the next meme coin wave.

The warning was accompanied by a claim that Moscow is intentionally slowing down the Russian economy in exchange for the ability to restrain prices. Money printing brings inflation, Putin tells party leaders Inflation will rise if the government yields to the temptation to “print and distribute money,” Putin said during a meeting with leaders of Russian parliamentary factions. The president issued the warning about the consequences of inflating the ruble while commenting on a current proposal for a quarterly adjustment of pensions in the Russian Federation. Discussing the upcoming preparation of the draft law on the country’s next budget, the Russian head of state emphasized: “This is extremely important. Many temptations arise: for example, to print money and distribute it. What will be the result? Inflation!” Attempts to improve conditions for certain groups of the population could have this outcome, Putin elaborated, quoted by the TASS news agency. In this context, the Russian leader is convinced Moscow needs to take “actions that fundamentally solve the problem.” While recognizing the importance of subsidies and state support, these should be applied “in a targeted manner,” Putin added. “During discussions with the government, you will probably choose the best options,” the president said in conclusion, making it clear that the ball is now in the lawmakers’ court. Russia slows its economy to curb inflation, Putin says During the meeting, Vladimir Putin also claimed that Russian authorities are intentionally slowing down economic growth in order to gain better control over inflation. Elaborating on the topic, he insisted: “With regard to the decline from growth rates of over 4% GDP – this is not a slump. These are deliberate actions – slowing growth in exchange for curbing inflation.” Russia’s annual GDP growth slowed to 1.4% in the first quarter of this year and to 1.1% in the second quarter, down from 4.5% at the end of 2024. Its budget deficit surged to 4.9 trillion rubles (almost $59 billion) in the first seven months of 2025. Meanwhile, inflation remained high this summer, at over 8%. This month, however, the Bank of Russia cut its benchmark interest rate by one point to 17%, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The move was part of an effort to reverse previous tightening that had taken it to 21%, with the aim of taming inflation. Putin now agrees with Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov that avoiding freezing the economy is the main priority for the Russian government. Zyuganov emphasized it’s important to recognize when overcooling occurs ahead of a potential recession. The president stressed that Russia is far from entering recession, pointing to the current state of the labor market. His statement echoed recent remarks by the head of the Central Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina. Speaking at a financial forum in Moscow, the governor urged not to confuse the currently observed economic slowdown with a recession. Quoted by the business daily Vedomosti on Wednesday, she insisted the Russian economy is still growing, albeit at a more moderate pace. Addressing the parliamentarians, Putin placed a particular emphasis on maintaining macroeconomic stability, which underpins the country’s military power. He highlighted: “Many of the issues you always consider of utmost importance depend on this. These include the state’s obligations to our citizens, the fulfillment of social commitments, as well as matters related to strengthening and enhancing Russia’s defense capabilities.” For over three years, Russia has been stubbornly waging a costly war against neighboring Ukraine, which has had a serious impact on its economy, including as a result of heavy Western sanctions targeting its banks and finances, energy revenues, and even crypto networks.

An urgent Upbit KRW suspension is on the horizon, temporarily impacting deposit and withdrawal services. Leading South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has officially announced a brief halt to account verification and Korean won (KRW) deposit and withdrawal functionalities. This temporary measure is essential for system maintenance at its banking partner, K Bank. Understanding the details of this scheduled downtime is crucial to manage your funds effectively and avoid any unexpected disruptions. What’s Behind the Upbit KRW Suspension? The upcoming Upbit KRW suspension is not an arbitrary decision but a planned maintenance event. K Bank, Upbit’s primary banking partner for KRW services, requires a system upgrade. Such maintenance periods are vital for ensuring the long-term stability, security, and efficiency of banking infrastructure that supports crypto exchanges. Think of it as a necessary tune-up for a high-performance engine. Duration: Approximately four hours. Timing: From 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. UTC on September 24th. Affected Services: Account verification, KRW deposits, and KRW withdrawals. During this window, users will not be able to initiate or complete transactions involving the Korean won. It’s a brief but important pause that requires user awareness and planning. How Does This Upbit KRW Suspension Affect You? For active traders and those planning to move funds, the Upbit KRW suspension directly impacts your immediate financial activities. If you typically rely on quick KRW transfers, this period will require some adjustments. It’s not just about depositing or withdrawing; it also means any pending verifications might be delayed. Here’s what you need to consider: Planning Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw KRW, ensure you complete these transactions well before the scheduled 5:00 p.m. UTC start time on September 24th. Alternative Strategies: While KRW services are paused, trading within Upbit using existing KRW balances or other cryptocurrencies should remain unaffected. However, fresh fiat injection or cash-out will be on hold. Impact on Trading: If you rely on fiat deposits to “buy the dip” or withdrawals after “selling the peak,” this window might restrict your immediate reaction to market movements. Being prepared is key to minimizing any inconvenience caused by this necessary maintenance. Navigating Temporary Upbit KRW Suspension: Tips for Traders A temporary Upbit KRW suspension can be a minor hurdle, but with a few proactive steps, you can navigate it smoothly. Experienced traders understand the importance of anticipating such events and planning their moves accordingly. Communication from Upbit will be crucial, and users should always refer to official announcements for the most accurate information. Consider these actionable insights: Check Your Balances: Review your KRW and crypto balances on Upbit beforehand. Set Reminders: Mark the exact suspension times in your calendar to avoid attempting transactions during the downtime. Stay Informed: Follow Upbit’s official communication channels (website, announcements) for any updates or changes to the schedule. Customer Support: While services are suspended, general inquiries can still be directed to Upbit’s customer support, though specific transaction issues might need to wait until services resume. This proactive approach ensures you’re not caught off guard and can continue your crypto journey with minimal disruption. Why Are Such Crypto Exchange Maintenance Periods Crucial? Beyond the immediate inconvenience, understanding the “why” behind an Upbit KRW suspension highlights the crucial role of robust infrastructure in the crypto world. Just like traditional banks, crypto exchanges rely on complex systems that require regular upkeep. These maintenance windows are essential for: Security Enhancements: Implementing the latest security patches and protocols to protect user assets. System Upgrades: Improving transaction speed, platform stability, and overall user experience. Compliance: Ensuring the platform adheres to evolving financial regulations and standards. Bug Fixes: Addressing any underlying technical issues to prevent future problems. Ultimately, these planned downtimes contribute to a more secure and reliable trading environment for everyone. They reflect a commitment to operational excellence and user protection. In conclusion, the temporary Upbit KRW suspension on September 24th, from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. UTC, is a necessary step for system maintenance at K Bank. While it impacts KRW deposits, withdrawals, and account verification, it’s a short-term measure designed to enhance the long-term reliability and security of Upbit’s services. By staying informed and planning your transactions in advance, you can easily navigate this brief period of downtime. Always refer to Upbit’s official announcements for the most current and accurate information regarding their services. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What services will be affected during the Upbit KRW suspension? A1: During the scheduled maintenance, account verification, Korean won (KRW) deposits, and KRW withdrawals will be temporarily unavailable. Other services, such as cryptocurrency trading, are expected to function normally. Q2: When exactly will the Upbit KRW suspension take place? A2: The services will be suspended for approximately four hours, from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. UTC on September 24th. It’s crucial to note these specific times for planning your transactions. Q3: Why is Upbit suspending KRW services? A3: The temporary suspension is due to essential system maintenance being conducted by Upbit’s banking partner, K Bank. This maintenance is crucial for ensuring the stability, security, and efficiency of the banking infrastructure that supports Upbit’s KRW services. Q4: Can I still trade cryptocurrencies on Upbit during the suspension? A4: Yes, typically, internal cryptocurrency trading using your existing balances on Upbit should remain unaffected. The suspension specifically targets KRW deposit, withdrawal, and account verification services. Q5: What should I do if I need to deposit or withdraw KRW during this period? A5: It is strongly advised to complete any necessary KRW deposits or withdrawals well in advance of the scheduled suspension time. If you miss the window, you will need to wait until services resume after 9:00 p.m. UTC on September 24th. Q6: Where can I find official updates regarding the Upbit KRW suspension?

Additional requirements include daily publication of holdings, net asset values, and liquidity policies. In addition, market makers will face trading limits and firewalls implemented to prevent misuse of non-public information.

Matrixport: US Economy Remains Resilient, Signals New Uptrend for Bitcoin The company stated that narrowing credit interest spreads reduced refinancing costs, which offset the negative impacts, particularly from tariffs. In addition, the easing of financing conditions and the increased efficiency of businesses using artificial intelligence create a solid foundation for risky assets. According to Matrixport's report, narrowing spreads historically have often coincided with strong performance in stocks and Bitcoin, so the firm predicts the current market rally could continue. Meanwhile, the report noted that inflation remains the biggest risk. While inflation is still running above target, Matrixport's models predict that rates will fall below 2% within the next few quarters, prompting the Fed to embark on a more prolonged monetary easing cycle. This expectation differs from the general market consensus, as many analysts believe fiscal policy easing and de-globalization will keep inflation high. Despite this, the likelihood of inflation exceeding 3% is low, driven by falling energy and housing costs. Matrixport noted that while the primary catalyst for Bitcoin's next rally remains unclear, a new upward trend has begun. *This is not investment advice.

Balances are scattered across different networks, bridging takes time and money, and users constantly switch wallets and chains to complete simple actions. Mono Protocol is building a new foundation for Web3 that unifies these experiences. With unified balances, instant settlement, and universal accounts, it aims to make blockchain interactions feel seamless. The project has raised $2M in a Private Round and is now running whitelist registration ahead of the presale. Mono Protocol: Solving Web3’s Biggest Problem With a Unified Design Today’s blockchain space struggles with fragmentation. Users maintain balances across several chains, bridges are slow and expensive, and front-running risks cause value loss. Developers face the added challenge of building infrastructure for multiple networks, making the experience complex on both sides. Mono Protocol addresses these issues with chain abstraction technology. By unifying per-token balances, it allows users to hold and use assets from any supported blockchain in one place. Transactions are protected with MEV-resistant routing, ensuring value is preserved during execution. Liquidity Lock technology guarantees that transactions cannot fail, which is a major step forward compared to traditional cross-chain systems. This combination creates a new standard for blockchain interaction. Developers gain access to simple APIs to build cross-chain applications without handling infrastructure overhead, while users enjoy one-click transactions across multiple ecosystems. It marks a shift from fragmented networks to a cohesive Web3 environment where complexity is invisible. One Balance, One Account, One Experience Mono Protocol introduces unified balances, instant settlement, and universal accounts that work across blockchains. This approach makes transactions simpler, faster, and free of the friction users often face today. Instead of managing assets on multiple networks, users interact with a single account and one balance. Liquidity Locks ensure transactions are guaranteed and completed instantly, while universal accounts remove the need to constantly switch networks. Together, these features reshape Web3 into a system that feels like one network rather than many disconnected chains. Utility And Economic Design Of MONO Token The MONO token powers the protocol’s ecosystem. It is used for universal gas payments, protocol fees, and routing execution costs. Developers also use MONO when integrating APIs and SDKs, with staking options that reduce fees over time. For security and governance, MONO enables operator bonding, voting on upgrades, and fee distribution to active participants. Execution bonds ensure instant settlement by introducing guarantees and penalties, while part of the supply contributes to an insurance pool. The economic model includes one billion tokens in total, with an initial circulating supply of 132.5 million. Deflationary mechanics such as buybacks, fee burns, and staking locks help stabilize long-term token dynamics. Revenue is shared across stakers, the treasury, operations, and buybacks, ensuring the ecosystem remains sustainable as adoption grows. Moving Toward A Cohesive Web3 Future Mono Protocol highlights how Web3 can evolve beyond fragmented experiences. By combining unified balances, instant settlement, and universal accounts, it simplifies blockchain use while providing developers with a strong framework to innovate. The project introduces a design where users no longer need to think about chains, tokens for gas, or bridging delays. Instead, the focus shifts to seamless execution and accessible applications that work across multiple networks. With its whitelist currently open at $0.01 following the $2M Private Round, Mono Protocol positions itself as a key step toward making blockchain feel like one connected system.

Developers building on the project now have production-ready agents that can be rented, customized, and combined with local solutions. According to a press statement shared with Cryptopolitan on Friday, the platform introduces new capabilities to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) development on blockchain ecosystems. Users can now access ready-to-use agents on demand while integrating them with their own systems. Every interaction and decision made by these agents is tracked in Coral Studio through threads and telemetry, for developers to have oversight of their workflows. Coral v1 adds remote agents on registry Per the Coral Protocol team, agent creators can list their work in the Coral Registry, a marketplace that pays out automatically whenever their agents are used. This encourages innovation by fairly compensating contributors for the value their software provides. The system debuts with full support for agent creation, acquisition, and customization. Transactions are settled through Coral’s secure on-chain payment network powered by Solana . AI builders can create collaborative systems where agents with different specialties work together, efficiently and competently. Roman Georgio, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Coral Protocol, said the release came about as a result of years of work directed towards a scalable AI ecosystem. “The launch of v1 embodies everything Coral has been working towards up until now. An AI ecosystem that can accomplish virtually anything through combining distinct agents, each with their own sphere of expertise,” the CEO told the press. Georgio also mentioned that the company is eager to observe how developers employ remote agents in solutions, which could raise the standards for on-chain collaboration. Multi-agent systems have been operationally troubling for AI blockchain developers because traditional frameworks treated agents like functions. This created heavy infrastructure demands and long development cycles, and deployment of any multi agent software was nearly impossible. Another challenge was interoperability, as most frameworks operated in isolation and lacked standardized rules for communication. Agents struggled to coordinate networks, and there was no reliable system to compensate creators, who felt innovation was a big price to pay. Much different to LangChain, Coral’s system allows developers to configure detailed interaction rules for their agents. Most frameworks require agents to function like callable algorithms, but remote agents permit systems to be built around teams and processes, closer to real-world business structures. New feature follows big benchmark performance As reported by Cryptopolitan in early August, Coral Protocol saw success after it outperformed Microsoft’s Magnetic UI by 34% on the GAIA benchmark, a rigorous test designed to evaluate AI agents in complex, real-world scenarios. The GAIA test suite features 450 advanced questions, assessing human-like problem-solving, research, and analytical reasoning. Coral’s results placed it ahead of established large language model (LLM) developers. Caelum Forder, Coral’s Chief Technology Officer, said the benchmark results were proof that the so-called “Internet of Agents” is a reality. He encouraged agent developers to “Coralize” their systems to improve scalability, asking application developers to use the protocol to reduce costs and boost its effectiveness. Coral Protocol has undergone significant changes in 2025, beginning with its rebrand from Ai23T earlier this year. The project also launched its own token on Solana in late April. As of the time of this publication, the CORAL token trades at $0.002069, more than 500% above its debut price but 40% below its all-time high of $0.003474, reached roughly four months ago. The project’s development roadmap for the remainder of 2025 features the launch of Session Contracts, on-chain agent task coordination, and Local Server and Agent Mesh tooling for deployment.

For Chinese tech companies, it necessitates a rapid pivot towards domestic alternatives. This regulatory environment creates an urgent demand for solutions like Huawei’s SuperPoD, which can fill the void left by Nvidia’s restricted access. It’s not just about technological advancement; it’s about strategic self-sufficiency in a fragmented global tech ecosystem. Elevating AI Chips: How Does Huawei Plan to Compete Effectively? The core of Huawei’s competitive strategy lies in its innovative approach to leveraging its existing AI Chips Market presence. By focusing on interconnectivity rather than solely on individual chip performance, Huawei aims to provide scalable and robust solutions for AI development. Here’s how they plan to compete: Massive Scalability: The SuperPoD Interconnect allows for an unprecedented number of chips (up to 15,000) to work in unison, delivering collective compute power that can rival larger, more powerful individual chips. Optimized for Domestic Hardware: This infrastructure is specifically designed to work seamlessly with Huawei’s Ascend AI chips, ensuring optimal performance and integration within a domestically controlled ecosystem. Strategic Independence: By developing its own full-stack AI infrastructure, Huawei reduces reliance on foreign technology, aligning with China’s broader goals of technological sovereignty. This approach highlights a crucial understanding: for many AI applications, sheer raw power from a single chip is less critical than the ability to distribute and manage vast amounts of computation across a network of processors. Huawei’s SuperPoD directly addresses this need, providing a pathway for Chinese enterprises to continue their AI development without interruption from international sanctions. Global Tech Competition: What Does This Mean for the Future of AI? The intensified Tech Competition between global powers, particularly in the realm of AI and semiconductors, has profound implications. Huawei’s latest announcement is a clear signal that China is doubling down on its efforts to build a self-reliant and advanced domestic tech industry. This could lead to: Accelerated Domestic Innovation: The necessity to innovate internally will likely spur faster development cycles and new breakthroughs within China’s tech sector. Diversification of AI Hardware: Developers and businesses worldwide may increasingly consider a broader range of AI hardware solutions, moving beyond a single dominant provider. Fragmented Tech Ecosystems: The global tech landscape might become more segmented, with different regions developing and adopting distinct hardware and software stacks, potentially impacting global interoperability. New Investment Opportunities: As new domestic champions emerge, there will be fresh avenues for investment in AI infrastructure, chip manufacturing, and related software services. For those in the cryptocurrency space, these shifts in AI infrastructure can indirectly influence mining operations, decentralized AI projects, and the overall technological backbone supporting various blockchain innovations. Greater access to diversified compute power could foster new advancements in AI-driven smart contracts, oracle networks, and secure data processing. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Development in China Huawei’s announcement of its new AI infrastructure, the SuperPoD Interconnect, marks a pivotal moment in the global AI Chips Market . In the face of the Nvidia China Ban and escalating Tech Competition , Huawei is demonstrating remarkable resilience and strategic foresight. By focusing on interconnected Huawei AI chips to deliver immense compute power , the company is not just filling a void but actively shaping a new paradigm for AI development within China. This move underscores a broader trend towards technological self-sufficiency and promises to accelerate domestic innovation, with far-reaching implications for the global tech industry and beyond.

That is the essence of EGRAG Crypto’s latest analysis, which pairs “before and after” TradingView charts with a focused X post. The message is clear: as long as XRP defends a key support zone, the path toward a major upward move remains firmly intact. The Initial Setup: “Before” the Breakout In the first chart, EGRAG illustrates a textbook symmetrical triangle pattern . Price action tightens between converging trendlines while the 21- and 33-period moving averages hug closely underneath, signaling compressed momentum. A side-panel note labels this phase the “triangle retest,” highlighting $3.00 as the critical battleground. According to EGRAG, this level marks the difference between a routine consolidation and the start of a powerful new trend. The emphasis on the interaction between the 21 EMA and 33 EMA underscores how closely moving averages align with the pattern’s structural integrity. #XRP – Ready to Move! As long as #XRP doesn’t close below $3.00 on the daily or 3-day time frame, we’re set for takeoff! A wick on lower time frames to $2.90-$2.95 is still a possibility. **************************NOTE:************************** When you start to… pic.twitter.com/yOvSHTZWIe — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 19, 2025 Confirmation: The “After” Perspective The follow-up chart captures what EGRAG calls the “after” view. Here, XRP presses against the triangle’s upper boundary and then retests the breakout line near $3.00, with the 21 EMA and 33 EMA still acting as firm support. EGRAG projects that a successful hold could propel the token toward incremental resistance in the low-$3 range, ultimately leading to a more ambitious $4.20 target derived from the triangle’s measured move. The “retest edge” highlighted in the chart effectively becomes the launchpad for a potential rally. Support and Risk Parameters EGRAG stresses one decisive rule: XRP must not close below $3.00 on the daily or three-day timeframe. Brief intraday wicks dipping to $2.90–$2.95 are acceptable. Still, a sustained close under $3.00 would invalidate the bullish thesis and shift focus to deeper support zones, including levels as low as $2.80 or even $2.00. Traders and investors are therefore urged to treat the $3.00 daily and three-day close as a non-negotiable line of defense when managing risk. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Real-Time Market Context As of report time, XRP is trading in the low-$3 range, keeping the breakout scenario very much alive. Market watchers are advised to monitor daily and three-day closes, the relative position of the 21 and 33 EMAs, and any surge in volume for confirmation. A decisive close above the $3.20–$3.30 corridor would substantially raise the probability of reaching EGRAG’s projected $4.20 objective. Conversely, a clear break below the $3.00 threshold would force a complete reassessment of the market’s upside potential. Bottom Line EGRAG Crypto’s dual-chart presentation frames a straightforward, high-stakes proposition. As long as XRP maintains daily and three-day closes above $3.00, the technical roadmap favors a strong upward move. Hold that line, and the market could be poised for a sharp advance; lose it, and the bullish structure gives way to a far more uncertain outlook.

Within 90 minutes, the fund racked up $24M in trading volume. The explosive debut has sparked hopes of a broader market rally. And as Uptober sentiment starts spreading across the market, investors are on the hunt for the best altcoins to buy now. REX-Osprey ETF Sparks Optimism REX Shares and Osprey Funds has launched the REX-Osprey $XRP ETF , the first US-based ETF tied to $XRP. The ETF offers exposure to $XRP via a Cayman Islands subsidiary. $XRP, being the third-largest crypto and backed by a cross-border payment ecosystem, has long tempted traditional investors. But many fear taking the first step. The new ETF, however, opens the door for traditional investors to access $XRP without the hassle of installing a crypto wallet or managing private keys. The fund’s strong debut surprised both investors and analysts. For example, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas describes the $24M figure as a ‘semi-shock,’ as its performance is five times stronger than $XRP futures ETFs managed on their first day. It has also sparked bullish sentiments in the crypto community, as the launch could bring more institutional capital to the $XRP ecosystem. In fact, 58% of Myriad users expect the $XRP price to hit a new all-time high of $4 . As Uptober approaches, which altcoins could follow a similar trend and moon? Here are what we’ve identified as the best altcoins to buy now. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Building A Long-Awaited Bitcoin Layer-2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one of the hottest new cryptos this season. Like $XRP, Bitcoin Hyper is an infrastructure coin with high utility – it’s building a Bitcoin Layer-2 ecosystem. Bitcoin is a brilliant store of value, as its exponential surge over the years proves. But the blockchain has failed to stay up-to-date with the times. Bitcoin’s slow max theoretical transactions per second (TPS) rate of just seven pales in comparison to Solana’s 65K . High transaction costs and lack of scalability are also among Bitcoin’s pain points. That’s why Hyper is introducing a Layer-2 designed to give Bitcoin more speed, efficiency, and scalability – while lowering transaction fees. It will bring this vision alive by integrating advanced tools, such as a non-custodial Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). You send your $BTC to a designated wallet where it will be verified and then minted on the Layer-2 as wrapped $BTC, unlocking access to DeFi, dApps, NFTs, and gaming. The SVM, meanwhile, builds a programmable layer on top of the base Bitcoin blockchain. It also makes transactions faster and cheaper, while maintaining Bitcoin-level security. That explains why both retail and whale investors are hurrying to secure the token for low prices before it hits exchanges. The viral $HYPER presale is closing in on the $17M milestone, as whales circle the project. Bitcoin Hyper has recorded $418K whale buys in September alone, across 24 large transactions. August, meanwhile, saw a particularly impressive individual whale buy of $161.3K . Right now you can buy $HYPER for $0.012945, and stake it for 68% APY. Our How To Buy Bitcoin Hyper guide explains how to do just that. By the way, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction suggests that $HYPER could deliver up to 25x gains from its presale price by the end of the year. Join the $HYPER presale before the next price increase. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – The First-Ever Mine-To-Earn Meme Coin The crypto market runs on tech and innovation, and projects $XRP and $HYPER showcase this trend. But the crypto culture welcomes fun and chaos too, as the exponential growth of the meme coin niche shows. In fact, REX-Osprey just launched the $DOJE ETF, the first US Dogecoin ETF. Yet $DOGE is a market giant with limited room for growth. That’s why Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , the world’s first mine-to-earn meme coin, has become an instant sensation among degens. In its viral new presale, the project has already raised $1.2M. So, what’s driving this FOMO? Speculation is sometimes not enough to drive token demand. $PEPENODE understands this.That’s why it has launched a gamified meme coin model that keeps investors coming back for more. Holding $PEPENODE lets you buy virtual miner nodes and facilities, build server rooms, boost hashpower, and collect $PEPENODE rewards – right from the get-go. No need to wait until the token generation event. The fun kicks in immediately. The interactive mine-to-earn system is also completely virtual, doing away with hardware and large investments. Pepenode offers other mechanisms to boost your earning potential: Receive 2% of mined rewards from users you refer Passive staking offers attractive passive income (currently at an impressive 1,019% APY) on staked tokens The platform will also burn 70% of the tokens spent on upgrades, driving the token price up over time as they become more scarce $PEPENODE is currently priced at $0.001066, but the next hike is just two days away. Check out our How To Buy Pepenode guide to find out everything you need to know. Then visit the Pepenode website today to buy and stake your tokens. 3. Ethereum ($ETH) – The OG Set To Rock Altcoin Season For investors who are more comfortable with blue-chip cryptos, Ethereum ($ETH) is an obvious choice this season. $ETH has climbed around 7.25% in the past four weeks, as the market welcomes altcoin season. The recent Fed rate cut is widely expected to boost risk appetite across financial markets, and crypto could be one of the biggest winners. Among the best crypto to buy now, giants like $ETH and $XRP, in particular, stand to benefit the most. Since Ethereum ETFs are already available, traditional investors can gain exposure to the coin without directly interacting with the crypto market. Yet frictionless access is not the only reason drawing traditional investors to Ethereum. Ethereum’s smart contract ecosystem powers everything from DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins to gaming, fueling its long-term growth. While Bitcoin tops crypto rankings, tapping into its historical relevance, the market owes its technological growth to projects like Ethereum. Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade is set to go live in November, just ahead of Devconnect, bringing 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals focused on backend infrastructure. In other words, September could be a strategic time to buy $ETH, as it prepares for a series of rallies. Buy your $ETH today via Binance and other leading platforms. Being a large-cap crypto with a massive market cap of around $545B, is it unrealistic to expect exponential returns from $ETH? Perhaps. But this is where small-cap cryptos like $HYPER and $PEPENODE shine, placing them alongside $ETH as the best altcoins to buy now. Be sure to always do your own research before investing.

Zawodnik Houston Rockets, ponownie znalazł się w nagłówkach gazet. Tym razem nie chodzi jednak o sportowe sukcesy lub transferowe plotki. Po latach Kevin Durant odzyskał Bitcoiny! KD na nowo ma dostęp do swojego dawno zapomnianego konta na Coinbase, gdzie trzymał Bitcoiny kupione niemal dekadę temu. Wartość tych aktywów wzrosła blisko 200-krotnie ! Powrót do dawno kupionych Bitcoinów Durant i jego agent, Rich Kleiman, po raz pierwszy zetknęli się z Bitcoinem w 2016 roku. Inspiracją była nietypowa okazja – urodzinowa impreza organizowana przez inwestora Bena Horowitza. Jak wspominał Kleiman podczas konferencji CNBC Game Plan w Los Angeles: Po prostu słyszałem słowo “Bitcoin” 25 razy tego wieczoru, a następnego dnia zaczęliśmy inwestować w Bitcoina. W ówczas cena jednej monety oscylowała wokół 600 dolarów. Dziś to już blisko 117 tysięcy dolarów , co oznacza niemal 200-krotny wzrost wartości. Problemem przez lata były jednak utracone dane logowania. Durant nie miał dostępu do środków, a portfel na Coinbase pozostawał zamrożony. Teraz, dzięki pomocy zespołu wsparcia Coinbase i narzędzi do resetowania, sprawa została rozwiązana. Brian Armstrong, CEO Coinbase, potwierdził sukces całej operacji w poście na platformie X. We got this fixed. Account recovery complete! https://t.co/TWYFpQkXsb — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 19, 2025 Durant – inwestor, sportowiec i partner Coinbase To nie pierwszy raz, gdy Durant pojawia się w kontekście Coinbase. Razem z Kleimanem inwestował w tę giełdę już w 2017 roku poprzez firmę venture capital Thirty Five Ventures. Od 2021 roku pełnił też funkcję ambasadora marki. Jego relacja ze światem kryptowalut rozwijała się równolegle z karierą koszykarską, Durant wpisuje się w trend sportowców sięgających po kryptowaluty. Tristan Thompson niedawno uruchomił własny projekt Web3, a Spencer Dinwiddie próbował nawet tokenizować swój kontrakt NBA. To dowód, że sektor sportu i blockchainu zacieśnia więzi szybciej, niż wielu mogło się spodziewać. Nowe pokolenie projektów Historia Duranta to przypomnienie, że wczesna decyzja inwestycyjna w Bitcoin mogła zmienić przyszłość finansową każdego, kto wykazał się cierpliwością. Ale dziś, obok klasycznego Bitcoina, na rynku pojawiają się projekty rozwijające jego potencjał. Jednym z nich jest Bitcoin Hyper. Bitcoin Hyper to innowacyjna warstwa druga, która łączy moc sieci Bitcoin z funkcjonalnościami znanymi z DeFi . Twórcy wykorzystali Solana Virtual Machine, aby transakcje były błyskawiczne i tanie, a jednocześnie dodali mechanizmy stakingu i obsługi aplikacji zdecentralizowanych. Rdzeniem systemu jest token $HYPER , zgodny ze standardami ERC-20 i BEP-20. Użytkownicy mogą nim zarządzać przez popularne portfele, takie jak MetaMask, Trust Wallet czy Best Wallet . Most między Bitcoinem a DeFi Unikalnym elementem Bitcoin Hyper jest tzw. Bitcoin Relay. Dzięki niemu użytkownik może przenieść swoje BTC do warstwy drugiej i otrzymać token reprezentacyjny. Ten token działa w ekosystemie Hyper i otwiera dostęp do nowoczesnych usług finansowych od yield farmingu, przez pożyczki, aż po zdecentralizowane giełdy. Co ważne, wypłata środków odbywa się bez pośredników. System synchronizuje transakcje z głównym łańcuchem Bitcoina i zabezpiecza je za pomocą technologii zero-knowledge proofs. To rozwiązanie zwiększa prywatność i skalowalność całej sieci. Dzięki temu Bitcoin Hyper buduje pomost między najbardziej rozpoznawalną kryptowalutą świata a nową generacją narzędzi finansowych. Można powiedzieć, że gdy Durant zyskał na swojej pasywnej inwestycji w BTC, nowe projekty takie jak $HYPER pozwalają aktywnie wykorzystywać ten kapitał. Staking bez blokady Wielu inwestorów odstraszają skomplikowane mechanizmy stakingu, które wymagają blokady środków na określony czas. Bitcoin Hyper eliminuje tę barierę. Nagrody naliczane są automatycznie od momentu zakupu tokena . Środki można wypłacić w dowolnym momencie, co daje większą elastyczność i swobodę. To rozwiązanie szczególnie przemawia do osób, które dopiero rozpoczynają przygodę z kryptowalutami. Podobnie jak Durant w 2016 roku, nie trzeba być ekspertem, aby skorzystać z potencjału nowej technologii. Bezpieczeństwo i przejrzystość Każdy projekt nowych najlepszych memecoinów musi mierzyć się z pytaniem o bezpieczeństwo. W przypadku Bitcoin Hyper audyt przeprowadziła firma Coinsult. Analiza kodu nie wykazała żadnych luk ani mechanizmów umożliwiających manipulację podażą. To podejście kontrastuje z wieloma memecoinami, które opierają się głównie na marketingu. Hyper łączy innowacyjną technologię z zasadami otwartego rynku, co może zainteresować inwestorów szukających bardziej zrównoważonych projektów. Ekosystem i przyszłość Whitepaper Bitcoin Hyper dzieli rozwój na trzy etapy. Pierwszy to uruchomienie warstwy 2 i stakingu. Kolejny to wdrożenie. Ostatni etap to ozszerzenie interoperacyjności na inne łańcuchy, takie jak Polygon czy Arbitrum. Część funkcji jest już aktywna. Działa most BTC, staking i podstawowe aplikacje DeFi. Projekt ma ambicje stać się integralną częścią Web3, łącząc społeczności różnych sieci blockchain. Dzięki kompatybilności z ERC-20 i BEP-20, $HYPER już teraz integruje się z dziesiątkami narzędzi dostępnych na rynku. Nowy rozdział w relacji sportu i blockchaina Historia Kevina Duranta to przykład, jak technologia zmienia życie nie tylko inwestorów, ale też osób spoza świata finansów . Niegdyś przypadkowa rozmowa na urodzinach doprowadziła go do inwestycji, która dziś jest warta fortunę. Odzyskanie dostępu do konta Coinbase przypomina, że cierpliwość i otwartość na nowe rozwiązania mogą przynieść nieoczekiwane efekty. Jednocześnie pojawienie się projektów takich jak Bitcoin Hyper dowodzi, że rynek kryptowalut nie stoi w miejscu. Z jednej strony mamy klasyczny Bitcoin – symbol stabilności i cyfrowego złota. Z drugiej – innowacyjne sieci warstwy drugiej, które oferują błyskawiczne transakcje, staking i integrację z DeFi.

Nasdaq-listed company FG Nexus (FGNX) recently announced a substantial increase in its Ethereum holdings , pushing its total to an impressive 49,715 ETH. This strategic accumulation, valued at approximately $229 million, underscores a clear ambition: to become the leading corporate holder of Ethereum. What’s Driving FG Nexus’s Impressive Ethereum Holdings Growth? FG Nexus has been methodically expanding its digital asset portfolio. The latest surge in their Ethereum holdings comes from two primary sources, showcasing a well-rounded approach to asset growth: Staking Rewards: A portion of the increase is attributed to rewards earned from staking their existing Ethereum. Staking is a process where participants lock up their cryptocurrency to support the network’s operations, in return for new coin rewards. Additional Purchase: The company also made a direct purchase of 1,087 ETH, further solidifying its position. This direct acquisition highlights a proactive investment strategy. This calculated expansion is not merely about holding assets; it is about positioning FG Nexus as a major player in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Their stated goal of becoming the largest corporate holder of Ethereum signals a strong belief in the asset’s long-term value and utility. Why Are More Companies Building Significant Ethereum Holdings? The trend of corporations accumulating cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum, is gaining momentum. Companies are increasingly recognizing the potential of digital assets beyond just speculative trading. Here are a few reasons why firms like FG Nexus are boosting their Ethereum holdings : Diversification: Adding digital assets can diversify a company’s treasury holdings, potentially offering a hedge against traditional market fluctuations. Growth Potential: Ethereum, as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and countless decentralized applications, offers substantial growth potential. Its robust ecosystem makes it an attractive long-term investment. Technological Alignment: For tech-focused companies, holding Ethereum can align with their innovative ethos and provide direct exposure to the evolving Web3 landscape. Strategic Positioning: Being an early and significant holder can offer a competitive advantage as the digital economy matures. Furthermore, the increasing institutional infrastructure supporting crypto investments makes it easier and more secure for public companies to manage their digital assets. What Does This Significant Increase in Ethereum Holdings Mean for the Broader Market? FG Nexus’s bold move carries implications for the wider cryptocurrency market. A major Nasdaq-listed entity publicly increasing its Ethereum holdings can: Boost Confidence: It sends a strong signal of institutional confidence in Ethereum’s stability and future prospects, potentially encouraging other corporations to consider similar strategies. Validate Ethereum’s Utility: Such a significant investment from a traditional finance player further validates Ethereum’s role as a foundational technology, not just a speculative asset. Influence Market Dynamics: Large corporate holdings can reduce the circulating supply of ETH, which could, over time, impact its market dynamics. While the benefits are clear, challenges such as market volatility and evolving regulatory landscapes remain important considerations for any corporate entity venturing into significant digital asset investments. However, FG Nexus appears committed to navigating these complexities. FG Nexus’s ambition to become the largest corporate holder of Ethereum is a testament to the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Their strategy, combining staking rewards with direct purchases, offers a blueprint for other companies looking to build substantial Ethereum holdings . This development not only highlights FG Nexus’s forward-thinking approach but also underscores the increasing institutional validation of Ethereum as a crucial digital asset for the future.

A powerful group of U.S. lawmakers is urgently demanding more clarity and information from the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding a pending agreement. This agreement seeks to lift critical compliance monitoring obligations for Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The move has sparked considerable debate and concern among industry observers and regulators alike. Why Are Lawmakers Questioning the Binance Settlement? In a strongly worded letter addressed to the DOJ, several prominent lawmakers, including the outspoken crypto industry critic Senator Elizabeth Warren, have voiced serious reservations. Their primary concern revolves around the department’s alleged failure to adequately verify Binance’s claims. These claims assert that the exchange has fully paid its substantial Binance settlement fine and is now in complete compliance with all mandated requirements. This lack of verification, they argue, leaves too many unanswered questions. Lawmakers doubt proper verification of Binance’s compliance. Concerns over the payment of the Binance settlement fine. Demands for concrete evidence of adherence to all regulatory obligations. Moreover, the timing of the DOJ’s potential action to ease compliance monitoring has fueled further suspicion. This decision comes amidst growing public awareness of Binance’s developing financial relationships with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance (DeFi) project reportedly linked to the Trump family. This connection has raised eyebrows and intensified calls for transparency. The Unanswered Questions: Trump Family Ties and the Binance Settlement The lawmakers’ letter highlights a critical point: they had previously submitted detailed questions about Binance to the DOJ back in May. Disappointingly, they claim to have received no adequate response to those inquiries. Now, with the new developments surrounding WLFI, they have escalated their demands, requesting a comprehensive and updated answer by October 1. This deadline underscores the urgency of their concerns regarding the Binance settlement . Previous inquiries in May went unanswered by the DOJ. A new, firm deadline of October 1 has been set for a comprehensive response. Lawmakers are focusing on the potential influence of external financial ties on the DOJ’s decisions. The alleged financial ties between Binance and WLFI, a project associated with the Trump family, introduce a complex layer to the ongoing Binance settlement discussions. Critics suggest that such connections could potentially influence the DOJ’s decisions regarding Binance’s monitoring obligations, raising questions about fairness and impartiality in regulatory oversight. This situation adds significant weight to the lawmakers’ demand for full disclosure. What Are the Implications of This Scrutiny for the Binance Settlement? This intensified scrutiny has broad implications for Binance, the cryptocurrency industry, and the integrity of regulatory processes. For Binance, a failure to convincingly demonstrate full compliance could prolong its period of enhanced oversight and potentially lead to further punitive actions. The exchange’s reputation, already impacted by its past legal troubles, is once again at stake. For the broader crypto market, this situation could trigger: Increased calls for stricter oversight of large exchanges globally. Potential for new legislative measures designed to prevent conflicts of interest in crypto dealings. A push for greater transparency in all cryptocurrency-related financial dealings and partnerships. Furthermore, the situation puts the Department of Justice under immense pressure to uphold its commitment to impartial enforcement. The public and lawmakers expect a thorough and unbiased investigation into the compliance status of the Binance settlement , irrespective of any external political or financial connections. This incident serves as a crucial test of the DOJ’s accountability and independence. The unfolding narrative around the Binance settlement and its alleged connections to politically influential families highlights the intricate challenges facing the cryptocurrency space. As US lawmakers push for answers, the demand for transparency, rigorous compliance, and impartial regulatory oversight has never been more critical. The outcome of this inquiry will undoubtedly set important precedents for future cryptocurrency regulation and reinforce the necessity of unwavering integrity in the digital asset landscape. The world watches as the DOJ faces its deadline. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main concern of US lawmakers regarding the Binance settlement? A: Lawmakers are primarily concerned that the Department of Justice has not adequately verified Binance’s claims of full compliance and payment of its settlement fine, questioning the transparency and impartiality of the process. Q2: Who are the key lawmakers involved in questioning the DOJ? A: The group includes prominent figures such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a well-known critic of the cryptocurrency industry. Q3: What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and its alleged connection? A: World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a DeFi project that lawmakers allege has financial ties with Binance and is reportedly linked to the Trump family, raising suspicions about potential influence. Q4: Why is the timing of the DOJ’s action suspicious to lawmakers? A: Lawmakers find the timing suspicious because the DOJ’s potential move to lift compliance monitoring obligations for Binance coincides with Binance’s developing financial ties to WLFI, a project with political connections. Q5: What is the deadline for the DOJ to respond to the lawmakers’ demands? A: The lawmakers have requested an updated and comprehensive answer from the DOJ by October 1. Q6: What are the potential implications of this scrutiny for Binance? A: This scrutiny could prolong Binance’s enhanced oversight, potentially lead to further punitive actions, and impact its reputation, while also setting precedents for future cryptocurrency regulation and demanding greater transparency across the industry.

It will launch on the Holesky testnet on October 1, followed by Sepolia on October 14, Hoodi on October 28, and the mainnet on December 3. Details of the Launch Christine Kim, former Vice President of Research at Galaxy Digital, shared these details on X, noting that developers will reconfirm the exact dates, epoch numbers, and timings over the next few days. Ethereum’s upcoming Fusaka release marks the next major protocol upgrade following Pectra. It introduces 11 proposals designed to improve scalability, node stability, and validator performance. Key changes include PeerDAS, which helps with data availability sampling and controlling spam, as well as an increase in blob capacity and a higher gas limit of 150 million units. These updates are expected to lower Layer 2 (L2) rollup costs and increase transaction throughput, while also laying the groundwork for future improvements such as faster block times and Verkle tree integration. Preliminary analysis on Devnet-5 has shown that blob capacity should more than double over the two weeks following its activation. Developers also shared the BPO hard fork plan for Fusaka, with Kim explaining that it will initially launch without changes to blob capacity. After the first week, the fork will raise the blob target and maximum from 6/9 to 10/15, followed by a second update a week later that increases the values to 14/21. Fusaka to Boost Scalability and Cut L2 Costs If all goes as planned, the release will arrive just seven months after the Pectra upgrade, which introduced wallet enhancements and raised the validator limit to support more efficient staking. Before this, Dencun went live in March 2024, enabling blob transactions and boosting Layer-2 scalability. These developments have made Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more scalable. Following Dencun’s launch, L2 rollups saw data availability costs drop by 90%, with some protocols cutting monthly expenses from $15,000 to $1,500 by switching to blob transactions. This shift also reduced transaction fees by up to 73% while Pectra raised the validator limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. Fusaka now builds on these foundations as part of the network’s “Surge” phase, targeting throughput and resilience through expanded blob capacity, validator optimizations, and PeerDAS integration. Elsewhere, developer Davide Crapis announced that the Ethereum Foundation is forming a new artificial intelligence unit called the dAI Team. Its main priorities include enabling AI agents and robots to handle payments, coordination, and governance independently. The team will also work on building open and verifiable systems that resist censorship and limit control by centralized players.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently issued a significant warning: Russia sanctions crypto platforms will feel a direct impact. This declaration signals a new era where geopolitical tensions directly intersect with the burgeoning cryptocurrency ecosystem, prompting crucial questions about compliance, security, and the future of decentralized finance. It’s a development that every participant in the crypto space, from individual traders to large exchanges, needs to understand. Understanding the Direct Impact of Russia Sanctions Crypto Platforms When the EU Commission President speaks about the effects of sanctions, it’s a clear and powerful signal for the entire crypto industry. The primary goal of these international sanctions is to restrict Russia’s access to global financial systems and resources. Now, this critical net is explicitly extending to digital assets, making it harder for sanctioned entities to bypass traditional banking restrictions. What specific impacts are we talking about? Increased Scrutiny: Cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers are now under heightened pressure to comply with international sanctions. Regulators expect them to actively prevent any circumvention attempts. Enhanced Regulatory Compliance: Platforms must significantly strengthen their Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. This rigorous approach is vital to identify and prevent sanctioned individuals or entities from using cryptocurrencies to bypass traditional financial restrictions. Potential Asset Freezing: There is a growing potential for digital assets linked to sanctioned parties to be frozen or seized. This action would mirror the measures already taken in the traditional banking sector against specific individuals and organizations. This strategic move highlights a growing global effort to regulate the crypto space, especially in times of international conflict. It underscores that while cryptocurrencies offer the promise of decentralization, they are not entirely immune to governmental oversight and legal frameworks. Navigating the Challenges: How Will Russia Sanctions Crypto Users? The ripple effects of these sanctions extend beyond just the platforms themselves. Individual users, especially those interacting with centralized exchanges, will likely experience significant changes and new requirements. So, what does this mean for the average crypto holder and those active in the DeFi space? More Rigorous Verification: Users might face more stringent identity checks and transaction monitoring processes on centralized exchanges. This is a direct consequence of platforms needing to prove their compliance. Access Restrictions: Individuals or entities identified as being in sanctioned regions or linked to sanctioned activities could find their access to certain crypto services restricted or even entirely blocked. This impacts both sending and receiving funds. Decentralized Dilemma: While decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are designed to be permissionless, the pressure on front-end interfaces, developers, and even stablecoin issuers to comply could still create access barriers for some users. The debate over true decentralization versus regulatory demands intensifies. The core challenge lies in balancing the innovative, decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies with the imperative of national security and international law. This tension is becoming increasingly evident as regulators worldwide grapple with effective digital asset oversight. Actionable Insights for Russia Sanctions Crypto Compliance and Security For both platforms and individual users, proactive measures are absolutely essential to navigate this evolving and complex regulatory landscape. Staying ahead of changes is key to minimizing risks. How can you ensure compliance and safeguard your digital assets? Stay Critically Informed: Regularly monitor official announcements from key regulatory bodies like the EU Commission, the U.S. Treasury, and national financial authorities. Information is your best defense. Understand Your Platform’s Policies: Familiarize yourself with the compliance policies of the exchanges and services you use. Understand their stance on international sanctions and how they implement them. Practice Due Diligence: For platforms, this means implementing robust screening tools and ongoing transaction monitoring. For users, it means being acutely aware of the origin and destination of your crypto transactions and avoiding any interaction with known sanctioned entities. Seek Expert Legal Counsel: Businesses operating in the crypto space, particularly those with international reach, should seek expert legal advice. This ensures full compliance with complex and constantly changing international sanction regimes. The overarching goal is to maintain the integrity of the global financial system while allowing legitimate innovation in the digital asset space to flourish. This requires careful consideration, responsible practices, and a commitment to transparency from all participants. Conclusion: The statement from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen regarding the impact of Russia sanctions crypto platforms is a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the urgent need for robust compliance, transparent operations, and a clear understanding of evolving regulatory expectations. As the digital asset landscape continues to mature, its intersection with global geopolitics will only become more pronounced, demanding vigilance and adaptability from all participants. This is a critical juncture for the future of crypto, shaping how digital assets will be perceived and regulated on the world stage. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are the EU sanctions against Russia targeting in the crypto space? A1: The EU sanctions aim to prevent Russia and sanctioned entities from using cryptocurrencies to bypass traditional financial restrictions. This means platforms must implement stricter KYC/AML checks and potentially freeze assets linked to sanctioned parties. Q2: Will these sanctions affect all cryptocurrency platforms equally? A2: Centralized exchanges and regulated service providers are most directly affected due to their legal obligations. Decentralized platforms face different challenges, but pressure on their front-ends and associated services can still impact users. Q3: What should individual crypto users do to comply with these sanctions? A3: Individual users should stay informed about regulatory changes, understand their chosen platform’s compliance policies, and ensure they are not inadvertently interacting with sanctioned entities. More rigorous identity verification might be required. Q4: Is there a risk of my crypto assets being frozen due to these sanctions? A4: If your assets are held on a centralized exchange and are linked to a sanctioned individual, entity, or region, there is a risk of them being frozen to comply with international law. Always ensure your transactions are legitimate and compliant. Q5: How does this impact the broader vision of decentralized finance (DeFi)? A5: This development highlights the ongoing tension between true decentralization and regulatory demands. While DeFi aims to be permissionless, the need for compliance can lead to challenges for front-end access, stablecoin issuers, and other components of the DeFi ecosystem.

REX-Osprey XRP ETF opens with $37.7M volume, marking the biggest ETF debut in 2025. High-volume liquidity between $3–$3.05 supports the price; resistance is expected near the $3.3–$3.5 zone. Technical Setup Points to Breakout Potential XRP is trading near $3.05, showing a weekly gain of just under 2%. The chart shows a bull flag pattern on the weekly timeframe, which typically appears after a sharp upward move. This setup has traders watching a possible short-term target around $5.8, based on the flagpole projection. Looking back further, XRP broke out of a larger consolidation channel that had been in place since early 2024. That broader move gives a longer-term target close to $15. Momentum, as measured by RSI, sits just below 60—an area that reflects strength without entering overbought conditions. Source: Zenia/X Notably, the REX-Osprey XRP ETF, listed on Cboe under the ticker XRPR, posted $37.7 million in trading volume on its opening day. That made it the most actively traded ETF debut of the year. Data shared by Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg confirmed it outpaced the previous record set by the Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (IVES). Market analyst Zenia noted that XRP’s price setup is now backed by structural developments. She said new partnerships with DBS and Franklin Templeton add further weight. Referring to past cycles, she wrote, “Will the ETF era finally give XRP the sustained breakout that past cycles failed to hold?” Pullback to Key Support Zone Short-term price action shows XRP recently formed a double bottom near $3, which triggered a move to around $3.13. The price is now testing $3.08, a zone acting as short-term support. According to market watcher BitGuru, “Holding this zone could set the stage for another upward push, while losing it may invite more consolidation.” So far, the price structure remains stable. If buyers defend this level, the next test could be toward the recent high. If not, the market may look back toward the $3 area as the next support. Source: BitGuru/X Liquidity Map Highlights Key Levels Volume data on the 1-hour chart shows strong activity between $3 and $3.05, marking this as an area of high liquidity. This level has supported multiple tests and is now viewed as a zone of active trading interest. Analysis shared by Cryptoinsightuk shows that above this range, resistance could build near $3.3–$3.5, where larger order clusters are visible. $XRP hourly and daily liquidity pic.twitter.com/luKbmmQMkZ — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 19, 2025 If XRP holds the current support and volume increases, those higher levels may come into play. Below current prices, the next low-liquidity area sits near $2.8, which may draw attention if the market weakens. For now, XRP remains inside a tight structure with growing interest from both traders and institutions.

Accordingly, Yakovenko stated that there is a “50/50” chance of a breakthrough in quantum computing by 2030, and said that the Bitcoin community should “speed things up.” Yakovenko warned that quantum computing could break Bitcoin's ECDSA within 5 years and stated that quantum-resistant signatures should be adopted. “There is an urgent need to migrate Bitcoin’s cryptographic infrastructure to quantum-resistant signatures. There will be a major quantum breakthrough in 5 years. Quantum computers will theoretically be able to solve Bitcoin's existing elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA). That's why Bitcoin needs to move fast to surpass quantum by 2030.” Anatoly Yakovenko said that in response to quantum risks, Solana has taken a proactive step by introducing Winternitz Vault, a quantum-safe security feature. According to Yakovenko, the solution uses hash-based Winternitz One-Time Signatures (WOTS) that generate a new cryptographic key for each transaction. This approach minimizes the exposure of public keys that could be targeted by quantum attacks. It is predicted that quantum computers will eventually be able to break today's encryption, creating security concerns for users in the blockchain industry. *This is not investment advice.
