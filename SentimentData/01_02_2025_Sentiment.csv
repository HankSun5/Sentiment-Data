Three standout picks are Arctic Pablo Coin , Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW), and Mog Coin (MOG). Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining traction among the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025, bringing a frosty twist to meme culture. MEW thrives on its unique feline-in-dog-world concept, while MOG capitalizes on internet virality. These coins blend humor with investment appeal, attracting traders eager for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. With meme coins on the rise, these projects could deliver substantial returns—research before diving in! Arctic Pablo Coin: An Adventurous Expedition into Crypto Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin; it’s an adventurous journey that bridges myth and reality. The narrative follows Arctic Pablo, a daring explorer navigating icy terrains and uncovering mystical $APC coins. These shimmering tokens symbolize prosperity and potential, inviting investors to join Pablo on his thrilling expedition. The presale structure of Arctic Pablo is uniquely designed around Pablo’s travels, with each phase representing a different mythical location. Currently, in its 8th location, Shangri-La, the coin is priced at $0.000047. Investors have a golden opportunity here: a $100 investment would yield 2,127,595.00 APCs, which could balloon to $17,020.76 upon reaching the listing price of $0.008. This represents a staggering 16,936% return on investment from the current price to the listing price. Beyond the presale, Arctic Pablo offers a generous 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) staking program. By staking APC tokens, investors can watch their holdings grow, with all staked coins vested for a two-month period from the launch date. Additionally, the project employs a deflationary mechanism by burning unsold tokens at the end of each week during the presale, enhancing scarcity and potential value. With over $740,000 raised so far, Arctic Pablo is gaining significant traction. The combination of its adventurous narrative, strategic presale structure, and attractive staking rewards positions it as one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): The Feline Challenger in the Meme Coin Arena In a crypto landscape dominated by dog-themed coins, Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) emerges as a feline contender, offering a fresh perspective. Launched on the Solana blockchain, MEW aims to carve out its niche by challenging the status quo. As of now, MEW is trading at approximately $0.0044, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $20 million. The total supply stands at 88.88 billion MEW tokens, all of which are currently in circulation. Despite a decline from its all-time high of $0.01288 in November 2024, MEW remains up significantly from its all-time low in March 2024. MEW’s strength lies in its community-driven approach. Partnerships with animation studios and integration into pop culture have bolstered its appeal, making it more than just a meme coin. The project employs a strategic burning mechanism and airdrops to build community, value, and scarcity, quickly gaining traction in the Solana ecosystem. For investors seeking the best meme coins to buy for 2025, MEW offers a compelling narrative and a dedicated community, positioning it as a noteworthy contender in the meme coin space. Mog Coin (MOG): Riding the Wave of Viral Popularity Mog Coin (MOG) has been making significant waves in the meme coin space, leveraging its viral community-driven presence to maintain momentum. Positioned within the Ethereum and Base ecosystems, MOG thrives on social engagement and memetic appeal. Currently, MOG boasts a market cap of approximately $454.62 million, with a total supply of 390.56 trillion MOG tokens. Over the past 24 hours, its trading volume surged by 25.75% to $19.89 million, reflecting strong market activity. Despite being 71.06% below its all-time high of $0.054022 in December 2024, MOG has delivered an astronomical 7,096,604.21% gain since its all-time low in July 2023. The project’s success is largely attributed to its community-driven approach, leveraging social media platforms to foster engagement and drive interest. As the broader meme coin sector remains volatile, MOG continues to attract both traders and long-term believers, with bullish sentiment dominating its community discussions. For those exploring the best meme coins to buy for 2025, Mog Coin presents an intriguing opportunity, especially for investors looking to capitalize on community-driven momentum.

The Virginia-based firm’s press statement revealed plans to raise $563 million through a Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK) offering. This move aligns with the company’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, further solidifying its position as a corporate leader in cryptocurrency investments. MicroStrategy’s MSTR Stock Climbs As More Shares Are Expected The Nasdaq-listed company announced it will issue 7.3 million STRK shares at $80 each. The deal is expected to close on February 5, 2025, pending standard closing conditions. This deal estimation is poised to bring in $563.4 million in net proceeds. As usual, all the profits will be funneled into buying more Bitcoin and other corporate purposes. MicroStrategy’s Chairman Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy has gained substantial shareholder support. A recent vote approved the issuance of additional shares, meaning more capital raises could be coming soon. This would further cement the company’s status as the world’s most aggressive corporate Bitcoin buyer. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has reacted positively. Following the STRK offering announcement, MSTR rebounded to around $340, logging a 17% year-to-date gain. MicroStrategy and Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation Spree MicroStrategy has used every available financial tool for the past four years to buy Bitcoin. This varied from convertible notes to direct stock offerings. It recently bought 10,107 BTC valued at $1.1 billion , marking twelve weeks of aggressive Bitcoin purchases. Following the transaction, the company announced a redemption notice for its 2027 convertible senior tranche , valued at $1.05 billion. With another $563 million incoming, MicroStrategy is making it clear that it has no plans to slow down. Bitcoin Stays Unshaken Despite MicroStrategy’s commitment, Bitcoin has yet to respond to the news. The world’s largest cryptocurrency remains below the $105,000 support level, showing no immediate reaction to the company’s latest BTC accumulation plans. Still, history suggests that MicroStrategy’s persistent buying could contribute to long-term bullish momentum. With Saylor’s unwavering Bitcoin conviction and fresh capital on hand, all eyes are now on MicroStrategy’s next big BTC purchase.

Meanwhile, Web3Bay, a pioneering blockchain-based e-commerce platform, is making waves, not just disrupting marketplaces but redefining commerce itself. As Solana capitalizes on its robust tech and Binance leverages its diverse offerings, Web3Bay introduces a new model of transparency, inclusivity, and community-led governance. With its presale already raising over $1,000,0000, the platform is drawing significant interest, promising investors a potential 6,430% return. Investors are now evaluating which of these initiatives will offer the most transformative growth. Solana Price Set for 25% Increase Amid Positive Signals Solana (SOL) is gearing up for a significant upswing, with chart patterns suggesting a move toward $330 could be imminent. If the Solana price can overcome the $270 resistance and maintain its drive, a 25% increase is likely soon. A Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 54 supports this positive outlook. Enhancing this optimism, Solana’s DEXs have recently outperformed Ethereum in trading volume, as reported by DeFiLlama, signaling rising confidence in Solana’s capabilities. Data from Coinglass also shows a noteworthy $40.6 million in SOL withdrawals from exchanges in 24 hours, indicating strong accumulation by long-term investors, which could propel the Solana price further. Binance Coin Set for $1,000 as Positive Patterns Surface Binance Coin (BNB) is capturing interest as it approaches its peak price levels, sparking talk of a surge up to $1,000. It’s currently priced at $682.35 and has been relatively stable, with a minor decrease of 0.26% in the last 24 hours. Yet, its market capitalization stands strong at $97.23 billion, making it the sixth largest in the crypto sector. Market experts are feeling positive about Binance Coin’s price movements, having recently emerged from a falling wedge pattern—an upbeat sign that suggests gains ahead. After confirming the pattern’s breakout, predictions suggest it could soon surpass $700, potentially reaching $1,000 soon. Furthermore, Binance Labs has evolved into YZi Labs, branching out into AI and biotechnology. This expansion could bolster the ecosystem and ensure long-term viability, indirectly aiding Binance Coin’s price growth. However, traders should tread carefully as volatility is expected, with current analyses indicating possible fluctuations around $683. Overcoming the $720 resistance could push BNB to revisit its earlier high of $790 and possibly exceed it. Should it drop below $630, the price could fall to $570. Currently, Binance Coin offers a notable chance for investors seeking significant gains. Web3Bay: Transforming Online Shopping with Blockchain Imagine a market where users rule, not big companies—enter Web3Bay. This decentralized shopping platform is changing how we buy online by cutting out intermediaries, reducing fees, and returning control of data and assets to its users. Web3Bay is built on blockchain, providing a safe, clear, and welcoming space that’s open to everyone, not just crypto fans, who are ready for a new era in shopping. The heart of Web3Bay is the 3BAY token, which is more than just money. It gives users benefits like 5% off buys, rewards for staking, and even a vote in its future direction with its upcoming DAO. The platform’s plans are bold, aiming to bring in NFT markets and work across different blockchains, making Web3Bay a key player in Web3 commerce. The buzz is real, as the presale has already brought in over 1000,000, selling more than 260 million tokens at just $0.004562 each. Early backers are looking at a staggering 6,430% ROI when the token hits the market at $0.1959. Web3Bay isn’t just an investment—it’s your ticket to a movement that could change global commerce forever. Don’t just watch; be part of the future. Final Say Solana’s strong signs and expanding community activities make it a thrilling choice for traders looking for quick profits, while Binance Coin’s smart expansion plans offer a solid base with huge growth possibilities. Yet, Web3Bay is in a league of its own, blending blockchain tech with practical daily use. Its model to spread out commerce, reward community involvement, and add cutting-edge tech makes it more than a crypto venture—it’s a blueprint for tomorrow’s e-commerce. As its presale picks up speed and its growth path is clear, Web3Bay draws those who support innovative changes. Solana and Binance might excel in their areas, but for anyone eyeing the next big blockchain marketplace, Web3Bay stands out. The future of crypto is not just about currency—it’s about revolutionizing industries, and Web3Bay is at the forefront.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

Solana Stablecoin Supply Jumps 73% Since Mid-January,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/trump-effect-solana-stablecoin-supply-jumps-73-since-mid-january/,"An unprecedented stablecoin supply of 73% has occurred on the Solana blockchain since the middle of January. A new initiative that has captured the attention of the crypto community, the $TRUMP memecoin, was launched at the same time as this spike. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Spikes 5% In A Day—Will the Rally Continue? Solana has been a significant actor in the crypto space for a long time; however, the release of this memecoin has sparked new interest, propelling the network’s stablecoin ecosystem to new heights. TRUMP Token Drives Significant Stablecoin Supply Increase Its launch spurred activity on Solana’s distributed markets and further investments into the network. More stablecoins are now available thanks to the rise of money entering the market, therefore enhancing Solana’s significance as a key blockchain for distributed finance. Its debut attracted new investments to the network and increased activity on Solana’s decentralized markets. The increase in money flowing into the market has led to more stablecoins being available, boosting Solana’s role as an important blockchain for decentralized finance. After Donald Trump launched his memecoin, $TRUMP, on Solana, the network saw a spike in money inflows, leading to record [decentralized exchange] trade activity, according to CCData. CCData reports that Solana has overtaken BNB Chain as the third-largest blockchain network in terms of stablecoin supply. It continues to fall behind Tron and Ethereum. SOLANA STABLECOIN SUPPLY SKYROCKETS 73% -WHAT’S DRIVING IT? Solana just hit $11.1B in stablecoin supply, jumping 73% since mid-Jan. Big catalyst?

Now Solana’s the #3 blockchain for stablecoins,… pic.twitter.com/9WAow0sKFd — IBC Group Official (@ibcgroupio) January 31, 2025 USD Coin Dominates Solana Stablecoin Market USD Coin (USDC) continues to be the most prevalent stablecoin asset in Solana, accounting for an impressive 78% of the network’s total stablecoin supply. The token’s widespread adoption across decentralized applications (dApps) and Solana’s ongoing relationship with Circle are both distinct indications of USDC’s dominance. In contrast, USDT, representing merely 12% of the stablecoin supply on Solana, bags the second place. This dynamic illustrates the impact of USDC’s preeminence on Solana’s stablecoin market, notwithstanding the sporadic appearance of alternative currencies like USDt. Solana’s Recent User Growth In addition to having an effect on Solana’s stablecoin market, the excitement around the $TRUMP token has significantly increased the number of on-chain users. Hundreds of thousands of new users have joined the Solana network in an attempt to join the $TRUMP frenzy.

According to a new blog post, Kraken says that its revenue and trading volumes doubled in 2024 compared to what it did in 2023. Kraken attributes its growth last year to the company’s focus on improving execution. “Our relentless execution is evidenced by our 2024 financial highlights, which we are releasing for the first time in Kraken history. In 2024, we saw revenue of $1.5 billion (up 128% year-over-year) and $380 million in adjusted EBITDA. During the year, clients entrusted us with $42.8 billion in assets on the platform and 2.5 million funded accounts. Total trading volumes in 2024 reached $665 billion and our average revenue per customer is now well over $2,000 – far surpassing any comparable stat we’ve seen from traditional or crypto exchanges. One of Kraken’s core principles from day one has been accountability – to our customers, shareholders and employees. We don’t just measure success by volume, but by the quality of that volume. Not just by security, but by the depth and soundness of that security. Not just by accessibility, but by how seamlessly our products integrate liquidity and user experience.” Source: Kraken The announcement comes one day after the relaunch of Kraken’s staking program.

39753986,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=666247,1738364717,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39753986.jpeg,Elon Musk says his D.O.G.E will be cutting $4B daily in US govt spending until September,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musk-says-his-d-o-g-e-will-be-cutting-4b-daily-in-us-govt-spending-until-september/,"Mr. Elon Musk, who is now basically Washington’s Lara Croft, has announced today that he plans to cut $4 billion from the US government’s budget every single day from now until September 30 as part of his mission at the infamous Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). Via a post on X (which is the only way Elon communicates with the public now for the sake of total transparency), the eccentric billionaire explained that the cuts are part of a larger plan to reduce the federal deficit for fiscal year 2026 from $2 trillion down to $1 trillion. Under the Biden administration, the FAA and other government agencies had absolutely insane hiring practices that endangered the public. President @realDonaldTrump and his team are working rapidly to restore competent personnel to all positions involving your safety. pic.twitter.com/wn376WUq0v — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 30, 2025 The Tesla CEO and self-proclaimed efficiency freak explained that even with a $1 trillion deficit, economic growth could bridge the gap and keep inflation at bay by 2026. “Super big deal,” Elon called it, pointing out that America’s debt is already sitting at a mind-numbing $36.6 trillion right now. Elon genuinely believes that inflation is caused solely by government spending and wants the American public to allow him the chance to prove that to them. D.O.G.E wipes out $1B in contracts, targets bloated government spending Elon’s D.O.G.E team has already canceled over $1 billion in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility contracts, calling them wasteful products of what he described as “insane hiring practices” under the Biden administration. According to Elon, these contracts weren’t just expensive—they were dangerous. His words: “They endangered the public.” The Biden-era contracts covered nearly every corner of the federal government, including departments handling defense, labor, and health. Now the contracts have been terminated across major agencies like the Department of Defense, Department of Education, Treasury, and Agriculture. The Environmental Protection Agency, Commerce Department, and even smaller agencies like the Bureau of Land Management and the Railroad Retirement Board were also targeted. The cancellations alone are estimated to have saved taxpayers $1 billion, but that’s just the warm-up, according to the Doge Master. Source: D.O.G.E on X “Through January 29, 85 DEIA-related contracts totaling ~$1B have been terminated,” D.O.G.E posted on its official X account. Elon’s team claimed many of these contracts were part of Biden’s diversity-driven hiring policies that prioritized social agendas over competency. On Jan. 29 when the Fed decided not to cut rates again despite Trump telling them to, he publicly slammed them, blaming DEI and chairman Powell for inflation. In his words: “The Fed has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation. My Treasury Secretary Scott is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary Regulation, and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses. If the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, ‘green’ energy, and fake climate change, Inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst Inflation in the History of our Country!” The Lara Croft of efficiency This isn’t the first time Elon has taken a hard line on workplace policies. His Tesla factories are known for their brutal work schedules, and now federal workers are getting a taste of that same approach. An email from the Trump administration, reportedly sent last Tuesday, gave government employees until February 6 to either take an eight-month buyout or return to the office five days a week. Elon has said time and time again since COVID-19 that he despises remote work. The email, titled “Fork in the Road,” looked eerily and hilariously similar to Elon’s past messages to employees at Tesla and Twitter during massive layoffs. Elon’s D.O.G.E is being enforced despite lacking actual congressional approval. Legal battles are likely, but Elon doesn’t care one bit. In fact, he mocks the Union workers who are threatening him. Yeah this guy’s a menace. Source: Elon Musk on X Now Wired reported yesterday that Elon has even been sleeping at D.O.G.E headquarters, pulling overnight shifts at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. He told people he’s been invited to crash in the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House, though no official confirmation backs that claim. Sleeping at work isn’t nothing new for the genius either. Back in 2018, Elon famously said he was sleeping on the Tesla factory floor during production delays because he “didn’t have time to go home.” Now, he’s bringing that same obsessive approach to Washington. The man just has a lot of passion for every work he does, and he really does so much, for humanity especially. Blockchain takes over: Elon’s plan to track every federal dollar Elon is also pitching blockchain as the future of federal spending. According to a report by Bloomberg, Elon wants public blockchain networks to track every government dollar spent, ensuring transparency and preventing fraud. The plan could revolutionize government finance, but it’s also admittedly kind of risky. Blockchain experiments in corporate America have been hit-or-miss, with some companies abandoning the tech due to high costs and inefficiency. The idea for using blockchain in government finance reportedly came from a pitch given to Trump’s transition team in December on how decentralized ledgers could secure sensitive data and track spending in real time. Elon’s team jumped on the opportunity, believing that blockchain could eliminate fraud and abuse in federal programs. But the scale of what D.O.G.E wants to do is massive. Using blockchain to track spending across the U.S. government would dwarf anything tried in the private sector. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) weighed in on Elon’s plan, tweeting that “all governments should track their spending on the blockchain. It’s public money.” Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also offered his services, suggesting a collaboration between Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight to help D.O.G.E. As Cryptopolitan reported just yesterday, D.O.G.E has inspired a ton of copycats in Texas, with lawmakers there wanting to cut spending too. Now XRP lawyer John Deaton is also calling for the same in Massachusetts after learning that the government is raising taxes yet again. John is a Republican and he ran for Senate against Bitcoin-hating Democrat, Elizabeth Warren, last year. He lost to her, but has promised that he would never stop fighting. In his post today, he blamed Democrats for making inflation worse with massive spendings. He said, “Taxes are the Democrats answer to every problem we face in Massachusetts. Here’s an idea: How about we cut unnecessary spending for once?” John added a direct call to Elon saying, “@elonmusk we need a Massachusetts D.O.G.E.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",News|Elon Musk,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|ADA|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-31 23:05:17

The crypto world is packed with opportunities, but not all projects have what it takes to thrive. Some are built on hype, while others have solid ecosystems that generate real, long-term value. With constant market fluctuations, finding the best cryptos for exponential returns can be the key to turning a small investment into massive gains. Qubetics is making headlines with its successful presale and groundbreaking decentralized VPN technology, making it a top contender for 2025. Terra Classic is focusing on token burns to regain investor confidence, while NEAR Protocol is gaining traction with its scalable blockchain ecosystem. Let’s break down why these cryptos are on everyone’s radar. Qubetics: The Best Cryptos for Exponential Returns Qubetics is leading the charge as the world’s first Layer 1 Web3 aggregator, seamlessly bridging blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana into a single ecosystem. This unique approach positions Qubetics as one of the best cryptos for exponential returns, thanks to its massive presale success and innovative technology. As of January 31, 2025, Qubetics is in its 19th presale stage, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0606 each. The presale has already raised over $11.5 million, with more than 453 million tokens sold and 17,600 holders onboard. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, representing a 312.18% gain, with projections aiming for $1, $5, $6, and even $15 after the mainnet launch, offering 24,630.58% growth potential. The Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace is a groundbreaking platform that facilitates the conversion of tangible assets like real estate, commodities, and financial products into digital tokens on the blockchain. TICSScan leads the charge in this space by offering a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace for tokenizing and trading these assets. TICSScan TICSScan provides an innovative solution for asset owners and investors by allowing the tokenization of real-world assets into easily tradable digital tokens. This opens up new opportunities for liquidity, as investors can buy and sell fractional ownership of assets, making traditionally illiquid markets more accessible and efficient. With its innovative ecosystem and game-changing technology, Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s one of the best cryptos for exponential returns with long-term potential. Terra Classic: The Path to Recovery Terra Classic (LUNC) has had a turbulent past, but it’s still a force in the crypto space. Once a dominant blockchain, LUNC suffered a major collapse, but its community has remained resilient, working on token burns and ecosystem revival to restore its value. Currently priced at $0.00007719, LUNC has maintained stability despite market fluctuations. The community-driven initiative to burn tokens and reduce supply aims to push the price higher over time. While its previous glory may be hard to reclaim, Terra Classic is proving that a committed community can breathe new life into a struggling project. Investors looking for the best cryptos for exponential returns often eye LUNC due to its potential for a massive comeback. If burn initiatives successfully cut down token supply and spark renewed interest, LUNC could see a sharp rise in value, making it an attractive high-risk, high-reward investment. NEAR Protocol: The Scalable Contender NEAR Protocol is quickly establishing itself as one of the most promising Layer 1 blockchains. Designed for scalability and efficiency, NEAR offers fast transactions, low fees, and a developer-friendly environment, making it a top competitor in the blockchain space. Currently priced at $4.68, NEAR has seen a 3.54% increase, with analysts predicting its price to fluctuate between $4.53 and $4.59 in the near term. While some expect minor dips, NEAR’s long-term growth potential remains strong, especially as more developers build on its ecosystem. NEAR Protocol’s strength lies in its user-friendly blockchain infrastructure, enabling businesses and developers to create and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) with ease. This accessibility has led to increasing adoption, making NEAR a solid bet for investors searching for the best cryptos for exponential returns. Conclusion: The Best Crypto Investments for 2025 Picking the best cryptos for exponential returns requires analyzing utility, adoption, and long-term growth potential. Qubetics, Terra Classic, and NEAR Protocol each offer unique value propositions: Qubetics is breaking new ground with its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace and Web3 aggregation, positioning itself as a must-watch crypto for 2025. Terra Classic (LUNC) is on the road to recovery, with token burns driving potential price surges, making it a high-risk, high-reward play. NEAR Protocol is leading the way in blockchain scalability, with strong developer adoption and a growing ecosystem fueling its long-term prospects. For those looking for explosive growth and real-world applications, these three cryptos are worth serious consideration. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and getting in early could lead to significant gains in 2025. Which of these projects will be the next big success story?

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN.

But with so many options, it can be tricky to figure out which ones are worth your attention. If you’re looking to make a savvy investment in February 2025, three names stand out from the crowd: Arctic Pablo, Neiro, and Notcoin. These meme coins are making waves, each with unique narratives and a promise of big returns. In this article, Let’s dive into why they’re considered the best meme coins to invest in February 2025 , focusing on Arctic Pablo’s exciting presale journey, Neiro’s emerging popularity, and Notcoin’s innovative approach. Arctic Pablo: The Adventure Coin with Massive Potential When it comes to the best meme coins to invest in February 2025, Arctic Pablo is leading the charge. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a full-on adventure wrapped in a token. Arctic Pablo’s theme takes inspiration from an intrepid explorer venturing into the icy unknown, on a quest for riches, hidden mysteries, and the discovery of the magical $APC tokens. Each presale phase is tied to different locations on Pablo’s journey, with the current phase set in the icy expanse of Shangri-La. As the token travels, so does the value, which makes it incredibly exciting for investors. Right now, Arctic Pablo is in its 8th location (Shangri-La) and offers an incredible ROI. If you decide to invest $300, you’ll get 6,382,785.00 $APCs. And here’s the kicker: once the token hits its launch price of $0.008, your initial investment could balloon to a whopping $51,062.28. That’s a stunning return of 16,936%! Arctic Pablo is on a mission to connect the realms of myth and reality, offering more than just a token but a ticket to a thrilling, money-making adventure. The coin is launching its presale, and here’s where things get even more exciting. For every unsold token, Arctic Pablo is burning them, creating a deflationary environment. This means the remaining tokens become even more scarce, adding further value to your investment. Also, staking is a huge part of the deal with Arctic Pablo. You can earn an outstanding 66% APY by staking your tokens. This isn’t just a passive investment—it’s an active journey, where the more you stake, the more you can earn. With all staked tokens vested for two months from the launch date, the rewards keep stacking up, making Arctic Pablo one of the best meme coins to invest in February 2025 for those looking to grow their holdings. So, if you’re ready to take a dive into the icy unknown and join an adventure that could change your financial future, Arctic Pablo’s presale is your ticket. Neiro: A Meme Coin with Real Utility Neiro (NEIRO), currently ranked #268 on CoinMarketCap, is proving itself as one of the best meme coins to invest in February 2025. With a market cap of $215.96 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $74.37 million, NEIRO is showing steady performance. The token’s current price is $0.0005134, reflecting a slight increase of 0.38% in the last day. What makes Neiro especially appealing is its impressive recovery. After hitting an all-time low of $0.052433 in mid-2024, the token surged by over 21,000%, reaching an all-time high of $0.003093 just three months ago. This growth demonstrates Neiro’s potential for future gains, making it an attractive investment in the meme coin market. Neiro benefits from being part of the Ethereum ecosystem, which boosts its credibility and utility. With a circulating supply of 420.68 billion tokens out of a total supply of 420.69 billion, the token’s scarcity is an added factor to consider for potential investors. Backed by a strong and growing community, Neiro continues to attract attention as a meme coin with significant growth potential. For anyone interested in meme coins, Neiro stands out as one of the best options to consider in February 2025. With its steady performance, market recovery, and community backing, it’s definitely worth watching. Notcoin: A Disruptor in the Meme Coin Space Notcoin (NOT) is quickly gaining attention as one of the best meme coins to invest in February 2025, currently ranked #145 on CoinMarketCap with a market cap of $453.4 million. The coin has recently seen a 0.58% increase in value, reaching $0.004425 USD, with a significant 44.73% surge in trading volume over the last 24 hours, totaling $33.65 million. Its total supply of 102.45 billion tokens matches its max supply, ensuring stable circulation without excessive inflation. Despite fluctuations, Notcoin has maintained a steady trading pattern, with a bullish community sentiment of 88%, which is a positive sign for future growth. Notcoin stands out for its popularity in the gaming and meme sectors, having been featured on Binance Launchpool, which adds credibility and exposure within these rapidly growing markets. Its all-time high of $0.02896 in June 2024 and recent low of $0.004044 in February 2025 showcase the volatility but also highlight potential for significant returns. Investors can track price movements, with a current range between $0.004369 and $0.004516. Overall, Notcoin offers an intriguing option for those looking to enter the meme coin market with potential for both short-term gains and long-term growth in 2025. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Leads the Charge Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that Arctic Pablo stands out as the best meme coin to invest in February 2025. The combination of a thrilling narrative, a deflationary tokenomics model, and the chance for enormous returns through staking and presale investments makes Arctic Pablo a standout choice for investors looking for both excitement and potential profit. The presale journey, with its unique locations and burning mechanism, offers a sense of adventure that’s rarely seen in the crypto world. While Neiro and Notcoin certainly have their merits, Arctic Pablo’s presale structure and high potential ROI make it the frontrunner in this list. If you’re ready to hop on board and be part of a meme coin adventure that could pay off big, Arctic Pablo is your best bet.

Meanwhile, RCO Finance (RCOF) is gearing up for an explosive 44,000% rally, drawing attention from serious investors. With its AI-driven Robo Advisor, a booming presale, and an innovative DeFi ecosystem, RCOF is proving to be more than just another altcoin. Let’s break down why experts believe this new AI altcoin is set for unprecedented gains. XRP Price Faces an Uphill Battle While Traders Look for the Next Big Thing For months, the XRP price has been locked in a frustrating battle against key resistance levels. While many investors were hopeful for a breakout, the reality is that XRP still hasn’t recaptured its previous high, leaving traders questioning whether the momentum has dried up. Currently, the XRP price is struggling to push past the $3.1 mark, a historically significant level that has rejected multiple rally attempts. Analysts believe that if XRP can gain enough traction, its next targets could be $4.20 or even $5. However, breaking these levels is easier said than done. The market structure remains uncertain, and XRP price is moving within a consolidation phase that lacks a clear breakout signal. While the XRP price remains uncertain, one project is gaining unstoppable momentum; RCO Finance . Unlike XRP, which has already matured, RCO Finance is still in its early stages, meaning its potential for exponential growth is far greater. RCO Finance’s AI Revolution Is Changing the Game For years, traders have relied on feelings, technical analysis, and market speculation to make investment decisions. But RCO Finance is rewriting the rules with its AI-powered Robo Advisor , an advanced tool designed to give traders precise entry and exit points in real time. Unlike traditional trading platforms, the Robo Advisor pulls live data from top financial sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, analyzing trends before they hit the mainstream. This gives investors an early edge, allowing them to capitalize on market shifts before the masses catch on. Imagine you had access to an AI system that alerted you to Solana in its early days when it was trading below $1. Fast forward, and Solana skyrocketed to over $200, making early investors millionaires. The Robo Advisor can detect similar opportunities, analyzing trending altcoins before they explode, ensuring you never miss out. Beyond identifying breakouts, the AI also protects your portfolio. If a coin is showing signs of weakness, the Robo Advisor can trigger sell signals, preventing devastating losses. This means no emotional trading, no second-guessing, and no stress; it’s just data-driven, automated decisions that optimize your portfolio. RCOF Beta Platform is a Rare Early-Access Advantage Most DeFi projects launch a product after their presale, but RCO Finance is ahead of the curve. The Beta platform is already live, with over 10,000 users testing its features. This hands-on approach ensures that the platform is battle-tested before full deployment. While the Beta focuses on core functionalities, the upcoming Alpha phase will introduce even more powerful AI-driven enhancements. Beyond its AI trading capabilities, RCO Finance is a full-fledged financial ecosystem that offers KYC-free transactions, so you can enjoy full privacy with no intrusive identity checks. You can diversify into 120,000+ assets, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, and real estate. Also, the RCOF debit cards allow you to spend your crypto instantly. RCO Finance Presale Is a Rare 44,000% Opportunity Opportunities like this don’t come often. RCO Finance is still in its 5th presale stage , with tokens priced at $0.10. But with the next stage pushing the price to $0.13, investors who get in now are securing an immediate 30% gain in just a few weeks. The project has already raised over $12 million, and demand is surging as more traders recognize its potential. With each new presale stage, the price increases, making early entries significantly more profitable. Investing $1,000 today at $0.10 means you get 10,000 RCOF tokens. When the price moves to $0.13, your investment grows to $1,300; without lifting a finger. Upon launch, when RCOF hits the projected 44,000% surge, your $1,000 turns into $440,000. With a fully audited smart contract by SolidProof proving the project’s security, this is an unprecedented opportunity that serious investors are taking full advantage of. Why RCO Finance Could Leave XRP in the Dust Even in a best-case scenario, XRP price may take years to reach $6.62, and that’s only a 200% gain. While this is decent, it doesn’t compare to RCO Finance’s 44,000% upside in just a few months. The reason is simple; XRP is already well-established, meaning its growth is naturally slower. On the other hand, RCO Finance is fresh, innovative, and solving real-world problems, making it far more likely to see explosive adoption. Investors who got into RCOF at earlier stages have already locked in gains, but even now, the presale offers incredible upside. Waiting until the next stage means losing 30% in potential gains, and by the time RCOF lists, the price will be significantly higher. Every day that passes, the opportunity window gets smaller. Those who wait risk watching RCOF skyrocket while they’re left on the sidelines. Now is the time to act.

And of course the surge was triggered by the perfect storm of Trump’s election win, a calm Federal Reserve, and institutional investors piling into crypto assets like there was no tomorrow. XRP’s price climbed from the ashes of SEC suppression in a comeback after years of legal chaos when it finally saw its biggest nemesis, former SEC chair Gary Gensler, handing in his resignation. According to Ripple’s report , between mid-November and December, XRP trading volumes averaged $5 billion daily, which is a pretty wild increase from $500 million just the month before. XRP dominated spot markets, US traders went all in Ripple’s report also says that most of the XRP activity came from spot trading. Binance accounted for 36% of global spot XRP volume, followed by Upbit at 20%, and Coinbase at 9%. US institutional investors like WisdomTree and Coinshares submitted filings for spot XRP ETFs, joining Bitwise and Canary Capital. With Ripple’s legal pressure easing, big money is treating XRP like the next big thing. I mean, we just reported that Canada is trying to launch an XRP ETF before America. Bitcoin’s rise to $109,000 also helped XRP along the way, as the BTC/XRP trading pair surged 130% over the quarter. And while volatility spiked from 40% in early November to 200%, investors stayed confident. By December 30th, XRP’s price reached $2.70, a 500% increase from its November levels. Ripple expanded XRP Ledger utility and stablecoin adoption By Q4’s end, Ripple Payments had had $70 billion in global transactions, with its RLUSD stablecoin acting as a critical bridge for cross-border payments. Ripple reported that RLUSD had been integrated into payment networks like Bitstamp, MoonPay, Uphold, and Independent Reserve. Ripple’s stablecoin strategy reportedly came with monthly reserve reports carried out by third-party auditors, to ensure trust in the reserves backing RLUSD. XRP Ledger wallet creation exploded to 709,000, up from just 140,000 in Q3. Ripple’s report said that XRP’s average price soared from $0.55 to $1.43 over the quarter, with burned XRP rising from 592,000 to 724,000 tokens. On-chain activity didn’t slow down either. Trustlines on the ledger grew from 7.3 million to 7.9 million, with 37,000 new trustlines tied directly to RLUSD adoption. Ripple’s AMM feature, which launched last March, reported $774 million in swap volume, compared to $31 million in the previous quarter. Decentralized exchange (DEX) volume shot past $1 billion, with AMM swaps making up 77% of it. Ripple pushed out new tech upgrades as well. The XLS-40 amendment brought decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to the ledger, and a native oracle protocol was integrated with Band Protocol and DIA. According to the report, this gave XRP Ledger real-time price feeds that could support lending, tokenization, and market-making operations. Archax, an FCA-regulated digital asset exchange, teamed up with abrdn to tokenize money market funds on the XRP Ledger. Societe Generale announced plans to deploy its MiCA-compliant stablecoin EURCV on the same network. Ripple claims that the ledger has fast 3-5 second settlements, low transaction fees, and built-in compliance tools. SEC lawsuit updates and regulatory breakthroughs Ripple’s legal saga with the SEC didn’t end, but the company gained the upper hand. On January 15, the SEC filed an opening brief in its appeal. Ripple argued that the brief rehashed already-failed arguments and ignored the incoming crypto-friendly Trump administration. Ripple will respond formally by April 16. Interestingly enough, the SEC’s appeal doesn’t actually question whether XRP itself is a security, which Judge Analisa Torres had already ruled against in 2023. But the SEC has reversed course a little. It scrapped SAB 121, a policy that had previously discouraged banks from working with crypto companies. The policy’s removal was a result of GAO findings that determined SAB 121 violated rulemaking processes. Ripple’s Q4 report included updated figures on its XRP holdings. As of December 31, 2024, Ripple claimed it had 4.48 billion XRP, up from 4.43 billion on September 30. The total XRP subject to on-ledger escrow dropped from 38.9 billion to 38.03 billion tokens. Ripple explained that these escrow funds are released monthly, with any unused tokens returned to escrow. The company clarified that it sometimes transfers XRP to third parties like ETPs or trusts but only when it expects the tokens to remain within its ecosystem.

Similarly, BlockDAG (BDAG) is experiencing heightened interest due to enhancements in its affiliate program, enticing both referrers and purchasers with a 5% USDT cashback for each transaction completed through a referral link. This offer, paired with no limits on usage, has encouraged traders to invest in BDAG, with forecasts suggesting a surge to $1 by 2025. In other sectors, Founder Justin Sun’s remarks have spurred a 16.67% increase in TRX’s price, complemented by a 15% growth in active addresses, signaling robust network engagement. Cardano (ADA) Price on the Brink of a Breakthrough The Cardano (ADA) price has been consolidating after its recent upward trend, hinting at a potential surge as it forms an ascending triangle pattern. The crucial resistance levels to monitor are between $1.15 and $1.20, which have posed challenges since December. Should ADA break and sustain above these levels, it could pave the way for a rise towards its 52-week peak of $1.327, with potential gains extending to $1.38. Conversely, ADA has robust support within the $0.93 to $0.918 range. Dropping below this could lead to a fallback to the next support at $0.85, yet the overall positive outlook will stand if these supports hold. Tron Network: TRX Price Surges Following Leadership’s Comments On January 26, 2025, Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron network, affirmed the platform’s decentralization, asserting that no single entity controls more than 50% of the total supply, and no node possesses more than 1/27 of the validation power. This announcement led to a notable increase in TRX’s price, which escalated from $0.12 to $0.14 in just an hour, alongside a 30% boost in trading volume. The technical indicators are promising, showing strong momentum with an RSI of 72 and a bullish MACD crossover. The number of active addresses also increased by 15%, indicating a rise in network activity and heightened interest in the market. BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program Offers 5% USDT Cashback! BlockDAG has enhanced its Affiliate Program, now granting a 5% instant cashback to both the person who refers and the one who purchases through the referral link. For example, if someone refers a friend and they buy $1,000 of cryptocurrency, both the referrer and the friend receive $50 in USDT cashback, directly added to their USDT (BEP-20) compatible wallets. This update follows BlockDAG’s stellar presale achievement, which has accumulated over $187 million. As the presale moves towards its $600 million goal, forecasts suggest BDAG could hit a $1 valuation by 2025. Participants buying now at $0.0248 in the current batch 27 are positioned for a potential 3932% return on investment when BDAG reaches $1. Early participants have already experienced a 2380% increase in their investments, underscoring BDAG’s appeal as one of today’s top crypto buys. For those looking to capitalize on promising crypto and garner additional perks, this affiliate program provides an ideal starting point, allowing them to accumulate USDT rewards. However, with the offer limited and batch 27 nearly sold out, prompt action is advisable before the program concludes and BDAG’s price escalates in upcoming batches. Long Story, Short! Cardano (ADA) is on the brink of surpassing the $1.20 mark, aiming for a yearly high of $1.327, contingent on maintaining above essential support levels. Simultaneously, Justin Sun’s reassurance regarding Tron’s decentralization has propelled a TRX price increase, though its continued momentum is yet to be determined. Nonetheless, BlockDAG emerges as the standout with its remarkable 3932% ROI potential . Its time-sensitive affiliate program not only enhances BDAG purchases but also fosters substantial USDT earnings and portfolio growth for participants. With the opportunity closing soon, now is the crucial moment for those who missed out initially to get involved before BDAG’s valuation surges.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has bounced back to the $0.00002 price mark, igniting tentative hope within its followers, though its long-term growth is still up for debate. Likewise, Polkadot (DOT) is on the brink of a bullish surge, drawing in traders with its target price of $17. Amid these well-known coins, Web3Bay stands out as a trailblazer, transforming e-commerce through blockchain technology. Web3Bay surpasses SHIB’s uncertain outlook and DOT’s dependence on network interoperability by merging real-world applications with investor benefits. Its presale has already gathered over $1,000,000, with initial tokens projecting a 6,430% ROI, highlighting its increasing traction. Integrating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), staking opportunities, and NFTs, Web3Bay is paving the way for a decentralized shopping era. Web3Bay: Leading Blockchain’s Charge in E-commerce Envision a future where online shopping escapes the grip of central authority, avoiding exorbitant fees and protecting your data. Welcome to Web3Bay—a blockchain-driven marketplace that could alter e-commerce fundamentally. This platform removes intermediaries, cuts down costs, and ensures unprecedented data security, making shopping smarter, quicker, and more equitable. The standout feature? The 3BAY token. More than just a currency, it’s a key to various perks—5% off purchases, staking bonuses, and participation in the platform’s evolving DAO. The journey doesn’t end here. With plans to assimilate NFT marketplaces and support cross-chain interactions, Web3Bay is shaping up to be the ultimate decentralized hub. Investors are catching on fast. Web3Bay’s crypto presale has already raked in over $1,000,000, distributing more than 260 million tokens at just $0.004562 each. Early participants are poised for a staggering 6,430% ROI as the token’s debut price is slated at $0.1959. This opportunity represents not just an investment but a stake in reshaping global commerce. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Hits $0.00002 Again: Will It Maintain Its Position? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has touched the $0.00002 mark once more, a pivotal psychological level often influencing investor sentiment. This resurgence hints at some buying interest, yet the overall market view advises caution. The lack of robust trading volumes may not support a sustained rise, potentially shaking investor confidence. Current indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) show neutral to bearish trends, pointing to tepid excitement from traders. SHIB still trades below key moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day, signaling hurdles to kickstart a bullish trend. For a firm recovery, SHIB needs significant buying pressure to push past the resistance at $0.0000216. Failing this, the token might face a downward correction. Polkadot on the Verge of a Breakout Polkadot (DOT) appears ready for a breakout, displaying a bullish pennant pattern that’s caught traders’ attention. This pattern, typically a continuation signal, formed after DOT’s climb from $3.75 to $10.68, with its price now hovering around $6.30. However, DOT Price finds it challenging to build momentum, witnessing a 24-hour drop of 2.92% and a 37% fall in trading volume to $169.94 million. This suggests wary sentiment among investors who are waiting for a clear breakout confirmation. Key resistance stands at the $7.16 Fibonacci level. Surpassing this could push DOT Price towards $10.68 and potentially $17. Yet, a failed breakout attempt might result in a retreat below $6.00. The Money Flow Index (MFI) is at 32.54, indicating slight buying interest but overall market caution. For those eyeing Polkadot, this could be a promising break, yet patience is essential as the market seeks a definitive direction. Takeaway As Shiba Inu (SHIB) strives to build momentum and Polkadot (DOT) anticipates a breakout, Web3Bay is carving a niche as a noteworthy crypto investment. SHIB’s revival heavily relies on fresh trading volume and trader interest, while DOT’s potential breakout is yet to be confirmed, depending on crucial Fibonacci levels. Conversely, Web3Bay continues to advance with its groundbreaking marketplace, comprehensive roadmap, and successful presale. Early investors in Web3Bay’s 3BAY token are positioned advantageously, possibly witnessing substantial returns from a platform that addresses genuine e-commerce inefficiencies. As blockchain evolves, Web3Bay differentiates itself by prioritizing utility, scalability, and investor participation, presenting itself as a premier investment choice in a speculative market. For astute traders, Web3Bay could very well be the future Amazon of crypto.

The filing intended to launch what would become the world’s first XRP ETF in Canada and provide investors with a regulated opportunity for long-term exposure to XRP and potential capital gains. If approved, the new product would operate as a spot XRP ETF, offering a regulated method for securing long-term exposure to XRP alongside the possibility of benefiting from its capital appreciation. Spot Ripple ETF on the Horizon? Purpose Investments Aims for Another First In an official statement issued on Thursday, the firm underscored its determination to replicate the successes of its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by introducing the first spot XRP ETF. Purpose Investments, recognized for launching the inaugural spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2021, now seeks to extend similar long-term exposure opportunities to XRP. Innovation drives the future of digital asset investing. We’re proud to file a preliminary prospectus for the world’s first Ripple (XRP) ETF – expanding access to regulated, institutional-grade crypto exposure. Learn more: https://t.co/x39gjnQcVb pic.twitter.com/PXpwO4mE1q — Purpose Investments (@PurposeInvest) January 30, 2025 The proposed ETF planned to invest nearly all of its assets in long-term holdings of XRP. Purpose Investments founder and CEO Som Seif stressed the firm’s commitment to innovation and to bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance. “At Purpose, we remain steadfast in our commitment to innovation and to bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance,” Seif said. “As XRP sees increasing adoption and institutional interest, we believe an ETF can offer investors a transparent and familiar way to access it within a regulated framework,” he added. While XRP exchange-traded products (ETPs) had been available across various global markets, the launch of a spot XRP ETF in Canada would represent a major development in providing regulated access to the asset. Meanwhile, several asset management firms filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch comparable products, although those filings remain under regulatory review. Rising Applications Amid U.S. Regulatory Shifts and Price Rally Applications for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had increased following the reelection of President Donald Trump and the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. @WisdomTreeFunds has filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the @SECGov for a spot XRP ETF. #XRP #Ripple #XRPETF https://t.co/lLCj5OmRoB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 2, 2024 Several asset managers, including Grayscale, CoinShares, Bitwise , WisdomTree , and 21Shares, filed for XRP ETFs in the United States as recent regulatory shifts encourage issuers to move forward with their filings. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, Litecoin , and Dogecoin, also attracted spot ETF applications. The SEC was expected to render preliminary decisions on these filings by the end of January; Grayscale’s XRP ETF application carried a deadline of January 23, while other applicants awaited decisions by January 25. Leadership changes at the SEC accelerated these developments, as market participants anticipated a more favorable regulatory stance on crypto-based investment products. Purpose Investments, which had introduced the world’s first Bitcoin ETF in Canada in 2021, had paved the way for institutional access to crypto. In contrast, U.S. asset managers had to wait until January 2024 for SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have since amassed over $121 billion in assets. XRP’s price surged to $3.20 on January 15—its highest level since 2018—before retracing to $3.09 on January 31 and marking a 31% gain for the month. The rally occurred despite the SEC’s appeal against a July 2023 ruling that determined XRP sales to retail investors were not unregistered securities. Market observers suggest that an approved XRP ETF could attract between $3 billion and $6 billion in net new investments, assuming adoption rates similar to those of Ethereum ETFs.

The cryptocurrency had shown signs of a potential breakout, but key indicators have come into focus as the market evaluates its next move. The latest insights from analysts have raised questions about whether Bitcoin’s market momentum can overcome the resistance level at $108,000, its previous all-time high. Related Reading: MVRV Ratio Reveals Bitcoin’s Market Position Amid Short-Term Selling Pressure Analyzing Bitcoin’s Market Indicators Amid the price performance from BTC, CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC has provided insights on the challenges and possibilities ahead for Bitcoin. Shayan noted that despite Bitcoin’s recent price increases, the funding rates—a critical on-chain indicator—have started to decline. This bearish divergence suggests that demand in perpetual markets may be weakening, casting doubt on whether the current bullish momentum is sufficient to push Bitcoin above its all-time high. Particularly, one of the primary hurdles for Bitcoin’s price to surpass $108,000 is the lack of strong market enthusiasm, as reflected in the funding rates. According to Shayan, typically, rising funding rates indicate an increase in long positions and market optimism. However, the current decline in these rates signals that traders are hesitant to bet on further price increases. Shayan emphasized that without a significant boost in optimism and a greater influx of long positions, Bitcoin’s resistance at $108,000 could hold firm, potentially leading to a consolidation phase or even a temporary price rejection. The analyst wrote: For Bitcoin to decisively breach $108K, the funding rates must rise further, signaling an increase in optimism and a greater influx of long positions. Without this market-wide enthusiasm, the resistance at $108K could hold, leading to potential consolidation or a temporary rejection. Indication from Long-Term Holders Metric On the other hand, long-term holders—investors who have maintained their Bitcoin holdings for seven years or more—have shown no inclination to sell their assets. Another CryptoQuant analyst reporting this in a post on the QuickTake platform noted: Holders who have held bitcoin for seven years or more sold some of their holdings before the end of the previous bull market. Long-term bitcoin holders have not yet moved their holdings to exchanges. This behavior highlights a trend seen in previous market cycles: long-term holders often remain resilient through price fluctuations, providing a steady base of support for the cryptocurrency.

Amid this, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (previously Twitter) and shared a buy signal for the meme coin. Buy Signal For PEPE In a post on X, the expert noted that a technical indicator named TD Sequential flashed a buy signal for the PEPE meme coin and also hinted that the price could rebound when applied to the 3-day chart.

Data from the spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $9 million worth of PEPE meme coin. This substantial outflow signals potential accumulation by long-term holders, which can create notable buying pressure and fuel a further upside rally that the meme coin is currently experiencing. PEPE is currently trading near $0.00001387 and has witnessed a price surge of over 8.15% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 90%, suggesting immense participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Major Liquidation Areas Looking at the data, it appears that the bulls are the ones currently dominating the meme coin, as they seem to be strongly betting on the long side. Source: Coinglass According to on-chain data, the major liquidation area is near $0.00001359, where bulls are over-leveraged and currently hold $2.50 million worth of long positions. Conversely, $0.00001405 is another key level where short sellers, with $1 million in over-leveraged positions, could be liquidated if the price reaches this level. When combining these on-chain metrics, it appears that bulls are strongly dominating the asset, and $0.00001405 is a minor resistance level that could soon be breached, opening the path for further upside momentum.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,PEPE|TRADING|BTC|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 00:37:52

As Cryptopolitan reported , the company had said at first that they were gonna wait until SEC chair nominee Paul Atkins gets confirmed by the Senate next week. But it seems like they decided not to wait even a day longer after all. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas summed it up perfectly: No trust has ever pulled a “launch-today, file-tomorrow” kind of move before. What’s wild is that there are now four DOGE ETF filings floating around, including leveraged bets. Gary Gensler’s exit from the SEC isn’t even old news yet, and suddenly the ETF industry is looking like a free-for-all. “Man, the jockeying is intense. I’ve never heard of a trust launching and then looking to convert to ETF the same day. But hey they may now be in pole position in the 19b-4 race. Also we now have up to four Doge etf filings (including 2x). Genz has only been gone for like two weeks lol,” said Eric. UPDATE: That was FAST. @Grayscale launched a DOGE trust earlier today and they just filed a 19b-4 to convert it into an ETF pic.twitter.com/IU64NeiPsY — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 31, 2025 What was once just a joke —literally born as a meme—is now getting polished up and taken seriously as an asset. DOGE, derived from Litecoin and indirectly connected to Bitcoin, exploded into mainstream awareness over the years, mostly thanks to Elon Musk. According to Grayscale’s Head of Product & Research, DOGE has become an accessible way for people around the world to make fast, low-cost transactions. And they’re not wrong about the adoption part—Dogecoin’s low transaction fees and rapid speed have made it attractive in emerging markets. Unlike Bitcoin, where fees and confirmation times can leave you waiting and sweating, DOGE breezes through transactions at breakneck speed without gouging users. What’s happening with DOGE isn’t Grayscale’s only power move this month. The company just filed to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF on January 30. They’ve submitted their proposal to the New York Stock Exchange and picked Coinbase Custody as the official custodian for the trust. Grayscale manages over $16 million in XRP through its current trust, and converting that into an ETF would open the floodgates for institutional investors. Think mutual funds, pension funds, and other big players who’ve been hesitant to touch crypto directly because of regulatory uncertainty caused by Gary.

The ETF and securities exchange NYSE Arca filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to propose the rule change. Grayscale, a crypto asset manager, believes converting the trust into an ETF “would provide other investors with a way to invest in XRP on a regulated national securities exchange,” according to NYSE Arca’s filing. The XRP trust has nearly $16.2 million worth of assets under management (AUM) at time of writing. Grayscale isn’t the first firm to make a bid for an XRP ETF: Bitwise Asset Management, the largest digital asset index fund manager in the US, filed an initial registration statement for the product in October, and the crypto ETF provider 21Shares followed suit in November. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs last January, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs for trading in July, and multiple firms, including 21Shares, applied for Solana ( SOL ) exchange-traded products over the summer. Grayscale filed in December to convert its Solana Trust into a spot ETF.

As the market fluctuations continue, traders turn to PropiChain (PCHAIN) as a strategic hedge against volatility. PropiChain, a sub-$1 presale token, is near its all-time low. This offers investors an attractive entry point. The project has already raised over $2 million during its presale token, demonstrating its ability to outperform Ripple and Ethereum in 2025. Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen Sells XRP Tokens The action taken by the Ripple Chairman, Chris Larsen, could add selling pressure to XRP. Larsen has sold roughly $116 million in XRP in 2025 so far after a long holding period. The sale puts pressure on Ripple after XRP spent years under-performing. The sale indicates that Larsen is capitalizing on XRP’s recent bullish momentum. Some traders believe that the Ripple Chairman’s actions mark the top. XRP , the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, is down 4% in the past week. XRP and Ethereum have lost ground this week although leading altcoins have suffered more losses. PropiChain is a Good Hedge Against Altcoin Volatility PropiChain has been tipped to be one of the best hedges against volatility. This is mainly because PCHAIN is near its all-time low, presenting an exciting opportunity for investors. It will also perform better than Ripple and Ethereum due to growing interest in the presale token. The project has already raised over $2 million, with more set to come after listing. As a tokenization platform, the altcoin supports fractional ownership. This tool allows users to buy portions of real estate, making it easy for retail traders to diversify their assets even with minimum capital. With AI at the heart of PCHAIN, the altcoin has practical use cases such as predictive market analysis. With AI-driven analysis, investors can make smart investment decisions. For example, PropiChain’s predictive market analysis would have alerted users that Jupiter (JUP) would make substantial gains after its acquired Moonshot. Thanks to this acquisition, JUP is up 35% this week. Additionally, AI is used in smart contract automation . This feature automates real estate transactions such as auto-leasing and lease renewals. This process reduces manual paperwork, simplifying the lives of landlords and investors. To keep the platform safe for users, PropiChain’s smart contracts have been audited by BlockAudit, one of the best security firms in the blockchain space. Furthermore, the project has automated valuation models, a tool for accurate property appraisals. This offers accurate, fair pricing for any property, allowing buyers and seller to close their real estate deals quickly. The metaverse also allows prospective buyers to view properties digitally using the metaverse. This reduces costs in property scouting. Can PCHAIN Outperform Ripple and Ethereum? An analyst claims that PCHAIN could be a better investment bet than Ripple and Ethereum. The emerging altcoin is up 200% during the first two stages of its ongoing token presale. On the other hand, Ripple and Ethereum are suffering losses as the market loses momentum. PCHAIN is tipped to mirror Ethereum’s 2020 – 21 rally when its price surged from $122 in February 2020 to an all-time high of $4,891 in October 2021. Investors’ Appetite for PropiChain Rises Investors are betting big on PropiChain because it is undervalued at $0.01. The altcoin has raised over $2 million in its ongoing fundraising round, highlighting growing investor confidence in PropiChain. The project has been listed on CoinMarketCap. This has given it extra exposure, a key factor in attracting new investors. The sub-$1 altcoin is tipped to grow by 35,000% in 2025 thanks to its low entry price, growing community, and AI-driven tools that simplify real estate activities such as buying, selling, or investing properties. With investors’ appetite rising, this is the best time to scoop the PCHAIN token for cheap during its ongoing presale. Join PropiChain’s token presale and convert $1K into $350K.

In a letter to the CEOs of Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase (JPMC), US Bank, PNC Bank, Truist and Wells Fargo, US senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) say the lenders have increased the interest rates they charge borrowers while keeping the rates they pay to savings accounts low. “Deposit rates for savers always lag behind the federal funds rate, but this gap is larger for customers of big banks than for regional and community banks.” Warren and Reed are both members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. According to the senators, the seven banks made record profits of $1 trillion in 2023 by “charging borrowers more, paying savers a little, and pocketing interest paid by the Federal Reserve.” Warren and Reed say that the CEOs of the seven mega banks have not kept their word after testifying before the US Senate three years ago that they would increase interest rates for savers. On the CEO of the largest US lender by assets, Jamie Dimon, the two senators say, “When the Federal Reserve began raising the federal funds rate in March 2022, JPMC was very quick to increase the interest rates that it charged borrowers for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. In September 2022, you [Dimon] testified before the Senate Banking Committee that you expected to also increase the rates that JPMC pays savers—albeit at a slower pace. At that time, JPMC was charging 6.98% for a mortgage, and 18% to 27% for a credit card, while paying its customers .01% on a demand deposit account. But two years later and despite your testimony, JPMC’s interest rates have not budged. While the interest rate that JPMC earns on the balances that it maintains in its own accounts at the Federal Reserve has risen from 3.15% to 4.4%, JPMC’s customers continue to earn a negligible 0.01% on their savings.” The two US senators also accuse the heads of Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Truist of keeping the interest rates their savings account holders earn at “negligible 0.01%” despite the lenders generating between 3.15% to 4.4% on their Federal Reserve balances. The CEOs of PNC, Citi and US Bank are also accused of keeping interest rates on savings accounts at 0.02%, 0.03% and 0.05%, respectively, while generating more than three-hundredfold from their bank balances with the Fed.

Solana (SOL): Known for speed, but it hasn’t achieved the exclusive appeal of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Ethereum (ETH): A DeFi giant, but its growth potential can’t match this new token.

Memecoin (MEME) just saw a price uptick of 1% in the last 24 hours, but it’s still down 15.24% for the week. Meanwhile, Ponke (PONKE), which once hit an all-time high of $0.8409, is now 80.5% lower than that, trading at $0.1632. Investors are searching for the next meme coin that won’t just pump and dump but will actually deliver value. That’s where BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stepping in as one of the top new meme coins to join today . Meme coins have gone from internet jokes to legitimate investments, and BTFD is pushing that trend further with its Bulls Squad community, high-yield staking rewards (90% APY), and a full-fledged P2E game that launched on January 1, 2025. Now, BTFD Coin is making headlines by skipping directly to Stage 14 of its presale—burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13. On top of that, the team just dropped a 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100), which means every purchase right now gets DOUBLED. If there’s ever been a time to own the dip, it’s now. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Bulls Are Taking Over Ever wonder what it feels like to be ahead of the market before it takes off? That’s exactly where BTFD Coin investors are sitting right now. The project has already raised over $5.85 million, sold more than 68 billion coins, and attracted 10,000+ Bulls to its community. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. The Bulls Squad is at the heart of this ecosystem, rallying together to take advantage of the market’s best dips. Whether it’s through staking, gaming, or presale gains, this is a squad built for profits. With its presale price currently at $0.00016 per BTFD, early investors are gearing up for a major payday. When BTFD hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006, investors at Stage 14 could see 275% returns. And if it reaches the predicted $0.006 ‘moon price,’ those who buy now could be staring at a 3,650% gain. Let’s say an investor buys $5,000 worth of BTFD right now at $0.00016. That gets them 31,250,000 BTFD tokens. Once BTFD lists at $0.0006, those tokens would be worth $18,750—a near 4x return. If the price hits the projected $0.006, that same investment would be worth $187,500. How to Buy BTFD Coin Set up your bullish wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Load your wallet with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Connect to the presale page and enter the amount to buy. Enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code to double your tokens. Buy and confirm the transaction. This isn’t just another meme coin—this is your shot at owning the dip before it skyrockets. If you’re looking for the top new meme coins to join today, BTFD Coin is making waves with its bullish momentum, staking rewards, and strong community backing. Memecoin (MEME) – A Solid Ecosystem, But Facing Price Swings Memecoin (MEME) is backed by 9GAG’s Memeland and serves as its native ecosystem token. The project has strong branding and a dedicated community, making it a solid play in the meme coin space. Currently, MEME is trading at $0.00708, with a 1% price increase in the last 24 hours. However, it’s been hit hard over the past week, down 15.24%. Despite that, its market cap has risen 3.12% to $267.28M, showing that whales and long-term investors are still betting on it. However, there’s one concern—trading volume is down by 33.47% in the last 24 hours. This suggests that momentum might be slowing. The question now is: will Memecoin recover and push forward, or is it consolidating before another dip? Ponke (PONKE) – A Meme Coin with Character, But Facing Losses Ponke (PONKE) is built on Solana and features a distinct personality. Its “degenerate gambler” character has made it a unique player in the meme coin scene. But despite its entertaining concept, Ponke has taken a beating in the market. The token is currently trading at $0.1632, down 2.22% in the last 24 hours and 22.5% in the past week. Even more concerning, Ponke hit an all-time high of $0.8409 just two months ago—meaning it’s now 80.5% down from that peak. The question for investors is: Is this a prime buying opportunity, or is Ponke still searching for a bottom? Given the recent trends, Ponke could see renewed interest, but for now, investors are watching cautiously. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the most exciting opportunity in the meme coin space right now. While Memecoin (MEME) and Ponke (PONKE) each have their own strengths, they are facing market fluctuations that have made investors wary. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin is gaining serious traction with its Bulls Squad community, high-yield staking, and P2E gaming ecosystem. With the presale price sitting at $0.00016 and a 275% upside to the listing price of $0.0006, investors have a limited window to jump in before the next stage. And with the LAUNCH100 BONUS CODE doubling tokens, there’s no better time to own the dip and get in one of the top new meme coins to join today before it’s too late.

Whales have accumulated 560 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the past week following an intense sell-off, signaling renewed interest from large holders! pic.twitter.com/ObAVfqC9xi — Ali (@ali_charts) January 31, 2025 Data from Coinglass’s spot inflow/outflow metrics revealed that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of $13 million worth of DOGE, indicating potential accumulation and the possibility of buying pressure. However, despite substantial accumulation, the DOGE meme coin hasn’t witnessed any major gains or buying pressure. Traders Rising Interest Besides the strong accumulation by whales and long-term holders, intraday traders seem bullish on the meme coin today, February 1, 2025. At press time, the DOGE Long/Short ratio stands at 1.05, indicating strong bullish sentiment among traders. With all these on-chain metrics, the DOGE meme coin appears bullish, and this could support the coin in gaining a massive upside rally. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bullish as it seems to be forming a bullish double-bottom price action pattern on the daily time frame. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action and historical momentum, if DOGE holds above the $0.31 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 25% to reach the $0.415 level in the coming days. DOGE is currently trading near $0.33 and has experienced a modest price drop of 0.25% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 35%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to previous days.",News|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 01:58:36

XRP, Ethereum, and BlockDAG illustrate its potential. XRP remains a key player in cross-border payments, but its $1,000 price target faces obstacles related to adoption and regulation. Ethereum shows strength in decentralized finance and staking. BlockDAG is making its mark by connecting blockchain with sports through its Inter Milan partnership. These three projects represent diverse applications of blockchain technology and offer a glimpse into its transformative potential across various sectors. BlockDAG’s Football Fusion: A New Game in Sponsorships BlockDAG’s connection with Inter Milan is a prime example of how blockchain can merge with sports. It shows how decentralized systems can integrate with traditional sectors. By tapping into Inter Milan’s global fan base, BlockDAG is becoming a recognizable name in mainstream blockchain adoption. This top rated crypto project has raised over $187.5 million and is currently in batch 27, priced at $0.0248, reflecting a 2380% surge with over 18.3 billion coins sold. Inter Milan’s games, watched by millions worldwide, give BlockDAG a platform. It introduces blockchain to a broad audience. Stadium advertising and branding opportunities highlight how blockchain projects can reach diverse groups. The presale success demonstrates BlockDAG’s appeal. The $187.5 million raised, with over 18.3 billion coins sold, shows its traction. The current price of $0.0248 in batch 27, up 2380% from batch 1, attracts attention. This partnership could lead to fan engagement. Think tokenized collectibles, loyalty programs, and lower transaction costs for merchandise. These examples show how blockchain can improve user experiences while boosting transparency and security. Aligning with Inter Milan positions BlockDAG beyond crypto. It becomes relevant in sectors where community and trust are important. This is more than sponsorship. It is a study in how blockchain can integrate into daily life, creating value. This top rated crypto project is attracting more attention. Ethereum’s Network Growth Resists Market Trends Ethereum’s blockchain has seen growth, with over 206,000 new addresses, the most since October 2022. This happened despite negative market sentiment. Ethereum is important to the crypto world. Its dominance in DeFi and staking shows its key role. The rising number of active wallets suggests ongoing interest in Ethereum’s platform. Analysts point to Ethereum’s technical strength as a factor in handling market changes. While price is affected by perception, the consistent increase in addresses shows Ethereum’s resilience. As the largest player in decentralized finance, Ethereum continues to gain users, cementing its place in the crypto space. This top rated crypto is demonstrating its value. XRP’s $1,000 Target: Examining the Possibility XRP is used for fast, low-cost international payments, especially in banking. However, it faces challenges, including the SEC lawsuit about its status. XRP currently trades around $0.40-$0.50, far below its $3.84 peak in 2018. For XRP to reach $1,000, its market cap would need to be around $50 trillion. This is more than double the current value of all global stock markets. Several things could drive this growth. These include adoption by financial institutions, a positive outcome in the SEC case, reduced circulating supply, and clear regulations. Ripple’s focus on stablecoin and CBDC settlements could also increase demand. However, even in the best case, $1,000 seems unlikely soon. $10-$50 is more realistic in the mid-term. This top rated crypto still has potential. The Future of Blockchain: XRP, Ethereum, & BlockDAG Blockchain’s versatility is clear in the paths of XRP, Ethereum, and BlockDAG. XRP’s potential depends on overcoming regulatory and adoption issues. Ethereum continues to be important for DeFi and staking. BlockDAG, through its Inter Milan partnership, shows how blockchain can go beyond traditional uses, connecting technology with community-driven areas like sports. This top rated crypto is exploring new avenues. Each of these top rated crypto are important to the future of blockchain.

The token’s price jumped from $1.98 on January 30 to $2.37 at the time of writing. Kraken Reintroduces Staking Services In Select States On January 30, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken announced the relaunch of its staking services for US clients in 37 states and two territories. The exchange also noted plans to expand these services to additional states as regulatory conditions allow. Related Reading: Lido Finance Cements DeFi Lead, Expands To Optimism: Is LDO Undervalued? For the uninitiated, Kraken facilitates staking by delegating users’ staked tokens to network validators, who are responsible for transaction validation and block production. These validators then return rewards – minus fees – to clients who have staked their tokens with them. Commenting, Mark Greenberg, Global Head of Consumer at Kraken said the launch of this staking product in the US is a positive development for the entire US crypto industry. Greenberg added: Kraken serves as a bridge so people can access the crypto space and participate in an increasingly broad range of related activities from an interface and platform that they’re familiar with. Onchain staking is a key component of how we fulfill this role and we believe the resumption of staking in the US today will play a significant role in the development and mass adoption of crypto. Following the announcement, LDO experienced a sharp spike in buying activity, propelling its price above the psychologically significant $2 level. At the time of writing, LDO boasts a total market cap of $2.1 billion, making it the 63rd largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Lido Soars 20%, What Do The Analysts Say? LDO’s surge has caught the attention of crypto analysts, many of whom see further upside potential. Crypto analyst World of Crypto noted that LDO is breaking out of both a bullish pennant and a descending broadening wedge. A successful breakout could send the token to the $7–$8 range within a few weeks. Related Reading: Lido Finance (LDO) Is Down 18% In 7 Days, Time To Buy The Dip? Similarly, crypto analyst Daan Crypto pointed to $3 as a crucial resistance level for LDO to break. He attributed the token’s outperformance to investors positioning themselves ahead of the Ethereum staking narrative. They added: It’s just a matter of time before we’ll see the first ETH Spot ETF filing with staking included. That should kick off the ETH & staking narrative and should help boost the performance on these Liquid Staking Derivatives coins. As a token closely tied to Ethereum staking, LDO’s price trajectory remains heavily influenced by ETH’s performance. Fortunately for LDO holders, analysts remain optimistic about an upcoming Ethereum rally. Earlier this month, crypto analyst Mister Crypto remarked that ETH looks ‘bottomed out’, potentially getting ready for a strong rebound. At press time, LDO trades at $2.37, up 19.1% in the past 24 hours.

The Asset management firm 21Shares has filed with the US SEC to launch a spot Polkadot exchange-traded fund (ETF). 21Shares revealed plans to list the 21Shares Polkadot Trust on the Cboe BZX exchange, with Coinbase serving as the DOT custodian in a January 31 SEC filing . This comes four years after 21Shares launched a similar product in Switzerland. In February 2021, the asset manager introduced the world’s first Polkadot ETP on the Swiss SIX exchange. Uncertainty in Price Performance Post-ETF Launch Notably, the filing cautioned that there’s no guarantee of Polkadot’s price performance, either short-term or long-term, after the ETF launches. “There is no assurance that DOT will retain its value in the long or intermediate term,” it stated. The filing outlined potential risks associated with the Polkadot Network. These included a potential increase in the DOT supply available for trading, and the possibility of DOT being classified as a security “under federal laws.” Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted in an X post that the market will decide where value lies and if there’s value in launching such a product. “If no one puts money into a Polkadot ETF, it will close. People are free to launch whatever ETFs are deemed to be allowed by the SEC,” he noted. A Wave Of ETF Applications Ever since Gary Gensler’s departed from SEC earlier this month, the SEC has seen a surge in altcoin ETF applications. Grayscale submitted ETF applications for DOGE, XRP, Litecoin, and Solana. The firm recently launched a Bitcoin Miners ETF. Besides, asset managers Osprey Funds and REX Shares filed to launch ETFs for memecoins like Dogecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), and Bonk, the day after Gensler’s resignation. Also, recently, the SEC granted initial approval for Bitwise Asset Management’s Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, which aims to track the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum in one fund.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,DOT|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 02:13:01

The crypto space is filled with high-potential projects, but only a few truly stand out. Some thrive on hype, while others offer solid technology, real-world use cases, and exponential growth potential. Finding the top crypto presale projects and emerging blockchain leaders can make all the difference in achieving massive returns. Qubetics is making waves as the top crypto presale, attracting major investors with its cutting-edge interoperability technology. Kaspa is redefining blockchain speed and scalability, while Stacks continues to solidify its presence in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Let’s break down what makes these projects so promising. Qubetics: The Top Crypto Presale & Interoperability Leader Qubetics is positioning itself as the world’s first Layer 1 Web3 aggregator, seamlessly connecting blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana. This ambitious vision places Qubetics among the top crypto presale projects in 2025, thanks to its high utility and investor enthusiasm. As of January 31, 2025, Qubetics is in its 19th presale stage, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0606 each. The presale has already raised over $11.5 million, with more than 453 million tokens sold and 17,600 holders onboard. Analysts predict $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, marking a 312.18% gain, with post-launch projections targeting $1, $5, $6, and even $15, offering an incredible 24,630.58% growth potential. One of Qubetics’ standout innovations is its Interoperability feature. Imagine a business seamlessly moving assets between Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin without complicated bridges or third-party intermediaries. Picture a freelancer in Argentina receiving payments in Solana but instantly converting them into Bitcoin to hedge against inflation. This is the future Qubetics is building, making blockchain more accessible, flexible, and practical for real-world use. With its cutting-edge tech and groundbreaking interoperability, Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s the top crypto presale and a potential game-changer in blockchain infrastructure. Kaspa: The Speed Demon of Blockchain Kaspa is quickly rising through the ranks as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain networks. Built on a proof-of-work (PoW) system but optimized for high throughput, Kaspa is solving the congestion and inefficiency issues that plague traditional blockchains. Currently trading at $0.13213, Kaspa has seen a 3.42% increase in 24 hours, with a high of $0.13477 and a low of $0.12700. Analysts predict that Kaspa could hit $0.171776 by February 4, 2025, marking a 30.10% increase. Kaspa’s unique architecture allows for instant confirmation of transactions, making it an attractive choice for DeFi applications, high-frequency trading, and institutional adoption. Unlike traditional PoW chains, Kaspa’s GhostDAG protocol enables parallel block creation, eliminating bottlenecks while maintaining decentralization and security. For investors seeking top crypto opportunities that will lead to long-term gains, Kaspa is a solid bet. Its focus on scalability and efficiency could make it a go-to network for enterprise blockchain solutions. Stacks: The Future of Bitcoin Smart Contracts Stacks has emerged as the go-to solution for bringing smart contracts and DeFi applications to Bitcoin. Instead of competing with Ethereum and Solana, Stacks enhances Bitcoin’s capabilities, allowing developers to build secure, decentralized apps (dApps) while benefiting from Bitcoin’s unmatched security. Currently priced at $1.33, Stacks has seen a 3.01% increase, with an intraday high of $1.36 and a low of $1.28. The platform’s momentum continues to grow as more developers turn to Stacks to build DeFi, NFTs, and layer-2 solutions on top of Bitcoin. What makes Stacks particularly attractive is its ability to bring utility to Bitcoin’s $500 billion market cap. It’s a rare blockchain that aligns itself with the most secure network in the world while adding new layers of programmability and smart contract capabilities. For those looking beyond just top crypto opportunities and aiming for solid long-term plays, Stacks provides an exciting investment prospect. As Bitcoin adoption grows, Stacks will likely benefit from increased developer activity and institutional interest. Conclusion: The Best Crypto Investments for 2025 Identifying the top crypto presale projects and emerging market leaders involves evaluating technology, adoption, and long-term potential. Qubetics , Kaspa, and Stacks each bring unique strengths to the table. Qubetics is reshaping blockchain interoperability, positioning itself as the top crypto presale for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Kaspa, with its groundbreaking blockchain speed and scalability, is becoming a go-to choice for institutions and high-frequency trading. Meanwhile, Stacks is enhancing Bitcoin’s utility by integrating smart contract functionality, ensuring its relevance in the evolving blockchain landscape. For investors looking to capitalize on promising crypto projects, these three cryptocurrencies offer incredible opportunities.

How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN .

SOL, currently trading at $230, generated a revenue of over $116 million in the past month, compared to Ethereum’s $107 million earnings. Solana generated a revenue of about $59 million in December 2024, which translates to approximately a 96% increase over the month. The surge in earnings is primarily due to recent market dynamics, including increased DeFi activities and the influence of President Donald Trump launching his memecoin on the chain. While Solana is experiencing an increase in revenue, Ethereum saw a whopping 39% decrease. The network has also grown exponentially since January 2024, when it only earned about $6 million while Ethereum brought in about $179.6 million in the same period. Solana’s 2025 has been off to a bullish start Solana, known for its high performance and speed in executing transactions has seen significant growth compared to its competitors and is one of the best-performing cryptos of the current cycle all thanks to the massive growth in its DeFi sector, which has attracted a lot of attention, including that of US President Donald Trump. On Friday, January 17, 2025 Donald Trump launched the $Trump memecoin on the Solana blockchain on the weekend before his inauguration. Before then, the network had already positioned itself as a hub for memecoin activity. The $Trump coin was launched under $10, but it quickly rose by over 300% to rally to its peak value of $72 per token and an unprecedented $15 billion in market cap. The $ Melania token launch also helped boost network activity even though it drained some of the value locked into the $Trump meme as investors reverted funds into the second memecoin launched by the Trump family. The success of the $Trump meme leveraged the goodwill from Trump’s campaign, where he gradually established himself as a pro-crypto candidate. On the day $Trump launched, SOL’s price shot up by over 19%, driving the price to $295.3 as the memecoin also drove an influx of new users. $Trump currently trades at $24, down significantly from its $75 all-time high. However, the coin is still trading at over 500% from launch with over $2 billion in daily volume. There was an unprecedented 70% increase in stablecoin supply as new users and money flowed into the Solana blockchain because of the $Trump launch. It is now the third-largest blockchain in terms of stablecoin liquidity. Bitcoin also benefited from the Trump hype, hitting an ATH of $109,071 following his inauguration. Pump.fun outperforms Solana and Ethereum Complementing the effect of the $Trump launch on Solana is Pump.fun, the largest platform for launching memecoins. Platforms like Pump.fun have also been instrumental to the network’s meteoric rise during this cycle. On-chain analytics show that Pump.fun hit an all-time revenue of over $493 million ; on January 30, 2025, it recorded a trading volume of about $295 million. Following the successful launch of $Trump, over 6,000 tokens named “Trump” were launched on Pump.fun. In the past 30 days, Pump.fun has generated $116.72 million in revenue, beating Solana’s revenue over the same period by over $260,000. The frenzy of Trump launches on Pump.fun led to a record $3.3 billion trading volume.

39760928,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=666285,1738378533,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39760928.jpeg,US Federal Reserve official arrested for selling US economic secrets to China,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-federal-reserve-official-arrested-for-selling-us-economic-secrets-to-china/,"A former top dog at the Federal Reserve has been caught red-handed. John Harold Rogers, a 63-year-old Virginia resident and longtime Fed insider, was arrested on Friday after US prosecutors accused him of leaking sensitive economic data to Chinese intelligence operatives. The charges are smuggling classified information through personal emails and hotel room meetings under the guise of teaching “classes” to fake Chinese grad students. According to an indictment unsealed in a Washington, DC federal court, Rogers spent years exploiting his role as a senior adviser in the Fed’s international finance division to access top-secret details on US trade policies, tariffs, and Fed policy announcements. He then quietly passed that information on to his Chinese handlers, who posed as university students but were allegedly tied to China’s intelligence apparatus. Sensitive data, secret meetings, and a $450K paycheck The DOJ alleges that Rogers’s betrayal wasn’t sloppy or accidental, it was carefully planned. From 2018 until his retirement in 2021, the DOJ said Rogers emailed confidential Fed documents to his personal account and printed them out before traveling to China. Federal prosecutors say Rogers handled briefing books for Fed governors, classified reports on trade measures, and insider knowledge of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions—the very committee that sets the federal funds rate, which influences everything from mortgage rates to global bond markets. US Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. said: “President Trump tasks us with protecting our fellow Americans from all enemies, foreign and domestic. As alleged in the indictment, this defendant leveraged his position within the Federal Reserve to pass sensitive financial information to the Chinese government, a designated foreign adversary. Let this indictment serve as a warning to all who seek to betray or exploit the United States: law enforcement will find you and hold you accountable.” The DOJ’s indictment claims Rogers handed over this data like it was nothing, violating strict Fed rules in the process. The motive? Money. Prosecutors say Rogers wasn’t just being nice to China’s government. He pocketed $450,000 as a part-time professor at a Chinese university. But it wasn’t real academic work. The DOJ says the teaching gig was a front, allowing him to travel under the radar and deliver confidential data to Chinese intelligence officials disguised as students. One of the most alarming parts of this case is that Rogers’s leaks actually included data directly related to US-China trade tensions. He allegedly shared insider details on US tariffs, which were being discussed as part of then-President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade war with China. On the very day Rogers’s case became public, the White House confirmed that 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods were being finalized, with China’s coming Saturday morning. China’s role in US debt and why Rogers’s leaks matter This story is bigger than just about one guy selling secrets. China holds massive amounts of US debt — about $768.6 billion in US Treasury bonds as of November, second only to Japan. That makes them highly sensitive to any changes in US interest rates or economic policies. The DOJ says Rogers’s leaks gave China an unfathomable financial advantage. The Fed’s quantitative easing policies, especially after the 2008 financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic, directly affected US Treasuries. By knowing what the Fed was planning, China could position its holdings to minimize losses or maximize gains. Prosecutors accuse Rogers of transferring this information either electronically—through his personal email—or physically, by printing documents and carrying them to China. When questioned in 2020 by the Fed’s internal watchdog, the Office of the Inspector General, Rogers lied. The indictment says he denied accessing or sharing any sensitive data and downplayed his connections with Chinese officials. But by that time, the damage had already been done. The information had flowed into China’s hands for years, helping them navigate critical US decisions without anyone noticing. David Sundberg, Assistant Director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, said: “The Chinese Communist Party has expanded its economic espionage campaign to target U.S. government financial policies and trade secrets.” “This indictment sends a clear message that those who deliberately misuse sensitive Federal Reserve information for their own personal gain and lie about it to investigators will be held accountable for their actions,” said John T. Perez, Special Agent in Charge of Headquarters Operations.

This follows Grayscale’s announcement of the creation and launch of Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. A year ago, a Dogecoin ETF seemed far off, but on Tuesday, Bitwise filed for one, entering the race to offer Dogecoin exposure through an ETF. Coinbase Custody and BNY Mellon to Manage Dogecoin ETF The filign noted that similar to Bitcoin and Litecoin, DOGE can be used to pay for goods and services or converted to fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar, at rates determined on Digital Asset Trading Platforms or directly between users. DOGE is also used to pay miners for verifying transactions on the Dogecoin Network The proposed ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin without owning it directly. Notably, Coinbase Custody Trust Company would serve as the custodian, while BNY Mellon would handle administrative and transfer duties. This follows the firm’s earlier successful moves to convert its Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts into ETFs and highlights the growing trend of companies filing to launch DOGE ETFs in the U.S. Its important to note that the 19b-4 filing is a key step for new ETF listings. After it’s published in the Federal Register, the SEC has 45 days to review and decide whether to approve, disapprove, or initiate proceedings to disapprove the rule change. If necessary, the review period can be extended to 90 days, either if the SEC provides reasoning or if NYSE Arca agrees. Bloomberg Analyst Reacts To Grayscale’s Move Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas remarked , “I’ve never seen a trust launch and then try to convert to an ETF on the same day,” commenting on Grayscale’s move to convert its Dogecoin Trust into an ETF. Previously, Grayscale hinted in an October blog post that Dogecoin was among several assets under consideration for inclusion in future products. The asset manager is ramping up its ETF efforts, as it recently applied to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF and is also pursuing ETFs for major altcoins like Litecoin and Solana.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BTC|LTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 02:56:05

Dogecoin whales are making significant moves while the Shiba Inu price battles volatility. Amid this turbulence, all eyes are turning to WallitIQ (WLTQ) and its explosive growth. With technical indicators predicting an astonishing 37,250% surge , WallitIQ has become the go-to alternative for seasoned investors. No one wants to miss this rare chance for unprecedented gains, leaving Dogecoin (DOGE) and the Shiba Inu price in its wake. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Game-Changer Set To Yield 37,250% Gains This Fall WallitIQ (WLTQ) has been dubbed as the game-changer set to revolutionize crypto investments despite being at its presale stage. According to experts who accorded the digital token this name, its consistent commitment to explosive returns is rare in crypto history. With technical indicators pointing to a 37,250% move , the network has gone viral online and attracted backing from Dogecoin whales and other institutional investors who want more astounding rewards as early adopters. WallitiQ’s (WLTQ) innovative prowess sets a new standard in crypto trading. It recently introduced a Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App for investors to automate transactions, monitor real-time price movements, and access their transaction history. However, this is the tip of the iceberg, as this digital token has numerous technological features. All users on the platform can employ the Artificial Intelligence protocol to make smart money moves and identify suspicious activities in their wallets. Hence, its ecosystem combines its modern technology with high-yielding trading opportunities. The crypto event surpassed the million-dollar mark within a few weeks. However, the predicted 37,250% move by the Technical indicator has increased investors’ interest. With the next bull run on the horizon, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is projected to break more presale records. This prediction also means that the token could surge from $ 0.0420 to almost $16. Analysts say today is the best time to get ahead of the exponential gain and price increment. There is no need to worry about the safety of assets as the network underwent a smart contract audit from SolidProof, just as successful crypto projects do.

It’s a once-in-a-lifetime chance to wealth. Don’t let this one slip away from you. Why Dogecoin Whales Jump Ship From DOGE To WLTQ Dogecoin whales are on the move after Technical Indicator highlighted a past pattern with Dogecoin (DOGE) . Despite the peak performance in December 2024, Dogecoin whales are concerned about the future of this meme coin. An analyst observed that Dogecoin (DOGE) failed to touch the trendline in its latest drop. This recent analysis has raised concerns for the Dogecoin whales, who are now eyeing another token. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Declines By 10%. According to Technical Indicators, the Shiba Inu price declined by 10% on Monday, January 27. While experts believe that this drop is due to a notable figure leaving the Shiba Inu (SHIB) network, the market cap has plunged by $10.6 billion. As of this writing, the Shiba Inu price, trading at $0.00001889, has increased by over 3% in the past 24 hours. Conclusion In a market known for rapid fluctuations, the movements of Dogecoin whales and the Shiba Inu price volatility explain how unpredictable the crypto market is. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the beacon of opportunity amidst this chaos. Technical indicators forecast that the token will record a staggering 37,250% growth to reward investors seeking explosive returns . With its commitment to innovation and unrivaled growth, WallitIQ (WLTQ) will outperform Dogecoin (DOGE) and the Shiba Inu price in 2025.

With meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and SafeMoon bringing attention to the space, new and innovative meme coins are rapidly rising to the surface, bringing even more hype and excitement with them. These meme coins often fuse together viral internet culture, with wild predictions of their massive potential returns, giving investors something to be both excited and speculative about. And speaking of hype, one meme coin that’s particularly causing a stir right now is the BTFD Coin. Currently in the midst of its presale, BTFD is not just another “pump and dump” token. Investors are buzzing about the future of BTFD, and the 90% APY on staking is certainly helping it stand out from the pack. As this viral meme coin presale continues to hit full throttle, it’s got people asking whether this could be the next big thing in the meme coin space. Let’s take a closer look at the top new meme coins for massive return potential that are making waves this year, and see why BTFD Coin might be the one to watch. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – A Meme Coin with Real Utility and Staking Rewards BTFD Coin is undeniably one of the top new meme coins for massive return potential in 2025, and if you’re not paying attention, now’s the time to start. Not only is BTFD riding the wave of meme coin culture, but it also brings a strong case for why it’s more than just hype. One of the biggest selling points right now is its presale, which has already raised over $5.85 million, with more than 68 billion coins sold. And if you want to join the frenzy, it’s not too late. BTFD is offering an attractive 90% APY on staking to its holders, which is a massive incentive for anyone looking to earn passive income. Unlike many meme coins that are simply driven by viral trends, BTFD Coin is bringing something substantial to the table. That 90% APY means you could earn more while holding onto your investment, making this meme coin one that could provide real long-term value. Additionally, with over 10,000 coin holders already backing BTFD, it’s clear that this presale is catching the attention of crypto enthusiasts from all over. The community surrounding BTFD is growing rapidly, and this, combined with the staking rewards, is helping to create a sense of excitement that’s hard to ignore. There’s a lot of anticipation around what’s to come once the presale concludes, so if you’re looking for a coin with both potential and reward, BTFD should definitely be on your radar. How to Buy BTFD Coin During Presale: Go to the Presale Page. Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet).

Moo Deng (MOODENG) – The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves Another top contender in the top new meme coins for massive return potential is Moo Deng, a project that’s bringing some much-needed fun to the crypto space.

Memecoin (MEME) – The Meme Coin that Lives Up to Its Name When you think of meme coins, Memecoin is one that’s definitely worth considering in the top new meme coins for massive return potential.

Memecoin is a fun, vibrant coin that has managed to generate excitement among crypto traders and meme enthusiasts alike. The meme coin market is all about energy and hype, and Memecoin has certainly been able to capitalise on this trend. The coin’s community-driven approach allows for greater participation and engagement, meaning it has all the right ingredients to thrive in today’s meme coin craze.

What sets Ponke apart from other meme coins is its focus on charity and community. While it’s still a relatively new entrant, Ponke’s creators have stated that they intend to use a portion of the funds raised to support various charitable causes. This focus on giving back has helped Ponke cultivate a strong and loyal following. People want to invest in something that not only has the potential for a good return but also contributes to a greater cause.

Top 2 Stablecoins Have Seen Their Market Caps Grow Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the market caps of the top two stablecoins: USDT and USDC. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows the data for the 30-day change in the market caps of the two cryptocurrencies. As is visible in the graph, the 30-day percentage change in the market cap of USDC has spiked to sharp positive levels recently, implying that the stablecoin has been growing at a rapid rate. Unlike USDC, which has seen sustainable growth for the last few months, USDT kicked off the year 2025 with its 30-day market cap change dipping into the negative territory. Since bottoming at around -2% earlier in the month, though, momentum has returned for the asset as the indicator has just turned back green. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Extends To 1.1 Million BTC As Profit-Taking Continues This means that at present, both of the two stablecoin giants are enjoying an increase in their market caps. Historically, growth in these fiat-tied tokens is something that has been bullish for Bitcoin and other volatile cryptocurrencies. The reason behind this is the fact that investors who store their capital in the form of stablecoins generally plan to invest into the volatile side of the market eventually. When they buy BTC with their stables, its price naturally receives a positive effect. The most bullish scenario for the sector occurs when both Bitcoin and the stablecoins witness a rise in their market caps. Such a setup implies both sides of the market are getting net capital inflows. When only one rises while the other goes down, it means capital is merely seeing a rotation between the two. The recent inflows into USDT and USDC have come while BTC has been consolidating sideways. This suggests the capital entering into the stables is fresh, as BTC would have gone down if it was otherwise. At the same time, BTC itself isn’t seeing any direct inflows, hence the flat price action.

Thus, the number of stable deposits into these platforms can tell us about whether large-scaling buying of this type is happening or not. An analyst has shared the data for the metric in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. From the above chart, it’s apparent that the indicator is following a flat trajectory right now. An increase in it, like the one witnessed earlier, may provide fuel for a further rally for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $104,800, down 1% in the last week.

XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), once leaders in the crypto sphere, are now experiencing downturns, prompting doubts about their future viability. On the other hand, Web3Bay (3BAY) , an emerging project in the crypto world, continues its ascent and is increasingly seen as a potential game-changer. Could this be the Next Crypto to Explode? Let’s delve into the reasons Web3Bay is drawing investor interest. XRP’s Challenges: Legal Hurdles and Market Sluggishness Long seen as a heavyweight in the crypto arena, Ripple’s XRP is designed to streamline international transactions. Yet, its progress has been hampered by ongoing legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which cloud its growth prospects. Although there have been some wins in court, the ongoing litigation contributes to uncertainty regarding XRP’s compliance status. Additionally, emerging competitors in the global payment blockchain space pose a threat to XRP’s dominance. Its inability to overcome key price resistance levels makes it a less attractive option for those looking for substantial short-term gains. Dogecoin’s Decline: From Excitement to Caution Dogecoin, known for sparking a frenzy in 2021 through viral social media influence and celebrity endorsements like those from Elon Musk, is now seeing a shift. The market is gravitating towards projects with solid, real-world applications, highlighting Dogecoin’s limited utility. Dogecoin’s reliance on speculative trading rather than technological innovation has resulted in diminished interest. Although it retains a devoted base, the prospects for substantial growth are becoming more unlikely, especially when compared to rising stars like Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s Rise: Transforming Decentralized E-Commerce While XRP and DOGE are struggling, Web3Bay is quickly becoming a significant player. As a decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay uses blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and user-friendly marketplace. This new method poses a challenge to established platforms like Amazon and eBay. Web3Bay removes middlemen, allowing buyers and sellers to connect directly. Transactions are managed with its native token, 3BAY, and secured by blockchain-based smart contracts. Furthermore, Web3Bay offers both cryptocurrency and traditional payment options such as PayPal, appealing to both crypto enthusiasts and the general public. The platform’s presale has significantly contributed to its growth, raising over $1 million so far. Early backers see its potential to shake up the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector, and its appealing presale prices have boosted its attractiveness. Currently priced at $0.004562 in presale, the 3BAY token presents a remarkable chance for early backers. With an expected launch price of $0.1959, investors could see a 4,193% return on investment at launch. If the token hits $0.50 in the future, a simple $1,000 investment now could potentially increase to $10,960, showcasing its potential. Wrapping Up: Next Crypto to Explode The cryptocurrency market constantly changes, with new entries challenging established cryptocurrencies. As XRP and DOGE encounter increasing difficulties, Web3Bay is emerging as a strong candidate for the Next Crypto to Explode. Its fresh take on decentralized e-commerce, solid presale results, and substantial growth prospects position Web3Bay as one of the most promising new projects. With over $1 million already raised in crypto presale and an anticipated ROI of over 4,000%, this offers an exceptional chance for early investors to get involved at the start of a potentially high-growth venture. The real question is not if Web3Bay will succeed, but rather how significant its impact will be. As the platform continues to grow, now could be the ideal moment to consider what might become one of the most profitable investments of 2025. Are you prepared to be part of the Web3Bay movement?

However, he also added that not everyone at the company shares this view. Sam Altman appeared on Reddit for an “Ask Me Anything” session along with his team.

He said, “I personally think we have been on the wrong side of history here and need to figure out a different open-source strategy.” Sam Altman’s reply to a user on Reddit.

The company claimed to have built advanced AI models with training costs amounting to only $5.6 million, sending stock prices plummeting and removing nearly $600 billion from Nvidia’s market capitalization .

Grayscale has officially filed for an XRP spot ETF on the NYSE, and this has investors buzzing. Grayscale has been a key player in pushing forward Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which makes their move toward XRP important. This filing could pave the way for more crypto ETFs. Other companies, such as Canary Capital and Bitwise, have also applied for XRP spot ETFs. There’s even talk about BlackRock potentially submitting their own ETF application for XRP, and Grayscale has also filed for a Solana spot ETF. Meanwhile, companies like 21Shares, Bitwise, and Frank Templeton are considering their own applications for various crypto ETFs, including Dogecoin and Litecoin. The SEC has already acknowledged Litecoin’s ETF application, and while Bitcoin and Ethereum initially launched as Futures ETFs before becoming spot ETFs, Grayscale played a major role in that process. This growing momentum for crypto ETFs is undeniably bullish for the industry, particularly for coins like XRP that might eventually see ETF approval. However , Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has issued a warning, suggesting that while XRP ETFs might be approved in 2025, it’s likely that ETFs for other cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, will be prioritized. He said that the ongoing SEC lawsuit regarding XRP, which argues that the cryptocurrency is a security, remains a barrier to its ETF approval. “There’s some more work that needs to be done on that front that doesn’t need to happen with something like Litecoin.

With their quirky vibes, fun communities, and massive potential, meme coins are everywhere. From viral memes to insane price pumps, they’re capturing the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. And when it comes to top new meme coins to join this week, you bet BTFD Coin is making waves. The best part? BTFD Coin has a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’s catching fire, setting it apart from the crowd. As of today, BTFD Coin has raised an incredible $5.85 million during its presale, with over 68 billion $BTFD coins sold and more than 10,000 Bulls joining the movement. It’s already the talk of the crypto community, and if you’re looking to get in on the action, this is the week to do it. This article is going to dive into why BTFD Coin’s P2E is the feature you need to watch, alongside a few other meme coins like MOG and Cat in a Dog’s World. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution with P2E Action BTFD Coin has an epic Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’s already making waves. The game offers a truly immersive experience where you can earn rewards that are directly tied to the $BTFD coin ecosystem. Not only does this provide additional ways to earn, but it’s an investment opportunity like no other. Imagine stacking up $BTFD tokens while having a blast playing a game—how’s that for winning? With BTFD Coin’s presale price sitting at $0.00016, you’ve got a pretty sweet deal on your hands. For an investment of $2,000, you’ll be getting a whole lot of tokens: At $0.00016 per token: You’ll get 12,500,000 $BTFD tokens. If the price rises to $0.0006: You’ll see a massive return of $7,500 (a 3.75x increase). If the price skyrockets to $0.006: Your $2,000 investment could soar to $75,000. But wait, it gets even better. Thanks to the 100% code ( LAUNCH100 ), you’ll get twice the tokens with every purchase during this presale! With the code, your 12.5 million tokens become 25 million. Here’s how the math shakes out: Your 12,500,000 tokens (without the bonus) turn into 25,000,000 tokens. At $0.0006 per token, your 25 million tokens would be worth $15,000. If the price jumps to $0.006, your 25 million tokens could turn into $150,000. That’s some serious potential, and it all starts with BTFD Coin’s awesome P2E feature. BTFD Coin isn’t just about the P2E game, though. The community is everything. With over 10,000 Bulls already on board, BTFD Coin is all about bringing together like-minded investors who believe in the power of “buying the dip” and building something bigger together. MOG: The Coin for Meme Lovers MOG is the definition of a community-driven project, with a tribe of meme warriors constantly pushing out side-splitting content. If you’ve ever thought about how memes could take over the internet, MOG is the answer. With a market cap sitting at over $450 million, this meme coin is no joke. The community behind MOG is dedicated to pushing the meme game to new heights, and it’s already seeing some impressive gains. At the time of writing, MOG is up by 0.31% in the last 24 hours—proof that the power of memes isn’t going anywhere. But MOG isn’t just about the memes; it’s about a lifestyle. If you’re looking to join the top new meme coins to join this week, MOG is one to keep an eye on. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): The Cat Coin Taking Over Crypto The story behind Cat in a Dog’s World has captured the hearts of meme coin lovers everywhere. This cat-themed coin started as a small project but quickly gained traction, crossing a $1 billion market cap. With its whimsical storyline about a cat named MEW fighting the dog overlords to save the world, it’s not hard to see why it’s so popular. Right now, MEW is down 1.57% in the last 24 hours, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less of a contender. MEW’s price is currently $0.004353, and with a max supply of 88.8 billion coins, it’s a meme coin worth watching in the long term.

This price action is happening just below its recent swing high of $3.40, which was reached on January 16th. In order for XRP to break into new all-time high territory, this level needs to be breached. Short-Term Price Action: Sideways Consolidation Currently, XRP is experiencing a period of sideways consolidation, hovering just below the $3.10 mark. While the price hasn’t made any major upward moves recently, this could simply be a temporary phase before a potential breakout. Long-Term Outlook: A Possible Fifth Wave Looking at the long-term chart, XRP seems to be in the midst of a fifth wave that could complete a longer-term uptrend. Once this wave is completed, it’s possible that the market will experience a correction or pullback. These pullbacks could range from a smaller wave four to a larger and more significant correction. While the short-term outlook looks positive, the longer-term view suggests that after the wave five completes, there may be a major retracement. Key Price Levels to Watch Short-Term Support : The price has been finding support around key levels, especially on January 27th, where a potential bottom was marked in wave two. Short-Term Resistance : The $3.40 area remains a significant resistance level. A break above this would target higher prices, with $4.20, $5, and $6.62 as the next potential upside levels. However, if the price drops below certain levels, it would suggest that the larger wave two correction is still happening. Potential Risks: Break Below $2.52 The market could still face setbacks, as breaking the all-time high isn’t an easy task. If XRP drops below $2.52, it may mean a larger correction is taking place. A move below $2.52 could suggest that wave four is still unfolding as a larger correction, and the $1.96 level would then come into focus.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 04:38:07

Bitcoin (BTC) price showcased a waning movement to reach $102K, whereas Ethereum (ETH) and meme coins witnessed an upward intraday action. Simultaneously, QTUM emerged as the leader of the sector today, witnessing a staggering 40% uptick in value. Let’s take a closer look at some of the most trending coins for the day and broader market developments. Crypto Prices Today (February 1): BTC Wanes, ETH & Meme Coins Up The broader crypto market appears to be digesting the latest PCE inflation data release, which showed a 2.6% increase for December (YoY), per BEA data . Simultaneously, BTC price witnessed a waning action to reach $102K. Further, the global cryptocurrency market cap saw a 1.3% decrease to $3.49 trillion. However, ETH and meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE have illustrated rising trajectories, sparking market speculations. Besides, the global market volume also rose by nearly 16% intraday to reach $121.57 billion. BTC Price At $102K BTC price witnessed a 2% drop at the time of reporting, reaching $102,273. Its intraday low and high were $101,543.88 and $106,026.35, respectively. Bitcoin’s dominance sipped 0.16% from yesterday, reaching 58.08%. Further, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded only $241.28 million worth of inflows over the past week, per Sosovalue data of Jan 30 that excludes BlackRock data. The flagship crypto sees volatility amid reduced institutional interest and broader macroeconomic data release. ETH Price Jumps However, ETH price has gained nearly 2% in the past 24 hours, reaching $3,290. The coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $3,214.94 and $3,437.57, respectively. Notably, the rising trajectory comes against the backdrop of massive buying by ETH whales . Nevertheless, it’s also worth mentioning that U.S. Ethereum ETFs registered outflows worth $73.29 million over the past week, per SosoValue data as of Jan 30 that excludes BlackRock. XRP Price Today Besides, XRP price slipped nearly 2% over the past day and is currently resting at $3.04. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $3.01 and $3.11, respectively. Intriguingly, despite the asset’s price consolidation near the $3 mark over the days, a massive rally looms, per XRP price analysis by CoinGape. With historical trends in mind and the odds of an XRP ETF approval gaining weight, investors remain bullish over future movements. Solana Price Drops SOL price also witnessed a nearly 2% dip in value and is currently trading at $231. The coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $228.48 and $241.67, respectively. The current sluggish movement is primarily attributed to the broader market trend. Meme Crypto Prices Today Besides, the meme crypto sector glimmers immense optimism on Saturday. Notably, DOGE price witnessed a slight gain of 0.5% and traded at $0.3279. Further, SHIB price gained by a notable 2.5% to reach $0.00001903. Also, PEPE price surged by a whopping 7.5% intraday, reaching $0.0000138. Overall, the leading meme coins showcased a rising action despite the broader market trend. Top Crypto Gainer Prices Today QTUM Price: $3.98 24-Hour Gains: +40% Pudgy Pneguing (PENGU) Price: $0.01639 24-Hour Gains: +13% LidoDAO (LDO) Price: $2.30 24-Hour Gains: 12% Neo (NEO) Price: $14.93 24-Hour Gains: +10% Top Crypto Loser Prices Today Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Price: $0.8936 24-Hour Loss: -14% Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) Price: $1.84 24-Hour Loss: -10% SPX6900 (SPX) Price: $1.17 24-Hour Loss: -8.%% Onyxcoin (XCN) Price: $0.03169 24-Hour Loss: -7% Nevertheless, future prospects for the broader market remain bullish as market experts believe the bull cycle has yet to peak. Renowned expert Michaël van de Poppe posted on X , despite the rising inflation, stating that it is very “hard to say that the bull market has peaked.” This statement comes as Michaël spotlights how institutions and the entire U.S. government is interested in Bitcoin and adopting Web3.

In this article, I will share my opinion on how events related to Donald Trump’s inauguration will impact the crypto market, what initiatives might be implemented after February 20, 2025 and what lessons can be learned from years of interaction between the state and digital assets. Trump and Republicans – Monopolizing power and the risks of a split According to some statements, a unique situation is currently unfolding in which Republicans have gained the majority in both Congress and the Senate, as well as in the House of Representatives. This grants them the ability to pass laws more swiftly and confidently and to lobby initiatives, including those related to cryptocurrency regulation, Big Tech and more. However, a monopoly on power carries the risk of internal division if parts of the party find the course too radical or dangerous for their constituents. The role of Elon Musk and potential conflicts Elon Musk is a prominent figure whose statements influence crypto markets , geopolitics and global business. Some commentators suggest the following. Musk is engaging in political games – By supporting Trump, Musk may be participating in political maneuvers that could lead to serious problems for him, including investigations or legal prosecutions from other nations and even the United States. Diverging interests – I f Musk’s and Trump’s interests diverge at some point, Musk risks becoming a target, which could severely impact all his projects. Market volatility – The collapse of ‘Musk coins’ or a sudden shift in market sentiment could trigger a global wave of distrust in crypto, especially among retail and institutional investors. Amnesty for the darknet network founder President Donald Trump signed an executive order for the full and unconditional pardon of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the darknet marketplace Silk Road, who was serving a double life sentence. Many fear that such actions by the authorities could once again shape the media narrative to equate ‘cryptocurrency with illegal operations, fraud and scams.’ This reputation hindered the institutional recognition of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the early 2010s and could negatively affect them now. As a result, here are the possibilities that could occur. Reputational damage to the crypto market – The crypto market could suffer a reputational hit. Institutional investors pulling back – Institutional investors, already wary due to volatility and past incidents, might retreat once more. User concerns – Some users may fear that ongoing legal cases and repressive measures will ‘brand’ crypto as a national security threat (as seen in previous KYC/AML discussions). Tornado Cash and mixers – Double standards or necessary control Tornado Cash allows transactions on the Ethereum network to be mixed, obscuring the trail between sender and receiver. This increases privacy but also introduces risks, such as the following. Illicit use – Such services are often used to launder funds obtained illegally, including from sanctioned jurisdictions. Sanctions by OFAC (The US Office of Foreign Assets Control) – OFAC imposed sanctions on Tornado Cash, deeming it a tool for money laundering to circumvent sanctions. Vitalik Buterin stated that after Ross Ulbricht’s release, the next targets might be Tornado Cash team members Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm. If similar leniency is shown as with the creator of the largest darknet marketplace, it will raise additional suspicions that the new authorities are encouraging gray schemes. Risks for the crypto market and future scenarios 1. New wave of FUD (Fear, uncertainty and doubt) Potential amnesty for crypto market icons – The possible pardon of key figures in underground crypto markets could trigger negative media reactions. Public perception – Society might once again view cryptocurrency solely as a tool for criminal activities and money laundering. 2. Regulatory pressure Increased control – With the strengthening of Republican power and societal disagreements, regulators may begin to enforce stricter controls over crypto operations. New legislation – New laws could emerge that require the disclosure of user data. 3. Influence of major personalities Market volatility – If major players continue to abruptly change their views, pump or dump certain assets, volatility could increase sharply. Political missteps – An unsuccessful political maneuver could lead to lawsuits or impeachment, which would have immediate repercussions across the entire technology sector and further impact crypto. 4. Collapse or restructuring scenario Rebranding as a shadow economy – If cryptocurrency is once again branded as part of the shadow economy, institutional capital might decrease, and the market could enter another crypto winter. Industry cleansing – On the other hand, some analysts believe that after each such period, there is a cleansing of scam projects, and the industry becomes stronger in the new cycle. Conclusion The situation surrounding crypto remains contradictory. On one hand, there are signs of the mass adoption of digital assets. On the other hand, political factors, high-profile criminal cases and amnesties of scandalous figures could revert the market to a state of total distrust. High stakes in the political arena – toxic cases like Silk Road and Tornado Cash, as well as potential conflicts involving Elon Musk – heighten caution. It is not out of the question that in the coming months we will witness significant regulatory changes in the United States capable of affecting the global crypto market.

Parents Make a Direct Appeal (Report),https://cryptopotato.com/will-trump-pardon-sam-bankman-fried-parents-make-a-direct-appeal-report/,"The parents of the disgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried are looking into options to obtain a pardon for their son from former US President Donald Trump, according to a Bloomberg report. Stanford Law School professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried have reportedly held discussions in recent weeks with attorneys and individuals linked to Trump’s circle regarding potential clemency for their 32-year-old son, who was sentenced to 25 years for fraud in 2024. It remains uncertain whether they have directly contacted the White House. Pardon Uncertainty Following the collapse of FTX, a number of its former executives have benefited from sentence reductions in exchange for their cooperation with investigators. For instance, Caroline Ellison, who once led Alameda Research, was granted a reduced sentence for cooperating with prosecutors investigating FTX’s collapse. Sentenced to two years and beginning her prison term in September 2023, she secured an early release by three months. Former FTX executive Ryan Salame also received a sentence reduction – his original 7.5-year term was shortened by a year, with his expected release now set for March 1, 2031, under the First Step Act, which incentivizes good behavior. Additionally, FTX’s ex-technology chief, Gary Wang , and former engineering chief Nishad Singh similarly benefited from a reduced sentence after assisting authorities and managed to dodge prison. Both were sentenced to time served and three years of supervised release. The same cannot be said for Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison on March 28, 2024. The latest efforts to secure Bankman-Fried’s release follow a trend of seeking clemency for prominent figures behind bars. A notable example is Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road darknet marketplace, who was granted a pardon by Trump on January 21st after his supporters campaigned for years. However, Bankman-Fried may not receive the same level of backing as Ulbricht. Speculation about a possible pardon for Bankman-Fried surged in December, largely due to discussions about his Democratic Party connections. Tesla chief Elon Musk further fueled rumors by stating he would be “shocked” if a pardon weren’t granted. Despite this, prominent politicians, including former President Joe Biden, have not expressed support for clemency. FTX Reorganization Plan FTX’s court- approved reorganization plan, which took effect on January 3, will return up to 119% of creditor claims. Under this plan, an initial group called “convenience classes” – which includes users with claims of $50,000 or less – will be the first to receive payments.

However, very few analysts believe that ETH could be ready for a massive uptrend. With Vitalik Buterin’s assurance that the blockchain will never abandon its values and short-term holders capitulating, Ethereum price may be primed for a massive rally to $5,000 in February 2025. Ethereum performance in 2024 was disappointing. In 2025, while Bitcoin (BTC) is up 8%, ETH price today is around -1.4%. However, this outlook might have changed during month-end volatility that caused a massive capitulation. Ethereum Price Crash Triggers Holder Capitulation, Trend Reversal Likely On January 31, Ethereum price rose 5.87%, which was nothing unusual, but closed the day at a 1.65% gain. This sudden uptick and reversal, according to Santiment data , caused a massive capitulation. The Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) indicator flashed capitulation as 601 million ETH were exchanged at a loss. History shows that these capitulations are bottom signals, and price often kickstarts an uptrend soon thereafter. Here are some examples where capitulation was followed by double-digit uptrends: On August 5, 2024, when this indicator flashed capitulation signal, Ethereum price shot up 29% in the next three days. On September 10, 2024, ETH reversed 6% in three days but extended the gains to 17% in the next two weeks. Although the capitulation on November 19, 2024, was relatively small, it led to a 33% rally in the next 17 days. ETH Network Realized Profit/Loss The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio shows a similar outlook to the NPL indicator and confirms that capitulation could be from short-term holders. The 30-day, 60-day and 90-day MVRV that shows the average profit or loss of investors who purchased ETH in the past 30, 60 and 90 days ago sits at 0.62%, -3.88%, -2.36%, respectively. Only the 180-day MVRV hovers around 6.32%, which is the average profit of investors that purchased ETH 180 days ago. ETH 30, 60, 90, 180-day MVRV With many short-term holders sitting at a loss, the probability of Ethereum price triggering a reversal is high. Is $5,000 Possible in February 2025? There are multiple signs that suggest Ethereum price could hit $5,000 in February 2025. The first data point is the historical returns, which indicates that returns in the post-halving years are supporting altcoin rally. Furthermore, the daily chart shows Ethereum price is hovering inside a falling wedge setup. This pattern is formed by connecting ETH’s four lower highs and three lower lows since December 16, 2024. This technical formation forecasts Ethereum price target of $4,000 after a 17% rally. This target is obtained by adding the distance between the wedge’s first swing high and swing low to the breakout point of $3,222. ETH/USDT 1-day chart While the falling wedge is bullish, here are key resistance levels that could threaten the uptrend: $3,592, $3,975, and $4,069. Once the $4,000 psychological level is cleared, ETH will attempt a revisit to its ATH at $4,877. After clearing this level, Ethereum price prediction hints at a retest of the $5,000 psychological level.

This DOT-focused ETF is one of the more unusual crypto ETF applications made to the regulator this week. The 21Shares Polkadot ETF will track DOT prices using the CME CF Polkadot-Dollar Reference Rate. In addition to these updates, 21Shares noted that it will tap Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, which will hold the assets for the ETF product if approved. 21Shares files Polkadot ETF while competition in the crypto ETF space grows As per the S-1 filing, 21Shares said the firm plans to list the Polkadot ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The asset manager noted that the fund is a passive investment that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of DOT. Therefore, 21Shares pointed out that the funds will not conduct speculative trading, for instance, buying DOT low and selling high. 21Shares informed potential investors that it would not pursue its investment objectives through leverage or derivative products. Instead, it will exclusively track the price of DOT as listed on the CME CF Polkadot-Dollar Reference Rate. The firm characterized the protocol as a decentralized, distributed computing platform that functions on a peer-to-peer network. The 21Shares filing follows Tuttle Capital Management’s proposal earlier this week for a 2x leveraged Polkadot ETF, which was part of a broader package of 10 leveraged crypto ETFs. Yet, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas confirmed that Tuttle Capital has withdrawn its filing for all 2x leveraged ETFs. This is not the first time 21Shares’ filing has been featured on the ETF front this week. As reported earlier, the Cboe exchange refiled its Solana 19b-4 application alongside those of VanEck, Canary Capital, and Bitwise. A few hours ago, Grayscale also launched a Dogecoin Trust. The trust offers investors exposure to DOGE with a 2.5% management fee amid rising demand. Shortly after, Grayscale converted the trust filing into an ETF application. This was likely the first time a trust had been converted into an ETF on the same day. Eric Balchunas . Wrote: Man, the jockeying is intense. I’ve never heard of a trust launching and then looking to convert to ETF the same day. But they may now be in pole position in 19b-4 race. Also, we now up to four Doge ETF filings (including 2x). Gensler has only been gone for like two weeks. Eric Balchunas Grayscale also filed ETF applications for XRP, Litecoin, and Solana. The firm recently launched a Bitcoin Miners ETF, which provides exposure to Bitcoin-related companies without directly investing in cryptocurrency. This fund is designed to appeal to traditional investors. Trump’s appointments boost crypto industry, but Polkadot faces setbacks Things have started to look up in the crypto industry since President Donald Trump’s inauguration. First, the president appointed Mark Uyeda as acting Chairman of the US SEC and tapped Caroline Pham as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair. Mark Uyeda is leading the SEC on an interim basis as Paul Atkins, President Trump’s nominee, awaits the congressional process to become the permanent chair. The new appointees have already shown signs of being open to engaging with the crypto industry. In addition to establishing the Crypto Task Force, Mark Uyeda’s SEC has approved its first digital currency ETF product. Given this precedent, speculation is high that most of the newly filed crypto ETF products will also be approved. Interestingly, Polkadot’s price has shown no reaction to ETF news . Polkadot, the 18th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen disappointing price performance lately. According to CoinMarketCap data, its price has dropped by 5.16% over the past 12 months and 10.48% in the last month. The filing highlighted potential risks related to the Polkadot Network, including the possibility of an increase in the supply of DOT available for trading and the potential classification of DOT as a security “under federal laws.” It also cautioned that Polkadot’s price performance, whether in the short or long term, following the ETF launch is not guaranteed. As per the filing, there is no assurance that DOT will maintain its value in the long or intermediate term.

LTC has significantly outperformed LTCN, doubling in value while LTCN remained stagnant, highlighting the fund's premium collapse. With potential approval of a spot LTC ETF under a Trump SEC, there's no reason to pay a premium for LTC exposure through LTCN. Investors must understand the changing landscape for Grayscale funds, as new LTC investment options could impact capital flows and premiums to net asset values. Back in August I covered the Grayscale Litecoin Trust ( OTCQX:LTCN ) for Seeking Alpha. At that time, I called shares in the fund a 'hold' and even suggested longing Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) directly rather than LTCN if speculators were bullish LTC: On one hand, I think LTC is too cheap relative to peers. On the other hand, I think LTCN is too expensive relative to LTC. Despite what, I believe, are flaws in the product itself, LTCN is a fund that I've held long in the past and one that I certainly wouldn't rule out longing again in the future. That said, I don't want to pay double what the LTC is currently worth. I still think the better approach is owning LTC directly over holding LTCN shares. At the time that piece was published, LTCN shares traded at a roughly 100% premium to the net asset value of the underlying assets represented by each fund share. To no real surprise, Litecoin has drastically outperformed LTCN over the last 6 months. Since that early-August article, LTC has more than doubled while LTCN has effectively gone nowhere: LTC vs LTCN (Seeking Alpha) How could this be? In this update, we'll get into what is driving the collapse in the fund's premium, some of the on-chain data for Litecoin, and why I'm actually now willing to upgrade LTCN to a 'buy' from a 'hold.' Why The NAV Premium Is Essentially Gone One day after the general election in the United States, I offered one of the ways I was playing the ' Trump Trade ' for SA readers. Given the outgoing administration's regulatory approach to digital assets, my view for some time has been that a second Trump administration would be far friendlier to the cryptocurrency industry. Resulting in a better fundamental setup for 'altcoins' - essentially, anything other than Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). If there was any doubt about those assertions in November, certainly actions taken in the days leading up to the inauguration when President Trump launched his own memecoin might alleviate any concerns about continued regulatory pressure on the alts. To be sure, we're already seeing asset managers apply for spot ETFs offering exposure to no less than four additional digital assets. Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), XRP ( XRP-USD ), and Litecoin are on the list for the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider. Of which, a Litecoin ETF from Canary appears to be the furthest along judging by a request for public comment. LTCN NAV Rate (CoinGlass) At market close on January 30th, LTCN traded at a premium to NAV of just 4.7%. As of article submission on January 31st, LTCN is down 7% intraday, while LTC is down just 2%. For all intents and purposes, the premium is officially gone. Thus, if you like the investment prospects for LTC, LTCN is no longer a terrible way to express that idea. Of course, we could see LTCN trade down to a discount once again, as it did for most of 2022 and 2023. However, any concerns about such a scenario should be alleviated by the fact that Grayscale has already filed to convert LTCN to a spot fund. Is Litecoin Investment Justifiable? In my view, the short answer is 'yes' if you envision a future with competing digital currencies rather than one where Bitcoin reigns as the only cross-border settlement asset. Litecoin is competitive with Bitcoin in terms of usage metrics like daily active addresses. Over the last 30 days, Litecoin's daily active address figure is roughly 360k - this is just half that of Bitcoin but many multiples higher than competing payment-themed proof-of-work coins like DOGE and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ). Active Address Ratios (CoinMetrics) Where I think LTC makes its utility case quite clear is in the active address ratio. Though it is well off highs from early 2024, Litecoin's 30-day average active address ratio is 4.4%. Meaning, 4.4% of the non-zero wallet addresses that hold LTC are actively using the currency. This is more than 3x the active user base of Bitcoin. 30 Day NVT Ratio (CoinMetrics) From a valuation standpoint, LTC has been left in the dust in terms of network valuation multiple over the transacted value that the network is actually settling. At a 30 day average NVT ratio of just 64, Litecoin is the cheapest PoW payments network by a wide margin. The next closest NVT ratio is DOGE at 145. Bitcoin trades at a 30 day NVT ratio of 188. Meaning, LTC is comparatively cheaper than BTC. Closing Takeaways In my view, it is absolutely critical that investors in Grayscale funds understand the game that they're playing and how the setup in that game is drastically different from what it was three to five years ago. For LTCN specifically, there are implications from not just share lockup expiration , but the simultaneous spot LTC ETF applications from competing financial asset managers. Five years ago if a speculator wanted to get exposure to Litecoin through a traditional brokerage account, LTCN was the only option. Those days are likely coming to a close. With an approval of a spot LTC ETF, and I don't think it takes much imagination to see such a product hitting the market under a Trump SEC, there is absolutely zero reason to pay a premium for LTC exposure through LTCN. And the market appears to have already sniffed this out. Grayscale Fee Flight (Farside) One must also consider the implications of capital flows should new LTC investment options be available for TradFi brokerage accounts. We've seen the Grayscale 'fee flight' problem have an impact on the early net asset flow for the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs. Bitcoin's net flow story was positive in spite of exit pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) holders. It took four months following launch for the spot Ethereum funds to flip to positive net flow. However, the election results were absolutely the primary catalyst driving that sentiment shift for ETH. The same is likely to be true for LTC. I happen to bullish on LTC. For the first time since I started covering the fund, I'm also bullish LTCN.",LTCN|LTC-USD,EN,0,0,LTC|BCH|DOGE|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-01 04:59:26

The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization slipped from a $3.74 trillion high early in the week before stabilizing around $3.7 trillion by late Friday. The crypto fear and greed index dropped 7 points from the previous week to neutral levels at 54, reflecting the lack of momentum prevailing in the market. What happened with Bitcoin this week? Bitcoin remained confined within a tight range, trading between $98,380.59 and $106,462. A few factors can be attributed to the subdued performance, preventing the flagship crypto from retesting its all-time high. The early week jitters came after the world was introduced to DeepSeek, a Chinese-built artificial intelligence model that directly competes against US-made large language models like ChatGPT and Claude. Notably, DeepSeek was created on a fraction of the budget of its competitors, yet it offers comparable performance. As the Chinese alternative rose up app store charts, it sparked fears among the US tech markets, with major companies like Nvidia experiencing a 17% drop, erasing $589 billion from its market cap. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.1%, and the S&P 500 fell 1.5%. This downturn in the stock market spilled over into the crypto space, contributing to Bitcoin’s constrained trading range. Traders remained cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting, wary of a potential hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. However, bulls quickly reclaimed the key $103,000 support level after the Fed kept interest rates unchanged. Will Bitcoin go up? Currently, the report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, set for February 7, is expected to be a major deciding factor behind Bitcoin’s trajectory. Experts state that a strong labor market report would signal a resilient economy, thereby reducing the likelihood of further rate cuts, which wouldn’t bode well for BTC. On the contrary, a weaker-than-expected report could increase the chances of rate cuts, which could be the much-needed push that’s currently lacking in the market. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong, with institutional demand on the rise and its adoption as a reserve asset already gaining traction across various jurisdictions. Several countries are actively discussing its role in their financial systems, while some US states have introduced bills that are currently under consideration. In terms of technical analysis, a bullish case was presented by well-known trader Gladiator, who flagged that BTC had formed a cup and handle pattern on the daily chart. According to the analyst, this could position Bitcoin for a breakout above key resistance levels, potentially paving the way for a retest of its all-time high. Another perspective was presented by pseudonymous commentator CHADXBT, who did not rule out the possibility of an early February shakeout. However, the analyst expects the second month of 2025 to be “bullish overall.” He added: I also don’t think the top is in for this cycle. Ignore the people that say it is! When writing, Bitcoin was breaking past $105,500 but had posted a modest 0.3% loss on the weekly timeframe. Altcoin market lacked momentum Pressured by Bitcoin’s volatility, traders steered away from the much riskier altcoin market this week, which was defined by low trading volumes. Yet the altcoin season managed to climb four points to recover above 50. On X, some pundits speculated about the onset of alt season. Analyst Ash Crypto highlighted a resemblance between the current altcoin market structure and the historical pattern observed in 2020. Ash noted that the overall crypto market cap had broken out of a descending trendline, resembling the early stages of the 2020 rally. This breakout could signal the beginning of a bullish phase for altcoins if the pattern continues to develop as expected. However, broader market conditions, heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, remain a critical factor. Double-digit gains were posted by several of the top crypto projects. The best performers were: Mantra Mantra (OM), the RWA-focused layer-1 blockchain pulled the highest gains this week among the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Source: CoinMarketCap Over the last 7 days, OM rose 47.3%, exchanging hands at $5.30 at press time while its market cap was standing at over $5.1 billion. The gains also came amid a high-volume trading environment, with OM’s daily trading volume rising from around $80 million on Jan. 24 to $523 million when writing. Most of the weekly gains came from the hype of its major partnership with DAMAC, one of the largest real estate companies in Dubai. DAMAC will reportedly tokenize $1 billion worth of its real estate holdings on the Mantra blockchain. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s recent call for the U.S. securities regulator to approve the tokenization of stocks and bonds also acted as a tailwind for OM’s recent gains. Such a move could unlock trillions of dollars in assets within the stock and bond markets, with Mantra well-positioned to benefit from the expanding tokenization trend. Jupiter Jupiter (JUP) rallied 23.1% over the past 7 days, priced at $1.05 at the time of writing. Holding the 78th position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, the altcoin’s market cap was seated at $1.77 billion, with a circulating supply of about $1.68 billion in JUP tokens. Source: CoinMarketCap Most of the gains over the week likely came as the Solana DEX aggregator announced major platform changes at its recent ‘Catstanbul 2025’ event in Turkey. During the event, Jupiter burned 3 billion JUP tokens, reducing the total supply by 30%. The project’s founder also announced that half of the platform’s fee revenue would be used to buy back JUP tokens and lock them in a long-term reserve. Bittensor Recording gains of a little over 20% over the last 7 days, Bittensor (TAO) also made it among the leading gainers of this week. The AI coin was trading at $472.04 per coin with a market cap of over $3.8 billion at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap TAO rallied ahead of the mainnet launch of an overhaul of its integrated tokenomics and governance model dubbed ‘Dynamic TAO’. It replaces static control over TAO emissions, allowing emissions to adjust dynamically based on network activity and demand. A key feature of Dynamic TAO is the introduction of subnet-specific tokens, which will allow users to engage with and support individual subnets.

What Analysts Think!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-officialmagacoin-outperform-solana-in-2025-what-analysts-think/,"While Bitcoin (BTC) proved it’s possible by delivering exponential returns to early investors, the spotlight now shines on OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a newcomer that could replicate such success. With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity.

This 1.2% increase over the past hour reflects renewed optimism in the market. Amid this price performance, Crypto Dan, a CryptoQuant analyst has shared his analysis of on-chain data and market behaviors that may shape Bitcoin’s trajectory in the weeks and months ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Outflows Signal Bullish Strength As Demand Remains High At $100K – What This Means Bitcoin Bullish Market But Caution According to Dan, the amount of Bitcoin held for less than six months continues to show notable growth with each market cycle. This trend suggests that as Bitcoin’s appeal widens, new capital inflows—particularly from the expected introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs—could further drive demand. Dan anticipates that both institutional and retail investors will ramp up their involvement as these ETFs gain traction by the first half of 2025. Additionally, while current indicators remain bullish, Crypto Dan warns that surging interest in Bitcoin and altcoins, paired with an influx of new investors, could signal that the current cycle may be nearing its peak. If Bitcoin pushes through its all-time high with significant momentum, and altcoins follow suit, it could trigger a wave of inflows that may mark the cycle’s final stages. Dan advises investors to start considering risk management strategies.

According to recent Binance data, retail investors have significantly increased their BTC deposits over the past month, with inflows reaching approximately 6,000 BTC. In contrast, whale activity on Binance has dwindled, with their BTC inflows dropping to around 1,000 BTC—a fourfold decrease. Darkfost notes that retail investors often use exchanges to liquidate their holdings, whereas whales’ reduced inflows suggest they are holding onto their Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Enters Ascending Phase After Cup And Handle Formation At $105,000, Here’s The Next Target This contrasting behavior offers insights into broader market sentiment: retail participants appear eager to capitalize on short-term gains, while larger, more established investors maintain a more cautious stance.

Let’s Break Down What Top Analysts Predict,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-could-doge-hit-1-in-2025-lets-break/,"From $120 billion in December 2024 to $88 billion in January 2025, the decline of the meme sector is of concern to its investors. Dogecoin price prediction remains a debate among traders, with many questioning if it is possible for DOGE to reach $1 this year. Analysts have different views on whether DOGE has the momentum for such a move or if other factors could limit its growth. This article examines expert opinions, potential catalysts, and the challenges DOGE may face in its attempt to hit the psychological mark. Dogecoin: The Journey to $1 For the first time in four years, Dogecoin could be ending January without a double-figured price increase. This outlier event has seen the DOGE token drop 8th place on the market cap standings. With Dogecoin trading below $0.35 at a volatility of 6.9%, traders are concerned about the memecoin’s short term capabilities. The Dogecoin price prediction on CoinCodex highlights a 6.89% decline ahead of March 2025. Analyst Javon Marks predicts a potential 600% surge for DOGE , targeting a price of $2.28 based on historical patterns. Given that DOGE stepped out of trend in January, other analysts are not convinced the token would follow the same expectations. However, InvestingHaven forecasts a minimum price of $0.244 and a maximum of $1.445 in 2025. The recent election of Donald Trump and the appointment of Elon Musk as a special adviser have fueled optimism for DOGE . There are definitely parallels to Musk’s involvement in DOGE and historical investment successes. In the past week alone, large DOGE transactions have jumped by 41% and active addresses by 34.91%. The Possibilities are Endless With Panshibi Token traders are looking into Panshibi. The new meme coin has bulldozed its way into the meme sector, with projections suggesting that the SHIBI token could reach a $1 valuation by the end of 2025. This bold prediction is a result of Panshibi’s fundamentals, growing community, and well-designed ecosystem. Some of the driving momentum for its boom comes from Panshibi’s staking model that offers an impressive 1,200% annual reward incentive, making it an attractive opportunity for investors. This incentivizes long-term holding and creates a steady demand for the token. There’s even a governance mechanism in SHIBI, offering a direct voice for its community in deciding its future. Panshibi’s lore and branding also contributes towards its widespread appeal. Set in Bamboo Valley, the Panshibi Pandas represent decentralization, resilience, and innovation. This storytelling aspect has helped establish a strong community that unite against centralization and unnecessary intermediaries. Analysts also point to Panshibi’s security and transparency as major advantages. With a fully audited smart contract by Coinsult and locked liquidity for ten years, the project provides investors with a sense of stability. If current momentum continues, Panshibi’s path to $1 in 2025 may be more than just speculation—it could be a reality. Conclusion The best time to invest in projects is during the early stages of presale. Currently, Panshibi is in its second stage, with SHIBI tokens going for $0.003 apiece. With projections of $1, Panshibi’s worth could soar at least 33,000% in 2025 alone. Anyone could become a millionaire or a billionaire.

The BTC price is trading 2.17% down at $102,222 with daily trading volumes surging 14% to more than $44 billion. Bitcoin has been oscillating in the range of $101K-$106K for a while and breaking either end of this range would exacerbate a move in that direction. Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash Amid Tariffs Financial investor Robert Kiyosaki has weighed in on the potential impact of tariffs introduced under former President Donald Trump. He predicts a significant downturn coming for assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Kiyosaki stated that while these assets may experience a sharp decline, however, he views the situation as an opportunity to accumulate more. In his X post, Kiyosaki noted : “TRUMP TARRIFS BEGIN: Gold, silver, Bitcoin may crash. GOOD. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is DEBT….which will only get worse. CRASHES mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer”. Earlier this week, popular analyst Arthur Hayes also predicted a “mini financial crisis” in the making expecting a Bitcoin price crash to $70,000, before the mega bull run begins for $250K. BTC On-Chain Indicators Apart from Robert Kiyosaki’s views, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode has identified a significant price cluster for Bitcoin. It revealed that a substantial volume of BTC has exchanged hands in the $94,000 to $101,000 range over the past 45 days. This has created a dense supply zone, with $98,000 emerging as a pivotal support. As long as Bitcoin price stays above this support, the upward momentum could continue. Falling under $98,000 could open the gates for new lows to $90,000 and more. Source: Glassnode Trump Tariffs and Macros Under Radar As Trump tariffs are likely to go into effect starting February 1, investors can expect strong market volatility in the next week. Furthermore, the crypto market reaction will largely depend on next week’s US jobs data . “Tariffs may cause short-term disruption, but I’m not concerned about market reaction,” Trump remarked, underscoring his confidence in the long-term benefits of the policy. The DeepSeek disruption is also challenging the US AI dominance and Trump seems all prepared to put tariffs on chip exporters to China. “Eventually we are going to put tariffs on chips,” he added. Commenting on the DeepSeek saga, Robert Kiyosaki said: “The world is about to be turned upside down. Grateful Trump is President again”. This week, the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged amid a strong labor market and growing inflationary pressure. Although President Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, Fed Chair Jerome Powell refused to budge. Despite this strong market development, Bitcoin price has shown strength holding above $100K levels.

She observed that many cryptocurrency investors also have a strong relationship with God. Her post suggested that this was more than just coincidence—that there might be a deeper, divine reason behind it. The idea resonated with many in the XRP community, leading to a discussion about how faith influences financial decisions and how some investors feel guided by God toward XRP for a higher purpose. Faith-Driven XRP Investments Several XRP holders responded to The XRP Girl’s post with similar experiences. One individual stated , “I found XRP through Jesus. My faith and my crypto journey have been walking hand in hand.” Another commented , “I think it’s because God is blessing those of us that know we are just stewards of the money for His purposes.” For these investors, their faith is not separate from their financial choices. Instead, they see their involvement in XRP as a path guided by divine influence. Some also believe their ability to remain patient and navigate market fluctuations reflects their trust in God’s higher plan. Many in the XRP and broader crypto community are Christians, and well-respected Christian prophets have also shared prophecies on XRP’s future. Brandon Biggs, a prophet who predicted the assassination attempt on U.S. President Donald Trump, previously shared a revelation from God that XRP can reach $10,000 . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Viewing Wealth as a Responsibility A key theme among these faith-driven investors is stewardship—the belief that wealth should be used for a greater purpose. Rather than viewing XRP solely as a means of personal financial gain, some investors believe they must use any potential profits to help others. This perspective shifts the focus from mere accumulation to purposeful financial management. This belief was further reinforced when The XRP Girl posted again on January 31, writing: “Whether Crypto is involved in the beast system or not, I know in my heart, God has brought me towards XRP for the purpose of good.” Her statement suggests that, despite uncertainty about the future of cryptocurrency, she remains confident that her investment in XRP is part of a larger divine mission. Other Christian prophets have weighed in on a potential dominant future for XRP , and for those who see their investment as part of a divine plan, it is not just about financial returns, it is about fulfilling a higher purpose.

Before and after returning to office, he has repeatedly suggested imposing tariffs. Also, Tariffs could impact inflation by driving prices up. This, in turn, might affect the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates in the near future and beyond. Recently, Crypto saw a repeat of previous trends after a report about a tariff delay was quickly dismissed by the White House, indicating that market’s optimism was once again short-lived. Trump’s Tariff Announcement Sends Bitcoin Lower President Trump announced Thursday that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would start on February 1. Bitcoin, which had surged over $106,000, fell 2% to around $104,000 after the news. U.S. stocks gave up some gains but still ended the day higher. “The President will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada, and a 10% tariff on China for the illegal fentanyl that they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said during a White House press briefing. BREAKING: Karoline Leavitt confirms that the Reuters report is FALSE. Tomorrow, Feb 1st is the deadline for the tariffs There will be a 25% tariff on Canada, a 25% tariff on Mexico, and a 10% tariff on China No clarification on exemptions They will be LIVE in under 24 hours pic.twitter.com/7pzV9pblD9 — Autism Capital (@AutismCapital) January 31, 2025 On Friday, Reuters reported that tariffs would be delayed until March 1, with a process allowing countries to request exemptions for certain exports. However, the White House quickly rejected this, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirming that the tariffs, including a 10% levy on China, will take effect the next day. Notably, Trump’s tariffs and possible retaliation from Canada and Mexico could affect $1.6 trillion in North American trade, potentially ending the free trade system that has connected the three countries for over 30 years. Like Thursday, Bitcoin had risen above $106,000 and appeared ready to break the $109,000 mark. However, the tariff news caused prices to tumble down again, with Bitcoin trading just under $103,000, down 2.3% in the past 24 hours.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 06:18:45

Meanwhile, the delisting process will unfold in multiple stages, with automatic conversions of remaining holdings set for March 31, 2025. Kraken’s Delisting Plan and Timeline Recently Kraken emailed its users confirming that it will delist Tether (USDT) along with PayPal USD (PYUSD), Euro Tether (EURT), TrueUSD (TUSD), and TerraUSD (UST) stablecoins for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Damn, @Kraken is delisting USDT for Europeans on March 31st pic.twitter.com/FOlqu4DrV3 — Delta (@deltaxbt) January 31, 2025 The delisting process will begin on February 13, 2025, with margin trading for these assets being placed in “reduce-only” mode for EEA clients, meaning no new positions can be opened. Following this, spot trading will transition to a “sell-only” mode by February 27, preventing users from opening new positions with these stablecoins. Meanwhile, by March 17, any open margin positions involving these stablecoins will be closed automatically. All spot trading will cease by March 24, with all remaining orders canceled. Finally, after March 31, any remaining holdings in these stablecoins will be automatically converted to a compliant asset. Why Is Kraken Taking This Step? Kraken’s decision follows increasing pressure from European regulators under the MiCA framework, which introduces stricter rules for stablecoin issuers and exchanges. The exchange operates in several European countries, including Germany, Spain, Italy, and France, and is adjusting its services to ensure compliance with these new regulations. Thus users are encouraged to convert their affected holdings before the deadline to avoid automatic conversions. Other Major Exchanges Delisting Too Kraken is not the first major exchange to take such steps—Coinbase and Crypto.com have also announced plans to phase out support for USDT in Europe. While Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, the company thrives globally. In 2024, Tether reported a record-breaking $13 billion in net profits. Additionally, El Salvador recently welcomed Tether’s expansion, allowing the company to set up its headquarters in the country. Despite losing ground in the European market, Tether’s dominance in the crypto space remains strong.",News,EN,0,0,USDT|EXCHANGE|PYUSD|TRADING|TUSD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 06:25:35

While meme coins and hype-driven projects have seen their moments in the spotlight, the next bull run is expected to be dominated by blockchains solving real financial, privacy, and data-related challenges. Three projects are making waves: Qubetics, Internet Computer (ICP), and Filecoin (FIL). Qubetics is leading the charge in real-world asset tokenization, making investment opportunities more accessible and liquid. Internet Computer is redefining how web applications function on a decentralized scale, while Filecoin is bringing permanent, decentralized storage solutions to businesses and institutions globally. Each of these projects is tapping into trillion-dollar industries, setting the stage for massive investor demand in the coming months. Among them, Qubetics stands out the most, with its $TICS presale exploding past $11.5 million in raised funds and more than 453 million tokens sold to over 17,600 holders. With mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, early adopters are locking in their positions before prices soar. Let’s break down why these three projects are poised to ride the next bull run crypto wave. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Asset Tokenization for a Decentralized Future One of the biggest problems in finance today is illiquidity—assets like real estate, luxury goods, and fine art are difficult to trade, requiring expensive intermediaries and long settlement times. Qubetics is tackling this issue head-on with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace , which converts real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens, allowing them to be fractionally owned, traded, and instantly settled. Imagine owning a fraction of a high-rise property in Dubai, a Picasso painting, or a gold reserve—without the need for banks, brokers, or excessive fees. With Qubetics, these assets can be digitized, fractionalized, and traded on-chain with full transparency. This democratizes access to exclusive investment opportunities that were once reserved only for the ultra-wealthy. This innovation extends beyond individuals; institutions can use Qubetics’ platform to tokenize their own assets, unlocking new liquidity streams and expanding their investment reach. Whether it’s a private equity firm tokenizing a $100 million real estate fund or a company selling equity-backed digital securities, Qubetics is building a system where asset ownership is as simple as buying a cryptocurrency, making it the next bull run crypto . With smart contract automation, transactions that used to take weeks or months can now be settled in seconds. And thanks to blockchain’s immutable ledger, Qubetics offers unparalleled security, fraud resistance, and transparency, making it one of the most groundbreaking financial applications of Web3 technology today. Qubetics Presale: Investors Rushing to Get In Before the Price Surge The Qubetics presale is moving fast, and investors are locking in their positions before prices increase again. The presale follows a strict schedule, with each stage lasting only 7 days and a 10% price increase happening every Sunday at 12 AM. Right now, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0606, but prices will continue to rise as the presale nears its final stages. Analysts are predicting massive growth for $TICS, with forecasts suggesting it could hit $0.25 post-presale, delivering a 312% ROI. But the real gains could come after launch, with some projections placing $TICS at $1 (1548% ROI) or even $10 long-term (16,387% ROI). For example, an investor putting $1,000 into Qubetics at its current price would secure 16,501 tokens. If $TICS reaches $5 post-mainnet launch, that same investment would be worth $82,505—an absolutely mind-blowing return. With Qubetics’ mainnet scheduled for Q2 2025, this presale could be one of the last opportunities to buy at this price level before adoption accelerates. TICSScan: Boosting Transparency and Security in Web3 To enhance trust and transparency, Qubetics has launched TICSScan, its proprietary blockchain explorer. This platform allows investors, developers, and businesses to monitor transactions, verify asset ownership, and ensure compliance with on-chain audits. For example, an investor purchasing tokenized real estate on Qubetics can use TICSScan to confirm asset transfers, validate smart contract executions, and verify market liquidity. This level of visibility is unprecedented in traditional finance, giving investors full control over their on-chain assets. With blockchain adoption growing, TICSScan is set to play a vital role in increasing institutional trust in digital asset ownership. Internet Computer: Redefining How the Web Operates While Qubetics is revolutionizing asset trading, Internet Computer (ICP) is taking on an even bigger challenge—fixing the internet itself. Instead of relying on centralized cloud providers like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, ICP offers a fully decentralized web infrastructure where developers can build websites, dApps, and services without relying on traditional hosting. Right now, ICP is trading at $9.15, and the network is seeing increased adoption due to its scalability, speed, and reduced reliance on big tech corporations. Developers are using ICP to create decentralized applications that cannot be taken down or censored, making it one of the most promising next-gen blockchain ecosystems. With more developers migrating to decentralized hosting solutions, ICP is positioned to gain significant momentum in the next bull run. Filecoin: Solving the Global Data Storage Crisis In today’s world, centralized storage solutions are vulnerable to hacking, data loss, and corporate manipulation. Filecoin solves this by offering a fully decentralized cloud storage network, where users can rent out unused storage space to earn FIL tokens.

Analysts Say Bitcoin Will Continue Sideways Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-the-crypto-market-satiated-for-now-analysts-say-bitcoin-will-continue-sideways-move/,"As the first month of 2025 comes to an end, Bitcoin (BTC) continues moving within its post-US election price range but nears two historical closing candles. Some analysts weighed in on the market’s state, suggesting that it could be satisfied with good news for the time being. Related Reading: SUI Rally Eyes Double-Digits: VanEck Analyst Forecasts $16 Price By Year-End Bitcoin Near Historical Monthly Candle Despite the recent corrections, Bitcoin has been moving inside the $90,000-$108,000 range since December 2024, consolidating within the mid-zone of its price range for most of this period. Some analysts have pointed out that the flagship crypto has had a decent performance this month, not staying away from the $100,000 mark for long. Moreover, its recent recovery of the $104,000-$105,000 range is setting the stage for a historical monthly and weekly candle. As noted by analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin is hours away from closing the month above the $100,000 barrier for the first time and “printing a new Monthly Candle to confirm a breakout from its Monthly Bull Flag.” Additionally, Bitcoin could see a “historic Weekly Close” if it ends the week above $104,416. According to the analyst, similar closes above major weekly resistances at this point of the cycle have historically preceded a “continued upside to new all-time highs.” Nonetheless, Rekt Capital has also pointed out that BTC is most likely preparing for the second leg of its Post-halving Parabolic Phase, which suggests that a new Price Discovery rally could start mid-February. The second leg has historically started around the 16th week of the Parabolic Phase, the analyst explained, while BTC is currently in the 14th week, recovering from the First Price Discovery Correction. Based on this timeline, the flagship crypto is expected to continue gearing up for the rally for another week and a half, and investors are advised to “patiently HODL” BTC. Is The Crypto Market’s Confidence Shaken? Another market watcher noted that Bitcoin has been “stuck in rage for a while now,” adding that he expected to see some bullish momentum after the FOMC news. The trader considers that the lack of significant price movement suggests BTC’s price will “be sideways for the coming few days.” Recently, Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research Analyst at Nansen, weighed in on the market’s current state. Barthere suggested that the market appears to be “satiated for now,” as most of the recent bullish news has been seemingly overlooked. The report highlighted the latest regulatory changes, including the overturn of SAB 121 and the executive order for a US Crypto Stockpile, have been “extremely bullish” and will likely facilitate a wider crypto adoption. Additionally, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is reportedly considering public blockchain to track and manage public expenses. However, the news has been ignored and followed by “underwhelming price action by BTC and the rest of the crypto market.” This suggests that the market is momentarily satiated and “more reactive to negative sentiment than positive news.” Barthere pointed out how the DeepSeek-triggered pullback from Monday bled into the crypto market.

Based on the price and volume action right after the shakeout, the analyst noticed “that ‘buyers’ confidence has been somewhat shaken,” resulting in an initially timid recovery. Nonetheless, unlike other higher-beta tokens, Bitcoin had a shallow and brief intra-day sell-off on Monday, which “shows an interesting level of ‘dispersion’ between tokens, with BTC still the darling token of this new, policy-driven, market environment.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Bullish Breakout|Bitcoin correction|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto analyst|Crypto Bull Run 2025|crypto market|crypto market correction|Crypto trader|Nansen,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-01 06:30:10

Since there are many tokens, it’s hard to pick out the best ones. Here, we highlight five crypto assets to buy. These tokens stand out for their innovation, community engagement, or established market presence: Solana , Cardano , Litecoin , Ethereum , and the intriguing Panshibi . Each of these assets has its strengths, but one in particular: Panshibi, merits special attention for its potential in the meme coin sector. Let’s take a look at these tokens Solana: Speed and Scalability Solana is known for its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second. Today, Solana has become a go-to platform for developers looking to create high-performance decentralized applications (dApps). Investors eyeing a crypto asset to buy might find the Solana ecosystem appealing. It features various DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces which are always busy. As one of the trending tokens, Solana’s continuous tech upgrades and expanding use cases make it an exciting prospect for February. Cardano: The Future of Blockchain Governance Cardano distinguishes itself with its approach to blockchain development. This platform simply aims for security and sustainability. With the help of the Ouroboros protocol, Cardano offers a proof-of-stake system that is both efficient and scalable. This has drawn interest from those concerned with environmental impact. Cardano has also been making strides in DeFi and smart contract capabilities. This gives it a perfect position as a crypto asset to buy for those who value long-term stability and potential. Litecoin: The Digital Silver Litecoin is known as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold. It offers quicker transaction times and a different hashing algorithm (Scrypt). Since its design makes it more accessible for everyday transactions, investors find it easier to use. Also, Litecoin integration of technologies like MimbleWimble for privacy ensures it remains relevant. For investors looking for a crypto asset to buy , Litecoin makes a compelling choice. As one of the trending tokens , Litecoin may continue to attract attention. Ethereum: The Backbone of Defi Ethereum is a part of the foundation of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) . With the transition to Ethereum 2.0, the network promises to tackle scalability issues and reduce energy consumption. This evolution enhances the performance of Ethereum and increases its appeal as a crypto asset to buy . For those tracking trending tokens , Ethereum’s extensive developer community and the constant innovation keeps it at the forefront of blockchain technology. Ethereum is not stopping anytime soon, and most investors should know that. Panshibi: The Meme Coin Sensation Panshibi is a cultural phenomenon that offers the charm of pandas coupled with the Asian culture.It integrates social-fi and AI to engage its community, offering token holders the chance to participate in quests, earn rewards, and gain access to exclusive clubs. Panshibi’s presale strategy is particularly noteworthy, with a cap at $10 million over 60 days, which is designed to increase token value significantly. Also, the project’s commitment to transparency and security is evident from its smart contract audit by Coinsult, ensuring no vulnerabilities. With 60% of its total supply dedicated to the presale, early investors have a unique opportunity. In addition, Panshibi’s plan to list on major exchanges like Uniswap shows a clear path to liquidity. Since the token’s price structure is expected to rise to 1,200% during presale and potentially 145,000% post-launch, Panshibi positions as a high-reward crypto asset to buy . The community’s enthusiasm, reflected on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and the strategic locking of liquidity and team tokens for 10 and 2 years respectively means Panshibi’s is here to stay. Conclusion Solana , Cardano , Litecoin , and Ethereum each offer unique advantages, from speed and scalability to academic rigor and market longevity. However, Panshibi’s approach to offer community, utility, and fun in one meme coin makes it the standout crypto asset to buy this February. With a robust presale structure, a clear roadmap for growth, and a vibrant community, Panshibi is not just a trend but potentially a market leader in the making. For those looking to capitalize on the next big thing, Panshibi could well be that gem among the trending tokens .

SAB 121 rollback celebrated, but broader regulatory alignment remains crucial. Traditional accountants criticized SEC’s SAB 121 for violating established GAAP standards. The rollback of the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 is a big win for both the U.S. crypto and banking industries. This decision removes a major obstacle that complicated U.S. banks’ ability to offer digital asset custody services. This change has been praised by many, especially in the crypto sector, who saw the original guidance as an unnecessary hurdle.

The news was shared by crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) on X, generating significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community. BREAKING: PURPOSE INVESTMENTS INC, THE LEADER BEHIND THE FIRST BTC ETF & ETH ETFs, FILES PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS FOR THE WORLD‘S FIRST #XRP ETF! https://t.co/oFCxGg7Z7i pic.twitter.com/HQCKARbdkr — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) January 31, 2025 If approved, the Purpose Investments XRP ETF would provide institutional and retail investors with regulated access to XRP without the need to directly hold or manage the digital asset. This development follows a growing trend of major financial firms seeking to establish cryptocurrency ETFs, which aim to offer investors exposure to digital assets while mitigating risks associated with direct ownership. The filing by Purpose Investments indicates growing confidence in XRP as a viable investment option. This move also suggests that financial institutions recognize the increasing demand for diversified crypto investment vehicles beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Growing Interest in XRP ETFs The news of Purpose Investments’ filing comes amid a surge in interest surrounding XRP ETFs. Major firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares, began filing for XRP ETFs in January 2025, and Donald Trump’s election victory and return to the White House has increased confidence of the crypto community that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon approve these investment products. XRP gains traction as an institutional-grade asset, supported by its efficiency in cross-border payments and blockchain technology. The interest from multiple asset management firms suggests that XRP is recognized as a valuable component of the evolving digital asset market. Ripple’s president has publicly stated that XRP is next in line for ETF approval. She also believes the new administration will speed up the approval process. The introduction of these products would complement Ripple’s broader efforts to integrate XRP into global financial systems. Purpose Investments’ decision to file for an XRP ETF represents a significant milestone for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency industry. With firms like Purpose Investments, Grayscale, and CoinShares actively pursuing XRP ETFs, it is clear that demand for regulated investment vehicles tied to the asset is on the rise. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously described XRP ETFs as inevitable . With a crypto-friendly White House and SEC, the crypto world expects sensible and favorable crypto regulation, and 2025 could be the year XRP’s mainstream adoption soars through ETFs.

The meme coin is up by 6.74% over the past 24 hours, still it unclear what lies ahead for its long-term growth. Unlike emerging blockchain sectors such as DeFi, PayFi, and AI, which offer tangible use cases, PEPE’s primary driver is market sentiment. Without a sustainable use case or technological foundation, its potential for exponential growth appears limited. Meme coins largely rely on online communities and viral trends, making them highly unpredictable. While PEPE remains a dominant force in this category, new investors are seeking projects that offer more than speculation. This is where PEPETO comes into play.

Solana’s SOL: The Fast Lane of Blockchain Technology Solana is a blockchain platform built for speed and scalability. It offers a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps), standing alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. What sets Solana apart is its ability to process transactions quickly without relying on techniques like sharding or second-layer solutions. Developers can use multiple programming languages, making it flexible and accessible for building diverse projects. At the heart of Solana’s ecosystem is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. In the current market, SOL attracts attention due to its high-capacity network that can handle high-activity services without slowing down. While other platforms work on improving their scalability, Solana provides a fast alternative now. For those watching market trends, SOL’s technology and potential make it a notable player in the evolving world of cryptocurrencies. Chainlink: Connecting Blockchains to the Real World Chainlink is building bridges between blockchains and real-world data. It allows smart contracts to access information outside the blockchain securely. This means contracts can react to events like stock prices, weather updates, or sports results. Chainlink uses a network of “oracles” to fetch this data. To ensure accuracy, it combines information from multiple sources and rewards reliable data providers with its token, LINK. In today’s market, Chainlink stands out by solving a key problem: bringing external data into blockchains. As more industries explore blockchain technology, the need for trustworthy data connections grows. LINK tokens play a vital role in this system. They reward those who provide accurate data and help keep the network secure and decentralized. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Chainlink offers unique value by enhancing what smart contracts can do. With its practical use and growing importance, Chainlink looks promising in the current market cycle. Conclusion While SOL and LINK offer strong potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) distinguishes itself with a unique sports-meme ecosystem, poised for significant growth in the ongoing bull run.

Recent on-chain data revealed that whales accumulated 560 million Dogecoin, signaling a potential rally for DOGE price to $1. Further, in the wake of Grayscale’s new DOGE-backed Trust’s launch, investor sentiments surrounding the meme-themed asset have undergone a paradigm bullish shift. Dogecoin Whales On Buying Spree Signal Bullish Move Ahead In an X post by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez on February 1, it was spotlighted that Dogecoin whales purchased 560 million tokens in the past week. This massive buying signals heightened market confidence in the asset. Source: Ali Charts, X Notably, the analyst reveals that the buying spree follows an intense sell-off recently, thus flagging renewed interest among large-scale investors. As a response, broader market participants anticipate a bullish move ahead, primarily amid rising demand and buying pressure. Further, it’s also worth pointing out that CoinGape previously highlighted rising DOGE whale accumulations . Grayscale’s New Trust Launch Solidifies Market Optimism Meanwhile, the launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust has offered additional market support to the dog-themed meme crypto. The launch of a traditional financial investment product backed by a meme-themed asset paves the way for further money inflow into the crypto’s ecosystem. Simultaneously, it’s also worth mentioning that asset management company Bitwise submitted S-1 filing for a DOGE ETF previously. Overall, these recent endeavors, pushing the meme coin as a traditional investment product, have cemented investors’ bullish outlook for the token. Is Dogecoin To $1 Run Inevitable Amid Rising Whale Buying & Market Support? At the time of reporting, DOGE price continued showcasing a sideways trading session, exchanging hands at $0.3277. The crypto’s 24-hour low and high were $0.3243 and $0.3407, respectively. Amid the abovementioned bullish news surfacing across the market, intraday trading volume for the asset rose by 36% to $1.57 billion. Market watchers continue to anticipate further gains amid rising Dogecoin whale accumulations and broader developments. A recent Dogecoin price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the new Trust launch and ETF filing further amplify the token’s potential to hit $1. However, it’s worth mentioning that the coin must clear the $0.35 level promptly for further upside actions. The latest macroeconomic events, such as unchanged rates this FOMC and rising PCE inflation YoY, present the crypto market with uncertainty.

SEC Lawsuit: Here’s What Happened in January,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-heres-what-happened-in-january/,"TL;DR The SEC doubled down on its appeal against the 2023 ruling favoring Ripple, while the non-profit organization Better Markets sided with the regulator, arguing that XRP is a security. With pro-crypto Mark Uyeda replacing Gary Gensler at the SEC, analysts speculate on potential outcomes that could favor Ripple. The Tussle Goes on While the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started in 2020, its final resolution remains to be seen . The past few years were quite eventful, with numerous developments and partial court wins that seemingly tipped the scales in favor of the company. The first month of the new year also offered some key updates. In mid-January, the securities regulator officially filed its first opening brief as part of its appeal against a court decision concerning the XRP sold on exchanges years ago. It also insisted (once again) that Ripple’s native token should be classified as a security. A week later, Ripple requested a due date of April 16, 2025, for its brief. The SEC’s appeal concerns Judge Torres’ ruling from August 2023 when she found that the firm’s programmatic sales of XRP to retail clients through centralized exchanges did not breach the rules. And while the crypto industry has largely sided with Ripple in the lawsuit, some financial entities have voiced support for the Commission. On January 22, the non-profit organization Better Markets categorized XRP as a security. “The XRP tokens sold by Ripple Labs, Inc. (“Ripple”) are investment contract securities regardless of whether investors acquired them directly from Ripple or indirectly on secondary trading platforms. And they are investment contracts regardless of the purchasers’ level of sophistication. In all cases, investors were led to expect profits from the efforts of others, thus satisfying the third prong of the Howey test for investment contracts,” the brief reads. Gensler’s Departure An important event that may impact the Ripple v. SEC case is Gary Gensler’s resignation as a Chairman of the watchdog . He stepped down on January 20 (the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration) and was replaced by the pro-crypto Mark Uyeda. Gensler was considered a huge enemy of the crypto sector, and the XRP army interpreted the shifts in the SEC’s leadership as something that could lead to a potentially favorable resolution for Ripple. One person who presented three possible outcome scenarios following the changes is the American attorney John Deaton . First, he assumed that the SEC might stand by its appeal, thus prolonging the battle indefinitely. Second, he suggested that the regulator could dismiss the plea and insist that Ripple pay the previously ruled penalty of $125 million. Last summer, Judge Torres ordered the company to settle the amount due to violating certain rules. Some of the company’s execs were more than happy to abide by the rules, considering that the fine represented just a fraction of the $2 billion the SEC initially asked for. Deaton concluded that the third (most unlikely) scenario includes dismissing the appeal and scrapping the multi-million penalty. The post Ripple v.

According to the Jan. 31 SEC filing , the proposed 21Shares Polkadot Trust would be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with Coinbase designated as the custodian for DOT holdings. The development follows 21Shares’ earlier foray into Polkadot investment products. In February 2021, the firm made history by launching the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product (ETP) on Switzerland’s SIX Exchange, bringing institutional investment exposure to the blockchain network. Market Uncertainty Surrounding Polkadot ETF Polkadot, currently ranked 18th by market capitalization, has faced sluggish price performance despite its potential as a multi-chain interoperability protocol. CoinMarketCap data shows that DOT has lost 5.16% over the past year and has seen a 10.48% decline in the last month. Given this volatility, 21Shares acknowledged in its filing that there is no guarantee of future price appreciation, cautioning that the ETF’s success will be directly tied to Polkadot’s market performance. “There is no assurance that DOT will maintain its value in the long or intermediate term,” the filing stated. “In the event that the price of DOT declines, the Sponsor expects the value of the Shares to decline proportionately.” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart weighed in on the filing, emphasizing that market demand will ultimately determine whether a spot Polkadot ETF is sustainable. “The market will decide where value lies and if there’s value in launching such a product. If no one puts money into a Polkadot ETF—it will close. People are free to launch whatever ETFs are deemed to be allowed by the SEC,” Seyffart stated in a Jan. 31 post on X. idk who needs to hear this but the market will decide where value lies and if there's value in launching such a product. If no one puts money into a Polkadot ETF — it will close. People are free to launch whatever ETFs are deemed to be allowed by the SEC — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 31, 2025 The filing also outlined several potential risks associated with Polkadot’s network, including concerns about an increased supply of DOT tokens in circulation and the possibility of DOT being classified as a security under U.S. federal law. In February 2023, the Web3 Foundation, which oversees the Polkadot protocol, pushed back against the security classification concerns. The foundation asserted that it had carefully managed DOT distribution to prevent any single entity from gaining excessive control over the network. Additionally, it stated that it had rejected investment-only purchases from venture capitalists, focusing instead on promoting Polkadot’s technology rather than its token price. Crypto ETF Filings Surge Following Gensler’s Departure 21Shares’ latest filing comes at a pivotal time for the SEC and cryptocurrency ETFs, following the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Jan. 20. Gensler, known for his cautious stance on crypto regulations, stepped down amid increasing pressure for greater regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. His departure has triggered a wave of new crypto ETF filings, including Osprey Funds and REX Shares, which filed for meme coin ETFs covering Dogecoin (DOGE) , Official Trump (TRUMP), and Bonk (BONK) on Jan. 21. Meanwhile, the SEC has also granted initial approval for Bitwise Asset Management’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, which would track both BTC and ETH in a single fund—another significant step in the evolving landscape of crypto-based financial products.

Currently priced at $0.000000107 in its presale, PEPETO has already raised an impressive $4 million, positioning itself as a contender in the meme coin market while maintaining a focus on genuine utility. Trump and Melania Coin Values Stagnate After Days of High Gains Since their launch, Trump and Melania coins have drawn considerable attention, capitalizing on the popularity of the current US first family. However, their current state in the market has been met with skepticism. Trump Coin, at one point, boasted a market cap of $15 billion before falling to a more modest $4 billion. Meanwhile, Melania Coin reached a peak valuation of $2 billion before encountering the inevitable volatility associated with memecoins, dropping to $480 million, at press time. Despite their widespread recognition and financial gains, these tokens remain largely speculative, lacking any functional use cases or inherent utility. Critics continue to question the value of these coins, particularly given their political ties and the growing concern about the lack of real-world applications. While the coins may appeal to supporters and collectors, the absence of tangible benefits leaves many investors uncertain about their long-term sustainability. PEPETO: A Meme Coin With a Purpose Amidst the noise created by Trump and Melania coins, PEPETO has emerged as a meme coin with a difference. While it embraces the humor and viral nature of meme coins, #Pepeto stands out by offering a unique set of features that resonate with both tech enthusiasts and crypto investors. The new memecoin comes with an ecosystem built around six core principles: Power, energy, precision, efficiency, technology, and optimization.

The tweet, which included a video advertisement featuring Azimo’s use of RippleNet for global payments, was met with excitement and speculation regarding its timing and implications. The ad showcased RippleNet’s capabilities in facilitating seamless cross-border transactions, emphasizing the theme: “The Future of Finance Has No Boundaries.” BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! Ripple's New Ad Shakes Up Crypto: ""The Future of Finance Has No Boundaries"" $XRP pic.twitter.com/7XZw2YQktQ — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) January 30, 2025 Following Brett’s post, an X user, NetBastard, hinted at a potential connection between the resurfaced ad and the upcoming Super Bowl, scheduled for February 9, 2025. The user commented , “Hmm, If only there was some event airing on 02/09/2025 that is shown around the World to get an ad like this one out to the masses… Hmmmm what could that be?” This remark fueled discussions about whether Ripple could be planning a marketing campaign during the Super Bowl, one of the most widely viewed events globally. However, another X user, WatsonSherlock1887, countered the excitement by clarifying that the advertisement was not new. “Ad is from several years ago it isn’t a new ad,” the user noted . This statement aligns with the history of Ripple’s partnership with Azimo, which was officially announced in 2020. At that time, Azimo integrated Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution to enhance remittance services, particularly in corridors such as the Philippines. Azimo and Ripple’s 2020 Partnership In 2020, Azimo, a digital money transfer service, partnered with Ripple to leverage its ODL solution, which utilizes XRP for instant settlement. The collaboration aimed to reduce costs and improve the speed of international transactions. Azimo’s adoption of Ripple’s technology was seen as a step forward in the company’s mission to provide efficient cross-border payment services. At the time of the partnership, Azimo’s CEO, Richard Ambrose, highlighted the benefits of ODL, stating that it allowed the company to settle payments in real time while significantly reducing liquidity costs. The service was initially launched for remittances from Europe to the Philippines, a major remittance corridor with high demand for cost-effective transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Speculation and Potential Implications The sudden release of the advert has led to speculation about Ripple’s future marketing efforts . Some community members believe Ripple could prepare a broader campaign to promote XRP’s utility in global payments. The mention of the Super Bowl in user discussions further amplified expectations, as securing an advertisement slot during the event would represent a major step in mainstream marketing. Super Bowl commercials are among the most expensive and high-profile advertisements globally, often featuring major financial and technology firms. If Ripple were to sponsor an ad during the event, it would signify a strong push toward mainstream adoption and public awareness of its payment solutions. However, there is no official confirmation yet from Ripple regarding such plans. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Source: FLASH Recent price activity indicates a bounce from the lower trend line and the 0.786 Fibonacci level, hinting at a potential bullish reversal. However, confirmation of this trend is awaited. To sustain a bullish trajectory, the DOT price must breach a critical resistance level at $7.545, marked as a horizontal green line on the chart. A breakout above this level could pave the way for a rally toward a projected target of $14,605, as suggested by a bullish green arrow. Polkadot Positioned for Massive 650% Price Surge? Polkadot (DOT) may be gearing up for a significant rally, according to market analyst Javon Marks. In a recent statement, Marks highlighted DOT’s multiple breakouts as a sign of strong bullish momentum. If this projection materializes, it would represent a staggering DOT price climb of over 650% from current levels. “$DOT (Polkadot), by its multiple breakouts, looks to still be well positioned for another monumental surge in price, which could lead all the way to the $53.385 target, if not even higher,” Marks stated.

Following this, the altcoin market has displayed a significant rise in volatility with multiple tokens heading toward a new ATH. Evaluating the current market trends, top traders and investors are curious with questions like “Is this a good time to invest in altcoins?” In this article, CoinPedia’s expert panel has uncovered the market sentiment and possible monthly price analysis of 3 undervalued altcoins. Solana (SOL) Despite recording a correction of 6.52% in seven days, the Solana price has jumped 12.82% over the past month and has a Year-to-Date return of +22.19%. This highlights an increase in the long-term bullish price action for the 05th largest cryptocurrency in the market. TradingView: SOL/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues hovering around its neutral point in the daily time frame with a bearish curve. Furthermore, the EMA 50-day acts as a support in the Solana price chart. This suggests increased buying pressure for the altcoin in the market. Maintaining the price above its resistance level of $237.50 could set the stage for the price of Solana to head toward its high of $300. On the contrary, if the bears outrun the bulls, this could pull the SOL crypto toward its low of $210.

He believes that assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver could see a sharp dip as a result. Perhaps, Kiyosaki sees this as a golden buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern. Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Dip In a recent tweet post on X Robert Kiyosaki has warned that Bitcoin could face a sharp price drop as Trump’s new tariffs take effect. However, Kiyosaki’s tweet was clear, “Gold, silver, Bitcoin may crash. GOOD. Will buy more after prices crash.” For him, market crashes are like sales in a store. When prices drop, it’s the perfect time to invest in assets that have long-term value. TRUMP TARRIFS BEGIN: Gold, silver, Bitcoin may crash. GOOD. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is DEBT….which will only get worse. CRASHES mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 31, 2025 His warning comes as Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range of $101K to $106K. Market volatility could increase as Trump’s tariff policies take effect on February 1, influencing global financial markets, including crypto. The Real Problem: Debt While Kiyosaki is optimistic about buying assets during crashes, he also highlights a growing concern is debt. Meanwhile, he warned, that the “Real problem is DEBT which will only get worse.” He believes that the increasing levels of debt in the economy are a ticking time bomb. While market crashes can be managed with smart investments, the debt crisis is a deeper issue that needs attention. Bitcoin’s Key Price Levels Kiyosaki’s prediction aligns with recent comments from Arthur Hayes, another well-known analyst. Hayes expects a short-term decline in Bitcoin, possibly pushing its price down to $70,000, before a major rally towards $250,000 begins. Apart from bitcoin prediction, on-chain data from Glassnode shows a significant Bitcoin price cluster between $94,000 and $101,000. This suggests that many traders have bought Bitcoin in this range, making $98,000 a critical support level. If Bitcoin stays above this, it could maintain its bullish momentum. However, if it falls below, it might open the door for a drop toward $90,000 or lower.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BTG|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 07:28:25

Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing, wondering if this coin might be the next big thing. The potential for massive returns draws comparisons to past success stories. Investors are keen to discover whether this digital asset could redefine market expectations before 2025 wraps up. Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Denounces Fake AI Agents The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is a 100% meme coin . Agent A.I. is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: Agent A.I.’s True Identity Keep this under wraps: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs.\ Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount Dogecoin: From Meme to $50 Billion Crypto Phenomenon Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun twist on cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be plentiful. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there’s no maximum limit. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value exceeding $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and enthusiastic support from people like Elon Musk. The coin’s rise showed how powerful online communities and social media can be in the financial world. Dogecoin’s technology is similar to Bitcoin but with some tweaks. Transactions are fast and fees are low, making it suitable for everyday use. In the current market, Dogecoin remains popular. Its friendly community and widespread recognition set it apart from other coins. While it started as a joke, Dogecoin has shown that sometimes, even a meme can make a big impact. Conclusion In conclusion, while established coins like Dogecoin may offer less immediate potential, the emerging $AGENT token presents a unique opportunity. Agent A.I. is a genuine memecoin aiming to disrupt the influx of fake AI agents in the crypto space. With a community-driven presale offering significant early discounts and a capped supply of 5 billion tokens, it positions itself for substantial growth. The tokenomics are straightforward, focusing on staking and rewards without unexpected inflation. Early participation in the $AGENT mission could secure a place in a promising journey in the crypto market.

A Complete Guide for New Investors,https://coinpedia.org/beginners-guide/what-is-nft-marketplaces/,"The post What Are NFT Marketplaces? A Complete Guide for New Investors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Have you ever heard of someone spending thousands of dollars on a digital picture of a cat or a pixelated punk? Sounds crazy, right? Welcome to the fascinating world of NFTs! If you’ve been curious but don’t know where to start, this guide will walk you through everything you need to understand about NFT marketplaces. What Are NFTs, Anyway? Before we explore marketplaces, let’s get the basics down. NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token . That’s a fancy way of saying it’s a unique digital item that can’t be replaced with something else. You can think of it like a one-of-a-kind baseball card or a rare piece of art. Unlike your regular dollars or Bitcoins (which are fungible and interchangeable), NFTs are special. Each one has its own value and identity. NFTs can represent anything digital—art, music, videos, tweets, virtual real estate, and even in-game items. They’re powered by blockchain technology , which is like a public ledger ensuring everyone knows who owns what. Why Are NFTs So Popular? Okay, imagine owning a piece of art from a famous artist but in digital form. It’s yours. You can show it off, sell it, or trade it. That’s what makes NFTs exciting. Plus, the scarcity factor—there’s only one or a limited number of each NFT. It’s like finding a golden ticket in a chocolate bar. Another reason NFTs are booming? They give creators more control. Artists can earn royalties every time their NFT is sold. So, instead of being at the mercy of galleries or record labels, creators get direct access to their audience. What Is an NFT Marketplace? Now that you know about NFTs, let’s talk about where the magic happens: NFT marketplaces . Think of these platforms as digital art galleries or auction houses where you can buy, sell, or even create your own NFTs. Each marketplace has its vibe, features, and focus. Some cater to high-end digital art, while others are playgrounds for gaming enthusiasts or music lovers. If you’ve ever used eBay or Amazon, the concept isn’t too different. The key difference? Instead of physical goods, you’re dealing with digital assets. How Does It Work? Let’s break it down into simple steps: Create an Account : First, you’ll need to sign up on a marketplace. Connect a Wallet : To buy or sell NFTs, you’ll need a crypto wallet (more on that later). Think of it as your digital purse. Browse the Listings : Scroll through collections, discover trending pieces, and pick your favorites. Buy, Bid, or Mint : Depending on the platform, you can purchase NFTs instantly, place a bid, or create your own NFT (called minting). Own It : Once the transaction is complete, the NFT is all yours. It’ll sit safely in your wallet. There’s more to consider. Popular NFT Marketplaces Here are some of the top NFT marketplaces you’ll want to know about: 1.

To interact with NFT marketplaces, you’ll need a crypto wallet . This is where you store your cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum ) and NFTs. Popular wallets include: MetaMask : A browser extension wallet. Simple and widely used. Trust Wallet : Great for mobile users. Coinbase Wallet : User-friendly, especially if you’re already using Coinbase. Connecting your wallet to a marketplace is straightforward. Just follow the on-screen prompts, and you’re good to go. How Do You Buy an NFT? Alright, so you’ve found an NFT you love. Now what? Here’s the process: Check the Price : Some NFTs have a fixed price, while others are auctioned. Auctions mean you place a bid and hope it’s the highest. Pay with Crypto : Most marketplaces operate on Ethereum, so you’ll need ETH. Some also accept other cryptocurrencies. Confirm the Purchase : Once you pay, the NFT is transferred to your wallet. You’ll also pay a small transaction fee (called a gas fee). Show It Off : Your NFT is now yours. Display it in a virtual gallery or keep it as a valuable collectible. Can You Sell Your NFTs? Absolutely! Selling NFTs is just as easy as buying them. Upload your digital item, set a price, and list it on the marketplace. When someone buys it, the proceeds (minus marketplace fees) go directly to your wallet. Remember, you can also earn royalties if you’re the original creator. This means you’ll get a percentage of every future sale of that NFT. It’s a great way to keep earning long-term. Risks and Challenges It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, though. Here are some things to watch out for: High Gas Fees : Ethereum transactions can be expensive during peak times. Imagine paying $50 just to buy a $20 NFT. Frustrating, isn’t it? Scams and Fakes : Not all marketplaces are trustworthy. Stick to reputable platforms and double-check the authenticity of NFTs. Volatility : Crypto prices and NFT values can swing wildly. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Environmental Impact : Some blockchains consume a lot of energy. Fortunately, newer platforms are finding eco-friendly solutions. Real-Life Example: Beeple’s $69 Million Sale Let’s talk about the NFT that took the world by storm. In 2021, a digital artist named Beeple sold an NFT titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” for a whopping $69 million at a Christie’s auction. It’s essentially a collage of 5,000 digital images he created over 13 years. This sale put NFTs on the map. It showed the world that digital art can be just as valuable as physical masterpieces. Mind-blowing, right? The Future of NFT Marketplaces NFTs are still in their early days. But the potential is enormous. Imagine: Virtual Real Estate : People already buy and sell land in virtual worlds like Decentraland. Music Rights : Artists can sell songs directly to fans without middlemen.

Whether you’re an artist, collector, gamer, or just curious, there’s something for everyone. Start small. Explore a marketplace like OpenSea or Rarible. Browse, learn, and maybe even buy your first NFT. Who knows? You might discover a hidden gem or create something that takes the world by storm. FAQs What is an NFT marketplace and how does it work?

The Ultimate Guide for Beginners,https://coinpedia.org/beginners-guide/how-to-buy-and-sell-nfts/,"The post How to Buy or Sell NFT? The Ultimate Guide for Beginners appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Have you ever heard someone say, “ I just bought this NFT for $5,000 ,” and thought to yourself, “What on earth is an NFT?” Or maybe you’ve wondered if it’s too late to jump on the bandwagon? Don’t worry; you’re not alone. NFTs are the hot topic everyone’s buzzing about, but they can seem confusing at first. Let’s break it all down step by step. By the end of this, you’ll not only understand what NFTs are but also feel confident enough to buy or sell one yourself. What Exactly Is an NFT? First things first, NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token . Sounds fancy, right? Let me simplify it for you. Think of an NFT as a digital certificate of ownership. This certificate is stored on a blockchain (a secure digital ledger) and proves you own something unique. It could be a piece of digital art, music, a video, or even a virtual plot of land in the metaverse. Now, “non-fungible” means it’s one-of-a-kind. For example, a $10 bill is fungible. If I give you $10, you can give me another $10, and we’re even. But if I give you a rare collectible trading card, you can’t just give me any random card in return—it’s unique. That’s what makes NFTs special. Why Are People Buying NFTs? You might wonder, why would anyone pay thousands (or millions) of dollars for something digital? Great question. Ownership : Owning an NFT gives you bragging rights. It’s like saying, “I own this original Picasso.” Except it’s digital. Support Creators : Many people buy NFTs to support artists or creators they admire. Investment : Some see NFTs as an opportunity to make money. Buy low, sell high—you get the idea. Access : Certain NFTs give you perks, like VIP access to events or exclusive online communities. Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s get into the nitty-gritty: how to buy and sell NFTs. Step 1: Getting Started – Setting Up Your Digital Wallet Before you can buy or sell an NFT, you’ll need a digital wallet. This wallet holds the cryptocurrency you’ll use to make transactions. Think of it like a PayPal account, but for crypto. Choose a Wallet : Popular options include MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. MetaMask is a great choice for beginners. Download and Install : Go to the official website of the wallet you’ve chosen. Install it as a browser extension or a mobile app. MetaMask, for example, integrates smoothly with Chrome. Create Your Wallet : Follow the prompts to create a wallet. You’ll be given a “seed phrase” (a series of random words). Write this down and keep it safe. It’s like the master key to your wallet. Add Funds : To buy NFTs, you’ll need cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) is the most commonly used, but some platforms accept others. Buy ETH on exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, then transfer it to your wallet. Example : Let’s say you want to buy an NFT listed at 0.05 ETH. You’ll need to make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet, plus a little extra for transaction fees (called “gas fees”). Step 2: Picking an NFT Marketplace Now that your wallet is ready, it’s time to choose where to shop. Think of this step as deciding whether to buy clothes from Amazon, eBay, or a boutique store. Each NFT marketplace has its vibe. OpenSea : The largest and most beginner-friendly NFT marketplace. Rarible : Great for customizable NFTs. Foundation : Focuses on high-quality, curated art. NBA Top Shot : Perfect if you’re into sports collectibles. Tip : Stick to popular, reputable platforms to avoid scams. Step 3: Buying Your First NFT Here comes the fun part: buying an NFT. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet : Once you’re on the marketplace, click “Connect Wallet.” This links your digital wallet to the platform. Browse NFTs : Scroll through categories or use the search bar to find something you like. Pay attention to the price, description, and the creator’s reputation. Place a Bid or Buy Now : Some NFTs are sold at a fixed price (“Buy Now”), while others are auctioned. If it’s an auction, you’ll need to place a bid and wait to see if you win. Pay the Gas Fee : This is a transaction fee for using the blockchain. It fluctuates based on demand, so check the fee before completing your purchase. Confirm the Purchase : Once you pay, the NFT will be transferred to your wallet. You’re now the proud owner of a digital collectible! Example : Imagine you find a digital art piece priced at 0.1 ETH. You click “Buy Now,” pay the gas fee, and… congratulations, it’s yours! The NFT will show up in your wallet and your profile on the marketplace. Step 4: Selling an NFT So, you’ve bought an NFT and now want to sell it. Maybe the value has gone up, or you simply changed your mind. Here’s what you need to do: Go to Your Profile : On the marketplace, navigate to the NFT you own. List for Sale : Click “Sell” and set the price. You can choose between a fixed price or an auction format. Set Your Terms : Decide how long the sale will last and whether you want to include royalties. (Royalties give you a percentage of future sales.) Pay the Listing Fee : Some marketplaces charge a small fee to list an NFT. Wait for a Buyer : Once listed, potential buyers can view and purchase your NFT. When someone buys it, the cryptocurrency is transferred to your wallet. Example : Suppose you bought an NFT for 0.05 ETH and now want to sell it for 0.1 ETH. After listing it, a buyer snaps it up at your asking price. You’ve made a profit! Tips for Success Do Your Research : Not all NFTs are valuable. Check the creator’s history, the NFT’s rarity, and its demand. Watch Out for Scams : Only buy from verified creators or collections. Be cautious if a deal seems too good to be true. Start Small : If you’re new to NFTs, don’t spend a fortune right away. Experiment with low-cost items to understand the process. Stay Updated : The NFT world moves fast. Follow creators, join Discord communities, and keep an eye on trends. What next? Buying and selling NFTs might seem overwhelming at first, but it’s really just about taking it one step at a time. Set up your wallet, explore marketplaces, and start small. The more you engage, the more confident you’ll feel. Who knows? Your first NFT purchase might be the start of an exciting new hobby or even a profitable investment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : How to Create and Mint Your First NFT: A Simple Learning Guide , FAQs How do I buy an NFT for the first time?

NFTs can be profitable but are risky. Research creators, rarity, and market demand before investing. Start small and monitor trends closely. What are gas fees in NFT transactions?

Ripple attributed XRP’s resurgence to President Donald Trump’s executive order calling for regulatory clarity, fair banking access, and comprehensive legislation for crypto businesses in the U.S. This shift in policy has fueled optimism in the broader cryptocurrency market, contributing to strong institutional and retail demand for XRP. The report notes that prior to the SEC’s regulatory actions, XRP was the second most valuable cryptocurrency. However, Ripple claims that market manipulation by the SEC has hindered XRP’s growth and reduced trader confidence. With the easing of regulations, XRP has regained momentum, increasing investor interest. Related News: Controversial Founder Zhu Su Shares Price Prediction for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in 2025 XRP’s rally was accompanied by record-breaking trading volumes across major exchanges. Binance led the way with 36% of XRP’s spot trading volume, followed by Upbit Korea (20%) and Coinbase (9%). Following Trump’s election victory, XRP’s daily spot trading volume rose from $500 million at the beginning of Q4 to an average of $5 billion from mid-November to December. On December 2, CCData’s Top Tier exchanges traded nearly $25 billion in XRP spot volume, reaching an all-time high. Coinbase, in particular, doubled its share of total XRP trading volume, indicating growing confidence in the asset from U.S. investors. The report also points to long-term investor interest, emphasizing that most of XRP’s trading activity is driven by spot trading rather than short-term speculative bets. Institutional interest in XRP investment products continues to grow. WisdomTree and CoinShares have filed an S-1 for a spot XRP ETF, joining other ETF issuers such as Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares. Ripple’s report describes Q4 2024 as a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. With the Trump administration prioritizing innovation-friendly regulations and increasing institutional adoption, Ripple sees unprecedented growth potential in the crypto industry. “As regulatory clarity emerges and institutional demand strengthens, XRP is well positioned to capitalize on this new era of digital asset expansion,” the report concludes. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, top experts have set the short-term target for the crypto to $4, spotlighting a crucial support that the crypto must hold. In addition, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighting a flurry of positive developments has further fueled the market sentiments. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Highlights Key Developments Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has shared a slew of positive developments for the blockchain firm, sparking optimism for a potential XRP price rally ahead. According to Ripple’s Q4 Markets Report , XRP price surged 280% in Q4, driven by strong demand on major exchanges. Besides, the report also highlights significant institutional interest, with WisdomTree and Coinshares filing for a spot XRP ETF. Simultaneously, Canadian asset manager Purpose Investments has recently proposed to launch the first XRP ETF in the world. Regulatory Shift Can Further Push XRP Price Meanwhile, Garlinghouse noted that the new US administration’s pro-crypto stance has paved the way for innovation and growth. The CEO also emphasized the XRP Ledger’s growing adoption, with notable partnerships and tokenization initiatives. Recently, former Ripple alumni Sean McBride also highlighted Ripple’s strategy to boost XRPL revenue. Additionally, he also highlighted Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD launch and its market cap hitting $100 million in a month. With the US SEC’s regulatory overhang easing, XRP price is poised for a potential rally. Experts predict a continued surge in XRP’s value, driven by increasing institutional demand and favorable market conditions. As the crypto market enters a new era of growth, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on the trend. Notably, the report also showed that Ripple’s XRP holdings surged from 4.43 billion on September 30, 2024, to 4.48 billion on December 31, 2024. What’s Next For XRP Price? XRP price was down 1.3% and exchanged hands at $3.04, while its one-day trading volume fell 13% to $4 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $3.11 and $3.01, respectively.

The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, announced on January 31 , will provide a regulated avenue for investors to gain access to DOGE, the leading memecoin by market capitalization. The asset manager described Dogecoin as “an open-source, peer-to-peer digital currency derived from Litecoin, which itself originated from Bitcoin.” Dogecoin Fund is Limited to Institutional Investors The trust is limited to institutional investors, offering them exposure to DOGE without the need to hold the asset directly. Dogecoin operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, similar to Bitcoin, but with less computational demand for transaction verifications and no upper limit on supply. This makes DOGE unique compared to many other digital assets. Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s head of product and research, emphasized Dogecoin’s growth, stating that it has evolved into a “potentially powerful tool for promoting financial accessibility.” Grayscale’s move comes amid growing institutional interest in memecoins, a sector that has historically been dominated by retail traders. The launch of the Trump (TRUMP) memecoin on January 18, ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, fueled a wave of speculation. The meme coin gained massive traction on the Solana network, generating so much activity that it caused network congestion for days. Following this surge, asset managers Osprey Funds and REX Shares filed to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for DOGE, TRUMP, and Bonk (BONK) on January 21, signaling that meme coins are becoming an increasingly serious asset class. With the Dogecoin Trust, Grayscale continues to expand its suite of single-asset crypto investment products.

Read the press release: https://t.co/tV5TC8uoHV pic.twitter.com/cqqJxVRkIC — Grayscale (@Grayscale) January 31, 2025 In recent months, the firm has introduced funds for Lido (LDO), Optimism (OP), and Aave (AAVE). Additionally, it has placed over 35 altcoins, including Worldcoin (WLD), Pyth (PYTH), and Rune (RUNE), on its watchlist for potential future investment products. As the world’s largest crypto fund manager, Grayscale oversees nearly $35 billion in assets as of December 2023. It is best known for its flagship Bitcoin and Ethereum investment trusts (GBTC and ETHE), which have played a major role in institutional crypto adoption. Gensler’s Departure Sparks Rise in Crypto ETF Filings Grayscale’s latest filing comes at a pivotal time for the SEC and cryptocurrency ETFs, following the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Jan. 20. Gensler, known for his cautious stance on crypto regulations, stepped down amid increasing pressure for greater regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. Just recently, Tuttle Capital Management filed applications for ten cryptocurrency-based leveraged ETFs, including funds tied to popular meme coins. Analysts suggest the filings are part of a broader strategy to test the boundaries of an SEC under Trump-era crypto-friendly regulators. The proposed ETFs include leveraged funds that aim to deliver twice the returns of their underlying assets, such as the meme coins Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania Meme (MELANIA). Furthermore, Osprey Funds and REX Shares have filed for meme coin ETFs covering Dogecoin (DOGE) , Official Trump (TRUMP), and Bonk (BONK) on Jan. 21. Meanwhile, the SEC has also granted initial approval for Bitwise Asset Management’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, which would track both BTC and ETH in a single fund.

Shibarium Layer-2 burned over 55 billion SHIB, but more adoption is needed. SHIB’s key resistance at $0.000020 could trigger a rally if broken. Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a sharp increase in its burn rate, fueling discussions about its price outlook. A 7,240% surge in token burns removed over 1 billion SHIB from circulation in a single day. Despite this, analysts question whether token burns alone can push SHIB to $0.01. SHIB Burn Rate Surges—What It Means for Prices SHIB’s burn mechanism reduces circulating supply, theoretically increasing scarcity and potentially boosting prices. In the past 24 hours, over 4 million tokens were burned, reflecting a 6,233% increase. The Shiba Inu community continues to push for value appreciation through these burns. However, reaching $0.01 remains a challenge. SHIB’s current supply sits at 589 trillion tokens.

A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor.

Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token.

Source: US SEC. 21Shares is trying to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world by offering an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This will make DOT a more attractive choice for investors who like controlled investments instead of owning cryptocurrencies directly. This follows rising demand for diversified crypto-based ETFs. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have garnered attention, Polkadot’s participation shows popular interest in alternative currencies. However, the success of this filing depends on how the SEC views Polkadot’s regulatory standing, a factor that could impact the outcome of the approval process. Market Performance Presents Obstacles Polkadot has encountered market obstacles, despite the enthusiasm that fueled the filing. The price of DOT has decreased by approximately 5% in the past year, and it has declined by more than 10% in the past month alone. DOT is currently trading at approximately $6.42, a significant decline from its previous all-time highs. The ETF filing acknowledges that the asset can be unstable and warns buyers about possible risks. Polkadot’s value could still be uncertain, even with an ETF setup, and there’s no guarantee that the token will rise or bounce back soon. Related Reading: XRP $10 Price Tag Hinges On SEC Lawsuit Conclusion, Analyst Says Regulatory Risks Might Affect The Chances Of Approval Regarding the security status of this ETF, there are significant concerns about Polkadot’s potential legal standing in the US. Polkadot’s backer, the Web3 Foundation, has attempted to portray DOT as a digital asset rather than a security concern. The SEC’s stance on digital assets is evolving, thus Polkadot’s security status may make it challenging for 21Shares to develop an ETF.

In a new video, Cowen tells his 863,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is approaching a “decision time” as traders and investors await the non-farm payrolls (NFP) report scheduled for release on February 7th. The NFP report discloses the number of jobs added or lost in the US, excluding those in the agricultural sector. Market participants use the data to gauge the health of the country’s economy. According to Cowen, Bitcoin could turn bullish if the unemployment rate stays at more or less the same level as last month’s reading of 4.1%. “If the unemployment rate comes in fine… 4.1%, 4.2% then my guess is that it’s more likely than not that Bitcoin would make another move up.” On the likely price targets for Bitcoin, the widely followed analyst says, “The labor market data comes in next week. It seems like Bitcoin’s done the same exact thing it did last year. The question is, can it just simply follow through and get that next leg higher? I would probably say somewhere between $120,000 to $140,000, $150,000. Somewhere kind of in that zone if it’s just simply going to repeat last year.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Cowen also says there’s a possibility of Bitcoin reaching a cycle top in a couple of months based on historical data. “So there’s always a chance that if you do get another rally in say February or March, that it could lead into a major market cycle top depending on how aggressive it is. Remember [during the] last cycle, the top was basically in April [of 2021].” Bitcoin is trading at $102,491 at time of writing.

Notably, the rally was recorded following a massive surge in the Quantum computing stocks yesterday. Considering the present market sentiments, investors are curious with questions like “How high will QTUM go?” and “Top reasons why QTUM altcoin is rising?” In this article, we have covered the market sentiments and possible short-term QTUM price analysis just for you! Qtum (QTUM) The QTUM price jumped 46.15% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $1.037 billion, a change of 2,507.87. Moreover, it has added ~43% to its valuation in seven days and has a YTD return of +37.54%. Moreover, with a market cap of $436.1 million, it has secured the 148th position. TradingView: QTUM/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) records a strong bullish curve in the daily time frame. Moreover, it constantly acts as a support to the price chart. This suggests an increase in the buying-over-selling pressure for the altcoin in the crypto market. On the other hand, the MACD indicator displays a rising green histogram with its averages witnessing a bullish convergence in the QTUM price chart. This highlights a positive outlook for the 149th largest crypto token during the upcoming week. How High Will Qtum Price Go? If the bulls outrun the bears, the QTUM price could retest its resistance level of $4.450. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for this altcoin to head toward its upper resistance level of $5 in the upcoming time. However, if a bearish reversal occurs, this could pull the price toward its support level of $3.750. Furthermore, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, the QTUM crypto may plunge toward its important support trendline of $3.085 this month.

In a recent X post, Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has shared that the Fed is legally limited about what it can actually put on its balance sheet. GOOLSBEE: ASKED ABOUT #BITCOIN RESERVE, SAYS FED IS LEGALLY LIMITED ABOUT WHAT IT CAN PUT ON ITS BALANCE SHEET — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 31, 2025 Notably, Chair Jerome Powell previously mentioned that the Federal Reserve is legally barred from holding Bitcoin under the Federal Reserve Act and that the institution has no interest in changing the law. In 2021, he also stated that Bitcoin isn’t a reliable store of value because of its high volatility. In a recent press conference, Powell said that banks could offer cryptocurrency custody services now that the SEC dropped the controversial SAB-121 guidance. The crypto community reacted positively to the statement, causing Bitcoin to rise. Several States Working Towards BTC Reserve Last month, Powell described Bitcoin as a digital version of gold, aligning with views from its strong supporters. As for a Bitcoin reserve, that idea now seems less likely, with the chances of it happening by the end of April dropping to just 16%. However, most expect the reserve to be established sometime later this year. Besides, several states like Texas, Florida, and Ohio are working on creating local Bitcoin reserves, although it’s unclear about how many will succeed. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, who proposed last year that the U.S. Treasury buy Bitcoin, recently said that establishing the reserve will be her top priority as the head of a new Senate subcommittee on digital assets. Concerns Over Bitcoin’s Security, Liquidity There are critics as well to the idea as recently, ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that she is confident Bitcoin will not be included in the European Union’s reserves. She emphasized that central bank reserves must be secure, liquid, and free from suspicion of criminal activities like money laundering. Her rejection of the idea came after the head of the Czech National Bank proposed investing up to 5% of its reserves in Bitcoin, sparking new debates about Bitcoin’s place in national reserves. Time To Act Fast: Senator Lummis In response to recent events, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a supporter of a national Bitcoin reserve, emphasized the need for quick action to gain a competitive edge. “If you’re not first, you’re last,” Lummis said, urging the U.S. to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and secure its future. The Trump administration is exploring the benefits of such a reserve but has not yet made any official announcements.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 08:06:47

Technical and on-chain analysis suggests the two altcoins are poised for further gains next week. Bitcoin’s flash crash under $100,000 and its return above $104,000 have fuelled optimism among crypto traders. U.S. macroeconomic data releases, performance of tech stocks and equities, and developments in artificial intelligence are the key market movers for Bitcoin. Altcoins like LTC and OM follow Bitcoin closely as the correlation remains high. Table of Contents Litecoin and Mantra could extend gains, technical analysis shows On-chain analysis supports bullish thesis Market movers push Litecoin and Mantra higher Bitcoin catalyzes rally in Litecoin and Mantra Strategic considerations Litecoin and Mantra could extend gains, technical analysis shows Technical analysis supports gains in LTC and OM, on the daily timeframe. Mantra (OM) consolidated in a range-bound manner for several weeks between mid-December and January. OM broke out of the range between $4.5352 and $3.1730. At the time of writing, on Friday, OM trades at $5.6263, close to its all-time high of $5.9500 as observed in the TradingView chart below. On the daily timeframe, OM formed a support zone between $4.443 and $4.069. This is a key imbalance zone and a correction could see MANTRA bouncing off this range. Two key technical indicators, the Relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator support a bullish thesis for OM . RSI reads 76 and is sloping upward. While this typically generates a sell signal, when combined with MACD’s green histogram bars above the neutral line, it highlights underlying positive momentum in OM price trend. A retest of OM’s all-time high is likely next week if the token sustains its upward momentum. OM/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Litecoin was consolidating within the upper and lower boundaries of the range at $129.11 and $92.57. LTC ended its consolidation and broke out of the support zone, less than 8% under its 2025 peak of $141.22. Litecoin trades at $131.64 at the time of writing, early on Friday. The LTC/USDT daily price chart shows an imbalance zone between $102.57 and $114.04, two key levels for Litecoin in the event of a correction in the altcoin. RSI and MACD show underlying positive momentum in Litecoin’s price trend. RSI reads 61 and is sloping upwards and MACD shows green histogram bars above the neutral line. Traders need to watch for a re-test of the 2025 peak and an attempt to rally towards 2024 high of $147.06.

On-chain analysis supports bullish thesis Santiment metrics highlight the rising relevance and demand for Litecoin among traders this week. The total open interest across derivatives exchanges in LTC climbed to nearly $420 million on January 30, marking a spike in the chart below. The total number of LTC holders has climbed steadily between December 2 and January 31, according to Santiment data. On Friday, the metric climbed to 8.13 million. The number of active addresses remains above the 2024 average, and total funding rates aggregated by LTC read positive, meaning derivatives traders maintain a bullish bias on Litecoin. Litecoin on-chain analysis | Source: Santiment In the case of Mantra (OM), the total amount of holders is climbing slowly, reached nearly 44,000 on Friday. Key metrics like funding rate show a bullish bias and a positive value for nearly two weeks, confirming the token’s relevance and demand in the derivatives market. The Network realized profit/loss metric used to track the net profit/loss of all tokens moved on the chain on a given day shows several positive spikes in January, signaling profit-taking. Traders need to watch for large positive spikes as that would imply large volume sell-off by traders de-risking their portfolio, and this could result in a correction in OM price. The total open interest in OM hit its highest level on January 30 above $348 million.

As the SEC officially acknowledges the 19b-4 filing from Canary Capital for a spot Litecoin ETF, traders are hopeful of an approval. Typically a spot ETF approval generates demand and interest among institutional investors and large wallet traders. The developments in the ETF could fuel further gains in Litecoin next week. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst commented on the development in a tweet on X: News but expected. Even Gensler’s SEC would approve these. That said, they approved in 45 days vs waiting 240 days. I really want to interpret this as a sign the new SEC will be faster but no way to know really. Litecoin on deck, know more soon https://t.co/xqlXusHuyN — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 31, 2025 Mantra’s recent announcement about a partnership with the DAMAC Group, a real-estate giant, for tokenizing assets on their chain is a key market mover for OM token this week. JP Mullin, co-founder and CEO of Mantra said, “This partnership with DAMAC Group is an endorsement for the RWA industry. We’re thrilled to partner with such a prestigious group of leaders that share our ambitions and see the incredible opportunities of bringing traditional financing opportunities on chain.” The other key market mover is Bitcoin’s recovery from the flash crash under $100,000 on Monday. The correlation between the tokens and Bitcoin remains relatively high, supporting their gains. Bitcoin catalyzes rally in Litecoin and Mantra The three-month correlation between Bitcoin and Litecoin is 0.84, and between Bitcoin and Mantra is 0.87. The relatively high correlation suggests that Bitcoin’s price trend influences the prices of LTC and OM, therefore further gains in BTC could push the assets higher. A flash crash in Bitcoin could push traders on edge as BTC could drag out assets correlated with it, wiping out millions of dollars in market capitalization. U.S. macroeconomic releases, the movement of U.S. based tech stocks and equities and institutional investor activity typically influenced Bitcoin price. LTC and OM holders need to watch Bitcoin’s daily price trend to predict sudden movements in the two altcoins. Strategic considerations Traders who accumulated LTC under the $100 level could consider taking profits on a percentage of their holdings, at least 30% before a correction in Litecoin. Staggered profit-taking is recommended while Litecoin holds steady above the range-bound consolidation zone. Traders holding OM acquired under $3.87 should ideally consider staggered profit-taking while the altcoin trades above $5. Sidelined buyers can enter when OM is closer to $4 and wait for a re-test of the all-time high at $5.95 before taking profits. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

This prediction, shared by market analyst Amonyx (@amonbuy) on X, has sparked discussions among cryptocurrency investors and analysts. The increase in probability comes when institutional interest in XRP ETFs appears to be growing, with major financial firms exploring regulatory pathways for such investment products. JUST IN: Poly Market Data predicted 83% $XRP ETFs will be approved soon. Are U bullish or no? pic.twitter.com/gy7jLW2OOK — Amonyx (@amonbuy) January 31, 2025 Institutional Interest in XRP ETFs Grows The rise in confidence regarding an XRP ETF approval follows Grayscale Investments’ recent filing with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to launch an XRP-based ETF. This development marks a significant step in the mainstream adoption of XRP-based financial products. Grayscale, known for its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, is now seeking regulatory approval to expand its offerings to include XRP. In addition to Grayscale, other investment firms such as Bitwise and Canary have also pursued standalone XRP ETFs . These applications reflect a growing demand for diversified crypto investment products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. As institutional demand for XRP exposure increases, the probability of regulatory approval for an ETF linked to the asset has gained traction. Market Reaction and Sentiment The data from Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, shows that confidence in an XRP ETF approval has risen by 13%, reaching 83%. This suggests that market participants are increasingly optimistic about the likelihood of approval by regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor sentiment around XRP is being influenced by recent developments in the cryptocurrency market. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 set a precedent for further crypto-based financial products, with Ethereum ETFs also gaining attention. If XRP follows a similar path, it could provide investors with a regulated and more accessible way to gain exposure to the asset. Regulatory Considerations Despite the optimism, the approval of an XRP ETF will depend on regulatory decisions. The SEC has been scrutinizing cryptocurrency-related financial products. Its stance on XRP has been debated since its lawsuit against Ripple Labs. Although Ripple secured a partial victory in 2023 , with a U.S. judge ruling that XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets, regulatory uncertainty remains. However, the SEC’s willingness to approve Bitcoin ETFs suggests a shifting regulatory landscape that could favor additional crypto ETFs, including XRP. Market stability, investor protection, and institutional demand would influence the final decision. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Nevertheless, in spite of this temporary rebound, PEPE has faced challenges in the last month, dropping by 31.14%. As the value of PEPE demonstrates signs of bouncing back, three other digital currencies— Neo (NEO), Minotaurus (MTAUR), and Lido DAO (LDO)—are surpassing it in both momentum and potential for growth. PEPE Price Performance In the last 24 hours, PEPE’s price has soared by 7.10%, raising its market cap to $5.82 billion, while trading volume reached $1.42 billion. Although this recent increase has occurred, the coin’s performance in the past week and month has been more negative, reflecting decreases of 7.93% and 31.14% respectively. This implies that although there has been a short-term increase in its value, PEPE finds it difficult to maintain a steady upward trajectory over extended durations. 3 Coins Are Outshining It as February Kicks Off NEO, LDO and MTAUR are outperforming PEPE as February jets in. 1. Neo (NEO): A Surge in Trading Volume Neo (NEO) has outshined PEPE price with an 11.79% increase in the past 24 hours, bringing its market cap to $1.07 billion. Over the past week, NEO has risen by 10.09%, with a 4.95% gain in the last month, demonstrating steady momentum. Neo (NEO) price chart A significant factor contributing to NEO’s recent rally is the sharp increase in trading volume. Reports indicate a 463.75% surge in trading activity across major exchanges like Bitget, Upbit, OKX, Bithumb, Kucoin, and Binance. Such volume spikes typically signal heightened investor interest and bullish sentiment. Moreover, the integration of Neo X with Ledger support has further strengthened the ecosystem. Neo has also partnered with SUPRA Labs , integrating powerful oracle and randomness services that enhance the blockchain’s infrastructure for developers building decentralized applications (dApps). These developments have positioned NEO as a strong contender in the evolving blockchain space. 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR): A Gaming Revolution The Minotaurus (MTAUR) presale has drawn the interest of gamers and crypto fans, raising over 1,400,000 USDT to date. With a presale price of 0.00006001 USDT, MTAUR presents an attractive opportunity relative to its anticipated listing price of 0.00020 USDT. Those with a preference for early-stage cryptocurrencies who entered at 0.000040 USDT have already seen their deposits double, showcasing the token’s significant potential. As one of the new cryptocurrencies to buy, Minotaurus is distinguished by its focus on gaming as a priority. The ecosystem enables players to have personalized avatars, game enhancements, and unique entry to premium content. As the casual gaming industry keeps growing, Minotaurus is ideally situated to take advantage of this development. The project is fundamentally based on security and community confidence. Thorough audits conducted by SolidProof and Coinsult confirm the platform’s reliability, and a 100,000 USDT giveaway, referral initiatives, and vesting arrangements promote involvement and enhance its expanding community. These efforts demonstrate the team’s dedication to providing value to its supporters. The presale procedure is straightforward and reachable through the official Minotaurus site. Regardless of whether you’re a newcomer to crypto or an experienced enthusiast, obtaining MTAUR tokens is easy. With the cost poised to increase shortly, this is an excellent opportunity to get involved and solidify your position in the Minotaurus ecosystem. 3. Lido DAO (LDO): Technical Breakout Fuels Growth Lido DAO (LDO) has demonstrated notable performance with a current price settling at $2.31. Surging by 9.13% in the past 24 hours and gaining 15.50% over the past week, LDO’s one-month performance stands at a solid 25.78% increase, significantly outperforming PEPE price. Lido (DAO) price chart LDO’s recent breakout from a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart is a key bullish indicator. Technical analysts suggest that this could push LDO toward price targets of $3.00 to $3.60 in the coming days. Furthermore, Lido Finance has made a strategic move by making its Community Staking Module (CSM) permissionless . This allows anyone to become a validator with reduced bond requirements, making Ethereum staking more accessible. With the total value locked (TVL) on Lido increasing, the token’s utility and demand are also rising. Final Thoughts: PEPE Price Struggles as These 3 Cryptos Surge Ahead While PEPE price has managed a short-term recovery with a 7.10% daily gain, it remains in a downward trend over the past month. In contrast, Minotaurus (MTAUR) is gaining traction through its gaming ecosystem, Neo (NEO) is benefiting from increased trading activity and ecosystem growth, and Lido DAO (LDO) is experiencing a technical breakout alongside major staking upgrades. As February unfolds, these three cryptos are proving to be stronger contenders compared to PEPE price, offering better potential for long-term gains.

Being built on the Base chain, it has been offering crypto, NFTs, and DeFi tools, where investors fueled its demand based on its utility. However, the question remains the same: will the TOSHI price hit $1 in 2025? Let’s discuss. Toshi Meme Coin Price Analysis and History The popular meme coin , TOSHI, had a rough start, as it took months to gain bullish momentum in 2023. At that time, the price hovered around $0.00003 before gaining any upward momentum in December, followed by a significant surge in January 2024. March 2024’s bullish market hit this cat-themed meme coin for good, reaching its first major peak of $0.0006. Interestingly, this is nothing compared to its recent peak, when the TOSHI surged more than 1500%, jumping from $0.0001313 to $0.002273 in just two weeks. However, it also experienced significant volatility in this journey, including its current situation. At present, TOSHI trades at $0.001014 after an 11% drop in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $414.08M. Moreover, since the ATH of $0.002273 just six days ago, the price has declined by 55% per CoinmarketCap . Interestingly, despite the drop, the trading volume was $104.45M, with a 115% surge, which could aid in its recovery. Factors Driving The TOSHI’s Market Hype During January’s TOSHI price rally, the Coinbase listing, meme currency frenzy, and institutional demand were the biggest factors. Although a controversy built around Coinbase listing, as investors questioned the exchange’s listing criteria, this buzz helped with its exponential growth. The same factors could fuel its recovery, especially amid high trading volume, which signifies high investor interest. Moreover, whale activity is also high for this cat meme coin, with one buying $3M worth of tokens. Interestingly, crypto analyst Cavell Anderson commented on this, predicting a 2- 5x rally soon, claiming that ‘smart money is still buying.’ Will Toshi Meme Coin Price Hit $1 in 2025? The TOSHI/ USDT trading pair shows that after following the peak, the value stabilized at its current level. This could result in two scenarios: a recovery or a further drop. A bullish recovery can push the token to the next resistance level at $0.00100. Once the token reaches this key resistance, it can aim toward $0.001346 and $0.002355 (the current ATH). However, in contrast, if the price failed to hold the support at $0.000990, it could follow the downtrend projection, dropping lower to $0.000490. Any further declines could result in long-term bearish sentiment. In conclusion, the most optimistic scenario for the Toshi meme coin is that its price will reach the current ATH. However, that will also depend on market sentiments and its trading volume. As a result, TOSHI’s $1 target in 2025 is less likely, but a Bitcoin bull run may change the trajectory. Investors should analyze the token periodically to understand its future price trajectories clearly. Bottom Line TOSHI’s January performance has made it one of the best-performing meme tokens. However, the $1 mark remains too big a target in the current scenarios. However, things could change with the bull run, the upcoming development of the Toshi meme coin, and its role in the DeFi space. With that, investors can watch the key support level of $0.001289, as that could be the defining zone for this cryptocurrency.

Crypto traders who just joined recently have acquired different coins in the market. According to Shiba Inu news, new crypto traders who have little knowledge about the space acquired Shiba Inu and are connecting with other veterans within the community. Although the community has been quite helpful to them, the market hasn’t been so favorable. This has caused these new investors to panic and search for other options. With the emergence of Panshibi , a newly and rapidly developing coin, it might be a chance for these new investors to restart. This meme coin offers everything an investor needs and even more. In this article, we will discuss this new meme coin. Read ahead. Crypto Traders Picks Newly Growing Coin Ahead of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has been around for a while. It has an exciting community filled with some of the best crypto enthusiasts. Its attractive community makes it easy for newbies to invest in the coin even without properly assessing it. Shiba Inu has given great returns to traders who have invested in the coin over the years. These traders have also suffered major losses. Despite how attractive Shiba Inu is, it doesn’t get close to Panshibi. From Shiba Inu news, there are a lot of exciting perks in the Panshibi community that Shiba Inu holders who have held the coin for the longest time haven’t enjoyed. According to Shiba Inu news, a lot of investors now prefer to invest in Panshibi than Shiba Inu. It is only a matter of time before Panshibi overtakes Shiba Inu in the market. Panshibi To Get Listed On Major Exchanges After Launch Panshibi is taking over the place of other coins in the market. Traders who hold other coins are getting their Panshibi tokens as they do not want to be left out. One of the best things about this coin is the kind of community they plan to build. This community will be a perfect place for new crypto investors to network with other meme enthusiasts from different parts of the world and learn more about the cryptocurrency world. There will be games for those who love to have fun and winners will be rewarded with prizes. And with his token, you can become a part of the team that gets to make important decisions that affect the community. As it stands, Panshibi is in the second stage of presale where it is worth $0.003. There are 15 stages of presale before this coin is launched. Now is the best to acquire this coin. When the coin moves through these presale stages, the value of the coin rises. All through the presale stage, the value is tipped to rise by 1200%. When it gets launched, it is expected to move upwards even more by 145,000%. Right now, there are 1.2 billion tokens available for the presale stage and this represents only 60% of the total supply of the coin. Getting this token now comes with a lot of perks. It can increase your chance of earning high APYs of up to 1200% annually. You can also get the chance to join exclusive VIP clubs like Bamboo Private VIP Members Club which other crypto traders might not gain access to. After the launching of the coin, the token ownership will be relinquished which will allow token holders to take full ownership of the coin. The coin will also be listed on major exchanges like Uniswap and multiple centralized exchanges. To be transparent, this coin has consulted the Blockchain security firm Coinsult to help them audit and verify its full smart contract. The auditing process has to be passed without any setback while the verification process confirms some essential details. This is important as it lets crypto traders fully place their trust in the coin. Conclusion A recent analysis made earlier this year says that the meme coin market accounts for 10% of the total cryptocurrency market. Experts believe that Panshibi, which is tipped to be the biggest Asia-inspired coin, will be the front-runner of the meme market and will even make the numbers even better. According to Shiba Inu news, many Shiba Inu investors are already joining the Panshibi project as they believe it will earn them more benefits.

The crypto market moves fast, and traders now shift focus to trending altcoins with stronger upside potential. FXGuys ($FXG) has emerged as a top choice, attracting those looking for gains. FXGuys has two key features that set it apart. Its Trade2Earn model rewards every trade with $FXG tokens, making activity on the platform more rewarding. It also runs a Trader Funding Program, which lets users trade with large accounts without personal risk. These unique benefits appeal to traders who want more than just speculation. Could FXGuys be the next 50x breakout? Find out here! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE PEPE’s Wild Ride: Volatility Sparks a Price Drop For One of the Top Meme Coins PEPE, one of the top meme coins, has seen a sharp drop in value. Whales have sold big chunks of their tokens. This selling pushed more PEPE coins onto exchanges, making prices drop even more. Smaller, smarter investors are also stepping away. The number of these holders dropped to 69 from 91 last year . Together, they now hold 9.5 trillion PEPE coins, much less than the 12 trillion they had before. Over the past week, the price of PEPE and other meme coins have been dropping. PEPE is trading at $0.0000123, a 23% decline from last week. Meanwhile, top experts believe that PEPE will still surge in the coming weeks due to its high volatility. PEPE also has an active community. As such, it could still rise to $0.0000195 soon. Sui’s Ecosystem Growth: A Bullish Sign for Investors? Sui’s ecosystem has seen big progress, crossing 50 million accounts . This shows more people are joining the platform. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) now stands at $1.63 billion , slightly down from $1.75 billion at the end of 2024. Even with this drop, activity in the ecosystem remains strong. However, SUI’s price movement has not been encouraging lately. The CoinMarketCap data show that SUI’s price has been dropping since last week, just like the rest of the crypto market. SUI is valued at $3.72, a 21% decline from last week. Moving forward, some experts predict a surge in SUI’s value due to the recent rise in its TVL. With this in mind, SUI could surge to $5 soon. On the other hand, Sui’s RSI suggests a downtrend. Its RSI is currently at 33 , which means the bearish trend could persist. If this happens, SUI could fall to $3.30 soon. Due to this bearish outlook, investors are looking to the $FXG token to secure over 50x gains after its presale. FXGuys Rises: Could It Surpass Trending Altcoins Like SUI and PEPE?

Experts believe $FXG could grow significantly, with potential gains turning $100 into $10,000. Traders can use the token for funding, paying subscriptions, and accessing premium tools.

XRP is a Strong Contender for Explosive Growth Over the previous week, Ripple’s XRP has exhibited good indicators of recovery, climbing from an initial price of $3.13 to a high of $3.27 before suffering a minor fall. Despite a negative breakout that temporarily pushed the price down to $2.74, the altcoin regained bullish momentum and surged back above the $3.14 mark. This fluctuation highlights XRP’s resilience and validates its spot as one of the top altcoins to watch. Notably, the recent month has been even more positive for Ripple’s XRP, with a 46% surge in its price. The community outlook remains extremely hopeful about its future. Analysts are projecting that Ripple’s XRP may shortly retest its ATH of $3.84. In fact, Ripple’s XRP remains one of the top crypto investment choices for traders and investors looking to boost their portfolios. Its recent price movement, paired with technical indicators such as the MACD and Moving Averages, is providing a buy signal , which reinforces its growth potential. Ripple’s XRP enjoys a market cap of $181 billion, making it a well-established token in the crypto market. However, $FXG presents a more attractive investment option to investors looking for a DeFi altcoin with more room for growth. SUI: One of the Top Altcoins Poised for a Strong Recovery Over the previous week, SUI has seen a decrease of more than 21%, starting trading at $4.43 before gaining momentum to $4.77 and, at some point, falling to $4.10. It then consolidated between $4.24 and $4.09 before a bearish breakout dropped the price to $3.71 . SUI’s price performance over the past month has also been quite disappointing, with a decline of over 9%. The crypto community’s sentiment towards SUI remains firmly bullish, with many investors maintaining expectations for a return. Although the altcoin is still over 30% below its ATH of $5.35, analysts are hopeful about a potential retest of this ATH later this year, making SUI one of the altcoins to keep a watch on. A technical indicator, the Simple Moving Average, is indicating buy signs , which suggests a potential recovery shortly. While SUI has had an excellent 176% gain over the past year, $FXG has exceeded that growth with an incredible 300% gain in just a few months. This rapid surge indicates $FXG’s excellent potential for short-term growth, making it a more attractive alternative for investors looking for quick returns. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Accumulate the $FXG DeFi Token Before It Soars!

SUI’s price has risen in the past 24 hours, while JUP experienced a 26% surge following a token burn and increased liquidity. Remittix is also gaining attention, having raised over $10 million during its initial coin offering (ICO), and is currently valued at $0.0521. Is an altcoin season brewing? Where Does JUP Stand Among the Top Altcoins? Jupiter (JUP) is in a key position. On shorter time frames, its price moves within a tightening range while facing strong resistance on the higher charts. This setup suggests that a big price swing could be on the horizon, depending on how the market reacts. With many investors searching for the best crypto to invest in , JUP remains a top contender. However, it faces competition from other projects that are making waves, such as Sui . The SUI price has been climbing steadily, gaining more attention in the altcoin space. Sui could outperform many rivals if the momentum continues, drawing in more traders looking for high-potential assets. SUI Price Surges as Trading Volume Hits New Highs Sui (SUI) has been showing some impressive price actions. After a strong run, the token is currently trading at $4.16, following a 5.96% decline last week. While this correction might raise some eyebrows, SUI still ranks as one of the top altcoins with high return potential. Analysts are optimistic about a reversal that could push SUI back toward $5, making the current price an attractive entry point for investors. Sui’s fundamentals remain solid, with its Layer 1 blockchain focused on scalability and developer adoption. The innovative Move programming language continues to attract new applications, making Sui one of the best crypto to invest in right now. If history repeats itself and the token follows its past recovery patterns, SUI price could see strong growth in the near future, cementing its place as a high-potential asset in 2025. As SUI continues to evolve, its unique features and growing network make it an exciting project to watch. Remittix: The Future of Fast, Secure, and Low-Cost Global Money Transfers Remittix (RTX) is changing the game in global money transfers by simplifying the process of sending FIAT currency to any bank account using crypto. With its blockchain-powered system, users can transfer money straight from their crypto wallets without dealing with traditional banks or expensive fees. Unlike most financial services, Remittix doesn’t charge FX fees, making it a much cheaper alternative to existing options. Thanks to the platform’s use of blockchain technology, every transaction is documented on an open, impenetrable ledger. The inability to change a payment once it has been documented lowers fraud and improves security for both senders and recipients. The absence of intermediaries in transactions between users also reduces the possibility of data leaks or illegal access to private financial data. Businesses can accept crypto payments while reducing chargebacks by using Remittix’s payment system and its Remittix Pay API. With rewards of up to 18% APY, the platform’s VIP program also provides investors with the opportunity to generate passive income. Remittix Presale is Taking Over the Market The success of Remittix’s presale is a clear indication of why it’s the best crypto to invest in . Over 425 million tokens have already been sold, raising more than $10 million, with tokens currently priced at $0.0521. This strong presale performance highlights the increasing confidence investors have in the project’s potential. Those who purchase tokens during the presale at $0.0498 are locking in a low price, which could see significant appreciation as the project gains momentum.

The platform emphasizes environmental stewardship, tokenized carbon credits, and crowdfunding for social impact. By tokenizing carbon credits, Bitcoin Lithium allows users to invest in a cleaner future, creating a market where businesses and individuals can offset their carbon footprint seamlessly.

From renewable energy installations to community-driven environmental campaigns, Bitcoin Lithium empowers changemakers to build a better future. Tokenomics: Built for Growth The $BTCL token is the lifeblood of the Bitcoin Lithium ecosystem. Its deflationary design ensures long-term value creation for investors. Here’s a sneak peek at the tokenomics: Total Supply : Limited to ensure scarcity and increase demand. Presale Allocation : Designed to reward early adopters with significant discounts before $BTCL hits the open market. Community-Focused Distribution : A portion of the tokens is allocated to social impact projects, aligning profit with purpose. Bitcoin Lithium’s presale strategy is poised to generate enormous interest, and analysts predict a sharp increase in value as the token gains traction post-launch. Roadmap The Bitcoin Lithium roadmap is ambitious yet achievable, designed to maximize investor returns. Key milestones include listing on major exchanges, integrating blockchain-based battery charging networks, and expanding the reach of tokenized carbon credits. With the presale starting in just 3 days, investors have a limited window to secure $BTCL at its lowest entry point. Industry analysts are buzzing with excitement, and many forecast that Bitcoin Lithium will be a game changer in the world. This potential tenfold increase in presale prices has sparked a wave of investor interest, creating FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) among savvy buyers. Why Now Is the Time to Invest The presale launch is expected to create a frenzy in the crypto community. Bitcoin Lithium’s unique position at the intersection of blockchain and sustainable energy gives it an edge over traditional cryptocurrencies. Early investors stand to gain not just from potential price surges but also from the satisfaction of contributing to a platform that prioritizes environmental impact.

The post quickly gained traction, with opinions ranging from strong bullish optimism to cautious market-based reasoning. XRP’s Recent Price Surge The attached image, a CoinMarketCap screenshot, shows XRP trading at $3.106, reflecting a long-term increase of 52,743.43%. While this surge indicates renewed investor confidence, XRP still trades below its all-time high of $3.84 from early 2018. The key question is whether XRP can surpass previous highs and enter double-digit territory. Diverging Opinions on XRP’s Future Price Some users, like ANT1, strongly believe XRP is undervalued and misunderstood. He argued that once the regulatory case is resolved, XRP will experience an explosive price surge due to the scale of money flowing through the XRP Ledger . He predicted that XRP could reach hundreds of dollars within hours once institutional adoption kicks in. This aligns with the long-held belief that XRP’s role in cross-border payments and financial infrastructure will drive growth in the future. On the other hand, CryyptoCrazyy provided a more measured perspective, stating that the market cap increase required for XRP to reach $10 isn’t realistic in 2025. He estimated that such a move would require an $18 billion surge, which he doesn’t see happening in the short term. Instead, he believes XRP is more likely to cap out at around £5–6 by the end of the year, suggesting a slower and more sustainable growth trajectory. Another user, Paul Roussel, criticized the constant speculation surrounding XRP’s price, questioning why JackTheRippler repeatedly asks the same question. He suggested that people should focus on earning and accumulating XRP to help drive adoption and price rather than engaging in endless debates. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What Could Drive XRP to $10? While opinions vary, XRP’s ability to reach $10 will depend on several key factors: Regulatory Clarity – Institutional adoption could accelerate if XRP gains full legal clarity in the U.S. and other major markets. Many believe this would remove a key barrier to price growth. Institutional Adoption – Increased use of XRP in banking and financial settlements could drive demand, pushing prices higher. Market Sentiment & Liquidity – A broader crypto bull run and increased institutional investment could provide the momentum needed for XRP to reach new highs. Utility and On-Chain Volume – Greater transaction volume on the XRP Ledger, particularly for remittances and real-world payments, would strengthen its fundamental value. JackTheRippler’s post highlights the ongoing debate within the XRP community about the token’s future price potential. While some, like ANT1, believe $10 or higher is inevitable, others, like CryyptoCrazyy, argue that market realities make such targets difficult in the short term. Ultimately, XRP’s price trajectory will be dictated by regulatory developments, adoption trends, and broader market conditions.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin price continues to struggle below $106K despite Donald Trump signing multiple executive orders, favoring the crypto market. Over the last 30 days, BTC’s price consolidated around $105K. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $102,516 Market cap $1,238,914,422,643 Trading volume $22,318,495,561 Circulating supply 19,719,062 All-time high $108,268, December 17, 2024 All-time low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $104,888 24-hour low $104,112 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 102,239 Price Prediction $ 131,678 (28.40%) Fear & Greed Index 76 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 4.06% Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $ 99,178 200-Day SMA $ 77,031 14-Day RSI 58.76 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a sharp decline toward $101,560 Resistance for BTC is at $103,017. Support for BTC/USD is at $101,259. The BTC price analysis for 1 February confirms that the BTC price faced a sharp decline toward the low of $101,560. However, buyers immediately rebounded the price above $102K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price struggles to hold above resistance Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faces intense selling pressure as it faces a strong decline toward $101,560. However, the price of BTC faced a minor buying pressure and surged above $102K toward the immediate Fib channel. The 24-hour volume has surged to $1.97 billion, raising interest in trading today. BTC is trading at $102,516, dropping by over 0.8% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades above the buying region at 52, hinting that a bullish pressure is still on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the EMA trend lines. However, bulls maintain buying confidence as the BTC price aims for an upward correction. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.47, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence. Bitcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 100,217 BUY SMA 5 $ 100,441 BUY SMA 10 $ 103,337 SELL SMA 21 $ 101,290 BUY SMA 50 $ 99,178 BUY SMA 100 $ 92,151 BUY SMA 200 $ 77,031 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 100,069 BUY EMA 5 $ 98,563 BUY EMA 10 $ 97,360 BUY EMA 21 $ 96,968 BUY EMA 50 $ 94,899 BUY EMA 100 $ 88,344 BUY EMA 200 $ 78,936 BUY What to expect from BTC price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $103,017, it will fuel a bullish rally to $106,282. BTC/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $101,259, beginning a bearish trend to $98,580. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin down today? As BTC price failed to hold the $106K region, it resulted in a wave of selling pressure. Short-term holders quickly cashed in for profits, resulting in a sharp decline toward $101K. Will BTC Price Recover? If Bitcoin rebounds above the immediate 23.6% Fib channel and holds above $103K, we might see a recovery rally in the BTC price chart. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde stated that Bitcoin will not be held in European Union bank reserves, despite some EU countries exploring it as a foreign reserve asset. Bitcoin price prediction February 2025 Though BTC price made a new ATH in January, it was a neutral month for Bitcoin as it recorded only an 11% gain, characterized by significant upswings and downswings. Will BTC price establish a new ATH in February 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $103,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $95K. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction February 2025 $95,000 $103,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $95,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $95,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval. Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to reach a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-01 08:57:10

Although several have recorded healthy gains, many others are not performing well. For instance, data from MarketWatch shows that XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has gained 49.62% year to date. Over the last three months, XRP has returned over 517% to investors. On the other hand, Sui (SUI) has only returned 0.37% this year, according to TradingView data, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) has lost nearly 11%. Fortunately, this instability in the altcoin market is unlikely to affect Pepeto (PEPETO) , a new meme coin offering the crypto market a lot more than speculation. Will Altcoins Remain in Limbo? The outlook on altcoins is mixed, with varying reviews from different quarters. Recently, popular analyst Rekt Capital noted that a new “Hype Cycle” is possible for altcoins next month because February was a good month for altcoins in both 2023 and 2024, suggesting this trend could be repeated in 2025. According to Rekt Capital, altcoins are currently at their “Lowest Hype areas” and will likely rise in the coming weeks. For another analyst, Ali Martinez, alt season is unlikely because the market is saturated. In an X post , Martinez writes that a massive supply of altcoins has significantly changed the market. He notes that there are currently more than 36.4 million altcoins, much more than the 3,000 altcoins available during the 2017-2018 alt season, and 500 altcoins in the 2013-2014 period. Another Economist Alex Krüger agrees with Martinez, stating that there are already too many tokens, with an infinite number set to join the list. According to Krüger, the oversupply is why a desire for alt season is a misplaced expectation. Whether or not altcoins eventually struggle, the new #PEPETO meme coin is charting a different course and is likely to buck the trend and soar. PEPETO Creating New Inroads in the 2025 Crypto Market While there are many promising cryptocurrencies for the year, PEPETO is the one to watch out for. The new meme coin is at the end of a successful presale phase, where it successfully raised more than $4 million. The “God of Frogs” meme coin will soon conclude the presale, after which the price will likely spike. To buy #PEPETO, anyone can visit the website and buy tokens using fiat via a card payment, or make a purchase via USDT, BNB, or Ether (ETH). Holders may then decide to stake PEPETO tokens to enjoy some of the attractive benefits of staking coins on the platform. Currently, the total amount of staked tokens has crossed $23 trillion, with stakers already enjoying a dynamic rewards rate of 355% p/a. #PEPETO has stabilized itself as a meme coin with more value than average. In addition to handsome staking rewards, holders enjoy a cross-chain bridge that allows the easy transfer of assets between multiple unrelated blockchains. Join the PEPETO family to enjoy a brand new platform that combines the excitement of a meme coin with unmatched stability and high potential for growth. About Pepeto #Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem.

The launch of Bitcoin ETFs and growing institutional adoption by pension funds and corporations signal a shift toward mainstream acceptance, driving increased capital inflows and investment opportunities. Technological advancements like the Lightning Network, expanding use cases as a payment method and potential regulatory clarity under a crypto-friendly U.S. administration could define 2025 as a transformative year for Bitcoin’s global adoption. By Christopher Gannatti, CFA Bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, has evolved dramatically since its inception in 2008-09. Created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was initially a niche experiment - 10,000 bitcoins were famously used in 2010 to purchase two pizzas. 1 This early anecdote now stands as a stark reminder of Bitcoin's extraordinary growth, which has made it a global financial phenomenon. Over the past 15 years, Bitcoin has demonstrated one of the most impressive growth trajectories in financial history, despite ongoing volatility and adoption challenges. Global Economic Uncertainty Geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and potential recessions could drive investors toward alternative assets. Historically, extensive government spending has undermined fiat currencies, as highlighted in Ray Dalio's research on financial systems over 500 years. 2 Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply position it as a compelling alternative in this context. Potential Inflation Hedge Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a potential inflation hedge. While gold has served this role for centuries due to its scarcity and historical acceptance, Bitcoin offers distinct advantages: digital divisibility, portability and resistance to physical theft. Its adoption by tech-savvy investors underscores its growing role in modern financial systems and potential portfolio diversification. However, since Bitcoin's price has experienced significant fluctuations, it may be a risky asset to rely on if seeking a more stable inflation hedge. Performance against the U.S. Dollar Despite the dollar's recent strength, Bitcoin's market growth and increasing adoption make it an asset that cannot be ignored. As a relatively uncorrelated asset, Bitcoin appeals to investors seeking diversification and resilience against systemic risks. Bitcoin-Specific Developments Increased Institutional Adoption Institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to expand, including among pension funds: State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB): Disclosed $164 million in Bitcoin exposure in early 2024. 3 State of Michigan Retirement System: Reported significant Bitcoin investments as of mid-2024. 4 These examples highlight Bitcoin's integration into diversified, long-term investment strategies. The Launch of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) The January 2024 launch of Bitcoin ETFs was a milestone for the financial markets, drawing widespread attention. ETFs provide a regulated, accessible mechanism for investors to gain Bitcoin exposure without direct ownership, legitimizing the asset and driving capital inflows. As of this writing, there were more than $100 billion in assets in these ETFs. 5 Wider Adoption as a Payment Method Bitcoin's utility as a payment method continues to grow: PayPal and Venmo Integration: 6 Enabled millions of users to buy, sell and spend Bitcoin seamlessly. Retail Adoption: 7 Companies like Overstock and Shopify now accept Bitcoin. Cross-Border Transactions: 8 The Bitcoin remittance market is also gaining traction, with transactions reaching $3.5 billion in 2022, up 50% from the previous year. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for cross-border payments, with Bitcoin offering a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional methods, saving users up to 90% in transaction fees. Technological Advancements The Lightning Network, a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, addresses scalability and transaction speed issues. Recent upgrades have enhanced reliability, platform integration and liquidity management, significantly increasing the network's capacity and usability. Regulatory Clarity The current Trump administration has pledged strong support for the cryptocurrency sector. Proposed initiatives include: Creating a National Bitcoin Reserve: Trump's administration has referenced that it aims to establish a strategic stockpile of Bitcoin to solidify U.S. dominance in the digital economy. Appointing a Crypto Czar: David Sacks, tasked with overseeing cryptocurrency regulation, is expected to implement crypto-friendly policies to encourage innovation. Ending Regulatory Crackdowns: The administration plans to ease enforcement actions by agencies like the SEC, fostering a more supportive environment for crypto businesses. These actions signal a favorable environment for Bitcoin innovation and adoption. Steps toward Establishing a National Bitcoin Reserve Establishing a National Bitcoin Reserve would require coordinated efforts and strategic planning. Below are the key steps that would likely be involved: Legislative Framework: Enactment of laws to authorize and fund the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. Defining the reserve's purpose, such as stabilizing the national economy or bolstering strategic digital asset dominance. Acquisition Strategies: Direct purchases of Bitcoin from exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) markets to avoid significant price fluctuations. Collaborating with ""crypto whales"" or large holders to facilitate transactions without disrupting market liquidity. Incentivizing domestic Bitcoin miners to sell directly to the government. Infrastructure Development: Establishing secure, government-managed cold storage facilities for safeguarding private keys and digital wallets. Investing in cybersecurity measures to protect the reserve from potential breaches or theft. International Coordination: Engaging with global allies to share insights and best practices for national Bitcoin reserves. Ensuring compliance with international financial regulations to maintain global trust and transparency. Market Impact Mitigation: Implementing strategies to minimize the reserve's impact on Bitcoin's market volatility, such as dollar-cost averaging over time. Transparent communication with the public to prevent speculative bubbles or panic. Public and Stakeholder Engagement: Educating the public on the benefits and risks of holding Bitcoin in a national reserve. Working with financial institutions, miners and exchanges to align national interests with private-sector innovation. The establishment of a National Bitcoin Reserve would not only enhance the U.S.'s position in the digital economy but also set a precedent for how nations can integrate decentralized assets into their fiscal strategies. Notably, countries such as El Salvador have already made strides in this area. El Salvador, for instance, declared Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 and has since accumulated Bitcoin in its national reserve, using it to promote financial inclusion and attract foreign investment. While El Salvador's approach is unique, it demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating Bitcoin into national economic strategies. Conclusion Bitcoin's growth in 2025 may be driven by macroeconomic factors and key developments within its ecosystem. For stakeholders, monitoring the following will be crucial: Institutional Adoption: Announcements from major funds and corporations. Technological Progress: Innovations in scalability and usability, particularly with the Lightning Network. Regulatory Environment: Policy shifts in major economies. Market Trends: Bitcoin's response to economic and geopolitical events. Payment Adoption: Growth in retail and cross-border use cases. Competitive Landscape: Challenges from emerging digital assets. Despite risks such as volatility, regulatory uncertainty and competition, Bitcoin's adaptability and resilience position it as a transformative force in global finance. President Trump's proactive stance on crypto-friendly policies and the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve may further catalyze its prominence, making 2025 a potentially pivotal year for Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem.

Important Risks Related to this Article Crypto assets, such as bitcoin and ether, are complex, generally exhibit extreme price volatility and unpredictability, and should be viewed as highly speculative assets. Crypto assets are frequently referred to as crypto ""currencies,"" but they typically operate without central authority or banks, are not backed by any government or issuing entity (i.e., no right of recourse), have no government or insurance protections, are not legal tender and have limited or no usability as compared to fiat currencies. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use, transfer, exchange and value of crypto assets, and regulation in the U.S. and worldwide is still developing. Crypto asset exchanges and/or settlement facilities may stop operating, permanently shut down or experience issues due to security breaches, fraud, insolvency, market manipulation, market surveillance, KYC/AML (know your customer/anti-money laundering) procedures, noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations, technical glitches, hackers, malware or other reasons, which could negatively impact the price of any cryptocurrency traded on such exchanges or reliant on a settlement facility or otherwise may prevent access or use of the crypto asset. Crypto assets can experience unique events, such as forks or airdrops, which can impact the value and functionality of the crypto asset. Crypto asset transactions are generally irreversible, which means that a crypto asset may be unrecoverable in instances where: (i) it is sent to an incorrect address, (ii) the incorrect amount is sent or (iii) transactions are made fraudulently from an account. A crypto asset may decline in popularity, acceptance or use, thereby impairing its price, and the price of a crypto asset may also be impacted by the transactions of a small number of holders of such crypto asset. Crypto assets may be difficult to value, and valuations, even for the same crypto asset, may differ significantly by pricing source or otherwise be suspect due to market fragmentation, illiquidity, volatility and the potential for manipulation. Crypto assets generally rely on blockchain technology, and blockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology that operates as a distributed ledger. Blockchain systems could be subject to internet connectivity disruptions, consensus failures or cybersecurity attacks, and the date or time that you initiate a transaction may be different than when it is recorded on the blockchain. Access to a given blockchain requires an individualized key, which, if compromised, could result in loss due to theft, destruction or inaccessibility. In addition, different crypto assets exhibit different characteristics, use cases and risk profiles.

BTC to $102K The largest cryptocurrency started the business week on the wrong foot as the AI mania that started in China called DeepSeek sent the entire market into a severe correction. On Monday morning, the asset fell by over $7,000 and dropped below $98,000 for the first time in almost two weeks. After an unsuccessful recovery attempt later that day, the bulls finally stepped up on Tuesday and pushed BTC back into six-digit price territory. The markets calmed a bit on Wednesday in anticipation of the first yearly FOMC meeting, but once that concluded that it became known, as expected, that the Fed won’t change the interest rates, BTC started to lose value . Within less than an hour, the asset dropped from $103,000 to $101,500. However, it bounced off and surged to $106,500 on Thursday. It remained on that solid ground on Friday morning as well, with a daily peak of $106,000. Nevertheless, it slumped hard in the evening to $101,300 (on Bitstamp). Although it has recovered some ground since then, it’s still more than 2% down on the day and struggles beneath $102,000. Its market capitalization has slipped below $2.020 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 55.6%. BTCUSD.

Bitcoin Ready For $150,000 Price Target – Analyst In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with username Percival has touted Bitcoin to achieve a $150,000 price in the current bull cycle. Commenting on the present market state which might be unsettling to certain investors, Percival states that Bitcoin’s price trajectory, marked by sharp upward spikes and periods of consolidation, resembles the structural dynamics of any mature financial asset. In regards to future price movement, the analyst references a Fibonacci expansion from Bitcoin’s cycle low at $15,450 in November 2022 to the consolidation at $48,934 in 2024. In translating this historical data to the current market, Percival identifies a Bitcoin price target between $136,000 – $150,000 which is further supported by data from Bitcoin Realized Price Bands – a market metric that analyses supply based on different buying levels. However, for Bitcoin to trade at $150,000, the asset must attain a total market cap of $3 trillion. Currently, there is strong historical data in support of this postulation. For context, Percival explains that Bitcoin Realized Cap rose by 470% in the previous bearish cycle in 2021. Presently, the realized Cap has only grown by 111% suggesting more potential for market growth. Furthermore, the analyst identifies possible sources of demand to drive up the projected $3 trillion market expansion, one of which is the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Notably, these investment funds registered nearly $40 billion in inflow during their debut trading year in 2024. With the US expected to adopt a pro-crypto stance in the Donald Trump administration, institutional demand is also likely to surge stronger through these ETFs. In addition, Percival includes the Bitcoin Futures market which is currently valued at $95 billion as another potential bullish driver for the projected market expansion Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Extends To 1.1 Million BTC As Profit-Taking Continues BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at 102,334 reflecting a 1.66% decline over the last day.

The announcement came after Trump’s proposition for the US government to hold a Bitcoin reserve. But more interestingly, experts predict that this announcement could help position the marker towards a positive front. El Salvador became the first country to make this bold move, and with the USA now on the list of countries giving crypto a nod, the crypto market might be set for a brighter future. However, since these announcements, the Bitcoin price has remained steady, with a 12.50% growth in the last 30 days, and many altcoins have also moved slightly. Hence, there is rising concern about how much this new development from the US government and other players could affect the crypto market. Meanwhile, a new crypto asset seems to grow higher in the last couple of days, commanding strong attention from investors. The Remittix token ICO is a new cryptocurrency ICO that could start a bull rush earlier than any other crypto this season. How New Whales Might Trigger An Earlier Bull Run This Year Speculators and analysts have been vocal about the possibility of a strong bull run that might happen this year. But, many of these analyses have taken the BTC as a focal point. This gave birth to the raging speculation of the BTC to 100k after the Bitcoin halving last year. However, the move was massively delayed last year, primarily because of the fear of two things expected from the US last year: the Fed Rate cut report and the US election. Many feared being trapped in a bear circle, which could have been triggered had these two actions happened differently. However, the biggest defining moment came after the election when Donald Trump was announced as the winner. This meant two things: an end to the big crypto scrutiny from the SEC chairman, who doesn’t seem to be a big crypto fan, and the return of a pro-crypto president. This saw the crypto market react with an instant bullish move, seeing Bitcoin and many altcoins set a new record high. However, the latest developments speculate a massive adoption from the United States, Trump media, Arizona, and the Bank of Japan, among others. With these Whales’ contribution to the crypto market, they can spark a bull rage in the coming months. Remittix Maintains a Clear Edge as the Best Crypto Coin to Buy Now With a promise of a bull surge, identifying the best crypto coin to buy might make all the difference. While BTC continues to dominate the market, its ability to go 2x reduces as the price climbs. However, many new cryptos with lower prices are fast becoming the favorites for this bullish move. But again, it’s important to understand that not all new cryptos have the potential to benefit from the coming bull run. The new cryptocurrency ICO from the Remittix platform has become the talk of seasoned investors in the past few days. This is because many believe it has the potential to become a bigger and more recognized token in the future. The payment solution the Remittix platform is introducing makes it a potential frontrunner in the payment and remittance sector. Many payment solutions in the crypto market today make crypto-to-crypto their focal point, leaving FIAT solutions in the hands of Peer-to-peer transactions. But with Remittix, crypto-to-fiat transactions can now be done smoothly and at a lower conversion fee than traditional banks. The Remittix new cryptocurrency ICO has become the best crypto coin to buy today as it possesses the potential to usher in a smooth transition to crypto as a payment solution.

Uniswap is trading near the $12 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $14.1 and $15; a break above them can lead to $17. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved this same year. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Will UNI reach $100? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is expected to reach near $100 by the fourth quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting as the coin’s value will increase more than tenfold in this scenario. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts’ expect UNI’s price to reach $95.07 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana faces congestion as Musk It surges 500%, fueled by Errol Musk’s claims of ownership and rising trading volume. The rise of Musk It (MUSKIT) has caused another wave of congestion on the Solana blockchain as the meme coin frenzy continues to overwhelm network capacity. With MUSKIT pumping over 500% and hitting $0.069, trading volume has exploded, driving increased activity on Solana and pushing transaction fees higher. The sudden spike in interest was caused by Errol Musk, Elon Musk’s father, who claimed ownership of the Musk It project and dubbed it Musk Institute. The MUSKIT coin launched in mid-December last year, but public affiliation with the Musk family only came to light earlier today. According to Errol Musk, the project’s goal is to raise funding for Musk Institute, a for-profit think tank focused on scientific pursuits, including the development of flying vehicles. $MUSKIT Musk It meme coin nears deal with Musk Institute, secures MEXC Exchange listing @elonmusk @POTUS #memecoin $BTC $ETH $SOL https://t.co/pc29RrNrnX 9So52ugZh2BLBT3f7p61947q91uQh2DyvbfyMDeRpump pic.twitter.com/pCTVeX0xjE — Just Michelle (@MaryMichelleNay) January 31, 2025 Despite network strain on Solana, investor sentiment remains bullish, and traders continue accumulating MUSKIT, expecting further gains as market momentum builds. Meanwhile, investors are also backing the new Solaxy project, which is building the first Solana Layer-2 to ease congestion issues and has raised over $16 million through its ongoing presale. You might also like: Solana faces congestion woes as TRUMP, MELANIA coins soar; Solaxy layer-2 offers hope MUSKIT breaks key resistance levels: Where is the price headed next? This recent MUSKIT price surge follows a dramatic increase in demand, fueled by speculation and strong community backing. Solana’s network, already known for previous slowdowns during high-traffic periods, is once again facing delays and higher gas fees. The congestion highlights the urgent need for scalable Layer-2 solutions capable of absorbing the load from surging projects like MUSKIT. Despite congestion issues, the technical outlook for MUSKIT suggests continued upside potential following its latest breakout. The MUSKIT price is currently hovering around the key resistance level of $0.038, turning it into a new support zone and signaling strong buyer confidence. However, earlier today, MUSKIT saw a huge, even if biref, spike to $0.69 signaling the potential for new heights. On the four-hour chart, MUSKIT remains in a clear uptrend, trading well above its 9-period EMA and 50-period SMA, confirming bullish momentum. A golden cross between these moving averages further suggests continued upward movement. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) show strong buying pressure, currently sitting at 63, just below overbought territory. This suggests room for additional gains before a potential short-term correction. The Bollinger Bands are widening, indicating higher volatility, with price action trending toward the upper band, a sign of continued strength. If buying pressure holds, MUSKIT could target the next resistance level at $0.045 before attempting to reach the psychological barrier of $0.05. However, traders should watch for short-term retracements, as profit-taking could lead to temporary pullbacks toward the $0.035 support zone before another rally. While Oscillators are in the red of the “Sell” zone, which is mainly caused by the serious volatility and the unprecedented price hike to $0.69 earlier today, the moving averages are steadily flickering in the “Strong Buy” area, signaling that MUSKIT has a lot more potential. The overall sentiment remains bullish, and with trading volume surging, MUSKIT may continue to gain traction as speculative interest drives further accumulation. Solaxy is layer-2 solution for Solana’s scalability issues As MUSKIT’s success strains Solana , investors are looking for the next big project that can address congestion issues while offering major upside potential. Solaxy (SOLX) has emerged as the first Layer-2 scaling solution designed specifically for Solana’s expanding ecosystem, making it an attractive option for long-term growth. By integrating advanced Layer-2 technology, Solaxy improves transaction speeds and significantly lowers fees, resolving the congestion issues that projects like MUSKIT continue to expose. The project’s Ethereum-Solana bridge enhances cross-chain compatibility, allowing seamless transfers between two of the largest blockchain networks. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1882459105467433452 Solaxy’s SOLX token plays a critical role in securing transactions and powering the ecosystem. With its early presale pricing at $0.00162, investors can enter before the next price increase. Additionally, staking rewards of up to 240% APY provide passive income opportunities, making SOLX an attractive long-term investment. As demand for scalable blockchain solutions grows, Solaxy is well-positioned to surge in value, especially as Solana continues to experience congestion from meme coin activity. Investors looking for the next breakout project should consider SOLX as a top contender in the Layer-2 space. For more information, visit the Solaxy presale website .

Notably, it has also led to the exit of a top-ranking official of the agency, sparking further market discussions. Besides, it also comes as Musk has shared ambitious plans for DOGE, which has caught the market’s attention. Having said that, a flurry of investors anticipate the development to have an impact on the Dogecoin price ahead. Elon Musk’s DOGE Targets US Treasury Recent reports indicate that David Lebryk, a high-ranking US Treasury official, is stepping down after disagreements with allies of Elon Musk. According to a Washington Post report cited by Reuters , the conflict stemmed from DOGE’s request to audit a crucial payment system. This system processes over $6 trillion annually, including Social Security, Medicare, federal salaries, and tax refunds. While it remains unclear why Musk’s team sought access, the development has raised eyebrows in financial and political circles. The report noted that a DOGE spokesperson declined to comment, and the US Treasury has yet to respond to media inquiries. Musk Alleges US Treasury Fraud Reacting to the news, American activist Robby Starbuck questioned why government officials would resist an audit. He suggested that DOGE was investigating excessive spending and potential inefficiencies within the Treasury. Elon Musk, in response to Starbuck’s claims, alleged that Treasury officials were instructed to approve all payments, even to fraudulent or terrorist groups. In the latest X post, Musk stated: “The DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.” This bold accusation has fueled public concern over financial mismanagement within the federal government. Ambitious Plans For Elon Musk’s DOGE Amid the US Treasury controversy, the tech mogul has laid out an aggressive cost-cutting vision for DOGE. Elon Musk has reiterated his previous goal of cutting $4 billion in daily federal spending by 2026, targeting a deficit reduction from $2 trillion to $1 trillion. In a recent X post, Musk shared an optimistic update: “I am cautiously optimistic that we will reach the $4B/day FY2026 reduction this weekend.” If successful, this would mark a significant shift in government efficiency. Market Reactions & Dogecoin Speculation With Elon Musk’s DOGE making headlines, investors are speculating on its impact on Dogecoin’s price. Historically, Musk’s involvement with the meme coin has driven sharp fluctuations. While no direct connection exists between DOGE and Dogecoin, the resemblance in the department’s acronym and the meme coin’s ticker often influences the market sentiment. Having said that, several experts anticipate these developments to impact the Dogecoin price ahead. In addition, Dogecoin whales are also making headlines with their latest accumulation trend, indicating the growing investors’ confidence in the asset. Considering all these aspects, it appears that Elon Musk’s DOGE development is likely to influence Dogecoin price ahead. Simultaneously, the market watchers are keeping close track of the Department’s tactics in cutting the US federal spending in the coming days.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ripple’s court win boosts XRP’s outlook, while Elluminex eyes DeFi growth on the expanding TON network. Table of Contents Elluminex’s proprietary premarket feature attracts growing interest Ripple maintains strong bullish momentum in monthly rally Conclusion Ripple (XRP) has established its footprint across the global financial landscape, especially after its recent court victory against the U.S. SEC. This achievement has propelled the XRP price to unprecedented highs, with market forecasters touting a double-digit price for the top altcoin during this bull cycle. Meanwhile, new interesting projects are emerging. Elluminex (ELX), a fast-rising presale star that aims to solve similar challenges as Ripple but with a twist. In its own case, Elluminex aims to expand DeFi capabilities on the rapidly growing TON network by leveraging its robust DeFi infrastructure and proprietary premarket features. Elluminex’s proprietary premarket feature attracts growing interest For every blockchain network that has scaled significantly over the past two decades, there is always a cross-chain solution(s) that drives network adoption and liquidity aggregation. SushiSwap and Uniswap did it for Ethereum, PancakeSwap for Binance, and Jupiter for Solana. As a unified DeFi Hub, Elluminex aims to achieve the same and more for the TON blockchain. However, deviating from the traditional module, Elluminex introduces proprietary features such as premarket access as well as an AI-powered portfolio tracker that streamlines the overall DeFi experience for both new and experienced users. Additionally, Elluminex offers other key solutions including a comprehensive DEX protocol, advanced staking and farming mechanism, and cross-chain liquidity solutions. There is also an Academy that aims to eliminate DeFi illiteracy to the barest minimum, which further underscores Elluminex’s effort to deliver true financial liberty for its core users. This, coupled with exposure to the fastest growing network with over 950 million active users and over 1 billion recorded transactions, is drawing a massive interest to Elluminex presale, where the native ELX token currently sells for $0.06 with a potential for an exponential rally by launch. You might also like: Analyst predicts Solana ETF approval by March as Elluminex mirrors SOL’s rally Ripple maintains strong bullish momentum in monthly rally The past month has been quite an interesting one for the Ripple coin as it registered over 40% increase despite obvious market fluctuation. However, the past week has been met with a severe fluctuation as XRP price hovers around a weekly price range of $3.24 and $3.18, reflecting a roughly 2% decline during the period. Regardless, XRP coin still maintains a generally bullish outlook, especially considering its year-to-date price gain of over 500%. As such, there has been sustained optimism for the native XRP coin among community members and market forecasters alike. Meanwhile, technical analysis on TradingView reveals that XRP coin’s moving averages maintain a bullish position, suggesting that the top altcoin holds a strong potential to break past its recently registered all-time high of $3.84 in the coming weeks. It could possibly hit double digits before the end of this bull cycle as top analysts like Ali Chart predicted. Conclusion While both ELluminex and Ripple have a primary goal of expanding DeFi access to the masses, it’s hard to conclude which one has the most potential to dominate the DeFi market. Elluminex in particular, is set to expand DeFi capabilities on the TON network, which in itself holds a lot of unrealized potential for the base network and broader crypto market.

Massad, who currently serves as a research associate at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School, voiced his disapproval in a recent interview. He argued that the Trump Organization was using the timing of the inauguration for financial gain, potentially opening the door for domestic and foreign organizations to purchase the tokens in an effort to curry favor with the new administration. Related News: BREAKING: 21Shares Files Spot ETF for Unexpected Altcoin “I think it was clearly wrong of them to issue these,” Massad said. “The Trump Organization took advantage of the President’s upcoming inauguration to make money. In addition, they did so in a way that created the potential for further conflicts of interest, because domestic or foreign firms or foreign governments could now purchase these memecoins to curry favor with the administration.” Massad also criticized the move for undermining efforts to create a responsible regulatory framework for crypto. “The stated purpose of the Executive Order is to support the responsible development of digital assets on the blockchain. I cannot think of an action more contrary to that purpose than issuing these memecoins right as I am taking office,” he added. During his tenure at the CFTC, Massad played a key role in classifying Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities. In evaluating this decision, he explained that the legal definition of a commodity extends beyond traditional goods like wheat, cotton, and corn. Bitcoin’s recognition as a commodity was based on its role in financial markets and its use in derivative contracts. *This is not investment advice.

The crypto space is no stranger to innovation, and meme coins are evolving beyond just being viral sensations. Investors are now looking for projects that bring more than just hype—they seek engagement, storytelling, and the potential for massive gains. While TRUMP and Snek coins continue to make headlines with their latest updates, a new contender, Arctic Pablo (APC ), is capturing attention with its unique narrative. Unlike typical meme coins, Arctic Pablo ties its presale to legendary locations, allowing investors to join its global expedition. This article will explore the latest updates on the top new meme coins with 1000X potential: Arctic Pablo, TRUMP, and Snek. Arctic Pablo’s Mysterious Quest – A Meme Coin Like No Other Arctic Pablo (APC) isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an adventure waiting to unfold.

Instead, it follows a thrilling journey where each phase is connected to a legendary location. Currently, Arctic Pablo has reached Shangri-La , the 8th phase of its expedition. The previous seven phases concluded faster than expected, with the project blazing through each location in record time. This rapid progress has fueled excitement among early investors who recognize the rarity of such an innovative presale format. At present, 1 APC is priced at $0.000047, presenting a golden opportunity before prices rise in the next phase. With over $740,000 already raised, Arctic Pablo is proving its market demand. Investors who join at this stage could potentially see an ROI exceeding 16,936%, given the final presale price of $0.0008 and an expected launch price of $0.008. With each new phase, the entry price increases, making this the perfect time to get in while it remains affordable. The question is—will you secure your spot before the next location unlocks? TRUMP Coin’s New Utility Boosts Adoption The TRUMP meme coin has taken a major step toward mass adoption as select online stores now accept it as a form of payment. This move significantly strengthens the coin’s utility, shifting it from being just a political meme to an asset with real-world use cases. As more platforms explore integrating TRUMP coin transactions, its demand continues to rise among both crypto investors and political supporters. Despite market fluctuations, TRUMP has maintained strong community backing. The latest updates suggest further developments that could expand its reach even more. With ongoing discussions about potential partnerships, the coin’s presence in the meme coin space is solidifying, making it one to watch in the coming months. Snek Coin’s Market Activity Sparks Interest Snek (SNEK), a meme coin built on the Cardano blockchain, is gaining traction as its community-driven efforts continue to shape its progress. Recent trading data shows SNEK is priced at around $0.00645, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $2.38 million. Although the coin experienced a minor 1.21% dip, its overall engagement remains strong, reflecting consistent investor interest. The Snek community plays a crucial role in the coin’s momentum, frequently rallying support across social platforms. With discussions about upcoming developments, Snek maintains its position as a prominent player in the meme coin sector. As market conditions fluctuate, the project’s long-term vision and community involvement remain key factors in its performance. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Leads the Charge in Meme Coin Innovation With meme coins evolving beyond simple internet jokes, projects like Arctic Pablo are redefining what’s possible in the crypto world. While TRUMP and Snek continue to push forward with new developments, Arctic Pablo’s adventurous presale concept sets it apart from the rest. Investors looking for a high-potential project with both storytelling and massive ROI potential should keep an eye on Arctic Pablo.

39773097,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=381449,1738403171,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/39773097.jpeg,We Asked DeepSeek if Ripple (XRP) Can Hit New All-Time High This Year,https://cryptopotato.com/we-asked-deepseek-if-ripple-xrp-can-hit-new-all-time-high-this-year/,"TL:DR; XRP became one of the top performers of 2024, and the start of 2025 was also quite promising as it came just 1% away from its all-time high of $3.4. It has retraced since then, and the question now is whether it will be able to go into uncharted territory this year. Here’s DeepSeek’s answer. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP to New ATH Finally? The daily chart above shows that XRP was stuck below $1 for years, and it was predominantly trading within a tight range between $0.35 and $0.6. It stood close to the latter as the US elections took place, but once it became known that Donald Trump will return to the White House, Ripple’s cross-border token exploded in value. More positive news for the company behind it came from Gary Gensler’s departure announcement from the SEC, and this sent XRP further north. By the year’s end, the token had neared $3 and broke above it in January. Its peak came in the middle of the month, at just under $3.4 , which is the 2018 ATH, according to CoinGecko. Since then, XRP has been unable to push further and is even close to breaking below $3. However, there are more positive speculation in the US about its future, including a possible resolution of the SEC lawsuit as well as its introduction into strategic crypto reserve in the country. DeepSeek, which made the headlines earlier this week by possibly becoming a cheaper version of ChatGPT, outlined the lawsuit against the US securities regulator as the most important factor behind another XRP rally. “The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a significant overhang on XRP’s price. A favorable outcome for Ripple could lead to a surge in XRP’s price as it would remove a major uncertainty.” Other Factors DeepSeek also mentioned the overall regulatory environment not only in the US but across the globe. Positive news on that front could “boost investors’ confidence,” especially those who tend to stay away from the uncertainty regarding XRP’s status in the States. This could also enhance the XRP adoption rates, as well as lead to more strategic partnerships for the company behind it. The AI chatbot further indicated that the overall market conditions, meaning mostly BTC’s price movements, have to remain as bullish as they were in the past few months or even go beyond for XRP to resume its rally. Lastly, DeepSeek said XRP could benefit a lot from an altcoin season. It’s currently the second-largest alt and, given ETH’s underperformance lately, could be among the leaders in terms of further gains against the dollar and BTC. However, there have been many industry experts who doubted the existence of an altseason under the current market conditions. In conclusion, the ChatGPT alternative said it’s quite probable that XRP can indeed reach a new all-time high this year, but it needs the alignment of at least a few of the aforementioned factors.

From record-breaking XRP ETF filings to a booming decentralized exchange and a surging stablecoin, XRP’s Q4 2024 was one for the history books. Now, with top experts predicting a $4 target , the big question is—can XRP hold strong and explode even higher? Ripple’s Quarter to Remember Garlinghouse called the last quarter of 2024 “one for the XRP history books.” One of the key highlights was the filing of five XRP ETF applications by major financial firms in the U.S. This year, four more companies have followed suit, showing increasing confidence in XRP’s potential. Suffice it to say – Q4 2024 was absolutely one for the XRP history books. 5 different firms filed for XRP-related ETPs in the US (plus 4 more this month ); $RLUSD launched, hitting a $100M market cap within a month; and on-chain XRPL DEX trading volume reached $1B in Q4! More… https://t.co/X3m9Q1GHjH — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 31, 2025 Another significant achievement was the launch of Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, in December. The stablecoin has already crossed the $100 million market capitalization mark, proving its growing adoption. Additionally, Ripple’s decentralized exchange (XRPL DEX) recorded an on-chain trading volume of $1 billion in Q4, showcasing the growing activity within its ecosystem. XRP’s Eyeing $4 Mark The Ripple quarterly report also highlighted XRP’s remarkable 280% price increase in late 2024. This surge was driven by strong demand from top exchanges like Binance, Upbit Korea, and Coinbase. Despite a recent dip, with XRP trading at $3 and a 1% decline, experts remain bullish. Market analyst Dark Defender has set a short-term target for XRP, emphasizing the importance of holding the 3.07 support level. As per Coinpedia’s report , veteran trader Peter Brandt has spotted a bullish pattern in XRP’s price chart. If the pattern plays out as predicted, XRP could skyrocket to as high as $4.8. The SEC’s Changing Stance The report also touched on the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who returned to MIT as a lecturer. Gensler’s tenure was marked by controversy, with critics arguing that his policies created confusion in the crypto space. His replacement, Acting Chairman Uyeda, has hinted at a more balanced approach, which could benefit Ripple and the broader crypto industry.

TRON’s TRX: Empowering Creators in a Decentralized Digital World TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform that launched in 2017. It aims to give full ownership rights to digital content creators. Instead of big companies like YouTube or Facebook taking most of the profits, TRON allows creators to earn more rewards for their work. It does this by letting content consumers reward creators directly. TRON also supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, known as dApps. This means developers can build applications on TRON’s network and offer content without worrying about high fees. TRON’s potential lies in its focus on a decentralized internet. By cutting out middlemen, it puts power back into the hands of creators and users. In the current market, TRX looks attractive due to its unique approach and growing ecosystem. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, TRON offers faster transactions and lower fees. As more people seek alternatives to traditional platforms, TRON could see increased adoption. The trend towards decentralization and user empowerment makes TRX a coin to watch. Cardano’s ADA: The Sustainable Crypto Powerhouse Shaping the Future Cardano is emerging as a significant player in the cryptocurrency world, offering a flexible and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. This enables the development of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is a strong competitor to Ethereum’s ETH, allowing users to store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally sustainable approach. It utilizes the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient compared to the energy-intensive proof-of-work model used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The innovation doesn’t stop there. Cardano’s blockchain is uniquely divided into two layers—the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This division enhances its transaction processing capabilities, potentially reaching up to a million transactions per second. The introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021 has set a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability, offering secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In the current market cycle, ADA’s advanced technology and commitment to sustainability make it an attractive option for investors. As the demand for eco-friendly and efficient blockchain solutions grows, Cardano is well-positioned to make a lasting impact on the crypto market. Conclusion While TRX and ADA are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the pioneering all-sport memecoin poised for explosive 20,000% growth with its unique blend of sports and meme culture.

Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use “AI” as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Agent A.I. Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Agent A.I. aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility , while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Agent A.I. stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Agent A.I. is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform . According to its developers, the project’s AI framework can: Analyze massive datasets in milliseconds to improve decision-making Scale up processing power to match top cloud platforms Continuously refine its performance, learning and adapting over time. The development team behind Agent A.I. is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Agent A.I. has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices . The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token costs $0.003333333. It will go through 28 stages and reach $0.151515152 by the end of the presale. Those who buy at the first stage get a huge 98% discount . This pricing strategy means that the earlier you invest, the bigger the discount . Secure Your $AGNT Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Agent A.I. combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market : AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Agent A.I. Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Shiba Inu’s Roller Coaster: Is SHIB Set for a Surge or a Slip? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen ups and downs recently. Over the past week, the price dropped by -6.90%. In the past month, it decreased by -11.22%. However, in the last six months, SHIB gained 32.11%.

If it falls below the support, it might drop to the second support at $0.000007949, a decrease of around 32%. Technical indicators show mixed signals.

The MACD level is 0.0000000209, showing little momentum. Based on this data, PEPE’s price could rise, but market conditions remain uncertain.

With this score, the market is currently in Bitcoin Season , meaning that most altcoins are underperforming relative to BTC . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index measures whether altcoins or Bitcoin are leading market gains over the past 90 days . How the Index Works: Range: 1 to 100 (Updated Daily) Altcoin Season: If 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin Bitcoin Season: If 25% or fewer altcoins outperform Bitcoin Since the index remains at 46 , it suggests that Bitcoin dominance continues, limiting altcoin rallies . Why Is the Market Still in Bitcoin Season? Key Factors Keeping Bitcoin in Control: Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows – Institutional money is flowing into BTC rather than altcoins . Market Uncertainty – Investors favor Bitcoin’s stability over riskier altcoins . Altcoin Rotation Delayed – Historical trends suggest altcoin season follows Bitcoin’s peak . Until altcoins start outperforming BTC on a broader scale , the index is unlikely to signal Altcoin Season . What Needs to Happen for Altcoin Season to Begin? Altcoins Must Outperform Bitcoin – At least 75% of the top 100 coins must show stronger 90-day returns . Increased Speculation in Altcoins – More traders need to rotate capital from BTC into altcoins . More Institutional Interest in Altcoins – Major funds must begin allocating to Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins . If these conditions align, the index could rise toward Altcoin Season levels . FAQs What is the Altcoin Season Index? A metric that measures whether Bitcoin or altcoins are dominating market performance over 90 days . What does an index score of 46 mean? It indicates that Bitcoin is still outperforming most altcoins , keeping the market in Bitcoin Season . When does Altcoin Season start?

ETF inflows, market uncertainty, and investor preference for BTC over riskier altcoins . Will Altcoin Season happen soon? It depends on market rotation, investor sentiment, and Bitcoin’s price movements .

Although there were no announcements on the ease of tax policies around cryptocurrencies, the FM suggested that the term “virtual digital asset” (VDA) be included under defining undisclosed income. This saga has sparked nationwide speculations of a clearer stance on VDA to be revealed in the fine print set to be released ahead. Meanwhile, a new zero-income tax policy has offered major relief to the country’s broader masses. India Budget 2025: FM’s Comments Spurs Hope For Crypto Market As mentioned above, although there were no mentions of any ease of tax policies around cryptocurrencies, the FM’s comments have sparked slight hope for the broader sector. According to a Hindustan Times report dated February 1, Nirmala Sithraman has proposed in the India Budget speech 2025 that the term “VDA” be included in defining undisclosed income. Although this proposal still won’t offer tax relief, the measure will ensure the strengthening of cryptocurrency market regulations in India. Further, according to Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta on X, the fine print of the India Budget 2025 to be released ahead is anticipated to have “more details” regarding VDA. Moreover, in another post, the CEO highlighted that Indian businesses must report crypto transactions with a 30-day window to correct errors, as per the new finance bill. India Budget 2025 Offers Major Tax Relief Meanwhile, the latest India Budget also announced zero income tax for up to Rs 12 lakh, a major relief to the nation’s broader masses. Previously, the zero income tax policy was applied only for an income of up to Rs 7 lakhs. Further, the nation also saw its Economic Survey presented a day prior to the India budget 2025. This survey projected a growth rate of 6.3-6.8% for the next financial year, highlighting “Viksit Bharat@2047.” This endeavor projects the country as a developed nation by 2025. Subsequently, an economic growth rate of 8% can be expected in light of this feat. Even the cryptocurrency market glimmers hope for further clarity amid broader developments. The current approach outlined in the Union Budget speech, to include VDA in undisclosed income, signals the govt now classifies unreported crypto asset holdings as illegal. What’s Next For the Indian Crypto Market? In light of the latest India Budget and the government’s constant movers to supervise the digital assets sector nationwide, possibilities of a less scrutinized approach to taxes prevail. As regulators continue to establish laws around the sector, primarily mitigating risks and losses for users, further such developments are awaited. Currently, the nation tackles a 30% tax on income from crypto and 1% TDS (Tax Deducted At Source), unchanged from the previous Union Budget . Meanwhile, it’s also noteworthy that the broader crypto market volatility could substantially be leveraged if Indian tax policies on the sector loosen their grip. A substantial influx of money could be witnessed in the global market, given the Indian Budget offers eased tax policies ahead.

Solana’s explosive rise in the crypto market has sparked debate over why Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks have struggled to achieve similar momentum. According to the founder of Pump. Fun, Solana’s success stems from a superior user experience, deep liquidity, and a native token that surged alongside adoption. In contrast, Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions remain fragmented, limiting their ability to capture sustained market attention. On-chain data highlights Solana’s dominance in decentralized exchanges, reflecting its high-speed transactions and cost efficiency. As Ethereum developers push scaling solutions, questions linger on whether they can replicate Solana’s breakout trajectory. the reason Solana was able to reach exit velocity is because it had a better UX + sufficient liquidity + native asset that pumped alongside adoption can’t help but wonder how Eth L2s are supposed to compete if liquidity/attention keeps getting fragmented + a shit native asset Solana Price Finds Key Support, Eyes $300 Retest Next Solana price shows signs of a bullish reversal after bouncing off key support levels. The cryptocurrency found support at the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) around $212.94, preventing further downside. Currently, the SOL price is trading at $230, aiming for a recovery that could lead to a retest of the $300 resistance level. A swing failure pattern has emerged due to excessive selling pressure. This pattern signals a potential reversal as buyers stepped in to defend support. The Solana price briefly dipped below the mid-range level, nearly $232, but it was reclaimed, indicating a bullish shift. If this momentum sustains, the Solana price forecast could rally toward the range high of $296. SOL held above the 50-day SMA, acting as key support. The 200-day SMA near $181 remains a major safety net in case of further dips. Solana price is trading within a defined range, with the lower bound at $168 and the upper bound at $296. The MACD indicator shows decreasing selling momentum, hinting at a possible bullish crossover. The RSI stabilizes around 61.37, suggesting room for further upside without overbought conditions. If SOL reclaims the $250 resistance, bulls could drive the price toward $280-$300 in the coming weeks. However, failure to hold above $232.51 might lead to another retest of lower support levels near $212 and $181. TradingView The Solana price bullish momentum remains intact, supported by strong fundamentals and technical indicators. If key resistance levels break, SOL could rally toward $300. Traders should monitor support zones for potential reversals.

His statement on X (formerly Twitter) comes after Forbes released a new cover featuring Michael Saylor , founder of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) and the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC). King pointed out that past Forbes covers have preceded major downturns , citing: Changpeng Zhao (2018) – Binance’s former CEO appeared on Forbes before a multi-year bear market . Sam Bankman-Fried (2021) – The FTX founder graced Forbes shortly before FTX’s collapse and the 2022 crypto winter . With Saylor now featured , some analysts are questioning whether history will repeat itself . Are Forbes Covers a Signal for Crypto Market Peaks? Historical Trends Suggest a Pattern: 2018: Changpeng Zhao’s cover preceded a brutal bear market . 2021: Sam Bankman-Fried was featured before FTX’s downfall . 2024: Michael Saylor’s cover raises speculation about a potential market top . While correlation does not imply causation , these past events have led to skepticism about high-profile media coverage in the crypto space. Why Do Market Tops Coincide with Media Hype? Excessive Media Coverage Fuels FOMO – When crypto hits mainstream media, retail investors pile in , often marking the final stage of a bull market . Late-Stage Institutional Interest – Corporations and funds often enter near the top , thinking they are late but still early . Overconfidence Before Corrections – When a narrative becomes too bullish , smart money starts exiting , triggering a market downturn .

While past trends suggest caution , Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong , leaving room for further upside or a short-term correction . FAQs What is the Forbes crypto cover theory? It suggests that when a major crypto figure appears on Forbes, the market is near a peak , based on past examples. Who were the previous crypto figures featured on Forbes? Changpeng Zhao (2018) – Before the crypto bear market Sam Bankman-Fried (2021) – Before FTX collapsed Michael Saylor (2024) – Raising speculation about a market top Does media hype always mean a market peak? Not necessarily, but excessive media coverage often aligns with retail FOMO and speculative bubbles . Is Bitcoin due for a correction? While Bitcoin remains strong , if altcoin speculation surges , it could indicate market euphoria before a pullback. Should investors be worried about Michael Saylor’s cover? It’s worth monitoring , but institutional Bitcoin demand may prevent extreme volatility seen in past cycles. Conclusion The Forbes cover theory has gained attention after past features of Changpeng Zhao and Sam Bankman-Fried coincided with market peaks . With Michael Saylor now on the cover , analysts are debating whether this signals another potential market top or just heightened mainstream interest in Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, AVAX and IntelMarkets (INTL) have been speculated to offer a potential for much higher returns. This viral altcoin is defying the odds with its groundbreaking AI technology. Let’s see how. Ethereum Price Outlook: Can ETH Hit $5,700 Price Target? Analysts are anticipating that the ETH could potentially hit a price target of $5,700 in the near future. This bullish speculation has been made considering the Ethereum price surge in early January up to $3,712. However, after this surge, the Ethereum price faced a significant decline but it maintained its critical psychological level around $3000 up till now. Source: CoinMarketCap In the past seven days, the Ethereum price has dropped almost 2% and is currently trading above $3,200. Industry insiders believe ETH has to maintain support at this key level or else the Ethereum price might again fall back to $3000 or even below $2,810. On the other hand, the ETH could see a massive bullish rally if it breaks through key resistance above $3,550 and $3,770. Therefore, the possibility of the Ethereum price delivering a 70% gain by hitting $5,700 is still clouded and highly dependent on its next move. Meanwhile, IntelMarkets (INTL) emerges as a promising contender that could offer stability to ETH investors with higher returns. Avalanche (AVAX) Recovery Signals Bullish Momentum The current outlook of the Avalanche price is signaling an upcoming bullish cycle. AVAX has been showing exceptional movement toward recovery after Avalanche’s recent decline of almost 5% in the past week. In the last few days, AVAX has been successfully maintaining support at around $32. As of 31 January, Avalanche is trading at around $34, and analysts believe if AVAX continues to maintain this recovery momentum it might see a surge up to around $41. Source: CoinMarketCap Some industry insiders also speculate that the Avalanche price could even hit $65 if it breaks through the $34 resistance and enters an impulsive 5-wave bullish cycle. On the other hand, Avalanche’s break below this key level might invalidate AVAX’s bullish sentiment. Amid all this, IntelMarkets (INTL) is attracting significant attention from investors with the potential to drive even higher returns than Avalanche and ETH. IntelMarkets Could Outshine ETH with Its Higher Return Potential IntelMarkets is emerging as an upcoming tech giant in the crypto industry that could outshine ETH and Avalanche with its explosive return potential. The platform offers cutting-edge trading features, including copy trading and 1000x leverage. By utilizing these features, investors could amplify their returns by following the trading strategies of experts. Along with this, IntelMarkets (INTL) is the first platform that combines decentralized layer-1 blockchain with AI technology. This collaboration allows access to features like advanced arbitrage and AI-based cost averaging. These features could minimize risk and potentially boost returns by helping investors to make informed decisions. In addition, INTL utilizes Intelli-M and Rodeum AI bots that are trained on Advanced AI algorithms to conduct trades. These bots could be personalized to match the trader’s preferences by adjusting trading variables like risk, leverage, and position sizing. Another amazing feature that gives IntelMarkets (INTL) a significant edge over altcoins like ETH and AVAX is its dual-chain functionality. The platform could be operated on either Solana or Ethereum blockchain allowing users to benefit from both. Lastly, IntelMarkets’ presale has already crossed an impressive milestone of $7.9 million in funding. Experts believe this incredible presale performance signals its promising prospect of generating potential returns in the future. Final Thoughts IntelMarkets (INTL) is positioned as the next big thing with its groundbreaking presale performance and massive return on investment potential. Experts recommend this platform over ETH and AVAX because of its tech-driven and AI-powered innovative approach. As the possibility of the Ethereum price reaching $5,700 promises a 70% gain, INTL offers far greater potential for gains.

Although such turbulence is temporary, mixed investor sentiments significantly affect the performance of digital assets. Moreover, the crypto market is notoriously volatile, which puts pressure on their performance, so it is essential to consider which cryptos to handle and which to sell. In this blog, we will discuss five altcoins to sell before this Monday to avoid potential losses. 5 Altcoins to Sell Now The Santiment reports revealed the increased buying pressure in the crypto market, where selling sentiments are almost negligible. However, the ongoing market conditions are putting a lot of investors in losses due to increased volatility, which creates the requirement to sell the specific cryptos—especially considering PNUT, TRUMP, JELLY, CHARLES, X, and a few other altcoins to sell due to their poor performance. 1. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) PNUT gained significant attention in 2024 due to the mass coverage of the story of the Peanut squirrel, which got euthanized on the pretext of rabies. Soon, someone created a token on the same, which went viral in the industry. However, due to continuous Peanut the Squirrel controversies and the lack of bullish factors, the PNUT price continues to decline. It is facing a 90% decline from its prime, creating the need to sell before investors lose more. 2. Official TRUMP (TRUMP) TRUMP meme coin is launched by the current US president, Donald Trump. The Trump token peaked at new highs with this association and gained attention. However, the same is among the top altcoins to sell this week, as its hype ended, resulting in a 70% drop in TRUMP price over two weeks. Moreover, critics have raised concerns about Donald Trump’s involvement with volatile assets. As a result, it is a factor that could influence TRUMP’s price further. 3. Jelly My Jelly (JellyJelly) The Venmo founder launched the JellyJelly token just a few days ago, which became an instant hit among investors. However, a recent Santiment report identified that the token lacked primary fundamentals or developments before speculating the possibility of pump and dump. Moreover, the JellyJelly price has continuously declined on the charts, making it problematic and crypto to sell. 4. Charles (CHARLES) The owner of the ADA meme, CHARLES, made a strategic move, sending 90% of the total supply to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. This was done to capitalize on the founder’s name. However, Hoskinson burned all ADA meme coins to save investors from this sketchy token falsely associated with his name. The token has already crashed on the chart and may continue to decline due to the burning of 90% of its supply. 5. X Empire The native token of the popular Telegram mini-game, X Empire, failed to perform in the market. The token has been suffering since its launch and has worsened since then. Its price has declined more than 85% from its peak. With time, the price may continue to decline, as this crypto project has no new upcoming update. Disclaimer: This blog analyzed some of the altcoins to sell. Although the conclusion is made considering their price performance and investor sentiments, the outcome may vary. The crypto market is filled with uncertainties and changing trends, so investors must do their research. Final Thoughts Amid the market volatility, PNUT, X Empire, JellyJelly, TRUMP, and CHARLES have become the top picks for altcoins to sell due to poor performance on the chart. All these crypto tokens exhibit poor performance and face significant events that cater to their decline. Crypto investors could consider these tokens to lose after doing proper research. Meanwhile, they can consider Bitcoin, XRP, and a few other cryptos to buy before Monday due to their incredible performances.

Choosing the right Forex lot size is crucial, as it determines risk exposure, margin requirements, and potential profit or loss . Understanding lot sizes in Forex can help traders manage their risk effectively and optimize their trading strategies . Types of Forex Lot Sizes There are four main types of Forex lot sizes , each catering to different trading styles and risk tolerances . Lot Type Units of Currency Value Per Pip (USD) (for EUR/USD) Standard Lot 100,000 $10 Mini Lot 10,000 $1 Micro Lot 1,000 $0.10 Nano Lot 100 $0.01 1. Standard Lot (100,000 Units) Most commonly used by professional traders Each pip movement equals $10 (on EUR/USD) Higher profit potential but also higher risk 2. Mini Lot (10,000 Units) Ideal for intermediate traders Each pip movement equals $1 Lower risk compared to standard lots 3. Micro Lot (1,000 Units) Perfect for beginners and small accounts Each pip movement equals $0.10 Reduces risk while allowing real-market experience 4. Nano Lot (100 Units) Used for testing strategies with minimal risk Each pip movement equals $0.01 Offered by some brokers as a low-risk option How to Choose the Right Forex Lot Size Selecting the correct Forex lot size depends on: Account Size – Larger accounts can handle bigger lot sizes , while small accounts benefit from mini or micro lots . Risk Tolerance – Low-risk traders should use micro or nano lots , while aggressive traders may opt for standard lots . Leverage & Margin – Higher leverage allows larger positions , but also increases risk exposure . Trading Strategy – Scalpers often use smaller lot sizes , while swing traders may use larger lots for long-term positions . Lot Size & Risk Management Risk management is essential when trading Forex.

FAQs What is a lot size in Forex? A lot size refers to the number of currency units traded in a Forex position . What is the best lot size for beginners? Beginners should start with micro (1,000 units) or nano (100 units) lots to minimize risk. How does lot size affect profit and loss?

For a $100 account , a nano lot (100 units) or micro lot (1,000 units) is recommended to manage risk effectively.

The correlation peaks during major technological shifts , as observed in 2020 and 2024 , reinforcing Bitcoin’s deep ties to the broader technology sector . Why Bitcoin Moves Like Small-Cap Tech Stocks Unlike traditional commodities or currencies, Bitcoin behaves similarly to early-stage tech companies due to: Venture Capital Influence – Many crypto projects rely on VC funding , much like small-cap tech startups. High Innovation, High Volatility – Bitcoin and small-cap tech stocks thrive on innovation , making them more volatile but high-growth assets . Market Sentiment & Tech Cycles – BTC and small-cap stocks move in tandem during periods of technological breakthroughs .

Technology Cycles Drive Bitcoin’s Price Action – Peaks in crypto and tech innovation (2020, 2024) coincide with stronger correlations . Crypto & Small Tech Are Venture-Driven – Both rely heavily on venture capital funding , leading to similar market behavior . This suggests that Bitcoin’s price movements are increasingly influenced by the tech industry rather than traditional macroeconomic trends . How Will This Correlation Impact Bitcoin’s Future?

Tech Breakthroughs Could Boost Bitcoin – Innovations in AI, blockchain, and fintech may fuel BTC’s next bull run .

Crypto Stocks & ETFs May Rise Together – If Bitcoin is viewed as a small-cap tech investment , crypto-related stocks may follow its price action . Tech Industry Partnerships – Bitcoin’s role in AI, fintech, and Web3 may further connect it to technology sector trends . If this trend holds , Bitcoin investors should watch small-cap tech stock movements closely for market insights . FAQs Why is Bitcoin correlated with small-cap tech stocks? Both Bitcoin and small-cap tech stocks rely on venture capital, innovation, and high-risk, high-reward investment cycles . Which tech index does Bitcoin follow? JPMorgan found Bitcoin is most correlated with the Russell 2000 index , which tracks small-cap tech companies . Does Bitcoin still act like digital gold? While Bitcoin has some characteristics of gold , it behaves more like a tech stock , reacting to market sentiment and innovation trends . What does this correlation mean for Bitcoin investors? Bitcoin’s price action may align with small-cap tech cycles , meaning investors should track tech industry trends . Could this change in the future? If Bitcoin gains broader adoption as a financial reserve asset , its correlation with tech stocks may weaken over time. Conclusion JPMorgan’s findings confirm that Bitcoin is more closely tied to small-cap tech stocks than to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. With crypto markets relying on venture capital and tech innovation , Bitcoin’s future performance may continue mirroring the technology sector . For investors, this means monitoring small-cap tech trends, AI advancements, and venture capital inflows could provide valuable insights into Bitcoin’s price movements .

It crushed the $200 billion milestone last week. The market cap has increased by $37 billion since Trump emerged victorious in early November. USDT is the primary asset driving the expansion in stablecoin liquidity; however, USDC has also gained significant traction. USDT currently has a market cap of $139.4 billion, following a 15% ($19 billion) rise since November 4. On the other hand, the market cap of USDC has surged 48% (by $17 billion) over the same period and now hovers above $53.3 billion. USDT Deposits Grow on Exchanges CryptoQuant revealed that USDT’s liquidity impulse, which refers to the 30-day percentage change in market capitalization, has become slightly positive after declining by 2% in early 2024. USDC’s liquidity impulse has expanded much more, rising 20% for the first time in almost a year. “Historically, whenever the liquidity impulse is growing a rally in crypto prices follows…A further acceleration typically drives crypto prices higher,” the analytics platform stated. While stablecoins are growing, their liquidity expansion has extended to centralized crypto exchanges. The total value of USDT deposited on these trading platforms is now at record levels, rising from $30.5 billion on November 4 to $43 billion today. This represents a 41% increase ($12.5 billion). “The total value of stablecoins is an important source of liquidity for trading on exchanges, and its expansion is generally associated with higher crypto prices,” CryptoQuant added.

While Solana makes waves with its evolving token landscape and AVAX tests critical support levels, Rollblock’s explosive presale is capturing serious attention. Raising over $10 million already, Rollblock is quickly establishing itself as a leading crypto coin for the coming year. Rollblock’s $10M Presale Sets the Stage for Growth Rollblock ($RBLK) is redefining GambleFi with a decentralized gaming ecosystem that offers real revenue-sharing opportunities. Its presale has already raised over $10 million, signaling clear demand from investors looking for projects with high ROI potential. Unlike many speculative tokens, Rollblock is backed by a sustainable business model that ensures long-term profitability. Its upcoming launch on DEXs will bring additional liquidity to the platform, further strengthening its position as a top-performing crypto coin. With its locked liquidity pools and a clear roadmap, Rollblock presents a strong case for those seeking both stability and growth in the current market. Solana’s Future in Tokenization Solana (SOL) has been a key player in crypto, but its latest shift toward tokenized startup funding is pushing the blockchain into new territory. Co-founder Raj Gokal recently suggested that meme coin portfolios could evolve into structured investments similar to traditional stocks. This marks a potential transformation in how tokens are perceived and utilized. Beyond speculation, Solana is becoming the go-to blockchain for Web2 companies looking to launch their own tokens. High-profile cases like VINE and JellyJelly highlight this trend. As companies move away from traditional IPOs and toward blockchain-based fundraising, Solana is positioned to benefit from this shift. From a price perspective, Solana recently rebounded after a three-day slump, retaking the $230 level. With bulls leveraging over $200 million in long positions, market sentiment remains positive, and analysts are eyeing a potential rebound toward $250. AVAX News Shows Key Support Levels Hold Strong Avalanche (AVAX) has been testing the $10 support level, a critical price point that could determine what direction the coin will take on the short term. If AVAX can manage to hold above this level, a bounce toward $12 or even $14 could be in the books. The opposite is also true as a break below $10 could see the coin drop to the next major support at $8.50. Despite recent price pressure, AVAX remains one of the strongest Layer 1 blockchains. Analysts predict a potential surge to $81 in 2025, with long-term projections in the AVAX news reaching as high as $257 by 2030. With the altcoin market gaining momentum, AVAX could present a strong buying opportunity for those looking at long-term growth. Why Rollblock Is the Leading Presale Crypto Coin for 2025 While Solana and Avalanche continue to develop their ecosystems, Rollblock offers a unique blend of utility, revenue-sharing, and sustainable growth. Its $10M presale highlights strong market confidence, and with the DEX launch coming soon, liquidity and adoption are set to increase. Rollblock stands out from other projects because of its built-in passive income opportunities. Unlike Solana, which is focused on tokenization, or Avalanche, which is still trying to break out of its current price range, Rollblock provides direct financial incentives to token holders. Investors looking for a high-ROI crypto coin with strong fundamentals should take advantage of Rollblock before its presale ends.

A week after President Trump took office, Wall Street executives started to warm up to crypto and blockchain. At the World Economic Forum at Davos-Klosters, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said that banks, as highly regulated institutions, can always act as new crypto transactors. This favorable sentiment, plus President Trump’s pro-crypto agenda, is electrifying the general investing public looking for new digital assets to invest in. Three new cryptocurrencies are making noise in a crowded market: Aave, Rollblock , and Jupiter. Aave sets to recover Aave (AAVE), a leading money market protocol, is poised for recovery after sustaining almost sideways movement for most of 2024. From April to October, AAVE traded below $200. By November, the popular money market platform surged, eventually breaching the $300 mark. The project’s 7-day price range found support at around $280, and market analysts are bullish on its short-term performance. Investors’ bullish sentiment on AAVE is backed by its RSI of 52, which indicates increased buying pressure. Finally, on-chain data suggests that most traders and investors are on the long side, as reflected by the asset’s Long/Short ratio at 1.13. This metric indicates that for every 1.13 Aave long positions, there’s one short position, which reflects a bullish sentiment. Jupiter (JUP) is primed for a breakout Jupiter (JUP), a DEX aggregator, is headed for a breakout days after the project announced its token burn mechanism and a $600 million JUP token buyback program. According to its founder, ‘Meow,’ the token-burning initiative aims to remove up to 3 billion digital assets in circulation, which can enhance the token’s importance and lower its fully diluted valuation (FDV). These latest developments reflect a change in investors’ sentiment, potentially expanding its price action. Currently, JUP is looking at a 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level of $1.16. If JUP breaches this level, the market can expect a decisive price breakout, creating a new trend. If this fails, JUP holders can expect another corrective price action, with lower support at $0.94 or a 0.5 Fibonacci retracement. Rollblock (RBLK) Rollblock (RBLK) , currently in presale, is set on upending the GameFi segment. With an eye on innovation, Rollblock aims to enhance the traditional gambling experience by integrating crypto, blockchain technology, and its native token as on-site currency. This new crypto project doesn’t just power an online casino; it aims to create a community where players become active participants and reward earners. Expectations among investors run high, owing to the project’s commitment to a potentially lucrative rewards share program. 30% of its weekly generated revenue will be shared with its holders. Rollblock will use two mechanisms for its rewards system: buyback and burn and staking. The buyback and burn program rewards sellers and reduces the number of circulating tokens. Then, its staking program aims to reward stakers and holders. On-site, Rollblock players earn rewards such as rakeback and VIP bonuses, which enhance the crypto betting experience. Aave and Jupiter are both viable investment prospects, but Rollblock is racing towards its listing date like a GambleFi project on a mission. It has already raised over $9.8 million, is available for $0.052, and the next price increase is coming up rapidly. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock(RBLK) presale today!

But the new altcoin Rollblock (RBLK) stands head and shoulders above them, all thanks to its passive income benefits. Let’s discover why crypto analysts tout astronomical profits for this GambleFi presale gem. With a unique blend of gaming and DeFi, Rollblock offers users a fun yet rewarding way to earn passive income. Rollblock (RBLK) draws ETH whales with a 30% APY This Ethereum-based GambleFi protocol supports a massive token buyback and burn program from a share of its weekly gaming revenues. Sixty percent of the repurchased tokens are burned out of supply, lowering the RBLK supply to bolster its market price. The rest are paid out to RBLK token holders as a weekly dividend, with investors receiving up to 30% APY! Rollblock’s clever revenue-sharing strategy and deflationary tokenomics have drawn serious attention from crypto whales. The accumulation spree has pushed RBLK’s price up 420% in presale as investors bless the ICO with over $9.8 million. Analysts predict this new altcoin to pull an additional 420% increase before the ICO concludes, and might explode over 50x once the project debuts in the open market. Ethereum community sentiment turns 31% bearish During the Q4 altcoin season, ETH dropped the ball at $4,107, around the same zone where it had encountered rejection early last year. Failure to break above this zone has created a negative climate in the Ethereum community as 31% of investors turn bearish. In the past month, ETH crumbled nearly 5%, reducing its year-to-date gains to a disheartening 39%. Recently, ETH has been struggling to hold above $3k, dropping to $2.9k at one point. Algrorand predicted to post stable price action At the $0.37 zone, ALGO is trading with a serious crash from its recent high of $0.61. However, that’s a dazzling 4.5x return for those who piled into ALGO at its $0.082 bear market low. Though ALGO might appear a hemisphere away from its 2021 highs of $2.9, the altcoin has been making progress lately. In the past month, ALGO is up over 15%, increasing its yearly yields to 124%. Per CoinCodex Algorand price forecast, ALGO is expected to post stable price action throughout the year in the $0.3-$0.6 zone for a potential 60% yield. Raydium (RAY) could hit $34 this year After hitting an ATH of $17 during the 2021 altcoin season, RAY crumbled to lows of $0.13. But RAY has been in an uptrend through last year, rising to reach a high of $8.7 in January. Year-to-date, RAY was up over 460% after climbing over 49% in the past months alone. This spectacular price performance comes as Raydium grows into the largest DEX on Solana, controlling more than half of the ecosystem’s DEX trading volume. CoinCodex’s RAY price predictions spell further progress for the altcoin. RAY is forecasted to skyrocket over 370% in 2025 and could reach a new ATH of $34. Load your RBLK bag now Only about 65 million RBLK tokens are up for grabs in stage 10. ETH investors are among the top whales scooping this presale gem at the $ 0.052 bargain price before it rolls to $0.065 in stage 11.

His analysis emphasizes that RLUSD is not merely a stablecoin but a foundational element in a larger strategy aimed at integrating traditional financial markets with blockchain technology. King outlines a multi-phase plan that could position XRPL as a central infrastructure in the tokenization of financial assets, potentially bringing trillions of dollars onto the network. Most people do not understand the impact $RLUSD will have on the $XRP Ledger. If you think this is just about a stablecoin — you're missing the scale of this opportunity by over 1,000x. Here is the actual strategy that Ripple is pursuing and the impact it will have on $XRP : pic.twitter.com/3x2maDE84g — Austin King (@0xASK) January 31, 2025 RLUSD and Its Early Adoption According to King, RLUSD is already demonstrating strong adoption, with daily transaction volumes exceeding $300 million. Furthermore, multiple teams are working with OMNI, an interoperability protocol, to integrate RLUSD into their platforms. This early traction suggests that RLUSD could play a significant role in driving liquidity and utility within XRPL. Beyond RLUSD, King highlights the recent announcement by Ondo Finance , which has chosen XRPL as the platform for launching tokenized U.S. Treasury bills. This development represents a shift from stablecoins to more complex financial instruments, marking the beginning of a broader tokenization strategy. Ripple’s Four-Phase Tokenization Strategy King explains that Ripple’s strategy for integrating traditional finance with XRPL follows a structured progression. It begins with the launch of RLUSD , which serves as a proving ground for XRPL’s tokenization technology, demonstrating its efficiency, security, and usability. RLUSD is an entry point for financial institutions, encouraging them to explore the network’s potential. Once this foundation is established, the focus shifts to expanding tokenization to low-risk assets, such as U.S. Treasury bills. This move introduces a multi-trillion-dollar market to XRPL and signals growing institutional confidence in the ledger’s ability to handle regulated financial instruments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As adoption increases, the next phase involves tokenizing debt and equities, including corporate bonds and stocks. With a global market valued in the tens of trillions, this step represents a significant advancement toward mainstream adoption. The final stage of the strategy brings more complex financial instruments, such as derivatives, onto XRPL. Given that the global derivatives market is estimated to be worth hundreds of trillions, this expansion presents a substantial opportunity. By following this phased approach, Ripple aims to position XRPL as a critical infrastructure in the on-chain financial ecosystem, driving large-scale institutional adoption and asset tokenization. The Role of OMNI in Expanding XRPL’s Reach King points out that OMNI will play a crucial role in ensuring that tokenized assets on XRPL can be utilized across different blockchain networks. This interoperability is essential for driving adoption, as it allows institutions and users to access liquidity and financial products seamlessly across various platforms. He describes a “flywheel effect” where the more assets XRPL tokenizes, the greater the incentive for institutions to join the network. This, in turn, fuels further adoption and increases the overall value locked within XRPL. If Ripple successfully executes this vision, XRPL could become a key player in the tokenized economy, bridging the gap between traditional financial markets and the digital asset ecosystem. The potential scale of this transformation, as King emphasizes, is far greater than what many currently anticipate.

Gert van Lagen observed that Bitcoin is signaling a breakout from a long-term bullish “megaphone pattern,” which indicates the possibility of reaching a record high of $271,000, as he noted in an X post on January 30. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Gert van Lagen The megaphone pattern, formed on the two-week chart, is characterized by widening price swings with higher highs and lower lows, with an upper resistance trendline around the $120,000 level. According to the analysis, if Bitcoin successfully breaks above and retests $120,000 as support, BTC will likely clinch a new record high, with $140,000 to $150,000 as a potential intermediate resistance. If the pattern fully plays out, Bitcoin could then target the $271,000 level. Bitcoin’s path to $100,000 Another analyst , Captain Faibik, shared a similar outlook in an X post on February 1, suggesting Bitcoin is poised for further growth. He noted that $120,000 remains a key resistance level in the short term, based on Bitcoin trading within an ascending triangle formation on the daily timeframe. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The $106,000 zone is a key resistance level, repeatedly tested and crucial for Bitcoin’s upside. A decisive breakout could drive a surge to $120,000, while failure may lead to consolidation or a trendline retest. Bitcoin’s fundamentals Despite analysts maintaining a long-term bullish outlook, Bitcoin has experienced short-term bearish momentum amid geopolitical uncertainties. Risk assets, including Bitcoin, recorded capital outflows after President Donald Trump pushed forward with his proposed tariffs. Specifically, starting February 1, the White House announced a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada. This downturn added to Bitcoin’s challenging week after the cryptocurrency was caught in a broader market selloff triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI model DeepSeek, which led investors to reassess big tech’s investment in AI infrastructure. At the same time, Bitcoin struggled to push further above $100,000 despite bullish news, such as a report indicating that the Czech National Bank approved a proposal to explore investing in BTC. It would be the first central bank to hold BTC reserves if implemented. This development comes as European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is cautious about Bitcoin investments . Other market players, such as prominent cryptocurrency trader Michaël van de Poppe, remain confident that digital assets will likely see further upside despite the recent bearish momentum. #Bitcoin makes a 2-3% drop on tariff news. $ETH continues to show strength. I shouldn’t worry about this news, ultimately it will lead to higher crypto prices anyways. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 31, 2025 Historical Bitcoin price movements also support the bullish outlook. With Bitcoin ending on a high note in January, February has traditionally been one of the strongest months for the leading digital asset. According to data, BTC has recorded an average return of 14.4% for the second month of the year. If history repeats itself in 2025, Bitcoin could trade near the $120,000 level.

However, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggests that Litecoin could be approved for an ETF before XRP. If approved, the ETF would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and would provide investors with exposure to XRP without the complexity of direct asset ownership. The Grayscale XRP Trust currently has approximately $16.1 million in assets. “As an innovative and forward-thinking asset manager, Grayscale is committed to continually identifying opportunities to deliver products that meet client demand and expand investors’ access to digital assets and the broader DeFi ecosystem,” said Dave LaValle, Global Head of ETFs at Grayscale. Grayscale’s filing comes amid a surge in cryptocurrency ETF applications following the election of Donald Trump, whose administration is expected to take a more positive stance on the industry. Other firms are also hoping to take advantage of the expected regulatory change, with Solana, Dogecoin and Litecoin ETFs recently filing. Related News: Ripple Finally Publishes Its Last Quarter Official Report - Here's What You Need to Know Crypto advocates are closely monitoring the appointment of Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to chair the SEC. A known supporter of digital assets, Atkins is expected to take a softer approach to securities enforcement than former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Despite the excitement over the XRP ETF, Bloomberg’s Seyffart warns that regulatory hurdles remain. Ongoing SEC lawsuits allege that XRP is a security, which could delay ETF approval. “There’s still more work to be done on this issue that doesn’t necessarily have to happen with something like Litecoin,” Seyffart said, adding: “The SEC has never called Litecoin a security, so I wouldn’t be surprised if you see Litecoin come first.” If confirmed as SEC chairman, Atkins could drop or resolve lawsuits against XRP, potentially paving the way for an ETF, though the timeline for such a move remains unclear. Despite regulatory concerns, Ripple President Monica Long remains confident in XRP’s ETF prospects. In a recent Bloomberg interview, she stated that an XRP ETF is “in the pipeline” and could be approved “very soon.” *This is not investment advice.

Investors Think They Have Found The Next XRP,https://nulltx.com/can-ripple-xrp-justify-its-3-price-tag-investors-think-they-have-found-the-next-xrp/,"Ripple has been that name that has been making headlines for months. This cross-border remittance giant has revolutionized payment for years, but its legal woes kept it under the shadows. Until the breakthrough came in 2024! XRP price followed with a roaring 700% rise to a 7-year high above $3 – outpacing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies and institutional adoption further bolster its case. But with volatility ever-present, the question remains: Can XRP justify its $3 valuation, and will it hold? Is there another underdog that could outperform as the best crypto to buy now? Let’s find out. XRP price at $3: What Ripple’s resurgence back to 7-year high mean The XRP price shattered expectations when it exceeded $3 and reclaimed unseen levels since its post-debut run in 2018. Its remarkable 700% surge over the past year has outpaced many altcoins and even the red-hot Sokana. The pivotal moment came in August 2024, when Ripple secured a legal victory against the US SEC. Trump’s election victory and pro-crypto stance compounded the XRP price rally. The political developments signaled a shift in the US government’s stance on crypto regulation. But beyond politics, XRP price’s fundamentals are stronger than ever. The recently launched RLUSD stablecoin has added more utility and demand for XRP. XRP Ledger’s expansion of its smart contracts also attracted developers and institutional interest. This went hand in hand with the growing speculation around a potential XRP ETF approval this year. The legal breakthrough made Ripple more attractive to banks for CBDCs and cross-border payments. Recent news revealed that 80% of Japanese Banks will start using Ripple’s ledger technology this year. With regulatory clarity, high-profile institutional adoption, and bullish technical indicators, XRP’s rally to $3 may only begin a much larger breakout. New PayFi protocol toe in line as the best crypto to buy now The XRP price’s landmark breakthrough had investors doubting its potential, biting their nails. The utility is second to none, and the potential is massive. The boat has set sail, but the new Remittix PayFi protocol offers a golden second chance. Like Ripple, Remittix offers an innovative and user-friendly cross-border payment solution that facilitates the global transfer of over 40+ crypto assets into fiat currencies. Remittix is even better. It offers a regulatory-compliant solution to bridging the gap between individuals and banks. Its PayFi API solution, like the XRP Ledger, offers ingenious enterprise-grade remittance that offers e-commerce-friendly payment solutions for institutions. Since its launch, many analysts have touted Remittix as the best crypto to buy now. Its strong emphasis on user security and transparency is still unmatched. It leverages Ethereum’s DLT while concealing transaction parties. The mission is to democratize global payments, and Remittix is proving to be a game-changer. Its ongoing presale has raised over $10 million, a testament to retail and institutional support for its Ripple-inspired solution. Conclusion XRP price’s stunning rise above $3 made it the market’s dominant force this year. However, while XRP’s future looks bright, a new regulatory-compliant contender, Remittix, is gaining traction. Its innovative upgrade to Ripple’s dream positions Remittix as the game changer that the global remittance market needs. As both projects show tremendous promise, the crypto space is set for an exciting and competitive future.

Ethereum news is fair to middling at best. But it could be worse, though. It could be Shiba Inu. Shiba is losing value faster than a golden retriever loses hair. Is there any respite for investors? Fortunately, yes. The new crypto Remittix is here to make up for Shiba’s losses, and then some! Remittix (RTX): New crypto introduces PayFi to the world There is nothing crypto cannot do if you just let it. Now, Remittix is solving a problem that is literally as old as the modern banking system: international payments. Somehow, the banking system is still stuck in the nineteenth century when it comes to global payments. They take forever, cost a fortune, and are bogged down in paperwork. Remittix is here to bring global payments into the twenty-first century: Remittix is a new crypto that allows its users to make crypto-to-fiat payments in any of over 100 fiat currencies almost anywhere in the world. Remittix bypasses the banking system, and now RTX holders can use crypto to make near-instant global payments at a fraction of the cost without the tedium of regulatory hoops. This is a literal game-changer. Remittix is issuing an era of new crypto possibilities, and its presale has already gained almost $10 million in liquidity. This one is going to go big. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum news makes disheartening reading Ethereum is lagging badly. The Ethereum news has not been great for months now, if not years. And sadly, it is not improving. This is ironic since Ethereum ERC20 tokens form the backbone of the cryptosphere. But the Ethereum news can get a lot better if it does just one thing: get rid of the insanely high gas fees. The Ethereum news remains bad because the gas fee issue remains a problem. There is no reason for Ethereum to operate like it is 2017 anymore. Surely, Ethereum should have taken care of the gas fee issue in its several updates. When they do, it may start being competitive again instead of losing market share to every new crypto that comes along. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The end of meme coin madness kneecaps Shiba Meme coins need to be recognized for the insane profits they have shown, but the thing about meme coins is they have zero utility or intrinsic value. Community sentiment can only drive one so far. Shiba Inu had a good run. Shiba Inu was responsible for the greatest profits we’ve ever seen until Pepe took the crown. Shiba Inu even had a resurgence in the Trump pump, giving renewed hope of even more gains. But the era of meme coins is over. It was a good run, but Shiba is now sidelined for tokens with actual utility and a solid use case. Sentiment may bring some profits back to Shiba, but it’s nothing one can count on, not when new cryptos like Remittix can carry real results. Conclusion Despite the Ethereum news looking disheartening and Shiba losing popularity, there is still room for tons of market optimism. The new crypto Remittix leads the way with its PayFi system, and the investment opportunity here is massive. Remittix is now available in presale at $0.0521.

In fact, its ongoing presale pulled in so much interest that investors snapped nearly $10 million worth of RTX tokens in just months. Remittix is quickly becoming a dominant force in DeFi, but how does it stack up against top crypto performers such as Solana? Can this cross-border crypto coin rise to the challenge and compete with sturdy giants like Solana in the long run? One way to find out! Remittix growth: PayFi protocols crypto coin accrues almost $10 million in months Remittix’s comparison with Solana stems from its innovative focus and huge potential to revolutionize crypto payments. XRP already ousted Solana, and analysts are wondering if this new PayFi protocol could be the next. Since its launch, this top crypto payment protocol has rapidly gained attention for transforming cross-border transactions. Like Ripple, Remittix aims to offer a long-lasting solution to traditional banks’ inefficiencies and allow anyone to convert their cryptos into fiat for transfer quickly. Remittix’s PayFi solution allows individuals and businesses to bypass centralized financial systems’ inefficiencies, costly transactions, and long processing times. For businesses, Remittix provides an e-commerce-friendly Pay API for cryptocurrency payments with the flexibility to convert these into fiat. Its presale has raised over $10 million, and the RTX native token is at its heart. The token offers value-driven utility, including serving as the staking and governance token. As the ICO phase continues, RTX crypto coins are priced affordably at $0.0521, which is an attractive entry point for early investors. How does RTX stack up with Solana? Anatoly Yakovenko’s brainchild has changed DeFi and dApp development in unprecedented ways. Since its launch in 2020, Solana has proven the massive efficiency and scalability that innovative third-generation networks can achieve with its Proof of History consensus algorithm. Over the years, Solana has built on this innovation. Now, with recent technical and market developments, Solana is gearing up for what could be its most significant rally yet. Following Trump’s pro-crypto activities, Solana reached a new ATH of $294, with over 130% 12-month growth. Onchain performance has been impressive, too. TVL has risen to a whopping $11.3 billion from just $260 million at the height of the FTX collapse. The technical analysis complements the positive sentiment around this top crypto asset. A symmetrical triangle price pattern that suggests more upsurge is gradually playing out, and we could see this top crypto performer ride the wave to a new ATH of $330. Beyond the technicals, Solana has also been at the focal point of institutional interest as the next in line for spot ETF approval after BTC and Ethereum. Currently trading near $240 psychological support, Solana’s strong market position positions it for a strong rally soon. Conclusion Remittix continues to gain traction as a disruptor of global payments. With a unique PayFi solution, growing adoption, and a token presale that has already raised millions of dollars, Remittix is certainly making its mark. However, the question remains: can it go toe-to-toe with blockchain titans like Solana? Remittix’s innovative approach to cross-border transactions and strong community backing suggest that it surely could.

The Bears have tried hard to restrict the rally each time the price tried to set up a strong ascending trend. As a result, the DOGE price remained consolidated below $0.1 for a long time. However, after the latest upswing, a new ATH appeared to be imminent, but the current trade setup suggests a 20% pullback is fast approaching. DOGE Price Following PEPE’s Footsteps After Dogecoin & Shiba Inu, Pepe managed to attract massive attention and, in a very short time, became the third largest memecoin as per the market cap. Since then, the PEPE price has been displaying progressive moves. Meanwhile, the pattern that Dogecoin has been following in the past few months has been followed by PEPE. This hints towards a probable pullback if the top memecoin closely replicates the PEPE price rally. Source: X The above charts show a comparison between both price patterns, which suggests DOGE price is closely following the PEPE price that consolidated around the ATH for a while. Meanwhile, the price failed to defend the support around $0.000017, causing a 30% pullback to reach the local bottom close to $0.0000114. Currently, the DOGE price has reached local support and if the bulls fail to initiate a rebound, it may face a 20% pullback. What’s Next for the Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Rally? After the latest pullback, the Dogecoin price has dropped below the ascending trend line, which has been acting as a strong support. Moreover, the price is failing to recover the lost levels, which may raise concerns over the next price action. Hence, the DOGE price seems to be primed to lose support at $0.3 very soon. As seen in the above chart, the DOGE price is facing increased upward pressure that may drag the levels towards the support zone between $0.29 and $0.309. As the RSI is decremental and below the descending trend line, bearish targets have been activated for the price. Therefore, the DOGE price is expected to plunge below $0.3 and reach $0.246 at 0.382 FIB. This could be when the RSI may reach the lower threshold. If the levels trigger a rebound, the Dogecoin price may rebound and rise back above $0.3, else a drop to $0.2 could be imminent.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|PEPE|SHIB|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 12:07:27

Analysts are tipping Remittix, a new PayFi project to offer life-changing gains soon. This new project claims it can deliver a 100x rise, beating out older coins with its everyday use cases. As a result, investors are turning to Remittix in search of profit. The new PayFi project promises huge gains in the 2025 bull run. Shiba Inu Gains Despite Challenges Some believers stick to Shiba Inus, which had a minor decline over the past few days but still has a growth of 122% over one year. Often known as SHIB, Shiba Inu once surged massively thanks to community zeal and hype. Although fresh tokens show up frequently, many devoted users consider them as their main meme tool. They question if this latest meme coin crossover would link Shiba Inu with other coins for further profits. Although Shiba Inu is still susceptible to market swings, critics claim, enthusiasts continue to hold SHIB in hopes of yet another run. While some investors also consider other meme coins, a rising number focus on Remittix (RTX), believing it would surpass more established coins. Shiba Inu might need newer features that challenge the practical approach Remittix presents if it wants to keep up. Pepe Attracts Holders Eyeing Bigger Gains Many Pepe supporters have also held strong even following an 11% decline in the past week. Pepe, sometimes known as PEPE, gained notoriety for unexpected price swings that paid out early buyers. Nowadays, viewers refer to it as one of the most popular meme currencies, although they also observe that online buzz drives it largely. If a superior coin shows along, this kind of buzz can vanish fast. This meme coin crossover allows some Pepe holders to see a connection between meme coins and useful tokens. They have started turning toward Remittix, or at least investigating it. Pepe (PEPE) has competition from coins that address actual issues even if it might still soar once more. Observers claim that unless Pepe adds additional value, tokens like Pepe may lose momentum if whales donate money to new projects like Remittix. Pepe and Shiba Inu Holders Rush to Invest in Remittix For Huge Gains Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with FIAT transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into FIAT currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients’ bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and FIAT, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ FIAT currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform’s open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0521 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth, with a 25 x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 1,500 % gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with high growth potential at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal the success of other top altcoins but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis and evident market demand.

The demand for new crypto projects with real-world applications has skyrocketed, and RTX is at the center of attention. With the ADA price rallying after the Plomin hard fork, investors are looking for the next big opportunity. The burning question remains: can RTX deliver 10,000% gains? Cardano’s Latest Upgrade and Governance Recent Cardano news has been filled with excitement following the activation of the Plomin hard fork, which introduces a fully decentralized governance model. This upgrade gives ADA holders direct voting power, marking a shift toward full decentralization. As the Cardano news highlights this significant milestone, whale investors are making bold moves, increasing their ADA holdings in anticipation of future gains. The ADA price movement is becoming a hot topic, but new crypto projects are proving to be the real disruptors. One of them, Remittix, offers instant FIAT transactions with zero hidden fees, and investors are going big on the project. Why Remittix (RTX) is Outpacing Traditional Crypto Payment Networks With the Remittix presale token now priced at $0.0521, market analysts are drawing comparisons between RTX and previous high-gaining tokens. But unlike many other new crypto projects, RTX solves a major issue: high transaction costs in global remittances. How RTX Works: Users enter the recipient bank details into the Remittix platform. Specify the amount to transfer, with transparent fees displayed. Send crypto to a unique deposit address for instant conversion. The recipient receives FIAT in their bank account within 24 hours. Traditional platforms like Stripe and Wise charge excessive fees and require multiple intermediaries, while Remittix offers a direct payment structure. The ADA price momentum has helped highlight RTX’s market potential, with investors seeing Remittix as a practical financial solution rather than a speculative asset. Cardano Whale’s Involvement: What It Means for RTX Rather surprisingly, one notable Cardano whale recently put some big money in the RTX presale. Typically, large-scale investors, or “whales,” often drive market sentiment, influencing retail traders to follow suit. With Cardano’s governance overhaul and ADA price climbing, this whale’s move suggests belief in RTX’s growth potential. Can RTX Token Deliver 10,000% Gains? Historically, new crypto projects with real-world applications have yielded astronomical returns. With the Remittix presale token expected to sell out in weeks, its growing adoption signals a potential 100x move post-launch. Unlike ADA price movements, which are tied to network upgrades, RTX’s value is directly connected to remittance volume. Remittix operates in a market worth $190 trillion, with daily SWIFT transactions exceeding $5 trillion. If RTX captures even a fraction of this market, achieving 10,000% growth is a realistic target. The ADA price rally and Cardano news have drawn attention to DeFi projects, but Remittix is leading the shift toward crypto payments that integrate with real-world banking. Conclusion The crypto space is evolving, with Cardano whales making bold moves while new crypto projects like RTX capture investor attention. The ADA price surge is fueling speculation, but the real winner could be Remittix, which is solving fundamental issues in global payments. With the RTX presale token gaining traction, analysts see a clear path toward mass adoption. If its crypto-to-fiat solution continues to gain traction, 10,000% returns may no longer be a dream but a reality for early investors.

With VanEck’s bold prediction of a 326% surge in SUI price, alongside Ripple’s expanding global partnerships, investors are eyeing these assets for massive gains. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange has become a hot topic, raising $13.2 million in presale and positioning itself as the next big disruptor in crypto trading. Let’s find out what’s behind this. Why XRP’s Growing Network Is Bullish for Investors According to thorough research published by prominent asset management firm VanEck, the SUI token may rise 326% from its current price of about $3.75 to $16 by the end of 2025. VanEck’s bullish forecast is supported by recent market data. SUI has performed well in the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume over the last 100 days, coming in at number four behind well-known competitors Solana, Ethereum, and Arbitrum. In terms of market interest, the SUI blockchain network has also significantly increased. SUI is the third most searched network on the internet, behind Solana and Ethereum, according to Google Trends data, suggesting that the SUI is becoming more and more well-known. SUI’s market position has been significantly influenced by its technical abilities. The network includes features including Local Fee Markets, Pilot Fish, and Fast Path, which VanEck analysts say provide benefits over competitors in the industry. SUI is currently trading at $4.23, up 1.2% from recent lows. By keeping support above the $3.5 mark, which experts consider to be a critical demand zone, SUI has demonstrated strength. SUI’s Explosive Growth: Could It Hit $16 by 2025? Ripple (XRP) has been one of the best-performing currencies recently, particularly in the last few months, when it had some of its largest gains in years. While Ripple (XRP) continued price swings indicate that it will soon surpass the current $3.40 all-time high (ATH), the growth in Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) partnerships will send it substantially higher. Ripple (XRP) is presently partnered with over ten global institutions, including Santander, American Express (AMEX), and MoneyGram, to mention a few. However, Ripple Labs has announced its expansion into Japan, with over 80% of institutions expected to embrace Ripple (XRP) this year. The well-known crypto researcher Dark Defender predicted that Ripple (XRP) is expected to achieve the $6 milestone this year, especially given the vast network growth.

Therefore, with billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) liquidity about to flood into other projects, finding the best crypto to buy right now should be on every trader’s mind. Better yet, there are still several promising new cryptos yet to realise their full potential. For example, projects like Pikamoon (PIKA) are not only set to flip the GameFi market into orbit, but also the net worths of its early Pika Army adopters. Whilst you may be eager to get into our list of the top 3 crypto for alt season, let’s first explain why exactly February 2025 is the time to be investing in the hottest new cryptos. February 2025: The Best Time to Buy Cryptocurrencies The same experts that predicted a post-inauguration slump are now expecting a bounce back like no other in February, marking the beginning of this cycle’s altcoin season. With Bitcoin now looking comfortable above $100,000 once again, it’s thought that the OG crypto project is about to hit its all-time high (ATH) for this cycle. As a result, if history were to repeat itself (which it always does regarding Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle), thousands of traders of the ‘non Maxi’ accord are set to ‘rotate’ their BTC profits into smaller cap coins that present larger pump potential . As we enter what many tout as crypto’s most bullish month since November 2021, here is where Pikamoon (PIKA), a completely doxxed project that represents crypto’s first AAA game, emerges as our favourite for huge gains. 3 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest in Today at Cheap Prices 1. Pikamoon : Tiny Market Cap Token Destined For Mass Adoption Yat Siu, one of the biggest Web3 venture capitals in history, touts 2025 as the year for GameFi to turn around. With a pro-crypto government at the helm, this year marks a period of significant maturity compared to the wild antics of 2021. For example, as witnessed at the London Blockchain Conference in 2024, serious financial heavyweights are now entering the blockchain gaming space. As a result, GameFi is receiving more and more interest as the days pass by, with the space’s biggest bear market AAA builders set to reap the largest rewards. . This is where PIKA comes in as GameFi’s leading candidate for pumping in terms of adoption and token price amid the influx of fresh altcoin investment interest. How a Little PIKA Investment Can Turn Into Massive Returns To get to grips with the industry-leading building of its Asian developer Orbit Cosmos, we will let the Pikamoon X and YouTube accounts do most of the talking. Brief Players are tasked with saving humanity from extinction on planet Dreva by capturing, taming, training, and upgrading its native population of Pikamoons. Web3 game with Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanics built on Unity 6 (AAA-standard).

Ambitious AAA-standard roadmap developments, planned up until Q4 2026 (see image below). Based in Islamabad, giving Orbit Cosmos vast arbitrage and overhang advantages over its GameFi competitors. PIKA: The Next AXS As a result of the bullish features mentioned above, we invite you to find a superior – if not equivalent – GameFi project as we enter the 2025 bull run. Pivotally, the same could’ve been said for Axie Infinity (AXS) before the 2021 bull run, as with stark similarities regarding its standout AAA-standard gaming project, Orbit Cosmos and PIKA are set to replicate what Sky Mavis and AXS achieved last time out. For context, AXS surged from $0.20 in January 2021 to an astonishing $154 by November 2021. representing meteoric 26,900% gains. As AXS did back then, PIKA is poised to reap similar gains amid its industry-leading game experience and in-game economy. Again, we’ll let the project’s social media do the talking on this one. 2. Floki (FLOKI) — From Memecoin to GameFi Prospect FLOKI has transformed significantly from its origins as a meme coin, emerging as a notable contender in the GameFi sector with its Valhalla metaverse. By 2025, Valhalla has expanded its ecosystem, introducing more intricate gameplay mechanics and enhanced blockchain incentives. In turn, scope for a FLOKI pump has expanded. FLOKI Highlights to Consider In 2025: Valhalla Enhancements: Continuous updates have introduced new levels, characters, and interactive features, making the gaming experience more immersive and engaging. Growing Transaction Volume: Following recent updates, FLOKI has seen a 30% increase in transaction volume, reflecting heightened user engagement and investment interest. Moderate Price Growth: Analysts anticipate a 10-15% increase in FLOKI’s price during the February rally, driven by its unique integration of gaming and cryptocurrency. 3. Decentraland (MANA) — A Virtual Worlds Pioneer Decentraland continues to lead the metaverse space by 2025, empowering users to create, own, and explore expansive virtual environments. It utilizes its native MANA token to facilitate transactions, land ownership, and the creation of unique digital assets. Key Highlights: Robust Creator Tools: Ongoing development of advanced tools for creators enables the building and monetization of unique virtual experiences, fostering a vibrant community of developers and artists. Increased MANA Demand: The integration of major brands and the expansion of virtual events have led to a 20% increase in MANA demand. Price Outlook: Experts forecast a potential 12-20% rise in MANA’s value during the February bull run. User Empowerment: Decentraland’s focus on user-generated content and decentralized governance ensures long-term sustainability and adaptability in the evolving digital landscape.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 105,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historic precedence, Bitcoin may peak in the second half of 2025. The analyst looks at how long it took Bitcoin to hit its peak in previous cycles, from the time BTC broke out of prior all-time highs to the moment it printed new market cycle highs. He says the range varies from as low as 250 days to as high as 329 days. “If history repeats, and we see a 250-day period from breaking old all-time highs to rallying to new all-time highs, that would mean that we could get a mid-July 2025 bull market peak. However, if we see things go the other way, and we see an extended period – just like in 2021 where we were rallying for 329 days beyond old all-time highs before we finally peaked in the bull market top – then 329 days would get us to late September 2025.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube The analyst notes that a late September Bitcoin peak would be about 550 days from its April 2024 halving, when miners’ rewards are cut in half. According to Rekt Capital, a September bull market crescendo is in line with previous cycles. “A 550-day bull market top after the halving, that would get us into September or October 2025, so this is very much in alignment, while still appreciating and acknowledging the fact that we see varying degrees of acceleration beyond breaking into price discovery. We see these variations across cycles, and they give us this range. And what’s interesting is that the accelerated cycle thesis means mid-July, and the extended-cycle thesis, so to speak, still leaves us with a traditional halving cycle peaking in late September or October 2025.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $102,439 at time of writing, down 2.7% in the last 24 hours. ?

However, Rollblock (RBLK) is hot on its heels as this disruptive gaming platform is being tipped to deliver astonishing 50x returns owing to its surging adoption and tiny valuation. Let the battle commence! Rollblock (RBLK) Adoption Hits Record Levels For Blockchain Gaming Platform Rollblock ( RBLK ) is still at a very early stage in its development, meaning that investors can take positions at this fledgling stage and watch their investments soar in value as Rollblock takes the Web3 gaming industry by storm in 2025. Rollblock has seen incredible adoption in recent months with December crushing it in terms of new registrations, which surged by more than 600% . This is thanks to the fully comprehensive Rollblock platform, which features more than 7,000 classic games as well as an innovative sports prediction league. Everything is powered by engaging AI technology and features a massively loyal community thanks to trailblazing live dealer settings and PVP leaderboards. Rollblock brings new levels of trust to this $500 billion industry thanks to its leveraging of the Ethereum blockchain. Each and every wager is recorded on the blockchain, meaning that gamers no longer have to trust centralized platforms to do the right thing. The RBLK token has introduced a deflationary revenue-sharing mechanism to ensure a falling supply over time. Each week, 30% of Rollblock profits are used to buy back and burn RBLK to increase the token’s scarcity. The remaining 40% is used to fund a lucrative staking reward program in which holders can earn up to 30% on their bags. Stage 10 tokens are selling rapidly at just $0.052 and the price is set to rise again soon. Dogecoin (DOGE) Up 4% On ETF Application News Dogecoin has gained 4% in the last day of trading to reach $0.33. In the past week, Dogecoin has fallen by 6% as the entire meme coin sector has seen heavy losses. But over a long time frame, Dogecoin investors don’t have much to complain about as they are still 2% up in the last 30 days. The stage is set for a bullish 2025 for Dogecoin as Bitwise recently put in the necessary paperwork to apply for a spot Dogecoin ETF fund. This would see Dogecoin follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin and Ethereum in being awarded its own standalone fund, which would track the Dogecoin price in real time and give institutional investors easy exposure without having to take on any custodial risk. Bitwise has chosen Coinbase custody as a proposed custodian for its Dogecoin fund, which is likely to give the SEC confidence as Coinbase has proved itself to be one of the most trustworthy players in the crypto space. Dogecoin could easily race past the $1 level to reach $5 this year if a spot ETF fund gets the greenlight this year. The Verdict Is In: Rollblock’s ROI Cannot Be Beaten Although Dogecoin is likely to enjoy a blinding year in 2025, it cannot hope to compete with the gains predicted for Rollblock (RBLK) this year. This is because Rollblock is about to enter an even more explosive stage of growth that could send RBLK to $1 in the coming months.

So far, the altcoin has moved sideways ahead of this big milestone, but let’s explore how high Pi coin will soar if the Pi Network mainnet launches tomorrow. The announcement of this Grace Period Deadline noted: “This change provides additional time for Pioneers to complete KYC verification and Mainnet migration , helping more members secure their Pi and contribute to the growing ecosystem.” The Pi network miners, also known as pioneers, were anticipating the end of the KYC process on Friday, January 31. After yet another delay, the new announcement mentions, “Note that the Grace Period is independent of Open Network timing . It is possible for Open Network to launch before or after the Grace Period ends, and the Grace Period rules will remain the same regardless.” However, the developers have previously hinted that the mainnet could launch in the first quarter . This involves the network moving from the enclosed mainnet to the Open Network. Although there’s at least a month or two before this happens, let’s explore how high the Pi Network price might go if the mainnet launches tomorrow. What are the implications of this highly anticipated event? Will the Pi coin price hit an ATH? Pi Coin Price Prediction if Mainnet Launches Tomorrow The Pi Network price offered by HTX has been a good proxy for the coin since 2022. For example, the coin soared to $100 in October as the KYC grace period deadline neared. It then imploded when the developers postponed the first deadline to December. The odds of another delay explain why the coin has remained in a tight range this week. The daily chart shows that the Pi Network price was trading at $43 on Thursday, where it has been in the past few days. This price is slightly above the ascending trendline that links the lowest sides since September last year. The price is also along the lowest point on November 28, December 20, and January 13. It has formed what looks like a double-bottom pattern. Also, it has formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. Therefore, the odds of the Pi Network mainnet launch will likely lead to a God candle that will push it to $100. Pi Network Price On the other hand, If the value of Pi drops below the ascending trendline at $37.8 will invalidate the bullish view. A key catalyst for this is if the mainnet launch is again delayed as has happened many times before. Key Pi Coin Price Levels to Watch The key Pi coin price levels to watch will be $100 and $28. A confirmation of when the mainnet launch will happen will validate the falling wedge chart pattern and push the coin higher, with the key point to watch being at $100. The mainnet launch delay will lead to a strong bearish breakdown, potentially to $29, its lowest level in 2024. Pi Network Mainnet Launch Details As noted above, the mainnet could go live in the first quarter of 2025, which means another month or two to go. Pi Network has likely achieved two of the three conditions needed for the mainnet launch to happen. Chances are that at least 10 million users have already migrated their coins to the mainnet. In a recent statement, the developers noted that the third condition of external factors was already achieved. This leaves one condition yet to be met: mainnet-ready apps. The condition was that Pi needed at least 100 mainnet-ready applications. There are now about 80 of them, meaning that this condition may not be met. What is unclear is whether this condition alone will prevent the mainnet launch from happening. Regardless, the price consolidation and squeeze suggest a volatile breakout could be around the corner.

Rather than viewing this as a market negative, Kiyosaki plans to use any price drops as buying opportunities. In a recent tweet, Kiyosaki pointed to Trump’s tariffs as a catalyst for possible price declines in gold, silver, and Bitcoin ( BTC ). However, he emphasized that the real underlying concern remains the growing debt burden, which he believes will only intensify. TRUMP TARRIFS BEGIN: Gold, silver, Bitcoin may crash. GOOD. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is DEBT….which will only get worse. CRASHES mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 31, 2025 Kiyosaki sees a buying opportunity The author views market crashes as opportunities to buy assets at discounted prices, stating, “CRASHES mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer.” This outlook aligns with Kiyosaki’s long-standing investment philosophy and his previous market predictions. Earlier in January, he warned of a “giant market crash” while maintaining his bullish stance on alternative assets. He has consistently criticized the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and banking system for relying on money printing, arguing this practice benefits asset holders at the expense of dollar savers. You might also like: Elon Musk’s dad launches Musk It token, triggering Solana congestion Kiyosaki also discussed two economic principles he sees as key to Bitcoin’s power. He cited Gresham’s Law to explain how “bad money” in a system causes “good money” to go into hiding. Kiyosaki suggested that Bitcoin, along with gold and silver, push the U.S. dollar into this position. Additionally, he highlighted Metcalfe’s Law and the power of networks, comparing Bitcoin’s growing influence to successful business models like McDonald’s. Despite his prediction of a potential crash, Kiyosaki remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. He views market downturns as chances to accumulate assets rather than reasons for concern.

XRP ETF approval faces delays due to ongoing SEC lawsuits over its security status. Ripple’s Monica Long believes an XRP ETF could be approved soon, along with other crypto ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart has shared his thoughts on the possible approval timelines for crypto ETFs in the face of ongoing regulatory scrutiny. According to a Fortune report , Seyffart suggests that while an XRP ETF may see approval later, a Litecoin ETF could be the first to debut because Litecoin has not been registered as a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Still, multiple firms have filed applications for new crypto ETFs. Grayscale Investments recently filed with the SEC to convert its XRP trust into an ETF that would trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The trust holds about $16.1 million, giving investors access to XRP without requiring them to buy it directly.

If key resistance is breached, prices could climb even higher. At the same time, the Dogecoin (DOGE) value continues to be widely discussed, reflecting on instances where DOGE rose almost 900% within 48 hours. Amid these market dynamics, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining significant attention through its ongoing collaboration with Inter Milan, with the presale reaching over $191.5 million and 18.2 billion coins distributed. BDAG’s strategic partnership with a major soccer team enhances its reputation as one of the best crypto coins to buy right now. Will $700 Be The Next Milestone For BNB Coin? The Binance Coin (BNB) is on the rise again after finding support at $635. Market analysts suggest that the BNB coin could reach the $700 mark if it surpasses resistance around $685 and $692. The coin has rebounded from recent lows, and the hourly chart shows a positive trend above the 100-hourly simple moving average. BNB coin’s robust recovery, from a low of $637 to around $671, signals a potential return to its prior peaks. A breach of $700 could set targets around $720 or even $732. However, traders are wary as a fall below $668 could lead to another downturn for the BNB coin. Why Dogecoin Value is in Spotlight? The Dogecoin value is still a lively discussion point, as a recent comment from Ali ( @ali_charts ) mentioned it’s hard to dismiss Dogecoin after a nearly 900% jump in just 48 hours during 2021. Market analysts see a chance for a repeat performance, with current on-chain data showing significant whale activity. While DOGE’s value has recently declined slightly, some believe a resurgence is possible if overall market sentiment turns positive. Historical trends show sporadic, sharp increases, keeping the Dogecoin value in the spotlight for those speculating on its future. Critics point out the higher risk due to its meme-centric nature, but supporters cite past surges as indicators that dramatic rises are still possible. BlockDAG’s Impact Soars with Inter Milan Alliance, Presale Hits $191.5M! BlockDAG’s alliance with Inter Milan has catapulted blockchain into the global spotlight, captivating millions of soccer enthusiasts with the technology behind cryptocurrency. This collaboration has placed BDAG in a prime spot for significant expansion worldwide, fueled by the strong loyalty of Inter Milan’s fan base. The growth of BlockDAG’s community is notable—its Telegram channel now boasts 71.1K members, while its Twitter and Discord have swelled to 108.8K and 20K participants respectively. The partnership is hailed for significantly enhancing BlockDAG’s international profile, attracting both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers to its platform. This influx of diverse users is broadening the acceptance and integration of blockchain technologies. To date, BlockDAG has garnered over $191.5 million in its crypto presale, distributing more than 18.2 billion coins. With the coin priced attractively at $0.0248 and an impressive 2,380% ROI for early supporters, joining BlockDAG’s burgeoning community seems like a smart move. BlockDAG’s integration of mainstream sports with crypto has led experts to commend BDAG as the best crypto coin to buy currently. Speculations abound that further high-profile collaborations may be on the horizon, which could boost BDAG’s trajectory even further. With ongoing success, BlockDAG is poised to become a pioneer in linking sports sponsorships with blockchain innovation, setting the stage for even more achievements. Market Dynamics & Adoption Surge in Q1 The first quarter has brought a whirlwind of activity in the crypto sphere. The BNB coin is making strides towards crucial resistance levels, with traders keenly observing its potential to breach the $700 mark. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin value remains a hot topic of conversation, with its history of rapid price increases hinting at the possibility of another significant rally under the right market conditions. Alongside, BlockDAG’s continuous partnership with Inter Milan is proving to be a pivotal factor in boosting BDAG’s adoption, exposing it to millions of soccer fans worldwide. The crypto presale has rocketed to $191.5 million with 18.2 billion coins sold, signaling further growth ahead.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have long dominated the market, but in 2025, the rise of decentralized, automated, and community-driven projects could change the game. One such project gaining momentum is Skyren DAO. With its innovative automated airdrop rewards system, DAO governance, and integration with the Polygon blockchain, Skyren DAO has the potential to outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of user benefits, passive income, and decentralization. Skyren DAO is a newer cryptocurrency project that is designed to be faster, cheaper, and more rewarding for users. It helps people earn free crypto through automated airdrops, something neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum offers. It also gives users control over decisions through a community voting system. These features make Skyren DAO one of the most exciting crypto projects to watch in 2025. The Skyren DAO Telegram group is your space to interact with the community, receive direct help from the team, and access updates as they happen. By joining, users can stay connected with the latest developments and discussions around the project. What’s Wrong with Bitcoin and Ethereum? Even though Bitcoin and Ethereum are the biggest cryptocurrencies, they are not perfect. Bitcoin is a great store of value, meaning people trust it to hold its price over time, just like gold. But Bitcoin is not easy to use for things like payments or earning passive income. Sending Bitcoin can take a long time, and the transaction fees can be very high, making it difficult for small transactions. Ethereum is better for transactions because it allows smart contracts to run, powering things like NFTs, DeFi (decentralized finance), and dApps. However, Ethereum transactions can be very expensive. When the network is busy, simple transactions can cost hundreds of dollars in gas fees. Additionally, Ethereum’s development is controlled mostly by developers, meaning regular users have very little influence over how the system changes. Because of these problems, people are looking for better alternatives that offer lower costs, faster speeds, and more ways to earn money. Skyren DAO is one of the best solutions to these issues. Skyren DAO’s X page ensures users stay informed with real-time updates, important announcements, and all the latest news. By following, users never miss an update on new features, partnerships, and key milestones. How Skyren DAO is Different? 1. Automated Airdrop Rewards One of the biggest features of Skyren DAO is that it automatically finds and collects free airdrops for its users. 2. Lower Fees and Faster Transactions One of the biggest complaints about Bitcoin and Ethereum is that they are too slow and expensive. Skyren is built on Polygon, a blockchain known for its speed and low transaction fees. 3. Community-Driven Decisions Unlike Bitcoin, which is controlled by miners, or Ethereum, which is run mostly by developers, Skyren DAO is governed by its users. 4. Earn Passive Income Without Staking Many cryptocurrencies require staking, locking up tokens to earn rewards, which can be complicated and time-consuming. Skyren eliminates this hassle, and users earn a passive income simply by holding SKYRN tokens. Unlike Bitcoin, which depends on price increases, and Ethereum, which requires staking and gas fees, Skyren provides effortless rewards with no extra steps. Could Skyren DAO Become a Top Cryptocurrency? Skyren DAO has the potential to become one of the biggest crypto projects in 2025 by solving key issues in the industry. It automatically rewards users, eliminating the need to search for airdrops or stake tokens. Built on Polygon, it ensures cheaper and faster transactions compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Unlike networks controlled by developers or miners, Skyren empowers its community, allowing users to shape its future. Most importantly, it provides a simple way to earn passive income—just by holding SKYRN tokens. As more people seek easy and rewarding crypto opportunities, Skyren DAO could quickly become a top choice for both beginners and experienced investors. To stay informed on its latest news, key milestones, and community stories, Skyren DAO’s Threads keep users updated in one place. Don’t wait—grab your SKYRN now Conclusion Bitcoin and Ethereum have dominated crypto but face high fees, slow transactions, and no user rewards, making passive income difficult. Skyren DAO offers a better alternative with automated airdrop rewards, lower fees, and community-driven governance, making earning crypto easier. As 2025 nears, more users will seek rewarding cryptocurrencies, and Skyren’s simplicity and profitability position it as one of the top projects to watch.

According to data released by Alphractal, the search volume for Bitcoin on Google is decreasing and is far from the peaks seen in 2017 and 2021. According to the analysis company, the reasons for this data indicating that the public interest in Bitcoin is still weak may be as follows: The current cryptocurrency cycle may still not have captured the public's attention. People may not be searching Google for BTC anymore because they already know about Bitcoin. Additionally, the market focus may be shifting towards artificial intelligence (AI) or other new cryptocurrency trends. Related News: Former CFTC Chairman Talks About Official Trump (TRUMP) Token When we examine Google data, we see that the highest interest in Bitcoin searches so far was during the bull period observed at the end of 2017. When we evaluate the interest level at that time as 100, the current interest is around 30. At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at around $101,000. *This is not investment advice.

The Michael Saylor-founded firm announced on Jan. 31 that it had finalized the price of its perpetual preferred stock offering, which it will use to raise funds to buy even more of the foremost crypto. MicroStrategy Raises $584 Million Publicly traded MicroStrategy announced the pricing of its Thursday offering by selling 7.3 million shares of 8% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock, also known as STRK. STRK will go for a public offering price of $80 per share. MicroStrategy estimates the net proceeds from the offering will hit $563.4 million, which will go towards “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital.” The company’s founder and Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, said on X (aka Twitter) that it had upsized the perpetual preferred stock deal from raising $250 million to $584 million. The new pricing raises the dividend yield to 10% from an initially projected 8%, which is likely to boost investor demand. The perpetual strike preferred stock does not have a maturity date, and MicroStrategy will not have to redeem it later on, instead, it pays fixed dividends indefinitely. The offering will have a liquidation value of $100 per share. However, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based software firm, will have the right to redeem that stock in cash at its discretion. MicroStrategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Spree In October 2024, MicroStrategy unveiled a “21/21 Plan” to raise a whopping $42 billion — half through equity, half through debt— over the next three years to buy even more Bitcoin. Just last week, the company’s shareholders voted for a 30x boost to the number of authorized Class A common shares to help it fund its BTC purchases. The rationale is that with more shares on the market, there will be more sales and, therefore, more money to acquire Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has adopted an aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which began with a 21,454 BTC purchase in August 2020 via corporate cash. The Bitcoin-holding company currently has 471,107 BTC , worth an eye-watering $49.4 billion at the current price, with unrealized gains of more than $19 billion. Saylor is an unabashed Bitcoin evangelist. He even invented a novel financial metric dubbed BTC Yield — which is a unique performance metric assessing its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The tech entrepreneur has previously predicted that the premier crypto will rise up to a price of $13 million per coin over the next 21 years.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|STRK,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-01 13:06:30

Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Struggles To Break $4,000 Amid Mixed Market Signals Ethereum price is still experiencing selling pressure as it tries to recapture $3,500 after being pushed below this mark at the start of January. Although ETH has always been buoyed by February’s performance, the asset has lagged behind the rest of the crypto market, which added 6% to its capitalization, while Ethereum price shed 8%. From a technical perspective, Ethereum is bound within a falling wedge, which could indicate an upward breakout. Ethereum price breaking past $3,200–$3,220 could lead to a 35% bounce to $4,100, but $3,550 and $3,770 may act as hurdles. Looking into on-chain metrics, we can see that the buy-side is gathering momentum through higher ETH withdrawals and daily active addresses that have reached 588,782, the highest value of the year. Nevertheless, the $136.2 million of outflows in ETFs in the previous week is indicative of weak institutional interest. Source X Amid the bearish price trend, the upcoming Pectra upgrade aims to improve interoperability, but investor sentiment remains cautious. Analysts suggest Ethereum price must hold $3,000 to avoid a drop to $2,800 or lower. Optimism from this upgrade may subsequently set ground for a breakout past $4,000 could lead to new highs, with long-term targets near $6,770. Yeti Ouro (YETIO), A Promising Altcoin For Investors Seeking Growth While Ethereum is still trying to reclaim the $4,000 mark, Yeti Ouro is proving to be a great investment for those who want higher returns. This Ethereum-based token has gained popularity and has successfully raised more than $2.1 million thus far during the presale stage. The project has sold more than 153.2 million YETIO tokens and raised over $2.1 million, and this figure is still on the rise, indicating that investors are still keen on investing in the project.

Grayscale believes the $47.9 billion meme coin is no longer a laughing matter. Shortly after launching the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, Grayscale then filed a 19b-4 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert the trust into a spot DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. Grayscale Debuts Dogecoin Trust, Calls DOGE Tool For “Global Financial Inclusion” Grayscale has rolled out a new Trust providing individual and institutional accredited investors exposure to the canine-themed Dogecoin meme coin. Grayscale thinks Dogecoin is a potential driver of financial empowerment for underserved communities globally, not just a speculative crypto asset. “Grayscale believes DOGE has transitioned from a memecoin of a Shiba Inu to a tool for global financial inclusion, grassroots activism, and a reliable means of payment,” the firm stated in a Friday press release. “Due to its widespread accessibility, affordability, and rapid transaction speeds, DOGE has garnered significant adoption worldwide.” Like other Grayscale products, Grayscale DOGE Trust investors do not have to hold the meme coin physically in crypto wallets to benefit from its price movements in either direction. Grayscale Files Dogecoin ETF Registration The launch of the Dogecoin Trust, which charges investors a management fee of 2.5%, was swiftly followed by an application for the potential creation of a DOGE-based investment vehicle. The proposed ETF would give investors with Dogecoin exposure without requiring them to buy and hold the crypto themselves. In a Feb. 1 post on X, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart posited: “UPDATE: That was FAST. Grayscale launched a DOGE trust earlier today, and they just filed a 19b-4 to convert it into an ETF.” The price of DOGE has grown tremendously in recent months, primarily owing to President Trump’s election victory and the formal creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), helmed by longtime Dogecoin fan and technocrat Elon Musk. The new extra-governmental agency is reportedly exploring putting federal government systems of a public blockchain , with potential use cases, including tracking federal spending, managing buildings, and facilitating payments — though talks remain in their early stages. DOGE ETF Race Heats Up Asset managers have submitted a flurry of applications for memecoin ETFs, including those exclusively focused on Dogecoin. Bitwise recently threw its hat into the ring , filing for an S-1 registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list a DOGE ETF in America. As ZyCrypto previously reported , REX Advisers and Osprey Funds also jointly filed for an ETF that includes DOGE, among other meme cryptos. These filings come as interest in introducing ETFs for meme coins such as Dogecoin picks up pace.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin|Grayscale,EN,0,0,DOGE|BUSINESS|SHIB|SPONSORED|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-01 13:17:31

Against the backdrop of a staggering 1.1 billion SHIB tokens burn in January and recent ecosystem advancements, market watchers are highly bullish on the dog-themed meme coin. The meme coin’s price currently faces critical resistance at $0.00002, a key barrier to achieving further upside levels. Shiba Inu Price Brims With Optimism Amid Massive Token Burn Shiba Inu price’s long-term prospects remain optimistic, primarily attributed to the constant SHIB burns . According to the tracker Shibburn’s statistics, 1.16 billion tokens were burned in the month of January. Source: Shib Burn Tracker This marks a significant 37.52 million coins burnt on average per day. As a result, traders and investors remain bullish on Shiba Inu’s price amid the asset’s reduced supply, mirroring the law of supply and demand. Weekly Burn Surge Weighs In Further, the weekly burn rate for the meme coin was up by 2104.39%, highlighting the constant burns dealing a blow to the circulating supply. Notably, 1.13 billion tokens were burnt in the past seven days, aligning with the massive monthly burn. IS SHIB Price To $0.01 Possible Amid Constant Burns? At the time of reporting, Shiba Inu price witnessed a drop of nearly 2% and was trading at $0.00001875. Its intraday low and high were $0.00001858 and $0.00001964, respectively. The current price movement confirms the resistance point at $0.00002. Meanwhile, it’s noteworthy that the meme coin briefly topped this level in mid-January. However, the price is currently down 18% MoM. Nevertheless, a recent SHIB price analysis by CoinGape weighed further optimism in light of the massive burn. Despite the asset’s consolidation, constant supply reduction could aid the token in pushing above $0.00002, even paving the way for a run to $0.01. However, a $0.01 target remains out of the question for now, as also clarified by the SHIB community’s site . Nevertheless, the meme coin continues to showcase the potential to offer investors remarkable gains.

This led to distortion between retail and institutional holders in the market. The former is in decline, recording more sales to hold on to slight gains during the downtrend—bitcoin price trades at $105,122, with the total market cap gaining lost numbers. Retail Investors Increase Sell Pressure A new CryptoQuant market report shows surging Bitcoin inflows to centralized exchanges, lowering momentum. Among wallets targeting potential sales, retail holders recorded inflows of 6000 BTC to Binance. This short-term jittery follows wider macro factors, leading to a downward slope in U.S. tech stocks and digital assets. In the same period, whales moved 1000 BTC to other custodians indicating signs of long-term holdings. Overall, flows to exchanges point to a prevailing bearish market for crypto traders. Last year, Bitcoin retail investors showed slow growth as bulls’ dominance soared. Retail activities have dropped consistently, hindering chances of a cycle peak. Binance, the largest exchange by volume, also marked higher whale participation in the last 12 months, and with present factors, the status quo is expected. Binance trading activity remains a huge metric for ascertaining the market’s direction. “ The first chart shows that over the past month, retail investors on Binance have significantly increased their BTC deposits, reaching approximately 6,000 BTC. In contrast, the second chart highlights a completely different behavior from whales, whose BTC inflows to Binance have dropped by a factor of four, now sitting at around 1,000 BTC,” CryptoQuant wrote. Altcoins saw similar figures, with retail holders dumping assets at a higher rate. Some crypto whales capitalized on the dip and sell pressures to increase positions in altcoins. Institutional Traders Remain Positive After the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, traditional investors increased their market exposure. The new window became an easy gateway to add the asset, gaining a rapid price uptick. The past months saw the digital asset leader hit multiple all-time highs. Despite recent price corrections, whale accumulation has pushed the asset price above $105K, and bulls target a run above $115K. The United States markets hold prospects for the industry with incoming positive rules set to shape issuance and investor relations.

One of the biggest reasons behind this terrific growth has been the increased use of bots, especially on Solana. It’s worth noting that stablecoins are an integral part of the crypto economy, seeing as they simplify switching between different crypto assets. A growth in stablecoin’s liquidity means more and more people are being onboarded in the crypto industry, which is a hugely positive sign for the overall crypto market. All in all, it’d be safe to say that we’re on the cusp of yet another crypto bull run, which could be bigger and more rewarding than any we’ve seen so far. This is, therefore, the best time to invest in these 5 high-potential altcoins that could explode alongside crypto’s growth. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Overall Best Altcoin to Buy In 2025 As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the Solana network, Solaxy ($SOLX) aims to boost Solana’s utility by getting rid of several critical issues it has begun facing because of its popularity. These include the concerning frequency at which transactions get declined on the network, which is a result of too much congestion and limited scalability. Thanks to Solaxy’s multi-chain nature (it combines the best of Ethereum and Solana), it will be able to smoothen operations by bundling transactions through batch processing. This will not only result in higher throughputs but also reduce overall costs. Another reason to be bullish on Solaxy is the attention its presale has received from both retailers and whales. With over $17M raised in its ongoing presale, $SOLX’s current price of $0.001622 is an attractive entry point for early adopters. If you’d like some help through the buying process, here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $SOLX . 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Native Token of the Best Crypto Wallet Available Right Now Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of Best Wallet App , a well-rounded crypto wallet that exhibits serious potential of fulfilling its promise to control over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet industry by 2026. Best Wallet supports more than 60 blockchains, allowing users to manage almost all their crypto assets from a single platform. Additionally, you get the ability to execute easy and quick cross-chain swaps, thanks to a built-in decentralized exchange called Best DCS. $BEST token holders will receive an array of benefits within the Best Wallet ecosystem, including the right to vote on critical decisions regarding the project’s future. What’s more, you’ll also benefit from reduced transaction fees and early access to hyped and high-potential projects, as well as staking rewards of 197%. The $BEST presale has performed exceedingly well, with over $8.8M in funding at the time of writing. 1 $BEST is currently available for just $0.023825, and you can buy $BEST by either visiting its official presale website or directly from the Best Wallet App on your Android or iOS device. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Unlock Real-Time Investment Advice with Hive-Mind Analysis MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is one of the hottest crypto presales of 2025 , which is hardly a surprise seeing as it titillates not one but two high-potential segments: the AI space and finance bros. Plus, it carries the OG Pepe meme’s appeal, which is not to be taken lightly, either. $MIND is an AI agent that interacts with crypto enthusiasts and communities on platforms like X. Next, and the most interesting bit, is that $MIND is self-evolving; it scans everything that’s being said in the market, forms its own opinions, drives trends and conversations according to its bias, and identifies early-stage investment opportunities for the token holders. The MIND of Pepe presale is growing every minute, and it currently boasts over $4.7M in funding. The best AI agent coin is currently available for just $0.0032402, but interested investors should hurry up because prices increase in the next 40 hours. 4. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – Solana Meme Coin Based on Fart Jokes Fartcoin started out as a joke. After all, the whole idea that you can claim free tokens by submitting fart jokes is absurd, isn’t it? However, it doesn’t have to make sense to make you money – which should be the ethos of $FARTCOIN that now has a market capitalization of more than $850M. Make the mistake of thinking that $FARTCOIN is all fun and games at your own peril – it’s a ‘serious’ meme coin that hit all-time highs of around $2.40 early this year, jumping 300% in just two weeks, resulting in massive gains for early investors. Although Fartcoin is down quite a fair bit right now, the current price of $0.86 offers a discounted entry point for long-term investors. 5. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Meme Coin Twist to the S&P 500 Index If you thought Fartcoin had a weird theme, wait till you hear about SPX6900. With a market cap of over $1B, SPX6900 is an Ethereum-based altcoin that blends humor with finance, offering a meme coin twist to the S&P 500 index, which is one of the biggest and baddest stock market indexes in the world. Although you can argue that $SPX is all hype and no logic, there’s little to no room for debate about its potential. It’s up over 67,000% in the last year, and an active social media community (80K followers on X and over 19K subscribers on its Telegram ) means that there could still be room for more growth. Bottom Line Having mentioned the 5 best altcoins that could explode in 2025, it’s important to mention that the crypto market isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, and it can have its fair share of ups and downs as well. This is why you must be careful about how much you put into the market. Plus, you must do your own research (DYOR) before investing because that will give you the required confidence to stick with your bets.

Binance analysts see long-term potential as DeFi adoption and staking activity keep the network strong. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could push Bitcoin’s scalability forward with its new Bitcoin Layer 2 Technology to bring smart contracts and AI Powered Applications to the Bitcoin Network. Let’s break down Ethereum’s latest developments first. Ethereum Price Prediction – What’s Fueling ETH Growth Amid Concerns? Ethereum’s network activity is surging, with a record-breaking number of new wallets created in a single day. Over 206,000 new addresses appeared in just 24 hours, which marks the highest daily wallet creation since October 2022. Despite price fluctuations, this signals strong user demand and continued developer interest in Ethereum’s ecosystem. Institutional inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs are another major driver of market optimism. From January 21 to January 24, Ethereum ETFs saw $139 million in inflows, with BlackRock’s ETHA ETF pulling in the bulk of that at $135 million. This level of investment shows that institutional players still see Ethereum as a long-term asset, despite current market volatility. The Ethereum Foundation’s strategic moves are also shaping price action. The foundation recently sold 100 ETH at $3,078 per token, which adds to a total of 300 ETH sold in 2025. While some speculate about its impact on price, others see it as a strategic treasury management move to secure long-term stability. Technical analysis suggests Ethereum is consolidating, with key resistance levels at $3,200 and $3,500. If ETH pushes past these barriers, Binance analysts believe it could set up for another bullish run toward $4,000 and beyond. With a rapidly expanding network, strong institutional backing, and increasing staking participation, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain solid—even as traders watch for price volatility. Here’s How PlutoChain Could Add New Capabilities To Bitcoin’s Mainnet Bitcoin’s scalability has been a long-standing challenge, but PlutoChain could step in with a Layer-2 solution designed to make Bitcoin more efficient and versatile. One of PlutoChain’s standout features is its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. This means that Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols can now function on Bitcoin’s network. Developers can build and deploy smart contracts seamlessly, which might allow Bitcoin to tap into DeFi services, lending platforms, and NFT marketplaces that were previously limited to Ethereum and other Layer-1 networks. PlutoChain might improve Bitcoin’s transaction speed while maintaining its security by offering 2-second block times and supporting 43,200 transactions per day. This could make it more practical for real-world applications beyond simple payments. Security remains a top priority, and PlutoChain has undergone rigorous audits from SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi. These third-party evaluations ensure that the network is resistant to vulnerabilities and meets high-security standards, which could provide confidence to developers and enterprises looking to build on its Layer-2 framework. PlutoChain’s developer-friendly infrastructure provides scalable tools for dApps, decentralized finance, and cross-chain solutions. The Bottom Line Ethereum’s network growth continues to impress, even as price concerns linger. With increasing wallet creation, ETF inflows, and institutional adoption, ETH remains a dominant force in blockchain technology. If momentum holds, Ethereum could see significant upside in the coming months. Meanwhile, PlutoChain might redefine Bitcoin’s capabilities with its fast Layer-2 infrastructure, EVM compatibility, and AI-powered applications. PlutoChain could play a key role in expanding Bitcoin’s utility beyond simple transactions by enabling DeFi and smart contracts on Bitcoin.

The bank has completed a proof-of-concept for its fractional gold investment platform, UBS Key4 Gold, using ZKsync Validium, an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution. This is to enhance security, scalability, and accessibility for global users. UBS Key4 Gold and Blockchain Integration With over $5.7 trillion in assets under management, UBS is positioning itself to make a blockchain-based financial play. First based on the bank’s permissioned UBS Gold Network, which linked vaults, liquidity providers, and distributors, UBS Key4 Gold is now positioning to make a blockchain-based financial play. By adding ZKsync Validium, UBS hopes to enhance transaction privacy and scalability without sacrificing ease of trading. Off-chain data storage enables higher-throughput transactions while maintaining security. ZKsync Validium: Building up Financial Services Enabled by zero-knowledge proof technology, ZKsync allows for scalability and privacy of transactions. The L2 network is designed to process more than 10,000 transactions per second with considerable slashing in transaction fees. Alex Gluchowski, inventor of ZKsync, thinks that blockchain will have a central role in the financial world of tomorrow. “I strongly believe in the future that all finance will take place on-chain, and it is ZK technology which will drive that growth,” he said. UBS’ creation of a tokenized fund on Ethereum is its latest of various recent blockchain plays, continuing an integration of digital assets into the mainstream bank’s offerings. Driving Institutional Adoption Through Innovations in Privacy This is because institutional adoption has been slow due to concerns about privacy and transparency. At the FHE Summit 2024, Remi Gai, founder of Inco, reiterated on-chain, privacy-preserving solutions are key to attracting investors from institutional investors. “Institutions are still wary because of transparency issues. If we could create an experience similar to Web2, that could drive more liquidity and participation,” said Gai. Confidential computing solutions, such as fully homomorphic encryption, make it possible to process data in encrypted form without decryption , and this is a game-changer for financial institutions. Gai says that privacy-preserving blockchain technology could unlock $1 trillion of new capital and further accelerate institutional involvement in digital assets. While UBS continues with its blockchain explorations, the integration of ZKsync Validium is an indication of how traditional banking is moving toward decentralized financial solutions.",Blockchain|Regulation|ZkSync,EN,0,0,FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|ZK|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-02-01 13:28:56

The Senate City, County, and Local Affairs Committee of the state denied the measure by a 6-1 vote, thereby halting efforts to impose restrictions on mining operations situated within a 30-mile radius of military sites. Proposed Ban Addresses Environmental, Security Concerns The reason for the bill is that having big Bitcoin mining operations near military sites could cause energy problems and raise security issues. The lawmakers who supported the plan pointed to past examples where national security agencies found that foreign-owned mining operations, especially those connected to China, could pose major risks. The measure raised worries about noise pollution and high energy use, which some critics say could harm local neighborhoods and important services. If the law passes, it would immediately take away licenses for current crypto mining businesses in the banned areas. Shutting down operations in these areas might affect the growing crypto mining industry in Arkansas . The plan also had an emergency clause that highlighted the need to deal with these issues. However, this was not enough to convince lawmakers to move forward with the plan. Arkansas Maintains Its Crypto-Friendly Position Arkansas reaffirmed its relatively favorable posture toward cryptocurrency mining by rejecting the bill. Following the Arkansas Data Centers Act’s passage in 2023, the state has been perceived as one of the more hospitable regions for blockchain-based industries. By giving Bitcoin miners legal safeguards, this law ensured that they could continue to operate without fear of sudden regulatory crackdowns. By rejecting the proposed mining ban, Arkansas further establishes its position as a pro-crypto state and sets it apart from other areas that are implementing stricter laws pertaining to the digital asset sector. However, this ruling does not lessen concerns about cryptocurrency mining. This project’s possible national security risks, energy consumption, and environmental effects are still up for discussion. Some lawmakers might support different legislation that seeks to strike a balance between more security and unfettered mining operations. Discourse On Regulation Of Bitcoin Mining The defeat of the Arkansas bill is just one part of a more comprehensive national discussion. In May 2024, the Biden administration did not allow a Chinese-owned mining company to operate near a military base in Wyoming due to national security concerns. President Donald Trump has also stated that the US should focus on Bitcoin mining, saying that the country should lead in the cryptocurrency industry. Different points of view at the federal and state levels mean that the regulatory environment for crypto mining stays undefined. Arkansas’s ruling indicates, at least for now, the state is not ready to place strong limitations on the sector. But if environmental discussions and security issues get more heated, future legislative conflicts over Bitcoin mining could be just around the bend.

According to reports, the Tencent-backed lender wants to use its subsidiary to leverage the growing market in the city. The move was confirmed by an executive of the firm as it looks to establish itself in Hong Kong, a region that has long served as a virtual asset hub. Using its WeBank Technology Services that launched this month, the company’s executive, Henry Ma mentioned in an interview that the firm plans to be deeply involved in the developing Web3 infrastructure in Hong Kong . Ma also mentioned that the company is very open to the sector, as it wants to explore its full potential. He added that the city needs to create a friendly Web3 infrastructure, one which he believes will be a good fit for the company. WeBank pushes for Web3 expansion WeBank, founded by Tencent and other Chinese firms in 2014, is the country’s biggest digital lender and the 10th largest unicorn globally. According to a report by the Hurun Research Institute published in April, the firm is valued at 235 billion yuan ($32.4 billion). Outside digital banking, the financial institution also services the Blockchain sector, operating its open-source blockchain platform FISCO BCOS. According to a report by the company in December, the platform provides more than 500 use cases across several Chinese industries, including government services, education, and finance. In a statement by Ma, he mentioned that most of these industries use the blockchain application for data verification, noting that its true and untapped potential still remains in digital assets. Ma mentioned that blockchain’s role as a trusted enterprise database has limited value without the assets. “That’s why I think, with the technology we’ve accumulated over the years, Hong Kong offers us bigger opportunities,” Ma added. While China has been slow to adopt blockchain technology and has instituted a strict stance on crypto activities, Hong Kong has been consistent with its openness to the technology. The city has also received approval from Beijing to develop its crypto industry. Henry Ma discusses the firm’s areas of specialization According to Ma’s statement in the interview, WeBank will focus on some key areas that it wants to leverage. He mentioned areas like real-world assets, which will include the tokenization of physical assets. WeBank is also a member of the “architecture community” of Project Ensemble, a central bank digital currency initiative carried out by the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong. WeBank, in its quest for supremacy, will be going head-to-head with Ant Digital Technologies. The firm is a subsidiary of Chinese firm Ant Group, which owns the Hong Kong-based blockchain outfit Zan, a technology service that provides Web3 services. Ant Group also shares an affiliation with Alibaba Group Holdings, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms out of China. Aside from providing its digital banking infrastructure technologies to firms in Hong Kong, WeBank is also looking to cover firms and companies in countries and regions that are under the Belt and Road Initiative. According to an announcement last week, the firm entered into a partnership with Tencent-backed Fusion Bank in Hong Kong, and Hong Leong Bank in Malaysia. Ma added that the company presently has about 30 employees, with plans ongoing to expand the number to 100 before the end of the year.

But, there’s another project that could get traction in the DeFi space as well – NovaDEX , a new Solana-Based decentralized exchange. With its permissionless liquidity pools, staking options, and competitive rates, the platform might attract early adopters. Since its mainnet launch, NovaDEX has already processed 85,000+ transactions, which could bring more interest. Below, we’ll dive into the latest updates on Solana and NovaDEX. Solana Price Prediction: Can Solana (SOL) Reach $1,000 in 2025? Solana (SOL) is currently valued at $239, which reflects a 1.8% gain in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, SOL has declined 3.6%. The RSI sits at 50, placing SOL in neutral territory. Solana continues to make major moves, especially in DeFi and NFTs. Thanks to its high-speed transactions and low fees, the network has attracted a growing number of DeFi projects, which expanded its ecosystem and increased its utility. At Breakpoint 2024, the network introduced ‘Fire Dancer’ on the testnet, an alternative validator client capable of processing over 80,000 transactions per second. Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja believes Solana is on track to hit $1,000 by mid-2025, primarily due to strong technical indicators and growing momentum. NovaDEX: A New Decentralized Exchange That Could Bring Innovation, Flexibility, and Community-Driven DeFi Tools NovaDEX is a new decentralized exchange (DEX) that could introduce innovative DeFi features such as concentrated liquidity pools, yield farming, and staking options to Solana. Since its mainnet launch, the platform has already processed over 85,000 transactions, which shows strong early adoption. With around 1,900 users actively engaging, NovaDEX could play a big role in the Solana DeFi ecosystem. One of NovaDEX’s most promising features is its permissionless liquidity pool model, which could allow users to create liquidity pools for any supported token. This level of flexibility might set it apart from many traditional DEX platforms by giving users more control over their trading strategies. Additionally, the platform may provide competitive rates and lower slippage, and potentially higher APRs. Designed with ease of use in mind, NovaDEX could simplify DeFi activities such as token swaps, liquidity provision, and yield farming. Beyond trading, NovaDEX is committed to building a community-driven ecosystem. The platform plans to implement decentralized governance and give users the ability to participate in key decisions and contribute to its future development. Security is also a priority, as the platform has undergone a smart contract audit by QuillAudits to guarantee user asset protection and build trust. The NVX serves as a key part of the ecosystem — it unlocks access to various platform features and benefits. NVX has already achieved major milestones, securing listings on MEXC, Raydium, and Jupiter, all of which signal growing recognition. The Takeaway Solana continues to strengthen its position in the DeFi and NFT space, with institutional investment and network upgrades increasing adoption. Meanwhile, NovaDEX could make a name for itself in the decentralized exchange market on the Solana Ecosystem. With permissionless liquidity pools, staking, and competitive trading tools, the platform has already gained early traction. —————- Disclaimer: It’s important to note that participating in presales carries risks, including market volatility and potential project delays.

Still available at just $0.000085, analysts are tipping Dogizen as the next big crypto to boom this year—and the best part? You’re still early. But the window to buy into the undisputed blue chip of the lucrative Telegram gaming sector is closing fast. With the bull run of the ages just around the corner, you wouldn’t want to miss out on the next big crypto set to dominate the Telegram gaming niche this year and beyond. Telegram gaming poised to go BOOM in 2025 Few other narratives are as primed to explode this year as Telegram gaming. With analysts predicting the sector could be a major flashpoint for onboarding the next few billion users to the Web3 fold, Telegram gaming could be in line to smash all-time highs in capital inflows and valuation this year. Parabolic growth is well within the realm of possibility for Telegram gaming, given the social messaging app’s billion-strong user base and Telegram’s standing as the town square of crypto . The interest in Telegram gaming had the sector surge past a $1 billion total market cap in 2024—and that’s before the euphoria surrounding Trump’s reelection turned the market bullish. Paired with Telegram’s native crypto functionality requiring no downloads, consoles, or complicated steps to participate in gaming—plus an integrated crypto wallet—the ease with which Telegram onboards new users to crypto positions the sector to capture GameFi inflows as the GameFi grows at a 28.5% CAGR over the next decade . Dogizen primed to moon this year Dogizen’s competition, comprising 80% of the entire Telegram gaming sector’s market capitalization in the form of Hamster Kombat, Catizen, DOGS, and Notcoin achieved market caps of between $300 billion and $2.4 billion back in 2024. And that was despite suboptimal conditions in Q2 and Q3. With Dogizen’s position as the first Telegram ICO and microcap status, its native token DOGIZ could quickly turn in a 100x from its expected sub $10 million valuation upon launching. If Hamster Kombat, Catizen, DOGS, and Notcoin could surge to nine and ten-figure market caps, just imagine how much more Dogizen has to gain with its pioneering ICO within the easy reach of a billion users. Not to mention the fact that Dogizen is a strong candidate for a Binance listing. Tick tock: The first Telegram ICO is closing soon This is the first time Telegram users have been directly spoonfed with an ICO catering specifically to the Telegram gaming niche—the demand for the TON Ecosystem is real, and it’s rising all over the world. Dogizen is already in the middle of every Telegram gaming conversation with the success of its ICO, making it a mindshare minefield waiting to explode once it hits exchanges.

While some investors adopt the ‘buy and forget’ approach, it might not be ideal for the average trader. Taking out occasional profits becomes essential to invest in better opportunities to pay your bills. However, in a rally that never seems to stop, it can be hard to time your exit perfectly. Here are some tools that can help you plan your exits better. The Active Address Sentiment Indicator (AASI) maps the relationship between Bitcoin price and network activity. It measures the deviation between the two metrics, which is marked by the orange lines – the wider the gap between the two lines, the stronger the signal is deemed to be. As you can see in the image above, there were multiple exit signals during Jan 2021 and May 2021. The highest exit price was $63,000. The Fear and Greed Index is another useful exit indicator. Any value more than 90 depicts extreme greed among market participants. Usually, such times of greed are followed by sharp corrections. In 2021, the index suggested an exit at $14,000 when the value peaked at 95. Next is the Short-Term Holder MVRV, which compares the current Bitcoin prices with the average cost of short-term holders. This helps to arrive at a figure that shows the average unrealized profit or loss. The more this number rises, the higher the chances that a profit booking may follow, as short-term investors look to take home some gains. Usually, an unrealized profit above 66% suggests that a pullback is around the corner. Now, tracking these indicators on a regular basis can be overwhelming and may not be possible for everyone. This is where AI agents like $MIND of Pepe ($MIND) come in handy. What is $MIND? $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that interacts with various market participants and engages with influencers and communities on platforms like X to simplify the crypto information overload. In the process, $MIND generates actionable insights and signals for all token holders. This self-evolving AI agent helps sieve down the information overload and offers access to early trends and investment opportunities. Traditional tools, like the indexes mentioned above, are often lagging indicators and do not offer real-time information. However, $MIND converts real-time data, as new as milliseconds ago, into decision-making tools through hive-mind analysis. This gives token holders an early-mover advantage and identifies trends before they become mainstream. Why Can $MIND Be the Next 100x Token? AI agents like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) help participants stay one step ahead of other crypto investors. Unlike other meme coins, $MIND doesn’t just rely on the hype of a meme figure to churn out yields for investors. It offers all token holders actual, real-time, actionable information, which can actually make them profitable crypto investors in the long run. No wonder $MIND is being touted as the next 100x token after $DOGE and $PEPE. The project also boasts solid tokenomics. Out of the total supply of 100B tokens, 30% is reserved for the long-term development of the project. This depicts the long-term commitment of the developers. Furthermore, 15% of the token supply has been kept specifically for staking and community incentives. Visit the official $MIND website for more information. $MIND, the best AI agent coin , is currently in presale, where it has already raised over $4.7M. If you get in now, you can buy $MIND for just $0.0032402 each. However, with a price increase set to happen in less than 2 days, this can be your last shot at such a low price. All you need to do to purchase $MIND is connect your crypto wallet (we recommend Best Wallet) on the official $MIND presale website and ensure you have enough funds to complete the purchase. Next, punch in the number of $MIND tokens you want to buy and approve the transaction from your wallet.

Floki ( FLOKI ) dropped to a low of $0.0001135 in January, its lowest level since August last year. It was down by over 53% from its highest level in November. Floki’s decline was in line with the performance of other meme coins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), and Pepe ( PEPE ). The crash also occurred in a month when Floki incinerated more than 5.8 trillion coins. In the last three months, it has burned 2.46 billion tokens worth $330,000, and in the last twelve months, it has burned 100.9 million. Since its inception in 2021, Floki has burned 5.87 trillion coins, leaving those in circulation at 4.1 trillion. These burns happen when tokens are moved into an address that cannot be accessed. Their aim is to reduce the number of coins in circulation and boost their value. Floki also dropped despite some important ecosystem news. For example, the token was added into Coinbase, making it available to residents in New York. Coinbase also availed meme coins like Gigachad and Turbo to New York residents. Additionally, as shown below, two Floki whales continued to buy the dip as the coin fell. The second-biggest Floki holder bought an additional 214 million tokens, while another one acquired 253 million.

Valhalla is a play-to-earn game with over $43 million in treasury that will power its play-to-earn economy.

This is a highly bearish pattern made up of two peaks and a neckline, which is at $0.0002050. Floki’s other bearish pattern, a death cross, occurred when the 200-day and 50-day moving averages crossed each other. It has also formed a series of lower lows and lower highs. Therefore, more downside will be confirmed if the Floki price crashes below the key support at $0.0001135. This is a noteworthy price since it was its lowest point since July last year.

According to reports, Ripple whales have offloaded a staggering 70 million tokens recently, causing a slump in the asset’s price. In addition, it also comes as pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton recently hinted towards a potential XRP crash ahead. XRP News: Ripple Whales Offload 70M Coins The Ripple whales have stolen the spotlight with recent reports showing a massive dump by large investors. Top market expert Ali Martinez recently highlighted the dump trading strategy of the whales, which has ignited significant discussions in the market. According to Martinez, XRP whales have offloaded more than 70 million coins over the past few days, dampening the investors’ sentiment. Notably, this also comes in tandem with the recent dip in XRP price, signaling the cautious sentiment of the investors. Source: Ali Martinez, X Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton Hints At XRP Crash In a recent Thinking Crypto Podcast , Tony Edward asked pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton if he thinks that XRP ETF will be launched anytime soon. This comes amid soaring ETF applications for a flurry of altcoins this week, including XRP, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and others. Commenting on that, John Deaton predicted a potential crash for XRP, but not before a significant surge. Deaton cited the success of the Bitcoin Spot ETF, suggesting that Wall Street’s greed will drive demand for other cryptocurrencies, including XRP. Meanwhile, Deaton believes that XRP, currently the third-largest crypto asset, has a good chance of surpassing Ethereum, potentially reaching $7 or $8 before a downturn. Deaton’s comments offer a nuanced view of XRP’s future prospects, hinting at a short-term rally before a potential crash. Besides, his comment also echoes the sentiment of other experts, who recently predicted XRP to flip Ethereum ahead. XRP Price Dips Amid Despite Bullish Outlooks XRP price today was down over 3% and traded at $3, with its trading volume falling 7% to $4.3 billion. The crypto has rested between the $2.97 and $3.11 mark over the last 24 hours, signaling the cautious approach of the investors. Besides, XRP Futures Open Interest fell 3%, reflecting the current downturn sentiment in the market. However, despite that, experts remain optimistic about the future trajectory of the coin. For context, in a recent analysis, top expert Dark Defender predicted a potential XRP rally to $4 as long as it holds above the brief $3.07 support. In addition, it also comes after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted positive XRP news, which has further fueled market confidence. Having said that, it appears that XRP is poised to hit new highs in the coming days. Despite that, investors remained cautious given the recent XRP whales dump and John Deaton’s hint towards a potential crash ahead.

If the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves, the fund will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The successes of Bitcoin ETFs led investors to altcoin products in an attempt to replicate inflows. XRP bulls reacted positively to the news, but wider crypto sideways trading hindered more gains. XRP Is Close To An ETF With Grayscale’s application to convert its trust to a spot XRP ETF, the consensus is the market is at the cusp of approval. Although the process might take several months, the activities of institutional investors coupled with an easing regulatory landscape have raised appetite. The grayscale move comes after similar efforts in Bitcoin and Ethereum while hinting at increasing investor exposure to digital assets. The trust currently holds about $16.1 million in assets, mirroring XRP’s value, which a custodian maintains according to institutional standards. Operating as a Delaware statutory trust, it tracks the price minus fees with assets held in Coinbase Custody Trust Company. “ Grayscale XRP Trust (the “Trust”) is one of the first investment vehicles that enable investors to gain exposure to the token underlying the XRP platform (“XRP”) in the form of a security while avoiding the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping XRP directly. Shares of the Trust (based on XRP per Share as indicated below) are designed to track the XRP market price, less fees and expenses,” Grayscale wrote . If approved by the SEC, its shares will be traded more like stocks, opening up an investment window for traditional investors to increase their market exposure. Grayscale continues its institutional push to altcoins, having filed spot Solana and Litecoin ETFs. Other institutional players have also filed spot XRP ETF , with commentators anticipating more participation. What’s Next For XRP Price? XRP recorded slight gains after the announcement but lost gains following a bearish crypto market. At press time, the asset exchanges hand at $3.04, down 2% today and 3.6% in the last seven days. The weakened sentiments have wiped off several wins notched by altcoins. XRP maintains its position as the third largest crypto asset, with metrics pointing north. In recent weeks, institutional investors have mounted buying pressure on the asset with huge whale purchases. These factors spurred price projections above $6 in the next altcoin season .",Cryptocurrency|News|Grayscale|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-01 13:56:44

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP gains attention amid talks of expanding the U.S. crypto reserve beyond Bitcoin, while Yeti Ouro extends its token bonus. This week, the crypto space has been dominated by debates about whether the Trump administration should expand its national crypto reserve to other tokens beyond Bitcoin, and XRP has emerged as a leading contender. The token has been trading in a tight range over the past few days, but technical indicators signal a breakout to $5 in the short term. Elsewhere, the new Ethereum-based crypto project Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is aiming for $10 this year. After the widely celebrated Chinese New Year bonus at the end of January, the Yeti Ouro team has extended the 20% token purchase bonus for an additional 48 hours, now available until midnight on Sunday. You might also like: Why ADA might go parabolic soon as Yeti Ouro gains traction Why XRP price to $5 is achievable XRP started the week with a sudden dip, with XRP price dropping to a low of $2.739, its lowest price in two weeks and the lowest it had traded since Donald Trump took office. However, the drop was a broader market phenomenon — Solana and Dogecoin shed 14% each — and XRP price has recovered since then to trade above $3 since early Wednesday, as per data from CoinMarketCap. Analysts point out that XRP could be on the verge of a breakout, with technical indicators showing a rise in bullish momentum. The token recently surged past the median of its Bollinger Band, which stood at $3.067. This sets it up to test its upper Bollinger Band, which stands at $3.53. If it hits this level, it will set a new high in this bull rally, with its current peak at $3.4, set just two weeks ago. This test of the upper Bollinger Band would confirm analysts’ expectation that the token’s bullish momentum since mid-January is sustainable over the next few weeks. XRP’s ascent is backed by continued adoption at both the retail and institutional levels. This week, Worksport, a clean energy market leader and one of the key Tesla suppliers, announced that it would incorporate XRP and BTC into its reserves. The XRP reserves debate has spread to the American government, with key XRP leaders, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, proposing that the Trump administration should also hold XRP alongside Bitcoin on the national reserves, a proposal that has sparked heated debates. Yeti Ouro aims for $10 this year Yeti Ouro has emerged as one of the leading contenders for the best new crypto projects, with experts lauding the project’s integration of the fun nature of meme coins with the rewards of play-to-earn gaming. In its ongoing presale, the project has raised $2.1 million and sold more than 153,000,000 tokens to thousands of investors who believe it’s the next major Dogecoin rival. The momentum is undeniable, Yeti Ouro could be the next big thing in the crypto market. Yeti Ouro has always put the security of its investors first. But having gone through an audit conducted by SolidProof guarantees security, and trust amongst its investors. YETIO has attracted both institutional investors as well as regular investors by giving safety a priority. The tokens are selling at an affordable price of $0.017. The team has extended the 20% bonus until midnight Sunday UTC in celebration of the Chinese New Year. With experts projecting that the project’s sound tokenomics and focus on offering utility could push the token to $10 once it hits the exchanges, investors in the presale could make over 500X on their investment. Yeti Ouro’s utility comes from Yeti Go, its thrilling PvP racing game that tests a player’s gaming skills, quick reflexes, and strategy application. Built by avid gamers, in partnership with developers whose portfolio includes Call of Duty, Spiderman, Dead Space, and The Witcher, the game combines stunning concept art with immersive audio to deliver chaotic fun at its best. The game is powered by YETIO, a deflationary digital asset whose supply is capped at one billion tokens. Players can customize and power up their vehicles and stake for extra content. Winners also receive their reward in YETIO, creating an infinite loop of demand and utility. The dev team recently released a video showcasing glimpses of the level 1 map of Yeti Go game. Please note that this image is from a game currently in development. It does not represent the final product. Yeti Ouro stands out for the right reason to be a promising investment choice. For investors looking to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto, Yeti Ouro is undoubtedly the one to watch and invest in.

As of now, stablecoins are worth $223 billion, which is a 0.2% increase from yesterday. Interestingly, USDT and USDC are the present growth drivers of stablecoins. Apart from the numbers from both coins, the stablecoins group hasn’t changed much since 2023 and has shown steady and average values. Right now, Tether’s USDT is valued at almost $140 billion, and USDC is at $53 billion. USDC Slowly Gains Ground On Other Coins Alphractal’s post on Twitter/X shows that USDC has been gaining ground over other stablecoins in the market. According to the post, this is happening due to a drop in altcoin prices and since a substantial part of the sell-offs have been swapped into USDC. The post also showed that USDC’s dominance in this segment has hit a key resistance level, the same amount observed in 2021. This was the start of the bear market in 2022 when Bitcoin’s price dropped to as low as $15,500. If this metric persists, it can serve as the market’s bearish signal, impacting investors’ buying decisions. However, if this metric declines, it can be USDC’s jumping board to claim new highs. Related Reading: 21Shares Bets On Polkadot, Files For Spot ETF With SEC What To Expect From The Stablecoins Segment In The Short-Term In the last bull run, USDC’s supply increased in May, then reached its high in March 2022. The stablecoin’s market cap increased by 170% from April 2021 to March 2022. If the current coin supply continues to grow but price starts to dip, then the stablecoin market may hit its peak in a few months. Traditionally, a rising market cap for stablecoins reflects growing investors’ confidence, which signals an increase in capital inflows. On the contrary, a rising stablecoin market cap is usually associated with growing investor conviction, signaling the potential for boosted capital inflows. This suggests that the bullish momentum could continue for a few more months.

Unfortunately, Ali Martinez says the downtrend might not be over. He forecasts the price of Ethereum (ETH) might fall by 40% in the coming weeks. However, the main focus is on IntelMarkets (INTL) , the AI-driven cryptocurrency that has been gaining attention since the start of its crypto ICO. It is currently targeting the $1 mark. With innovative AI technology and growing investor enthusiasm, IntelMarkets could hit this mark soon. Meanwhile, Ali predicts the price of Cardano (ADA) might surge by 40% soon. Ethereum (ETH) Faces Potential 40% Decline Ali Martinez, an on-chain analyst, has forecasted a downtrend for Ethereum (ETH). He noted the ETH MVRV has declined below 160-day MA, signaling a potential downtrend. According to him, a similar move occurred in June 2024. At the time, the Ethereum price fell by 40% from $3,500 to $2,100. Presently, the value is trading around the $3,100-$3,400 range. A 40% decline could push the value of the Ethereum token below the $2,000 mark. On the flip side, Ashcryptoreal notes the altcoin is currently breaking out of a bearish trend. The cryptocurrency analyst notes the first main target would be $4,000. If the uptrend continues, the Ethereum crypto price might pump to a new all-time high of $5k. In the meantime, CoinMarketCap data reveals the value of ETH has dropped by 1.6% in the weekly timeframe. Bull is currently attempting to pull a trend reversal, a move that could kickstart an altcoin season. AI Integration Makes IntelMarkets (INTL) Stand Out IntelMarkets (INTL) is one of the projects that is making great progress in the cryptocurrency trading market through the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI). One of them is the AI-driven bots that allow users to monitor market movements, carry out analysis, and execute trades according to the user’s preferences.

With the help of AI-based trading bots and a successful presale, IntelMarkets is set to become a key player in the crypto trading sector. Analyst Forecasts 40% Rally for Cardano (ADA) According to Ali Martinez, Cardano (ADA) is currently consolidating in a symmetrical triangle. The analyst notes that a breakout could trigger a 40% price surge. Such a move might push the value of the Cardano coin from its current range to $1.26. Another analyst called CW predicts the Cardano price could skyrocket to a short-term target of $1.9. Right now, data from CoinMarketCap reveals the value of the Cardano token has dipped by 2.8% in the weekly timeframe. Nevertheless, the gains of 13.0% and 94.1% on the monthly and yearly charts show that the coin’s performance has not been all bearish. It also reveals the Cardano crypto has shown some level of resilience in the past few weeks. The Hull Moving Average (9) and Stoch RSI (14) are pointing to a potential uptrend. They are flashing buy signals which means that bulls are in control. Top Altcoins To Watch Out for in 2025 Ethereum (ETH) is dealing with downward pressure and Cardano (ADA) looks forward to making a strong comeback.
