Three standout picks are Arctic Pablo Coin , Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW), and Mog Coin (MOG). Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining traction among the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025, bringing a frosty twist to meme culture. MEW thrives on its unique feline-in-dog-world concept, while MOG capitalizes on internet virality. These coins blend humor with investment appeal, attracting traders eager for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. With meme coins on the rise, these projects could deliver substantial returns—research before diving in! Arctic Pablo Coin: An Adventurous Expedition into Crypto Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin; it’s an adventurous journey that bridges myth and reality. The narrative follows Arctic Pablo, a daring explorer navigating icy terrains and uncovering mystical $APC coins. These shimmering tokens symbolize prosperity and potential, inviting investors to join Pablo on his thrilling expedition. The presale structure of Arctic Pablo is uniquely designed around Pablo’s travels, with each phase representing a different mythical location. Currently, in its 8th location, Shangri-La, the coin is priced at $0.000047. Investors have a golden opportunity here: a $100 investment would yield 2,127,595.00 APCs, which could balloon to $17,020.76 upon reaching the listing price of $0.008. This represents a staggering 16,936% return on investment from the current price to the listing price. Beyond the presale, Arctic Pablo offers a generous 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) staking program. By staking APC tokens, investors can watch their holdings grow, with all staked coins vested for a two-month period from the launch date. Additionally, the project employs a deflationary mechanism by burning unsold tokens at the end of each week during the presale, enhancing scarcity and potential value. With over $740,000 raised so far, Arctic Pablo is gaining significant traction. The combination of its adventurous narrative, strategic presale structure, and attractive staking rewards positions it as one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): The Feline Challenger in the Meme Coin Arena In a crypto landscape dominated by dog-themed coins, Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) emerges as a feline contender, offering a fresh perspective. Launched on the Solana blockchain, MEW aims to carve out its niche by challenging the status quo. As of now, MEW is trading at approximately $0.0044, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $20 million. The total supply stands at 88.88 billion MEW tokens, all of which are currently in circulation. Despite a decline from its all-time high of $0.01288 in November 2024, MEW remains up significantly from its all-time low in March 2024. MEW’s strength lies in its community-driven approach. Partnerships with animation studios and integration into pop culture have bolstered its appeal, making it more than just a meme coin. The project employs a strategic burning mechanism and airdrops to build community, value, and scarcity, quickly gaining traction in the Solana ecosystem. For investors seeking the best meme coins to buy for 2025, MEW offers a compelling narrative and a dedicated community, positioning it as a noteworthy contender in the meme coin space. Mog Coin (MOG): Riding the Wave of Viral Popularity Mog Coin (MOG) has been making significant waves in the meme coin space, leveraging its viral community-driven presence to maintain momentum. Positioned within the Ethereum and Base ecosystems, MOG thrives on social engagement and memetic appeal. Currently, MOG boasts a market cap of approximately $454.62 million, with a total supply of 390.56 trillion MOG tokens. Over the past 24 hours, its trading volume surged by 25.75% to $19.89 million, reflecting strong market activity. Despite being 71.06% below its all-time high of $0.054022 in December 2024, MOG has delivered an astronomical 7,096,604.21% gain since its all-time low in July 2023. The project’s success is largely attributed to its community-driven approach, leveraging social media platforms to foster engagement and drive interest. As the broader meme coin sector remains volatile, MOG continues to attract both traders and long-term believers, with bullish sentiment dominating its community discussions. For those exploring the best meme coins to buy for 2025, Mog Coin presents an intriguing opportunity, especially for investors looking to capitalize on community-driven momentum.

The Virginia-based firm’s press statement revealed plans to raise $563 million through a Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK) offering. This move aligns with the company’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, further solidifying its position as a corporate leader in cryptocurrency investments. MicroStrategy’s MSTR Stock Climbs As More Shares Are Expected The Nasdaq-listed company announced it will issue 7.3 million STRK shares at $80 each. The deal is expected to close on February 5, 2025, pending standard closing conditions. This deal estimation is poised to bring in $563.4 million in net proceeds. As usual, all the profits will be funneled into buying more Bitcoin and other corporate purposes. MicroStrategy’s Chairman Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy has gained substantial shareholder support. A recent vote approved the issuance of additional shares, meaning more capital raises could be coming soon. This would further cement the company’s status as the world’s most aggressive corporate Bitcoin buyer. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has reacted positively. Following the STRK offering announcement, MSTR rebounded to around $340, logging a 17% year-to-date gain. MicroStrategy and Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation Spree MicroStrategy has used every available financial tool for the past four years to buy Bitcoin. This varied from convertible notes to direct stock offerings. It recently bought 10,107 BTC valued at $1.1 billion , marking twelve weeks of aggressive Bitcoin purchases. Following the transaction, the company announced a redemption notice for its 2027 convertible senior tranche , valued at $1.05 billion. With another $563 million incoming, MicroStrategy is making it clear that it has no plans to slow down. Bitcoin Stays Unshaken Despite MicroStrategy’s commitment, Bitcoin has yet to respond to the news. The world’s largest cryptocurrency remains below the $105,000 support level, showing no immediate reaction to the company’s latest BTC accumulation plans. Still, history suggests that MicroStrategy’s persistent buying could contribute to long-term bullish momentum. With Saylor’s unwavering Bitcoin conviction and fresh capital on hand, all eyes are now on MicroStrategy’s next big BTC purchase.

Meanwhile, Web3Bay, a pioneering blockchain-based e-commerce platform, is making waves, not just disrupting marketplaces but redefining commerce itself. As Solana capitalizes on its robust tech and Binance leverages its diverse offerings, Web3Bay introduces a new model of transparency, inclusivity, and community-led governance. With its presale already raising over $1,000,0000, the platform is drawing significant interest, promising investors a potential 6,430% return. Investors are now evaluating which of these initiatives will offer the most transformative growth. Solana Price Set for 25% Increase Amid Positive Signals Solana (SOL) is gearing up for a significant upswing, with chart patterns suggesting a move toward $330 could be imminent. If the Solana price can overcome the $270 resistance and maintain its drive, a 25% increase is likely soon. A Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 54 supports this positive outlook. Enhancing this optimism, Solana’s DEXs have recently outperformed Ethereum in trading volume, as reported by DeFiLlama, signaling rising confidence in Solana’s capabilities. Data from Coinglass also shows a noteworthy $40.6 million in SOL withdrawals from exchanges in 24 hours, indicating strong accumulation by long-term investors, which could propel the Solana price further. Binance Coin Set for $1,000 as Positive Patterns Surface Binance Coin (BNB) is capturing interest as it approaches its peak price levels, sparking talk of a surge up to $1,000. It’s currently priced at $682.35 and has been relatively stable, with a minor decrease of 0.26% in the last 24 hours. Yet, its market capitalization stands strong at $97.23 billion, making it the sixth largest in the crypto sector. Market experts are feeling positive about Binance Coin’s price movements, having recently emerged from a falling wedge pattern—an upbeat sign that suggests gains ahead. After confirming the pattern’s breakout, predictions suggest it could soon surpass $700, potentially reaching $1,000 soon. Furthermore, Binance Labs has evolved into YZi Labs, branching out into AI and biotechnology. This expansion could bolster the ecosystem and ensure long-term viability, indirectly aiding Binance Coin’s price growth. However, traders should tread carefully as volatility is expected, with current analyses indicating possible fluctuations around $683. Overcoming the $720 resistance could push BNB to revisit its earlier high of $790 and possibly exceed it. Should it drop below $630, the price could fall to $570. Currently, Binance Coin offers a notable chance for investors seeking significant gains. Web3Bay: Transforming Online Shopping with Blockchain Imagine a market where users rule, not big companies—enter Web3Bay. This decentralized shopping platform is changing how we buy online by cutting out intermediaries, reducing fees, and returning control of data and assets to its users. Web3Bay is built on blockchain, providing a safe, clear, and welcoming space that’s open to everyone, not just crypto fans, who are ready for a new era in shopping. The heart of Web3Bay is the 3BAY token, which is more than just money. It gives users benefits like 5% off buys, rewards for staking, and even a vote in its future direction with its upcoming DAO. The platform’s plans are bold, aiming to bring in NFT markets and work across different blockchains, making Web3Bay a key player in Web3 commerce. The buzz is real, as the presale has already brought in over 1000,000, selling more than 260 million tokens at just $0.004562 each. Early backers are looking at a staggering 6,430% ROI when the token hits the market at $0.1959. Web3Bay isn’t just an investment—it’s your ticket to a movement that could change global commerce forever. Don’t just watch; be part of the future. Final Say Solana’s strong signs and expanding community activities make it a thrilling choice for traders looking for quick profits, while Binance Coin’s smart expansion plans offer a solid base with huge growth possibilities. Yet, Web3Bay is in a league of its own, blending blockchain tech with practical daily use. Its model to spread out commerce, reward community involvement, and add cutting-edge tech makes it more than a crypto venture—it’s a blueprint for tomorrow’s e-commerce. As its presale picks up speed and its growth path is clear, Web3Bay draws those who support innovative changes. Solana and Binance might excel in their areas, but for anyone eyeing the next big blockchain marketplace, Web3Bay stands out. The future of crypto is not just about currency—it’s about revolutionizing industries, and Web3Bay is at the forefront.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

Solana Stablecoin Supply Jumps 73% Since Mid-January,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/trump-effect-solana-stablecoin-supply-jumps-73-since-mid-january/,"An unprecedented stablecoin supply of 73% has occurred on the Solana blockchain since the middle of January. A new initiative that has captured the attention of the crypto community, the $TRUMP memecoin, was launched at the same time as this spike. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Spikes 5% In A Day—Will the Rally Continue? Solana has been a significant actor in the crypto space for a long time; however, the release of this memecoin has sparked new interest, propelling the network’s stablecoin ecosystem to new heights. TRUMP Token Drives Significant Stablecoin Supply Increase Its launch spurred activity on Solana’s distributed markets and further investments into the network. More stablecoins are now available thanks to the rise of money entering the market, therefore enhancing Solana’s significance as a key blockchain for distributed finance. Its debut attracted new investments to the network and increased activity on Solana’s decentralized markets. The increase in money flowing into the market has led to more stablecoins being available, boosting Solana’s role as an important blockchain for decentralized finance. After Donald Trump launched his memecoin, $TRUMP, on Solana, the network saw a spike in money inflows, leading to record [decentralized exchange] trade activity, according to CCData. CCData reports that Solana has overtaken BNB Chain as the third-largest blockchain network in terms of stablecoin supply. It continues to fall behind Tron and Ethereum. SOLANA STABLECOIN SUPPLY SKYROCKETS 73% -WHAT’S DRIVING IT? Solana just hit $11.1B in stablecoin supply, jumping 73% since mid-Jan. Big catalyst?

Now Solana’s the #3 blockchain for stablecoins,… pic.twitter.com/9WAow0sKFd — IBC Group Official (@ibcgroupio) January 31, 2025 USD Coin Dominates Solana Stablecoin Market USD Coin (USDC) continues to be the most prevalent stablecoin asset in Solana, accounting for an impressive 78% of the network’s total stablecoin supply. The token’s widespread adoption across decentralized applications (dApps) and Solana’s ongoing relationship with Circle are both distinct indications of USDC’s dominance. In contrast, USDT, representing merely 12% of the stablecoin supply on Solana, bags the second place. This dynamic illustrates the impact of USDC’s preeminence on Solana’s stablecoin market, notwithstanding the sporadic appearance of alternative currencies like USDt. Solana’s Recent User Growth In addition to having an effect on Solana’s stablecoin market, the excitement around the $TRUMP token has significantly increased the number of on-chain users. Hundreds of thousands of new users have joined the Solana network in an attempt to join the $TRUMP frenzy.

According to a new blog post, Kraken says that its revenue and trading volumes doubled in 2024 compared to what it did in 2023. Kraken attributes its growth last year to the company’s focus on improving execution. “Our relentless execution is evidenced by our 2024 financial highlights, which we are releasing for the first time in Kraken history. In 2024, we saw revenue of $1.5 billion (up 128% year-over-year) and $380 million in adjusted EBITDA. During the year, clients entrusted us with $42.8 billion in assets on the platform and 2.5 million funded accounts. Total trading volumes in 2024 reached $665 billion and our average revenue per customer is now well over $2,000 – far surpassing any comparable stat we’ve seen from traditional or crypto exchanges. One of Kraken’s core principles from day one has been accountability – to our customers, shareholders and employees. We don’t just measure success by volume, but by the quality of that volume. Not just by security, but by the depth and soundness of that security. Not just by accessibility, but by how seamlessly our products integrate liquidity and user experience.” Source: Kraken The announcement comes one day after the relaunch of Kraken’s staking program.

39753986,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=666247,1738364717,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39753986.jpeg,Elon Musk says his D.O.G.E will be cutting $4B daily in US govt spending until September,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musk-says-his-d-o-g-e-will-be-cutting-4b-daily-in-us-govt-spending-until-september/,"Mr. Elon Musk, who is now basically Washington’s Lara Croft, has announced today that he plans to cut $4 billion from the US government’s budget every single day from now until September 30 as part of his mission at the infamous Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). Via a post on X (which is the only way Elon communicates with the public now for the sake of total transparency), the eccentric billionaire explained that the cuts are part of a larger plan to reduce the federal deficit for fiscal year 2026 from $2 trillion down to $1 trillion. Under the Biden administration, the FAA and other government agencies had absolutely insane hiring practices that endangered the public. President @realDonaldTrump and his team are working rapidly to restore competent personnel to all positions involving your safety. pic.twitter.com/wn376WUq0v — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 30, 2025 The Tesla CEO and self-proclaimed efficiency freak explained that even with a $1 trillion deficit, economic growth could bridge the gap and keep inflation at bay by 2026. “Super big deal,” Elon called it, pointing out that America’s debt is already sitting at a mind-numbing $36.6 trillion right now. Elon genuinely believes that inflation is caused solely by government spending and wants the American public to allow him the chance to prove that to them. D.O.G.E wipes out $1B in contracts, targets bloated government spending Elon’s D.O.G.E team has already canceled over $1 billion in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility contracts, calling them wasteful products of what he described as “insane hiring practices” under the Biden administration. According to Elon, these contracts weren’t just expensive—they were dangerous. His words: “They endangered the public.” The Biden-era contracts covered nearly every corner of the federal government, including departments handling defense, labor, and health. Now the contracts have been terminated across major agencies like the Department of Defense, Department of Education, Treasury, and Agriculture. The Environmental Protection Agency, Commerce Department, and even smaller agencies like the Bureau of Land Management and the Railroad Retirement Board were also targeted. The cancellations alone are estimated to have saved taxpayers $1 billion, but that’s just the warm-up, according to the Doge Master. Source: D.O.G.E on X “Through January 29, 85 DEIA-related contracts totaling ~$1B have been terminated,” D.O.G.E posted on its official X account. Elon’s team claimed many of these contracts were part of Biden’s diversity-driven hiring policies that prioritized social agendas over competency. On Jan. 29 when the Fed decided not to cut rates again despite Trump telling them to, he publicly slammed them, blaming DEI and chairman Powell for inflation. In his words: “The Fed has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation. My Treasury Secretary Scott is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary Regulation, and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses. If the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, ‘green’ energy, and fake climate change, Inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst Inflation in the History of our Country!” The Lara Croft of efficiency This isn’t the first time Elon has taken a hard line on workplace policies. His Tesla factories are known for their brutal work schedules, and now federal workers are getting a taste of that same approach. An email from the Trump administration, reportedly sent last Tuesday, gave government employees until February 6 to either take an eight-month buyout or return to the office five days a week. Elon has said time and time again since COVID-19 that he despises remote work. The email, titled “Fork in the Road,” looked eerily and hilariously similar to Elon’s past messages to employees at Tesla and Twitter during massive layoffs. Elon’s D.O.G.E is being enforced despite lacking actual congressional approval. Legal battles are likely, but Elon doesn’t care one bit. In fact, he mocks the Union workers who are threatening him. Yeah this guy’s a menace. Source: Elon Musk on X Now Wired reported yesterday that Elon has even been sleeping at D.O.G.E headquarters, pulling overnight shifts at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. He told people he’s been invited to crash in the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House, though no official confirmation backs that claim. Sleeping at work isn’t nothing new for the genius either. Back in 2018, Elon famously said he was sleeping on the Tesla factory floor during production delays because he “didn’t have time to go home.” Now, he’s bringing that same obsessive approach to Washington. The man just has a lot of passion for every work he does, and he really does so much, for humanity especially. Blockchain takes over: Elon’s plan to track every federal dollar Elon is also pitching blockchain as the future of federal spending. According to a report by Bloomberg, Elon wants public blockchain networks to track every government dollar spent, ensuring transparency and preventing fraud. The plan could revolutionize government finance, but it’s also admittedly kind of risky. Blockchain experiments in corporate America have been hit-or-miss, with some companies abandoning the tech due to high costs and inefficiency. The idea for using blockchain in government finance reportedly came from a pitch given to Trump’s transition team in December on how decentralized ledgers could secure sensitive data and track spending in real time. Elon’s team jumped on the opportunity, believing that blockchain could eliminate fraud and abuse in federal programs. But the scale of what D.O.G.E wants to do is massive. Using blockchain to track spending across the U.S. government would dwarf anything tried in the private sector. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) weighed in on Elon’s plan, tweeting that “all governments should track their spending on the blockchain. It’s public money.” Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also offered his services, suggesting a collaboration between Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight to help D.O.G.E. As Cryptopolitan reported just yesterday, D.O.G.E has inspired a ton of copycats in Texas, with lawmakers there wanting to cut spending too. Now XRP lawyer John Deaton is also calling for the same in Massachusetts after learning that the government is raising taxes yet again. John is a Republican and he ran for Senate against Bitcoin-hating Democrat, Elizabeth Warren, last year. He lost to her, but has promised that he would never stop fighting. In his post today, he blamed Democrats for making inflation worse with massive spendings. He said, “Taxes are the Democrats answer to every problem we face in Massachusetts. Here’s an idea: How about we cut unnecessary spending for once?” John added a direct call to Elon saying, “@elonmusk we need a Massachusetts D.O.G.E.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",News|Elon Musk,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|ADA|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-31 23:05:17

The crypto world is packed with opportunities, but not all projects have what it takes to thrive. Some are built on hype, while others have solid ecosystems that generate real, long-term value. With constant market fluctuations, finding the best cryptos for exponential returns can be the key to turning a small investment into massive gains. Qubetics is making headlines with its successful presale and groundbreaking decentralized VPN technology, making it a top contender for 2025. Terra Classic is focusing on token burns to regain investor confidence, while NEAR Protocol is gaining traction with its scalable blockchain ecosystem. Let’s break down why these cryptos are on everyone’s radar. Qubetics: The Best Cryptos for Exponential Returns Qubetics is leading the charge as the world’s first Layer 1 Web3 aggregator, seamlessly bridging blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana into a single ecosystem. This unique approach positions Qubetics as one of the best cryptos for exponential returns, thanks to its massive presale success and innovative technology. As of January 31, 2025, Qubetics is in its 19th presale stage, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0606 each. The presale has already raised over $11.5 million, with more than 453 million tokens sold and 17,600 holders onboard. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, representing a 312.18% gain, with projections aiming for $1, $5, $6, and even $15 after the mainnet launch, offering 24,630.58% growth potential. The Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace is a groundbreaking platform that facilitates the conversion of tangible assets like real estate, commodities, and financial products into digital tokens on the blockchain. TICSScan leads the charge in this space by offering a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace for tokenizing and trading these assets. TICSScan TICSScan provides an innovative solution for asset owners and investors by allowing the tokenization of real-world assets into easily tradable digital tokens. This opens up new opportunities for liquidity, as investors can buy and sell fractional ownership of assets, making traditionally illiquid markets more accessible and efficient. With its innovative ecosystem and game-changing technology, Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s one of the best cryptos for exponential returns with long-term potential. Terra Classic: The Path to Recovery Terra Classic (LUNC) has had a turbulent past, but it’s still a force in the crypto space. Once a dominant blockchain, LUNC suffered a major collapse, but its community has remained resilient, working on token burns and ecosystem revival to restore its value. Currently priced at $0.00007719, LUNC has maintained stability despite market fluctuations. The community-driven initiative to burn tokens and reduce supply aims to push the price higher over time. While its previous glory may be hard to reclaim, Terra Classic is proving that a committed community can breathe new life into a struggling project. Investors looking for the best cryptos for exponential returns often eye LUNC due to its potential for a massive comeback. If burn initiatives successfully cut down token supply and spark renewed interest, LUNC could see a sharp rise in value, making it an attractive high-risk, high-reward investment. NEAR Protocol: The Scalable Contender NEAR Protocol is quickly establishing itself as one of the most promising Layer 1 blockchains. Designed for scalability and efficiency, NEAR offers fast transactions, low fees, and a developer-friendly environment, making it a top competitor in the blockchain space. Currently priced at $4.68, NEAR has seen a 3.54% increase, with analysts predicting its price to fluctuate between $4.53 and $4.59 in the near term. While some expect minor dips, NEAR’s long-term growth potential remains strong, especially as more developers build on its ecosystem. NEAR Protocol’s strength lies in its user-friendly blockchain infrastructure, enabling businesses and developers to create and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) with ease. This accessibility has led to increasing adoption, making NEAR a solid bet for investors searching for the best cryptos for exponential returns. Conclusion: The Best Crypto Investments for 2025 Picking the best cryptos for exponential returns requires analyzing utility, adoption, and long-term growth potential. Qubetics, Terra Classic, and NEAR Protocol each offer unique value propositions: Qubetics is breaking new ground with its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace and Web3 aggregation, positioning itself as a must-watch crypto for 2025. Terra Classic (LUNC) is on the road to recovery, with token burns driving potential price surges, making it a high-risk, high-reward play. NEAR Protocol is leading the way in blockchain scalability, with strong developer adoption and a growing ecosystem fueling its long-term prospects. For those looking for explosive growth and real-world applications, these three cryptos are worth serious consideration. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and getting in early could lead to significant gains in 2025. Which of these projects will be the next big success story?

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN.

But with so many options, it can be tricky to figure out which ones are worth your attention. If you’re looking to make a savvy investment in February 2025, three names stand out from the crowd: Arctic Pablo, Neiro, and Notcoin. These meme coins are making waves, each with unique narratives and a promise of big returns. In this article, Let’s dive into why they’re considered the best meme coins to invest in February 2025 , focusing on Arctic Pablo’s exciting presale journey, Neiro’s emerging popularity, and Notcoin’s innovative approach. Arctic Pablo: The Adventure Coin with Massive Potential When it comes to the best meme coins to invest in February 2025, Arctic Pablo is leading the charge. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a full-on adventure wrapped in a token. Arctic Pablo’s theme takes inspiration from an intrepid explorer venturing into the icy unknown, on a quest for riches, hidden mysteries, and the discovery of the magical $APC tokens. Each presale phase is tied to different locations on Pablo’s journey, with the current phase set in the icy expanse of Shangri-La. As the token travels, so does the value, which makes it incredibly exciting for investors. Right now, Arctic Pablo is in its 8th location (Shangri-La) and offers an incredible ROI. If you decide to invest $300, you’ll get 6,382,785.00 $APCs. And here’s the kicker: once the token hits its launch price of $0.008, your initial investment could balloon to a whopping $51,062.28. That’s a stunning return of 16,936%! Arctic Pablo is on a mission to connect the realms of myth and reality, offering more than just a token but a ticket to a thrilling, money-making adventure. The coin is launching its presale, and here’s where things get even more exciting. For every unsold token, Arctic Pablo is burning them, creating a deflationary environment. This means the remaining tokens become even more scarce, adding further value to your investment. Also, staking is a huge part of the deal with Arctic Pablo. You can earn an outstanding 66% APY by staking your tokens. This isn’t just a passive investment—it’s an active journey, where the more you stake, the more you can earn. With all staked tokens vested for two months from the launch date, the rewards keep stacking up, making Arctic Pablo one of the best meme coins to invest in February 2025 for those looking to grow their holdings. So, if you’re ready to take a dive into the icy unknown and join an adventure that could change your financial future, Arctic Pablo’s presale is your ticket. Neiro: A Meme Coin with Real Utility Neiro (NEIRO), currently ranked #268 on CoinMarketCap, is proving itself as one of the best meme coins to invest in February 2025. With a market cap of $215.96 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $74.37 million, NEIRO is showing steady performance. The token’s current price is $0.0005134, reflecting a slight increase of 0.38% in the last day. What makes Neiro especially appealing is its impressive recovery. After hitting an all-time low of $0.052433 in mid-2024, the token surged by over 21,000%, reaching an all-time high of $0.003093 just three months ago. This growth demonstrates Neiro’s potential for future gains, making it an attractive investment in the meme coin market. Neiro benefits from being part of the Ethereum ecosystem, which boosts its credibility and utility. With a circulating supply of 420.68 billion tokens out of a total supply of 420.69 billion, the token’s scarcity is an added factor to consider for potential investors. Backed by a strong and growing community, Neiro continues to attract attention as a meme coin with significant growth potential. For anyone interested in meme coins, Neiro stands out as one of the best options to consider in February 2025. With its steady performance, market recovery, and community backing, it’s definitely worth watching. Notcoin: A Disruptor in the Meme Coin Space Notcoin (NOT) is quickly gaining attention as one of the best meme coins to invest in February 2025, currently ranked #145 on CoinMarketCap with a market cap of $453.4 million. The coin has recently seen a 0.58% increase in value, reaching $0.004425 USD, with a significant 44.73% surge in trading volume over the last 24 hours, totaling $33.65 million. Its total supply of 102.45 billion tokens matches its max supply, ensuring stable circulation without excessive inflation. Despite fluctuations, Notcoin has maintained a steady trading pattern, with a bullish community sentiment of 88%, which is a positive sign for future growth. Notcoin stands out for its popularity in the gaming and meme sectors, having been featured on Binance Launchpool, which adds credibility and exposure within these rapidly growing markets. Its all-time high of $0.02896 in June 2024 and recent low of $0.004044 in February 2025 showcase the volatility but also highlight potential for significant returns. Investors can track price movements, with a current range between $0.004369 and $0.004516. Overall, Notcoin offers an intriguing option for those looking to enter the meme coin market with potential for both short-term gains and long-term growth in 2025. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Leads the Charge Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that Arctic Pablo stands out as the best meme coin to invest in February 2025. The combination of a thrilling narrative, a deflationary tokenomics model, and the chance for enormous returns through staking and presale investments makes Arctic Pablo a standout choice for investors looking for both excitement and potential profit. The presale journey, with its unique locations and burning mechanism, offers a sense of adventure that’s rarely seen in the crypto world. While Neiro and Notcoin certainly have their merits, Arctic Pablo’s presale structure and high potential ROI make it the frontrunner in this list. If you’re ready to hop on board and be part of a meme coin adventure that could pay off big, Arctic Pablo is your best bet.

Meanwhile, RCO Finance (RCOF) is gearing up for an explosive 44,000% rally, drawing attention from serious investors. With its AI-driven Robo Advisor, a booming presale, and an innovative DeFi ecosystem, RCOF is proving to be more than just another altcoin. Let’s break down why experts believe this new AI altcoin is set for unprecedented gains. XRP Price Faces an Uphill Battle While Traders Look for the Next Big Thing For months, the XRP price has been locked in a frustrating battle against key resistance levels. While many investors were hopeful for a breakout, the reality is that XRP still hasn’t recaptured its previous high, leaving traders questioning whether the momentum has dried up. Currently, the XRP price is struggling to push past the $3.1 mark, a historically significant level that has rejected multiple rally attempts. Analysts believe that if XRP can gain enough traction, its next targets could be $4.20 or even $5. However, breaking these levels is easier said than done. The market structure remains uncertain, and XRP price is moving within a consolidation phase that lacks a clear breakout signal. While the XRP price remains uncertain, one project is gaining unstoppable momentum; RCO Finance . Unlike XRP, which has already matured, RCO Finance is still in its early stages, meaning its potential for exponential growth is far greater. RCO Finance’s AI Revolution Is Changing the Game For years, traders have relied on feelings, technical analysis, and market speculation to make investment decisions. But RCO Finance is rewriting the rules with its AI-powered Robo Advisor , an advanced tool designed to give traders precise entry and exit points in real time. Unlike traditional trading platforms, the Robo Advisor pulls live data from top financial sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, analyzing trends before they hit the mainstream. This gives investors an early edge, allowing them to capitalize on market shifts before the masses catch on. Imagine you had access to an AI system that alerted you to Solana in its early days when it was trading below $1. Fast forward, and Solana skyrocketed to over $200, making early investors millionaires. The Robo Advisor can detect similar opportunities, analyzing trending altcoins before they explode, ensuring you never miss out. Beyond identifying breakouts, the AI also protects your portfolio. If a coin is showing signs of weakness, the Robo Advisor can trigger sell signals, preventing devastating losses. This means no emotional trading, no second-guessing, and no stress; it’s just data-driven, automated decisions that optimize your portfolio. RCOF Beta Platform is a Rare Early-Access Advantage Most DeFi projects launch a product after their presale, but RCO Finance is ahead of the curve. The Beta platform is already live, with over 10,000 users testing its features. This hands-on approach ensures that the platform is battle-tested before full deployment. While the Beta focuses on core functionalities, the upcoming Alpha phase will introduce even more powerful AI-driven enhancements. Beyond its AI trading capabilities, RCO Finance is a full-fledged financial ecosystem that offers KYC-free transactions, so you can enjoy full privacy with no intrusive identity checks. You can diversify into 120,000+ assets, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, and real estate. Also, the RCOF debit cards allow you to spend your crypto instantly. RCO Finance Presale Is a Rare 44,000% Opportunity Opportunities like this don’t come often. RCO Finance is still in its 5th presale stage , with tokens priced at $0.10. But with the next stage pushing the price to $0.13, investors who get in now are securing an immediate 30% gain in just a few weeks. The project has already raised over $12 million, and demand is surging as more traders recognize its potential. With each new presale stage, the price increases, making early entries significantly more profitable. Investing $1,000 today at $0.10 means you get 10,000 RCOF tokens. When the price moves to $0.13, your investment grows to $1,300; without lifting a finger. Upon launch, when RCOF hits the projected 44,000% surge, your $1,000 turns into $440,000. With a fully audited smart contract by SolidProof proving the project’s security, this is an unprecedented opportunity that serious investors are taking full advantage of. Why RCO Finance Could Leave XRP in the Dust Even in a best-case scenario, XRP price may take years to reach $6.62, and that’s only a 200% gain. While this is decent, it doesn’t compare to RCO Finance’s 44,000% upside in just a few months. The reason is simple; XRP is already well-established, meaning its growth is naturally slower. On the other hand, RCO Finance is fresh, innovative, and solving real-world problems, making it far more likely to see explosive adoption. Investors who got into RCOF at earlier stages have already locked in gains, but even now, the presale offers incredible upside. Waiting until the next stage means losing 30% in potential gains, and by the time RCOF lists, the price will be significantly higher. Every day that passes, the opportunity window gets smaller. Those who wait risk watching RCOF skyrocket while they’re left on the sidelines. Now is the time to act.

And of course the surge was triggered by the perfect storm of Trump’s election win, a calm Federal Reserve, and institutional investors piling into crypto assets like there was no tomorrow. XRP’s price climbed from the ashes of SEC suppression in a comeback after years of legal chaos when it finally saw its biggest nemesis, former SEC chair Gary Gensler, handing in his resignation. According to Ripple’s report , between mid-November and December, XRP trading volumes averaged $5 billion daily, which is a pretty wild increase from $500 million just the month before. XRP dominated spot markets, US traders went all in Ripple’s report also says that most of the XRP activity came from spot trading. Binance accounted for 36% of global spot XRP volume, followed by Upbit at 20%, and Coinbase at 9%. US institutional investors like WisdomTree and Coinshares submitted filings for spot XRP ETFs, joining Bitwise and Canary Capital. With Ripple’s legal pressure easing, big money is treating XRP like the next big thing. I mean, we just reported that Canada is trying to launch an XRP ETF before America. Bitcoin’s rise to $109,000 also helped XRP along the way, as the BTC/XRP trading pair surged 130% over the quarter. And while volatility spiked from 40% in early November to 200%, investors stayed confident. By December 30th, XRP’s price reached $2.70, a 500% increase from its November levels. Ripple expanded XRP Ledger utility and stablecoin adoption By Q4’s end, Ripple Payments had had $70 billion in global transactions, with its RLUSD stablecoin acting as a critical bridge for cross-border payments. Ripple reported that RLUSD had been integrated into payment networks like Bitstamp, MoonPay, Uphold, and Independent Reserve. Ripple’s stablecoin strategy reportedly came with monthly reserve reports carried out by third-party auditors, to ensure trust in the reserves backing RLUSD. XRP Ledger wallet creation exploded to 709,000, up from just 140,000 in Q3. Ripple’s report said that XRP’s average price soared from $0.55 to $1.43 over the quarter, with burned XRP rising from 592,000 to 724,000 tokens. On-chain activity didn’t slow down either. Trustlines on the ledger grew from 7.3 million to 7.9 million, with 37,000 new trustlines tied directly to RLUSD adoption. Ripple’s AMM feature, which launched last March, reported $774 million in swap volume, compared to $31 million in the previous quarter. Decentralized exchange (DEX) volume shot past $1 billion, with AMM swaps making up 77% of it. Ripple pushed out new tech upgrades as well. The XLS-40 amendment brought decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to the ledger, and a native oracle protocol was integrated with Band Protocol and DIA. According to the report, this gave XRP Ledger real-time price feeds that could support lending, tokenization, and market-making operations. Archax, an FCA-regulated digital asset exchange, teamed up with abrdn to tokenize money market funds on the XRP Ledger. Societe Generale announced plans to deploy its MiCA-compliant stablecoin EURCV on the same network. Ripple claims that the ledger has fast 3-5 second settlements, low transaction fees, and built-in compliance tools. SEC lawsuit updates and regulatory breakthroughs Ripple’s legal saga with the SEC didn’t end, but the company gained the upper hand. On January 15, the SEC filed an opening brief in its appeal. Ripple argued that the brief rehashed already-failed arguments and ignored the incoming crypto-friendly Trump administration. Ripple will respond formally by April 16. Interestingly enough, the SEC’s appeal doesn’t actually question whether XRP itself is a security, which Judge Analisa Torres had already ruled against in 2023. But the SEC has reversed course a little. It scrapped SAB 121, a policy that had previously discouraged banks from working with crypto companies. The policy’s removal was a result of GAO findings that determined SAB 121 violated rulemaking processes. Ripple’s Q4 report included updated figures on its XRP holdings. As of December 31, 2024, Ripple claimed it had 4.48 billion XRP, up from 4.43 billion on September 30. The total XRP subject to on-ledger escrow dropped from 38.9 billion to 38.03 billion tokens. Ripple explained that these escrow funds are released monthly, with any unused tokens returned to escrow. The company clarified that it sometimes transfers XRP to third parties like ETPs or trusts but only when it expects the tokens to remain within its ecosystem.

Similarly, BlockDAG (BDAG) is experiencing heightened interest due to enhancements in its affiliate program, enticing both referrers and purchasers with a 5% USDT cashback for each transaction completed through a referral link. This offer, paired with no limits on usage, has encouraged traders to invest in BDAG, with forecasts suggesting a surge to $1 by 2025. In other sectors, Founder Justin Sun’s remarks have spurred a 16.67% increase in TRX’s price, complemented by a 15% growth in active addresses, signaling robust network engagement. Cardano (ADA) Price on the Brink of a Breakthrough The Cardano (ADA) price has been consolidating after its recent upward trend, hinting at a potential surge as it forms an ascending triangle pattern. The crucial resistance levels to monitor are between $1.15 and $1.20, which have posed challenges since December. Should ADA break and sustain above these levels, it could pave the way for a rise towards its 52-week peak of $1.327, with potential gains extending to $1.38. Conversely, ADA has robust support within the $0.93 to $0.918 range. Dropping below this could lead to a fallback to the next support at $0.85, yet the overall positive outlook will stand if these supports hold. Tron Network: TRX Price Surges Following Leadership’s Comments On January 26, 2025, Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron network, affirmed the platform’s decentralization, asserting that no single entity controls more than 50% of the total supply, and no node possesses more than 1/27 of the validation power. This announcement led to a notable increase in TRX’s price, which escalated from $0.12 to $0.14 in just an hour, alongside a 30% boost in trading volume. The technical indicators are promising, showing strong momentum with an RSI of 72 and a bullish MACD crossover. The number of active addresses also increased by 15%, indicating a rise in network activity and heightened interest in the market. BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program Offers 5% USDT Cashback! BlockDAG has enhanced its Affiliate Program, now granting a 5% instant cashback to both the person who refers and the one who purchases through the referral link. For example, if someone refers a friend and they buy $1,000 of cryptocurrency, both the referrer and the friend receive $50 in USDT cashback, directly added to their USDT (BEP-20) compatible wallets. This update follows BlockDAG’s stellar presale achievement, which has accumulated over $187 million. As the presale moves towards its $600 million goal, forecasts suggest BDAG could hit a $1 valuation by 2025. Participants buying now at $0.0248 in the current batch 27 are positioned for a potential 3932% return on investment when BDAG reaches $1. Early participants have already experienced a 2380% increase in their investments, underscoring BDAG’s appeal as one of today’s top crypto buys. For those looking to capitalize on promising crypto and garner additional perks, this affiliate program provides an ideal starting point, allowing them to accumulate USDT rewards. However, with the offer limited and batch 27 nearly sold out, prompt action is advisable before the program concludes and BDAG’s price escalates in upcoming batches. Long Story, Short! Cardano (ADA) is on the brink of surpassing the $1.20 mark, aiming for a yearly high of $1.327, contingent on maintaining above essential support levels. Simultaneously, Justin Sun’s reassurance regarding Tron’s decentralization has propelled a TRX price increase, though its continued momentum is yet to be determined. Nonetheless, BlockDAG emerges as the standout with its remarkable 3932% ROI potential . Its time-sensitive affiliate program not only enhances BDAG purchases but also fosters substantial USDT earnings and portfolio growth for participants. With the opportunity closing soon, now is the crucial moment for those who missed out initially to get involved before BDAG’s valuation surges.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has bounced back to the $0.00002 price mark, igniting tentative hope within its followers, though its long-term growth is still up for debate. Likewise, Polkadot (DOT) is on the brink of a bullish surge, drawing in traders with its target price of $17. Amid these well-known coins, Web3Bay stands out as a trailblazer, transforming e-commerce through blockchain technology. Web3Bay surpasses SHIB’s uncertain outlook and DOT’s dependence on network interoperability by merging real-world applications with investor benefits. Its presale has already gathered over $1,000,000, with initial tokens projecting a 6,430% ROI, highlighting its increasing traction. Integrating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), staking opportunities, and NFTs, Web3Bay is paving the way for a decentralized shopping era. Web3Bay: Leading Blockchain’s Charge in E-commerce Envision a future where online shopping escapes the grip of central authority, avoiding exorbitant fees and protecting your data. Welcome to Web3Bay—a blockchain-driven marketplace that could alter e-commerce fundamentally. This platform removes intermediaries, cuts down costs, and ensures unprecedented data security, making shopping smarter, quicker, and more equitable. The standout feature? The 3BAY token. More than just a currency, it’s a key to various perks—5% off purchases, staking bonuses, and participation in the platform’s evolving DAO. The journey doesn’t end here. With plans to assimilate NFT marketplaces and support cross-chain interactions, Web3Bay is shaping up to be the ultimate decentralized hub. Investors are catching on fast. Web3Bay’s crypto presale has already raked in over $1,000,000, distributing more than 260 million tokens at just $0.004562 each. Early participants are poised for a staggering 6,430% ROI as the token’s debut price is slated at $0.1959. This opportunity represents not just an investment but a stake in reshaping global commerce. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Hits $0.00002 Again: Will It Maintain Its Position? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has touched the $0.00002 mark once more, a pivotal psychological level often influencing investor sentiment. This resurgence hints at some buying interest, yet the overall market view advises caution. The lack of robust trading volumes may not support a sustained rise, potentially shaking investor confidence. Current indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) show neutral to bearish trends, pointing to tepid excitement from traders. SHIB still trades below key moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day, signaling hurdles to kickstart a bullish trend. For a firm recovery, SHIB needs significant buying pressure to push past the resistance at $0.0000216. Failing this, the token might face a downward correction. Polkadot on the Verge of a Breakout Polkadot (DOT) appears ready for a breakout, displaying a bullish pennant pattern that’s caught traders’ attention. This pattern, typically a continuation signal, formed after DOT’s climb from $3.75 to $10.68, with its price now hovering around $6.30. However, DOT Price finds it challenging to build momentum, witnessing a 24-hour drop of 2.92% and a 37% fall in trading volume to $169.94 million. This suggests wary sentiment among investors who are waiting for a clear breakout confirmation. Key resistance stands at the $7.16 Fibonacci level. Surpassing this could push DOT Price towards $10.68 and potentially $17. Yet, a failed breakout attempt might result in a retreat below $6.00. The Money Flow Index (MFI) is at 32.54, indicating slight buying interest but overall market caution. For those eyeing Polkadot, this could be a promising break, yet patience is essential as the market seeks a definitive direction. Takeaway As Shiba Inu (SHIB) strives to build momentum and Polkadot (DOT) anticipates a breakout, Web3Bay is carving a niche as a noteworthy crypto investment. SHIB’s revival heavily relies on fresh trading volume and trader interest, while DOT’s potential breakout is yet to be confirmed, depending on crucial Fibonacci levels. Conversely, Web3Bay continues to advance with its groundbreaking marketplace, comprehensive roadmap, and successful presale. Early investors in Web3Bay’s 3BAY token are positioned advantageously, possibly witnessing substantial returns from a platform that addresses genuine e-commerce inefficiencies. As blockchain evolves, Web3Bay differentiates itself by prioritizing utility, scalability, and investor participation, presenting itself as a premier investment choice in a speculative market. For astute traders, Web3Bay could very well be the future Amazon of crypto.

The filing intended to launch what would become the world’s first XRP ETF in Canada and provide investors with a regulated opportunity for long-term exposure to XRP and potential capital gains. If approved, the new product would operate as a spot XRP ETF, offering a regulated method for securing long-term exposure to XRP alongside the possibility of benefiting from its capital appreciation. Spot Ripple ETF on the Horizon? Purpose Investments Aims for Another First In an official statement issued on Thursday, the firm underscored its determination to replicate the successes of its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by introducing the first spot XRP ETF. Purpose Investments, recognized for launching the inaugural spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2021, now seeks to extend similar long-term exposure opportunities to XRP. Innovation drives the future of digital asset investing. We’re proud to file a preliminary prospectus for the world’s first Ripple (XRP) ETF – expanding access to regulated, institutional-grade crypto exposure. Learn more: https://t.co/x39gjnQcVb pic.twitter.com/PXpwO4mE1q — Purpose Investments (@PurposeInvest) January 30, 2025 The proposed ETF planned to invest nearly all of its assets in long-term holdings of XRP. Purpose Investments founder and CEO Som Seif stressed the firm’s commitment to innovation and to bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance. “At Purpose, we remain steadfast in our commitment to innovation and to bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance,” Seif said. “As XRP sees increasing adoption and institutional interest, we believe an ETF can offer investors a transparent and familiar way to access it within a regulated framework,” he added. While XRP exchange-traded products (ETPs) had been available across various global markets, the launch of a spot XRP ETF in Canada would represent a major development in providing regulated access to the asset. Meanwhile, several asset management firms filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch comparable products, although those filings remain under regulatory review. Rising Applications Amid U.S. Regulatory Shifts and Price Rally Applications for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had increased following the reelection of President Donald Trump and the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. @WisdomTreeFunds has filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the @SECGov for a spot XRP ETF. #XRP #Ripple #XRPETF https://t.co/lLCj5OmRoB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 2, 2024 Several asset managers, including Grayscale, CoinShares, Bitwise , WisdomTree , and 21Shares, filed for XRP ETFs in the United States as recent regulatory shifts encourage issuers to move forward with their filings. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, Litecoin , and Dogecoin, also attracted spot ETF applications. The SEC was expected to render preliminary decisions on these filings by the end of January; Grayscale’s XRP ETF application carried a deadline of January 23, while other applicants awaited decisions by January 25. Leadership changes at the SEC accelerated these developments, as market participants anticipated a more favorable regulatory stance on crypto-based investment products. Purpose Investments, which had introduced the world’s first Bitcoin ETF in Canada in 2021, had paved the way for institutional access to crypto. In contrast, U.S. asset managers had to wait until January 2024 for SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have since amassed over $121 billion in assets. XRP’s price surged to $3.20 on January 15—its highest level since 2018—before retracing to $3.09 on January 31 and marking a 31% gain for the month. The rally occurred despite the SEC’s appeal against a July 2023 ruling that determined XRP sales to retail investors were not unregistered securities. Market observers suggest that an approved XRP ETF could attract between $3 billion and $6 billion in net new investments, assuming adoption rates similar to those of Ethereum ETFs.

The cryptocurrency had shown signs of a potential breakout, but key indicators have come into focus as the market evaluates its next move. The latest insights from analysts have raised questions about whether Bitcoin’s market momentum can overcome the resistance level at $108,000, its previous all-time high. Related Reading: MVRV Ratio Reveals Bitcoin’s Market Position Amid Short-Term Selling Pressure Analyzing Bitcoin’s Market Indicators Amid the price performance from BTC, CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC has provided insights on the challenges and possibilities ahead for Bitcoin. Shayan noted that despite Bitcoin’s recent price increases, the funding rates—a critical on-chain indicator—have started to decline. This bearish divergence suggests that demand in perpetual markets may be weakening, casting doubt on whether the current bullish momentum is sufficient to push Bitcoin above its all-time high. Particularly, one of the primary hurdles for Bitcoin’s price to surpass $108,000 is the lack of strong market enthusiasm, as reflected in the funding rates. According to Shayan, typically, rising funding rates indicate an increase in long positions and market optimism. However, the current decline in these rates signals that traders are hesitant to bet on further price increases. Shayan emphasized that without a significant boost in optimism and a greater influx of long positions, Bitcoin’s resistance at $108,000 could hold firm, potentially leading to a consolidation phase or even a temporary price rejection. The analyst wrote: For Bitcoin to decisively breach $108K, the funding rates must rise further, signaling an increase in optimism and a greater influx of long positions. Without this market-wide enthusiasm, the resistance at $108K could hold, leading to potential consolidation or a temporary rejection. Indication from Long-Term Holders Metric On the other hand, long-term holders—investors who have maintained their Bitcoin holdings for seven years or more—have shown no inclination to sell their assets. Another CryptoQuant analyst reporting this in a post on the QuickTake platform noted: Holders who have held bitcoin for seven years or more sold some of their holdings before the end of the previous bull market. Long-term bitcoin holders have not yet moved their holdings to exchanges. This behavior highlights a trend seen in previous market cycles: long-term holders often remain resilient through price fluctuations, providing a steady base of support for the cryptocurrency.

Amid this, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (previously Twitter) and shared a buy signal for the meme coin. Buy Signal For PEPE In a post on X, the expert noted that a technical indicator named TD Sequential flashed a buy signal for the PEPE meme coin and also hinted that the price could rebound when applied to the 3-day chart.

Data from the spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $9 million worth of PEPE meme coin. This substantial outflow signals potential accumulation by long-term holders, which can create notable buying pressure and fuel a further upside rally that the meme coin is currently experiencing. PEPE is currently trading near $0.00001387 and has witnessed a price surge of over 8.15% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 90%, suggesting immense participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Major Liquidation Areas Looking at the data, it appears that the bulls are the ones currently dominating the meme coin, as they seem to be strongly betting on the long side. Source: Coinglass According to on-chain data, the major liquidation area is near $0.00001359, where bulls are over-leveraged and currently hold $2.50 million worth of long positions. Conversely, $0.00001405 is another key level where short sellers, with $1 million in over-leveraged positions, could be liquidated if the price reaches this level. When combining these on-chain metrics, it appears that bulls are strongly dominating the asset, and $0.00001405 is a minor resistance level that could soon be breached, opening the path for further upside momentum.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,PEPE|TRADING|BTC|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 00:37:52

As Cryptopolitan reported , the company had said at first that they were gonna wait until SEC chair nominee Paul Atkins gets confirmed by the Senate next week. But it seems like they decided not to wait even a day longer after all. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas summed it up perfectly: No trust has ever pulled a “launch-today, file-tomorrow” kind of move before. What’s wild is that there are now four DOGE ETF filings floating around, including leveraged bets. Gary Gensler’s exit from the SEC isn’t even old news yet, and suddenly the ETF industry is looking like a free-for-all. “Man, the jockeying is intense. I’ve never heard of a trust launching and then looking to convert to ETF the same day. But hey they may now be in pole position in the 19b-4 race. Also we now have up to four Doge etf filings (including 2x). Genz has only been gone for like two weeks lol,” said Eric. UPDATE: That was FAST. @Grayscale launched a DOGE trust earlier today and they just filed a 19b-4 to convert it into an ETF pic.twitter.com/IU64NeiPsY — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 31, 2025 What was once just a joke —literally born as a meme—is now getting polished up and taken seriously as an asset. DOGE, derived from Litecoin and indirectly connected to Bitcoin, exploded into mainstream awareness over the years, mostly thanks to Elon Musk. According to Grayscale’s Head of Product & Research, DOGE has become an accessible way for people around the world to make fast, low-cost transactions. And they’re not wrong about the adoption part—Dogecoin’s low transaction fees and rapid speed have made it attractive in emerging markets. Unlike Bitcoin, where fees and confirmation times can leave you waiting and sweating, DOGE breezes through transactions at breakneck speed without gouging users. What’s happening with DOGE isn’t Grayscale’s only power move this month. The company just filed to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF on January 30. They’ve submitted their proposal to the New York Stock Exchange and picked Coinbase Custody as the official custodian for the trust. Grayscale manages over $16 million in XRP through its current trust, and converting that into an ETF would open the floodgates for institutional investors. Think mutual funds, pension funds, and other big players who’ve been hesitant to touch crypto directly because of regulatory uncertainty caused by Gary.

The ETF and securities exchange NYSE Arca filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to propose the rule change. Grayscale, a crypto asset manager, believes converting the trust into an ETF “would provide other investors with a way to invest in XRP on a regulated national securities exchange,” according to NYSE Arca’s filing. The XRP trust has nearly $16.2 million worth of assets under management (AUM) at time of writing. Grayscale isn’t the first firm to make a bid for an XRP ETF: Bitwise Asset Management, the largest digital asset index fund manager in the US, filed an initial registration statement for the product in October, and the crypto ETF provider 21Shares followed suit in November. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs last January, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs for trading in July, and multiple firms, including 21Shares, applied for Solana ( SOL ) exchange-traded products over the summer. Grayscale filed in December to convert its Solana Trust into a spot ETF.

As the market fluctuations continue, traders turn to PropiChain (PCHAIN) as a strategic hedge against volatility. PropiChain, a sub-$1 presale token, is near its all-time low. This offers investors an attractive entry point. The project has already raised over $2 million during its presale token, demonstrating its ability to outperform Ripple and Ethereum in 2025. Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen Sells XRP Tokens The action taken by the Ripple Chairman, Chris Larsen, could add selling pressure to XRP. Larsen has sold roughly $116 million in XRP in 2025 so far after a long holding period. The sale puts pressure on Ripple after XRP spent years under-performing. The sale indicates that Larsen is capitalizing on XRP’s recent bullish momentum. Some traders believe that the Ripple Chairman’s actions mark the top. XRP , the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, is down 4% in the past week. XRP and Ethereum have lost ground this week although leading altcoins have suffered more losses. PropiChain is a Good Hedge Against Altcoin Volatility PropiChain has been tipped to be one of the best hedges against volatility. This is mainly because PCHAIN is near its all-time low, presenting an exciting opportunity for investors. It will also perform better than Ripple and Ethereum due to growing interest in the presale token. The project has already raised over $2 million, with more set to come after listing. As a tokenization platform, the altcoin supports fractional ownership. This tool allows users to buy portions of real estate, making it easy for retail traders to diversify their assets even with minimum capital. With AI at the heart of PCHAIN, the altcoin has practical use cases such as predictive market analysis. With AI-driven analysis, investors can make smart investment decisions. For example, PropiChain’s predictive market analysis would have alerted users that Jupiter (JUP) would make substantial gains after its acquired Moonshot. Thanks to this acquisition, JUP is up 35% this week. Additionally, AI is used in smart contract automation . This feature automates real estate transactions such as auto-leasing and lease renewals. This process reduces manual paperwork, simplifying the lives of landlords and investors. To keep the platform safe for users, PropiChain’s smart contracts have been audited by BlockAudit, one of the best security firms in the blockchain space. Furthermore, the project has automated valuation models, a tool for accurate property appraisals. This offers accurate, fair pricing for any property, allowing buyers and seller to close their real estate deals quickly. The metaverse also allows prospective buyers to view properties digitally using the metaverse. This reduces costs in property scouting. Can PCHAIN Outperform Ripple and Ethereum? An analyst claims that PCHAIN could be a better investment bet than Ripple and Ethereum. The emerging altcoin is up 200% during the first two stages of its ongoing token presale. On the other hand, Ripple and Ethereum are suffering losses as the market loses momentum. PCHAIN is tipped to mirror Ethereum’s 2020 – 21 rally when its price surged from $122 in February 2020 to an all-time high of $4,891 in October 2021. Investors’ Appetite for PropiChain Rises Investors are betting big on PropiChain because it is undervalued at $0.01. The altcoin has raised over $2 million in its ongoing fundraising round, highlighting growing investor confidence in PropiChain. The project has been listed on CoinMarketCap. This has given it extra exposure, a key factor in attracting new investors. The sub-$1 altcoin is tipped to grow by 35,000% in 2025 thanks to its low entry price, growing community, and AI-driven tools that simplify real estate activities such as buying, selling, or investing properties. With investors’ appetite rising, this is the best time to scoop the PCHAIN token for cheap during its ongoing presale. Join PropiChain’s token presale and convert $1K into $350K.

In a letter to the CEOs of Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase (JPMC), US Bank, PNC Bank, Truist and Wells Fargo, US senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) say the lenders have increased the interest rates they charge borrowers while keeping the rates they pay to savings accounts low. “Deposit rates for savers always lag behind the federal funds rate, but this gap is larger for customers of big banks than for regional and community banks.” Warren and Reed are both members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. According to the senators, the seven banks made record profits of $1 trillion in 2023 by “charging borrowers more, paying savers a little, and pocketing interest paid by the Federal Reserve.” Warren and Reed say that the CEOs of the seven mega banks have not kept their word after testifying before the US Senate three years ago that they would increase interest rates for savers. On the CEO of the largest US lender by assets, Jamie Dimon, the two senators say, “When the Federal Reserve began raising the federal funds rate in March 2022, JPMC was very quick to increase the interest rates that it charged borrowers for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. In September 2022, you [Dimon] testified before the Senate Banking Committee that you expected to also increase the rates that JPMC pays savers—albeit at a slower pace. At that time, JPMC was charging 6.98% for a mortgage, and 18% to 27% for a credit card, while paying its customers .01% on a demand deposit account. But two years later and despite your testimony, JPMC’s interest rates have not budged. While the interest rate that JPMC earns on the balances that it maintains in its own accounts at the Federal Reserve has risen from 3.15% to 4.4%, JPMC’s customers continue to earn a negligible 0.01% on their savings.” The two US senators also accuse the heads of Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Truist of keeping the interest rates their savings account holders earn at “negligible 0.01%” despite the lenders generating between 3.15% to 4.4% on their Federal Reserve balances. The CEOs of PNC, Citi and US Bank are also accused of keeping interest rates on savings accounts at 0.02%, 0.03% and 0.05%, respectively, while generating more than three-hundredfold from their bank balances with the Fed.

Solana (SOL): Known for speed, but it hasn’t achieved the exclusive appeal of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Ethereum (ETH): A DeFi giant, but its growth potential can’t match this new token.

Memecoin (MEME) just saw a price uptick of 1% in the last 24 hours, but it’s still down 15.24% for the week. Meanwhile, Ponke (PONKE), which once hit an all-time high of $0.8409, is now 80.5% lower than that, trading at $0.1632. Investors are searching for the next meme coin that won’t just pump and dump but will actually deliver value. That’s where BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stepping in as one of the top new meme coins to join today . Meme coins have gone from internet jokes to legitimate investments, and BTFD is pushing that trend further with its Bulls Squad community, high-yield staking rewards (90% APY), and a full-fledged P2E game that launched on January 1, 2025. Now, BTFD Coin is making headlines by skipping directly to Stage 14 of its presale—burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13. On top of that, the team just dropped a 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100), which means every purchase right now gets DOUBLED. If there’s ever been a time to own the dip, it’s now. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Bulls Are Taking Over Ever wonder what it feels like to be ahead of the market before it takes off? That’s exactly where BTFD Coin investors are sitting right now. The project has already raised over $5.85 million, sold more than 68 billion coins, and attracted 10,000+ Bulls to its community. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. The Bulls Squad is at the heart of this ecosystem, rallying together to take advantage of the market’s best dips. Whether it’s through staking, gaming, or presale gains, this is a squad built for profits. With its presale price currently at $0.00016 per BTFD, early investors are gearing up for a major payday. When BTFD hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006, investors at Stage 14 could see 275% returns. And if it reaches the predicted $0.006 ‘moon price,’ those who buy now could be staring at a 3,650% gain. Let’s say an investor buys $5,000 worth of BTFD right now at $0.00016. That gets them 31,250,000 BTFD tokens. Once BTFD lists at $0.0006, those tokens would be worth $18,750—a near 4x return. If the price hits the projected $0.006, that same investment would be worth $187,500. How to Buy BTFD Coin Set up your bullish wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Load your wallet with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Connect to the presale page and enter the amount to buy. Enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code to double your tokens. Buy and confirm the transaction. This isn’t just another meme coin—this is your shot at owning the dip before it skyrockets. If you’re looking for the top new meme coins to join today, BTFD Coin is making waves with its bullish momentum, staking rewards, and strong community backing. Memecoin (MEME) – A Solid Ecosystem, But Facing Price Swings Memecoin (MEME) is backed by 9GAG’s Memeland and serves as its native ecosystem token. The project has strong branding and a dedicated community, making it a solid play in the meme coin space. Currently, MEME is trading at $0.00708, with a 1% price increase in the last 24 hours. However, it’s been hit hard over the past week, down 15.24%. Despite that, its market cap has risen 3.12% to $267.28M, showing that whales and long-term investors are still betting on it. However, there’s one concern—trading volume is down by 33.47% in the last 24 hours. This suggests that momentum might be slowing. The question now is: will Memecoin recover and push forward, or is it consolidating before another dip? Ponke (PONKE) – A Meme Coin with Character, But Facing Losses Ponke (PONKE) is built on Solana and features a distinct personality. Its “degenerate gambler” character has made it a unique player in the meme coin scene. But despite its entertaining concept, Ponke has taken a beating in the market. The token is currently trading at $0.1632, down 2.22% in the last 24 hours and 22.5% in the past week. Even more concerning, Ponke hit an all-time high of $0.8409 just two months ago—meaning it’s now 80.5% down from that peak. The question for investors is: Is this a prime buying opportunity, or is Ponke still searching for a bottom? Given the recent trends, Ponke could see renewed interest, but for now, investors are watching cautiously. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the most exciting opportunity in the meme coin space right now. While Memecoin (MEME) and Ponke (PONKE) each have their own strengths, they are facing market fluctuations that have made investors wary. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin is gaining serious traction with its Bulls Squad community, high-yield staking, and P2E gaming ecosystem. With the presale price sitting at $0.00016 and a 275% upside to the listing price of $0.0006, investors have a limited window to jump in before the next stage. And with the LAUNCH100 BONUS CODE doubling tokens, there’s no better time to own the dip and get in one of the top new meme coins to join today before it’s too late.

Whales have accumulated 560 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the past week following an intense sell-off, signaling renewed interest from large holders! pic.twitter.com/ObAVfqC9xi — Ali (@ali_charts) January 31, 2025 Data from Coinglass’s spot inflow/outflow metrics revealed that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of $13 million worth of DOGE, indicating potential accumulation and the possibility of buying pressure. However, despite substantial accumulation, the DOGE meme coin hasn’t witnessed any major gains or buying pressure. Traders Rising Interest Besides the strong accumulation by whales and long-term holders, intraday traders seem bullish on the meme coin today, February 1, 2025. At press time, the DOGE Long/Short ratio stands at 1.05, indicating strong bullish sentiment among traders. With all these on-chain metrics, the DOGE meme coin appears bullish, and this could support the coin in gaining a massive upside rally. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bullish as it seems to be forming a bullish double-bottom price action pattern on the daily time frame. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action and historical momentum, if DOGE holds above the $0.31 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 25% to reach the $0.415 level in the coming days. DOGE is currently trading near $0.33 and has experienced a modest price drop of 0.25% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 35%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to previous days.",News|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 01:58:36

XRP, Ethereum, and BlockDAG illustrate its potential. XRP remains a key player in cross-border payments, but its $1,000 price target faces obstacles related to adoption and regulation. Ethereum shows strength in decentralized finance and staking. BlockDAG is making its mark by connecting blockchain with sports through its Inter Milan partnership. These three projects represent diverse applications of blockchain technology and offer a glimpse into its transformative potential across various sectors. BlockDAG’s Football Fusion: A New Game in Sponsorships BlockDAG’s connection with Inter Milan is a prime example of how blockchain can merge with sports. It shows how decentralized systems can integrate with traditional sectors. By tapping into Inter Milan’s global fan base, BlockDAG is becoming a recognizable name in mainstream blockchain adoption. This top rated crypto project has raised over $187.5 million and is currently in batch 27, priced at $0.0248, reflecting a 2380% surge with over 18.3 billion coins sold. Inter Milan’s games, watched by millions worldwide, give BlockDAG a platform. It introduces blockchain to a broad audience. Stadium advertising and branding opportunities highlight how blockchain projects can reach diverse groups. The presale success demonstrates BlockDAG’s appeal. The $187.5 million raised, with over 18.3 billion coins sold, shows its traction. The current price of $0.0248 in batch 27, up 2380% from batch 1, attracts attention. This partnership could lead to fan engagement. Think tokenized collectibles, loyalty programs, and lower transaction costs for merchandise. These examples show how blockchain can improve user experiences while boosting transparency and security. Aligning with Inter Milan positions BlockDAG beyond crypto. It becomes relevant in sectors where community and trust are important. This is more than sponsorship. It is a study in how blockchain can integrate into daily life, creating value. This top rated crypto project is attracting more attention. Ethereum’s Network Growth Resists Market Trends Ethereum’s blockchain has seen growth, with over 206,000 new addresses, the most since October 2022. This happened despite negative market sentiment. Ethereum is important to the crypto world. Its dominance in DeFi and staking shows its key role. The rising number of active wallets suggests ongoing interest in Ethereum’s platform. Analysts point to Ethereum’s technical strength as a factor in handling market changes. While price is affected by perception, the consistent increase in addresses shows Ethereum’s resilience. As the largest player in decentralized finance, Ethereum continues to gain users, cementing its place in the crypto space. This top rated crypto is demonstrating its value. XRP’s $1,000 Target: Examining the Possibility XRP is used for fast, low-cost international payments, especially in banking. However, it faces challenges, including the SEC lawsuit about its status. XRP currently trades around $0.40-$0.50, far below its $3.84 peak in 2018. For XRP to reach $1,000, its market cap would need to be around $50 trillion. This is more than double the current value of all global stock markets. Several things could drive this growth. These include adoption by financial institutions, a positive outcome in the SEC case, reduced circulating supply, and clear regulations. Ripple’s focus on stablecoin and CBDC settlements could also increase demand. However, even in the best case, $1,000 seems unlikely soon. $10-$50 is more realistic in the mid-term. This top rated crypto still has potential. The Future of Blockchain: XRP, Ethereum, & BlockDAG Blockchain’s versatility is clear in the paths of XRP, Ethereum, and BlockDAG. XRP’s potential depends on overcoming regulatory and adoption issues. Ethereum continues to be important for DeFi and staking. BlockDAG, through its Inter Milan partnership, shows how blockchain can go beyond traditional uses, connecting technology with community-driven areas like sports. This top rated crypto is exploring new avenues. Each of these top rated crypto are important to the future of blockchain.

The token’s price jumped from $1.98 on January 30 to $2.37 at the time of writing. Kraken Reintroduces Staking Services In Select States On January 30, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken announced the relaunch of its staking services for US clients in 37 states and two territories. The exchange also noted plans to expand these services to additional states as regulatory conditions allow. Related Reading: Lido Finance Cements DeFi Lead, Expands To Optimism: Is LDO Undervalued? For the uninitiated, Kraken facilitates staking by delegating users’ staked tokens to network validators, who are responsible for transaction validation and block production. These validators then return rewards – minus fees – to clients who have staked their tokens with them. Commenting, Mark Greenberg, Global Head of Consumer at Kraken said the launch of this staking product in the US is a positive development for the entire US crypto industry. Greenberg added: Kraken serves as a bridge so people can access the crypto space and participate in an increasingly broad range of related activities from an interface and platform that they’re familiar with. Onchain staking is a key component of how we fulfill this role and we believe the resumption of staking in the US today will play a significant role in the development and mass adoption of crypto. Following the announcement, LDO experienced a sharp spike in buying activity, propelling its price above the psychologically significant $2 level. At the time of writing, LDO boasts a total market cap of $2.1 billion, making it the 63rd largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Lido Soars 20%, What Do The Analysts Say? LDO’s surge has caught the attention of crypto analysts, many of whom see further upside potential. Crypto analyst World of Crypto noted that LDO is breaking out of both a bullish pennant and a descending broadening wedge. A successful breakout could send the token to the $7–$8 range within a few weeks. Related Reading: Lido Finance (LDO) Is Down 18% In 7 Days, Time To Buy The Dip? Similarly, crypto analyst Daan Crypto pointed to $3 as a crucial resistance level for LDO to break. He attributed the token’s outperformance to investors positioning themselves ahead of the Ethereum staking narrative. They added: It’s just a matter of time before we’ll see the first ETH Spot ETF filing with staking included. That should kick off the ETH & staking narrative and should help boost the performance on these Liquid Staking Derivatives coins. As a token closely tied to Ethereum staking, LDO’s price trajectory remains heavily influenced by ETH’s performance. Fortunately for LDO holders, analysts remain optimistic about an upcoming Ethereum rally. Earlier this month, crypto analyst Mister Crypto remarked that ETH looks ‘bottomed out’, potentially getting ready for a strong rebound. At press time, LDO trades at $2.37, up 19.1% in the past 24 hours.

The Asset management firm 21Shares has filed with the US SEC to launch a spot Polkadot exchange-traded fund (ETF). 21Shares revealed plans to list the 21Shares Polkadot Trust on the Cboe BZX exchange, with Coinbase serving as the DOT custodian in a January 31 SEC filing . This comes four years after 21Shares launched a similar product in Switzerland. In February 2021, the asset manager introduced the world’s first Polkadot ETP on the Swiss SIX exchange. Uncertainty in Price Performance Post-ETF Launch Notably, the filing cautioned that there’s no guarantee of Polkadot’s price performance, either short-term or long-term, after the ETF launches. “There is no assurance that DOT will retain its value in the long or intermediate term,” it stated. The filing outlined potential risks associated with the Polkadot Network. These included a potential increase in the DOT supply available for trading, and the possibility of DOT being classified as a security “under federal laws.” Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted in an X post that the market will decide where value lies and if there’s value in launching such a product. “If no one puts money into a Polkadot ETF, it will close. People are free to launch whatever ETFs are deemed to be allowed by the SEC,” he noted. A Wave Of ETF Applications Ever since Gary Gensler’s departed from SEC earlier this month, the SEC has seen a surge in altcoin ETF applications. Grayscale submitted ETF applications for DOGE, XRP, Litecoin, and Solana. The firm recently launched a Bitcoin Miners ETF. Besides, asset managers Osprey Funds and REX Shares filed to launch ETFs for memecoins like Dogecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), and Bonk, the day after Gensler’s resignation. Also, recently, the SEC granted initial approval for Bitwise Asset Management’s Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, which aims to track the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum in one fund.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,DOT|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 02:13:01

The crypto space is filled with high-potential projects, but only a few truly stand out. Some thrive on hype, while others offer solid technology, real-world use cases, and exponential growth potential. Finding the top crypto presale projects and emerging blockchain leaders can make all the difference in achieving massive returns. Qubetics is making waves as the top crypto presale, attracting major investors with its cutting-edge interoperability technology. Kaspa is redefining blockchain speed and scalability, while Stacks continues to solidify its presence in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Let’s break down what makes these projects so promising. Qubetics: The Top Crypto Presale & Interoperability Leader Qubetics is positioning itself as the world’s first Layer 1 Web3 aggregator, seamlessly connecting blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana. This ambitious vision places Qubetics among the top crypto presale projects in 2025, thanks to its high utility and investor enthusiasm. As of January 31, 2025, Qubetics is in its 19th presale stage, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0606 each. The presale has already raised over $11.5 million, with more than 453 million tokens sold and 17,600 holders onboard. Analysts predict $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, marking a 312.18% gain, with post-launch projections targeting $1, $5, $6, and even $15, offering an incredible 24,630.58% growth potential. One of Qubetics’ standout innovations is its Interoperability feature. Imagine a business seamlessly moving assets between Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin without complicated bridges or third-party intermediaries. Picture a freelancer in Argentina receiving payments in Solana but instantly converting them into Bitcoin to hedge against inflation. This is the future Qubetics is building, making blockchain more accessible, flexible, and practical for real-world use. With its cutting-edge tech and groundbreaking interoperability, Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s the top crypto presale and a potential game-changer in blockchain infrastructure. Kaspa: The Speed Demon of Blockchain Kaspa is quickly rising through the ranks as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain networks. Built on a proof-of-work (PoW) system but optimized for high throughput, Kaspa is solving the congestion and inefficiency issues that plague traditional blockchains. Currently trading at $0.13213, Kaspa has seen a 3.42% increase in 24 hours, with a high of $0.13477 and a low of $0.12700. Analysts predict that Kaspa could hit $0.171776 by February 4, 2025, marking a 30.10% increase. Kaspa’s unique architecture allows for instant confirmation of transactions, making it an attractive choice for DeFi applications, high-frequency trading, and institutional adoption. Unlike traditional PoW chains, Kaspa’s GhostDAG protocol enables parallel block creation, eliminating bottlenecks while maintaining decentralization and security. For investors seeking top crypto opportunities that will lead to long-term gains, Kaspa is a solid bet. Its focus on scalability and efficiency could make it a go-to network for enterprise blockchain solutions. Stacks: The Future of Bitcoin Smart Contracts Stacks has emerged as the go-to solution for bringing smart contracts and DeFi applications to Bitcoin. Instead of competing with Ethereum and Solana, Stacks enhances Bitcoin’s capabilities, allowing developers to build secure, decentralized apps (dApps) while benefiting from Bitcoin’s unmatched security. Currently priced at $1.33, Stacks has seen a 3.01% increase, with an intraday high of $1.36 and a low of $1.28. The platform’s momentum continues to grow as more developers turn to Stacks to build DeFi, NFTs, and layer-2 solutions on top of Bitcoin. What makes Stacks particularly attractive is its ability to bring utility to Bitcoin’s $500 billion market cap. It’s a rare blockchain that aligns itself with the most secure network in the world while adding new layers of programmability and smart contract capabilities. For those looking beyond just top crypto opportunities and aiming for solid long-term plays, Stacks provides an exciting investment prospect. As Bitcoin adoption grows, Stacks will likely benefit from increased developer activity and institutional interest. Conclusion: The Best Crypto Investments for 2025 Identifying the top crypto presale projects and emerging market leaders involves evaluating technology, adoption, and long-term potential. Qubetics , Kaspa, and Stacks each bring unique strengths to the table. Qubetics is reshaping blockchain interoperability, positioning itself as the top crypto presale for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Kaspa, with its groundbreaking blockchain speed and scalability, is becoming a go-to choice for institutions and high-frequency trading. Meanwhile, Stacks is enhancing Bitcoin’s utility by integrating smart contract functionality, ensuring its relevance in the evolving blockchain landscape. For investors looking to capitalize on promising crypto projects, these three cryptocurrencies offer incredible opportunities.

How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN .

SOL, currently trading at $230, generated a revenue of over $116 million in the past month, compared to Ethereum’s $107 million earnings. Solana generated a revenue of about $59 million in December 2024, which translates to approximately a 96% increase over the month. The surge in earnings is primarily due to recent market dynamics, including increased DeFi activities and the influence of President Donald Trump launching his memecoin on the chain. While Solana is experiencing an increase in revenue, Ethereum saw a whopping 39% decrease. The network has also grown exponentially since January 2024, when it only earned about $6 million while Ethereum brought in about $179.6 million in the same period. Solana’s 2025 has been off to a bullish start Solana, known for its high performance and speed in executing transactions has seen significant growth compared to its competitors and is one of the best-performing cryptos of the current cycle all thanks to the massive growth in its DeFi sector, which has attracted a lot of attention, including that of US President Donald Trump. On Friday, January 17, 2025 Donald Trump launched the $Trump memecoin on the Solana blockchain on the weekend before his inauguration. Before then, the network had already positioned itself as a hub for memecoin activity. The $Trump coin was launched under $10, but it quickly rose by over 300% to rally to its peak value of $72 per token and an unprecedented $15 billion in market cap. The $ Melania token launch also helped boost network activity even though it drained some of the value locked into the $Trump meme as investors reverted funds into the second memecoin launched by the Trump family. The success of the $Trump meme leveraged the goodwill from Trump’s campaign, where he gradually established himself as a pro-crypto candidate. On the day $Trump launched, SOL’s price shot up by over 19%, driving the price to $295.3 as the memecoin also drove an influx of new users. $Trump currently trades at $24, down significantly from its $75 all-time high. However, the coin is still trading at over 500% from launch with over $2 billion in daily volume. There was an unprecedented 70% increase in stablecoin supply as new users and money flowed into the Solana blockchain because of the $Trump launch. It is now the third-largest blockchain in terms of stablecoin liquidity. Bitcoin also benefited from the Trump hype, hitting an ATH of $109,071 following his inauguration. Pump.fun outperforms Solana and Ethereum Complementing the effect of the $Trump launch on Solana is Pump.fun, the largest platform for launching memecoins. Platforms like Pump.fun have also been instrumental to the network’s meteoric rise during this cycle. On-chain analytics show that Pump.fun hit an all-time revenue of over $493 million ; on January 30, 2025, it recorded a trading volume of about $295 million. Following the successful launch of $Trump, over 6,000 tokens named “Trump” were launched on Pump.fun. In the past 30 days, Pump.fun has generated $116.72 million in revenue, beating Solana’s revenue over the same period by over $260,000. The frenzy of Trump launches on Pump.fun led to a record $3.3 billion trading volume.

39760928,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=666285,1738378533,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39760928.jpeg,US Federal Reserve official arrested for selling US economic secrets to China,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-federal-reserve-official-arrested-for-selling-us-economic-secrets-to-china/,"A former top dog at the Federal Reserve has been caught red-handed. John Harold Rogers, a 63-year-old Virginia resident and longtime Fed insider, was arrested on Friday after US prosecutors accused him of leaking sensitive economic data to Chinese intelligence operatives. The charges are smuggling classified information through personal emails and hotel room meetings under the guise of teaching “classes” to fake Chinese grad students. According to an indictment unsealed in a Washington, DC federal court, Rogers spent years exploiting his role as a senior adviser in the Fed’s international finance division to access top-secret details on US trade policies, tariffs, and Fed policy announcements. He then quietly passed that information on to his Chinese handlers, who posed as university students but were allegedly tied to China’s intelligence apparatus. Sensitive data, secret meetings, and a $450K paycheck The DOJ alleges that Rogers’s betrayal wasn’t sloppy or accidental, it was carefully planned. From 2018 until his retirement in 2021, the DOJ said Rogers emailed confidential Fed documents to his personal account and printed them out before traveling to China. Federal prosecutors say Rogers handled briefing books for Fed governors, classified reports on trade measures, and insider knowledge of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions—the very committee that sets the federal funds rate, which influences everything from mortgage rates to global bond markets. US Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. said: “President Trump tasks us with protecting our fellow Americans from all enemies, foreign and domestic. As alleged in the indictment, this defendant leveraged his position within the Federal Reserve to pass sensitive financial information to the Chinese government, a designated foreign adversary. Let this indictment serve as a warning to all who seek to betray or exploit the United States: law enforcement will find you and hold you accountable.” The DOJ’s indictment claims Rogers handed over this data like it was nothing, violating strict Fed rules in the process. The motive? Money. Prosecutors say Rogers wasn’t just being nice to China’s government. He pocketed $450,000 as a part-time professor at a Chinese university. But it wasn’t real academic work. The DOJ says the teaching gig was a front, allowing him to travel under the radar and deliver confidential data to Chinese intelligence officials disguised as students. One of the most alarming parts of this case is that Rogers’s leaks actually included data directly related to US-China trade tensions. He allegedly shared insider details on US tariffs, which were being discussed as part of then-President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade war with China. On the very day Rogers’s case became public, the White House confirmed that 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods were being finalized, with China’s coming Saturday morning. China’s role in US debt and why Rogers’s leaks matter This story is bigger than just about one guy selling secrets. China holds massive amounts of US debt — about $768.6 billion in US Treasury bonds as of November, second only to Japan. That makes them highly sensitive to any changes in US interest rates or economic policies. The DOJ says Rogers’s leaks gave China an unfathomable financial advantage. The Fed’s quantitative easing policies, especially after the 2008 financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic, directly affected US Treasuries. By knowing what the Fed was planning, China could position its holdings to minimize losses or maximize gains. Prosecutors accuse Rogers of transferring this information either electronically—through his personal email—or physically, by printing documents and carrying them to China. When questioned in 2020 by the Fed’s internal watchdog, the Office of the Inspector General, Rogers lied. The indictment says he denied accessing or sharing any sensitive data and downplayed his connections with Chinese officials. But by that time, the damage had already been done. The information had flowed into China’s hands for years, helping them navigate critical US decisions without anyone noticing. David Sundberg, Assistant Director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, said: “The Chinese Communist Party has expanded its economic espionage campaign to target U.S. government financial policies and trade secrets.” “This indictment sends a clear message that those who deliberately misuse sensitive Federal Reserve information for their own personal gain and lie about it to investigators will be held accountable for their actions,” said John T. Perez, Special Agent in Charge of Headquarters Operations.

This follows Grayscale’s announcement of the creation and launch of Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. A year ago, a Dogecoin ETF seemed far off, but on Tuesday, Bitwise filed for one, entering the race to offer Dogecoin exposure through an ETF. Coinbase Custody and BNY Mellon to Manage Dogecoin ETF The filign noted that similar to Bitcoin and Litecoin, DOGE can be used to pay for goods and services or converted to fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar, at rates determined on Digital Asset Trading Platforms or directly between users. DOGE is also used to pay miners for verifying transactions on the Dogecoin Network The proposed ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin without owning it directly. Notably, Coinbase Custody Trust Company would serve as the custodian, while BNY Mellon would handle administrative and transfer duties. This follows the firm’s earlier successful moves to convert its Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts into ETFs and highlights the growing trend of companies filing to launch DOGE ETFs in the U.S. Its important to note that the 19b-4 filing is a key step for new ETF listings. After it’s published in the Federal Register, the SEC has 45 days to review and decide whether to approve, disapprove, or initiate proceedings to disapprove the rule change. If necessary, the review period can be extended to 90 days, either if the SEC provides reasoning or if NYSE Arca agrees. Bloomberg Analyst Reacts To Grayscale’s Move Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas remarked , “I’ve never seen a trust launch and then try to convert to an ETF on the same day,” commenting on Grayscale’s move to convert its Dogecoin Trust into an ETF. Previously, Grayscale hinted in an October blog post that Dogecoin was among several assets under consideration for inclusion in future products. The asset manager is ramping up its ETF efforts, as it recently applied to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF and is also pursuing ETFs for major altcoins like Litecoin and Solana.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BTC|LTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 02:56:05

Dogecoin whales are making significant moves while the Shiba Inu price battles volatility. Amid this turbulence, all eyes are turning to WallitIQ (WLTQ) and its explosive growth. With technical indicators predicting an astonishing 37,250% surge , WallitIQ has become the go-to alternative for seasoned investors. No one wants to miss this rare chance for unprecedented gains, leaving Dogecoin (DOGE) and the Shiba Inu price in its wake. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Game-Changer Set To Yield 37,250% Gains This Fall WallitIQ (WLTQ) has been dubbed as the game-changer set to revolutionize crypto investments despite being at its presale stage. According to experts who accorded the digital token this name, its consistent commitment to explosive returns is rare in crypto history. With technical indicators pointing to a 37,250% move , the network has gone viral online and attracted backing from Dogecoin whales and other institutional investors who want more astounding rewards as early adopters. WallitiQ’s (WLTQ) innovative prowess sets a new standard in crypto trading. It recently introduced a Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App for investors to automate transactions, monitor real-time price movements, and access their transaction history. However, this is the tip of the iceberg, as this digital token has numerous technological features. All users on the platform can employ the Artificial Intelligence protocol to make smart money moves and identify suspicious activities in their wallets. Hence, its ecosystem combines its modern technology with high-yielding trading opportunities. The crypto event surpassed the million-dollar mark within a few weeks. However, the predicted 37,250% move by the Technical indicator has increased investors’ interest. With the next bull run on the horizon, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is projected to break more presale records. This prediction also means that the token could surge from $ 0.0420 to almost $16. Analysts say today is the best time to get ahead of the exponential gain and price increment. There is no need to worry about the safety of assets as the network underwent a smart contract audit from SolidProof, just as successful crypto projects do.

It’s a once-in-a-lifetime chance to wealth. Don’t let this one slip away from you. Why Dogecoin Whales Jump Ship From DOGE To WLTQ Dogecoin whales are on the move after Technical Indicator highlighted a past pattern with Dogecoin (DOGE) . Despite the peak performance in December 2024, Dogecoin whales are concerned about the future of this meme coin. An analyst observed that Dogecoin (DOGE) failed to touch the trendline in its latest drop. This recent analysis has raised concerns for the Dogecoin whales, who are now eyeing another token. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Declines By 10%. According to Technical Indicators, the Shiba Inu price declined by 10% on Monday, January 27. While experts believe that this drop is due to a notable figure leaving the Shiba Inu (SHIB) network, the market cap has plunged by $10.6 billion. As of this writing, the Shiba Inu price, trading at $0.00001889, has increased by over 3% in the past 24 hours. Conclusion In a market known for rapid fluctuations, the movements of Dogecoin whales and the Shiba Inu price volatility explain how unpredictable the crypto market is. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the beacon of opportunity amidst this chaos. Technical indicators forecast that the token will record a staggering 37,250% growth to reward investors seeking explosive returns . With its commitment to innovation and unrivaled growth, WallitIQ (WLTQ) will outperform Dogecoin (DOGE) and the Shiba Inu price in 2025.

With meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and SafeMoon bringing attention to the space, new and innovative meme coins are rapidly rising to the surface, bringing even more hype and excitement with them. These meme coins often fuse together viral internet culture, with wild predictions of their massive potential returns, giving investors something to be both excited and speculative about. And speaking of hype, one meme coin that’s particularly causing a stir right now is the BTFD Coin. Currently in the midst of its presale, BTFD is not just another “pump and dump” token. Investors are buzzing about the future of BTFD, and the 90% APY on staking is certainly helping it stand out from the pack. As this viral meme coin presale continues to hit full throttle, it’s got people asking whether this could be the next big thing in the meme coin space. Let’s take a closer look at the top new meme coins for massive return potential that are making waves this year, and see why BTFD Coin might be the one to watch. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – A Meme Coin with Real Utility and Staking Rewards BTFD Coin is undeniably one of the top new meme coins for massive return potential in 2025, and if you’re not paying attention, now’s the time to start. Not only is BTFD riding the wave of meme coin culture, but it also brings a strong case for why it’s more than just hype. One of the biggest selling points right now is its presale, which has already raised over $5.85 million, with more than 68 billion coins sold. And if you want to join the frenzy, it’s not too late. BTFD is offering an attractive 90% APY on staking to its holders, which is a massive incentive for anyone looking to earn passive income. Unlike many meme coins that are simply driven by viral trends, BTFD Coin is bringing something substantial to the table. That 90% APY means you could earn more while holding onto your investment, making this meme coin one that could provide real long-term value. Additionally, with over 10,000 coin holders already backing BTFD, it’s clear that this presale is catching the attention of crypto enthusiasts from all over. The community surrounding BTFD is growing rapidly, and this, combined with the staking rewards, is helping to create a sense of excitement that’s hard to ignore. There’s a lot of anticipation around what’s to come once the presale concludes, so if you’re looking for a coin with both potential and reward, BTFD should definitely be on your radar. How to Buy BTFD Coin During Presale: Go to the Presale Page. Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet).

Moo Deng (MOODENG) – The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves Another top contender in the top new meme coins for massive return potential is Moo Deng, a project that’s bringing some much-needed fun to the crypto space.

Memecoin (MEME) – The Meme Coin that Lives Up to Its Name When you think of meme coins, Memecoin is one that’s definitely worth considering in the top new meme coins for massive return potential.

Memecoin is a fun, vibrant coin that has managed to generate excitement among crypto traders and meme enthusiasts alike. The meme coin market is all about energy and hype, and Memecoin has certainly been able to capitalise on this trend. The coin’s community-driven approach allows for greater participation and engagement, meaning it has all the right ingredients to thrive in today’s meme coin craze.

What sets Ponke apart from other meme coins is its focus on charity and community. While it’s still a relatively new entrant, Ponke’s creators have stated that they intend to use a portion of the funds raised to support various charitable causes. This focus on giving back has helped Ponke cultivate a strong and loyal following. People want to invest in something that not only has the potential for a good return but also contributes to a greater cause.

Top 2 Stablecoins Have Seen Their Market Caps Grow Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the market caps of the top two stablecoins: USDT and USDC. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows the data for the 30-day change in the market caps of the two cryptocurrencies. As is visible in the graph, the 30-day percentage change in the market cap of USDC has spiked to sharp positive levels recently, implying that the stablecoin has been growing at a rapid rate. Unlike USDC, which has seen sustainable growth for the last few months, USDT kicked off the year 2025 with its 30-day market cap change dipping into the negative territory. Since bottoming at around -2% earlier in the month, though, momentum has returned for the asset as the indicator has just turned back green. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Extends To 1.1 Million BTC As Profit-Taking Continues This means that at present, both of the two stablecoin giants are enjoying an increase in their market caps. Historically, growth in these fiat-tied tokens is something that has been bullish for Bitcoin and other volatile cryptocurrencies. The reason behind this is the fact that investors who store their capital in the form of stablecoins generally plan to invest into the volatile side of the market eventually. When they buy BTC with their stables, its price naturally receives a positive effect. The most bullish scenario for the sector occurs when both Bitcoin and the stablecoins witness a rise in their market caps. Such a setup implies both sides of the market are getting net capital inflows. When only one rises while the other goes down, it means capital is merely seeing a rotation between the two. The recent inflows into USDT and USDC have come while BTC has been consolidating sideways. This suggests the capital entering into the stables is fresh, as BTC would have gone down if it was otherwise. At the same time, BTC itself isn’t seeing any direct inflows, hence the flat price action.

Thus, the number of stable deposits into these platforms can tell us about whether large-scaling buying of this type is happening or not. An analyst has shared the data for the metric in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. From the above chart, it’s apparent that the indicator is following a flat trajectory right now. An increase in it, like the one witnessed earlier, may provide fuel for a further rally for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $104,800, down 1% in the last week.

XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), once leaders in the crypto sphere, are now experiencing downturns, prompting doubts about their future viability. On the other hand, Web3Bay (3BAY) , an emerging project in the crypto world, continues its ascent and is increasingly seen as a potential game-changer. Could this be the Next Crypto to Explode? Let’s delve into the reasons Web3Bay is drawing investor interest. XRP’s Challenges: Legal Hurdles and Market Sluggishness Long seen as a heavyweight in the crypto arena, Ripple’s XRP is designed to streamline international transactions. Yet, its progress has been hampered by ongoing legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which cloud its growth prospects. Although there have been some wins in court, the ongoing litigation contributes to uncertainty regarding XRP’s compliance status. Additionally, emerging competitors in the global payment blockchain space pose a threat to XRP’s dominance. Its inability to overcome key price resistance levels makes it a less attractive option for those looking for substantial short-term gains. Dogecoin’s Decline: From Excitement to Caution Dogecoin, known for sparking a frenzy in 2021 through viral social media influence and celebrity endorsements like those from Elon Musk, is now seeing a shift. The market is gravitating towards projects with solid, real-world applications, highlighting Dogecoin’s limited utility. Dogecoin’s reliance on speculative trading rather than technological innovation has resulted in diminished interest. Although it retains a devoted base, the prospects for substantial growth are becoming more unlikely, especially when compared to rising stars like Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s Rise: Transforming Decentralized E-Commerce While XRP and DOGE are struggling, Web3Bay is quickly becoming a significant player. As a decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay uses blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and user-friendly marketplace. This new method poses a challenge to established platforms like Amazon and eBay. Web3Bay removes middlemen, allowing buyers and sellers to connect directly. Transactions are managed with its native token, 3BAY, and secured by blockchain-based smart contracts. Furthermore, Web3Bay offers both cryptocurrency and traditional payment options such as PayPal, appealing to both crypto enthusiasts and the general public. The platform’s presale has significantly contributed to its growth, raising over $1 million so far. Early backers see its potential to shake up the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector, and its appealing presale prices have boosted its attractiveness. Currently priced at $0.004562 in presale, the 3BAY token presents a remarkable chance for early backers. With an expected launch price of $0.1959, investors could see a 4,193% return on investment at launch. If the token hits $0.50 in the future, a simple $1,000 investment now could potentially increase to $10,960, showcasing its potential. Wrapping Up: Next Crypto to Explode The cryptocurrency market constantly changes, with new entries challenging established cryptocurrencies. As XRP and DOGE encounter increasing difficulties, Web3Bay is emerging as a strong candidate for the Next Crypto to Explode. Its fresh take on decentralized e-commerce, solid presale results, and substantial growth prospects position Web3Bay as one of the most promising new projects. With over $1 million already raised in crypto presale and an anticipated ROI of over 4,000%, this offers an exceptional chance for early investors to get involved at the start of a potentially high-growth venture. The real question is not if Web3Bay will succeed, but rather how significant its impact will be. As the platform continues to grow, now could be the ideal moment to consider what might become one of the most profitable investments of 2025. Are you prepared to be part of the Web3Bay movement?

However, he also added that not everyone at the company shares this view. Sam Altman appeared on Reddit for an “Ask Me Anything” session along with his team.

He said, “I personally think we have been on the wrong side of history here and need to figure out a different open-source strategy.” Sam Altman’s reply to a user on Reddit.

The company claimed to have built advanced AI models with training costs amounting to only $5.6 million, sending stock prices plummeting and removing nearly $600 billion from Nvidia’s market capitalization .

Grayscale has officially filed for an XRP spot ETF on the NYSE, and this has investors buzzing. Grayscale has been a key player in pushing forward Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which makes their move toward XRP important. This filing could pave the way for more crypto ETFs. Other companies, such as Canary Capital and Bitwise, have also applied for XRP spot ETFs. There’s even talk about BlackRock potentially submitting their own ETF application for XRP, and Grayscale has also filed for a Solana spot ETF. Meanwhile, companies like 21Shares, Bitwise, and Frank Templeton are considering their own applications for various crypto ETFs, including Dogecoin and Litecoin. The SEC has already acknowledged Litecoin’s ETF application, and while Bitcoin and Ethereum initially launched as Futures ETFs before becoming spot ETFs, Grayscale played a major role in that process. This growing momentum for crypto ETFs is undeniably bullish for the industry, particularly for coins like XRP that might eventually see ETF approval. However , Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has issued a warning, suggesting that while XRP ETFs might be approved in 2025, it’s likely that ETFs for other cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, will be prioritized. He said that the ongoing SEC lawsuit regarding XRP, which argues that the cryptocurrency is a security, remains a barrier to its ETF approval. “There’s some more work that needs to be done on that front that doesn’t need to happen with something like Litecoin.

With their quirky vibes, fun communities, and massive potential, meme coins are everywhere. From viral memes to insane price pumps, they’re capturing the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. And when it comes to top new meme coins to join this week, you bet BTFD Coin is making waves. The best part? BTFD Coin has a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’s catching fire, setting it apart from the crowd. As of today, BTFD Coin has raised an incredible $5.85 million during its presale, with over 68 billion $BTFD coins sold and more than 10,000 Bulls joining the movement. It’s already the talk of the crypto community, and if you’re looking to get in on the action, this is the week to do it. This article is going to dive into why BTFD Coin’s P2E is the feature you need to watch, alongside a few other meme coins like MOG and Cat in a Dog’s World. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution with P2E Action BTFD Coin has an epic Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’s already making waves. The game offers a truly immersive experience where you can earn rewards that are directly tied to the $BTFD coin ecosystem. Not only does this provide additional ways to earn, but it’s an investment opportunity like no other. Imagine stacking up $BTFD tokens while having a blast playing a game—how’s that for winning? With BTFD Coin’s presale price sitting at $0.00016, you’ve got a pretty sweet deal on your hands. For an investment of $2,000, you’ll be getting a whole lot of tokens: At $0.00016 per token: You’ll get 12,500,000 $BTFD tokens. If the price rises to $0.0006: You’ll see a massive return of $7,500 (a 3.75x increase). If the price skyrockets to $0.006: Your $2,000 investment could soar to $75,000. But wait, it gets even better. Thanks to the 100% code ( LAUNCH100 ), you’ll get twice the tokens with every purchase during this presale! With the code, your 12.5 million tokens become 25 million. Here’s how the math shakes out: Your 12,500,000 tokens (without the bonus) turn into 25,000,000 tokens. At $0.0006 per token, your 25 million tokens would be worth $15,000. If the price jumps to $0.006, your 25 million tokens could turn into $150,000. That’s some serious potential, and it all starts with BTFD Coin’s awesome P2E feature. BTFD Coin isn’t just about the P2E game, though. The community is everything. With over 10,000 Bulls already on board, BTFD Coin is all about bringing together like-minded investors who believe in the power of “buying the dip” and building something bigger together. MOG: The Coin for Meme Lovers MOG is the definition of a community-driven project, with a tribe of meme warriors constantly pushing out side-splitting content. If you’ve ever thought about how memes could take over the internet, MOG is the answer. With a market cap sitting at over $450 million, this meme coin is no joke. The community behind MOG is dedicated to pushing the meme game to new heights, and it’s already seeing some impressive gains. At the time of writing, MOG is up by 0.31% in the last 24 hours—proof that the power of memes isn’t going anywhere. But MOG isn’t just about the memes; it’s about a lifestyle. If you’re looking to join the top new meme coins to join this week, MOG is one to keep an eye on. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): The Cat Coin Taking Over Crypto The story behind Cat in a Dog’s World has captured the hearts of meme coin lovers everywhere. This cat-themed coin started as a small project but quickly gained traction, crossing a $1 billion market cap. With its whimsical storyline about a cat named MEW fighting the dog overlords to save the world, it’s not hard to see why it’s so popular. Right now, MEW is down 1.57% in the last 24 hours, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less of a contender. MEW’s price is currently $0.004353, and with a max supply of 88.8 billion coins, it’s a meme coin worth watching in the long term.

This price action is happening just below its recent swing high of $3.40, which was reached on January 16th. In order for XRP to break into new all-time high territory, this level needs to be breached. Short-Term Price Action: Sideways Consolidation Currently, XRP is experiencing a period of sideways consolidation, hovering just below the $3.10 mark. While the price hasn’t made any major upward moves recently, this could simply be a temporary phase before a potential breakout. Long-Term Outlook: A Possible Fifth Wave Looking at the long-term chart, XRP seems to be in the midst of a fifth wave that could complete a longer-term uptrend. Once this wave is completed, it’s possible that the market will experience a correction or pullback. These pullbacks could range from a smaller wave four to a larger and more significant correction. While the short-term outlook looks positive, the longer-term view suggests that after the wave five completes, there may be a major retracement. Key Price Levels to Watch Short-Term Support : The price has been finding support around key levels, especially on January 27th, where a potential bottom was marked in wave two. Short-Term Resistance : The $3.40 area remains a significant resistance level. A break above this would target higher prices, with $4.20, $5, and $6.62 as the next potential upside levels. However, if the price drops below certain levels, it would suggest that the larger wave two correction is still happening. Potential Risks: Break Below $2.52 The market could still face setbacks, as breaking the all-time high isn’t an easy task. If XRP drops below $2.52, it may mean a larger correction is taking place. A move below $2.52 could suggest that wave four is still unfolding as a larger correction, and the $1.96 level would then come into focus.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 04:38:07

Bitcoin (BTC) price showcased a waning movement to reach $102K, whereas Ethereum (ETH) and meme coins witnessed an upward intraday action. Simultaneously, QTUM emerged as the leader of the sector today, witnessing a staggering 40% uptick in value. Let’s take a closer look at some of the most trending coins for the day and broader market developments. Crypto Prices Today (February 1): BTC Wanes, ETH & Meme Coins Up The broader crypto market appears to be digesting the latest PCE inflation data release, which showed a 2.6% increase for December (YoY), per BEA data . Simultaneously, BTC price witnessed a waning action to reach $102K. Further, the global cryptocurrency market cap saw a 1.3% decrease to $3.49 trillion. However, ETH and meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE have illustrated rising trajectories, sparking market speculations. Besides, the global market volume also rose by nearly 16% intraday to reach $121.57 billion. BTC Price At $102K BTC price witnessed a 2% drop at the time of reporting, reaching $102,273. Its intraday low and high were $101,543.88 and $106,026.35, respectively. Bitcoin’s dominance sipped 0.16% from yesterday, reaching 58.08%. Further, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded only $241.28 million worth of inflows over the past week, per Sosovalue data of Jan 30 that excludes BlackRock data. The flagship crypto sees volatility amid reduced institutional interest and broader macroeconomic data release. ETH Price Jumps However, ETH price has gained nearly 2% in the past 24 hours, reaching $3,290. The coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $3,214.94 and $3,437.57, respectively. Notably, the rising trajectory comes against the backdrop of massive buying by ETH whales . Nevertheless, it’s also worth mentioning that U.S. Ethereum ETFs registered outflows worth $73.29 million over the past week, per SosoValue data as of Jan 30 that excludes BlackRock. XRP Price Today Besides, XRP price slipped nearly 2% over the past day and is currently resting at $3.04. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $3.01 and $3.11, respectively. Intriguingly, despite the asset’s price consolidation near the $3 mark over the days, a massive rally looms, per XRP price analysis by CoinGape. With historical trends in mind and the odds of an XRP ETF approval gaining weight, investors remain bullish over future movements. Solana Price Drops SOL price also witnessed a nearly 2% dip in value and is currently trading at $231. The coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $228.48 and $241.67, respectively. The current sluggish movement is primarily attributed to the broader market trend. Meme Crypto Prices Today Besides, the meme crypto sector glimmers immense optimism on Saturday. Notably, DOGE price witnessed a slight gain of 0.5% and traded at $0.3279. Further, SHIB price gained by a notable 2.5% to reach $0.00001903. Also, PEPE price surged by a whopping 7.5% intraday, reaching $0.0000138. Overall, the leading meme coins showcased a rising action despite the broader market trend. Top Crypto Gainer Prices Today QTUM Price: $3.98 24-Hour Gains: +40% Pudgy Pneguing (PENGU) Price: $0.01639 24-Hour Gains: +13% LidoDAO (LDO) Price: $2.30 24-Hour Gains: 12% Neo (NEO) Price: $14.93 24-Hour Gains: +10% Top Crypto Loser Prices Today Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Price: $0.8936 24-Hour Loss: -14% Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) Price: $1.84 24-Hour Loss: -10% SPX6900 (SPX) Price: $1.17 24-Hour Loss: -8.%% Onyxcoin (XCN) Price: $0.03169 24-Hour Loss: -7% Nevertheless, future prospects for the broader market remain bullish as market experts believe the bull cycle has yet to peak. Renowned expert Michaël van de Poppe posted on X , despite the rising inflation, stating that it is very “hard to say that the bull market has peaked.” This statement comes as Michaël spotlights how institutions and the entire U.S. government is interested in Bitcoin and adopting Web3.

In this article, I will share my opinion on how events related to Donald Trump’s inauguration will impact the crypto market, what initiatives might be implemented after February 20, 2025 and what lessons can be learned from years of interaction between the state and digital assets. Trump and Republicans – Monopolizing power and the risks of a split According to some statements, a unique situation is currently unfolding in which Republicans have gained the majority in both Congress and the Senate, as well as in the House of Representatives. This grants them the ability to pass laws more swiftly and confidently and to lobby initiatives, including those related to cryptocurrency regulation, Big Tech and more. However, a monopoly on power carries the risk of internal division if parts of the party find the course too radical or dangerous for their constituents. The role of Elon Musk and potential conflicts Elon Musk is a prominent figure whose statements influence crypto markets , geopolitics and global business. Some commentators suggest the following. Musk is engaging in political games – By supporting Trump, Musk may be participating in political maneuvers that could lead to serious problems for him, including investigations or legal prosecutions from other nations and even the United States. Diverging interests – I f Musk’s and Trump’s interests diverge at some point, Musk risks becoming a target, which could severely impact all his projects. Market volatility – The collapse of ‘Musk coins’ or a sudden shift in market sentiment could trigger a global wave of distrust in crypto, especially among retail and institutional investors. Amnesty for the darknet network founder President Donald Trump signed an executive order for the full and unconditional pardon of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the darknet marketplace Silk Road, who was serving a double life sentence. Many fear that such actions by the authorities could once again shape the media narrative to equate ‘cryptocurrency with illegal operations, fraud and scams.’ This reputation hindered the institutional recognition of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the early 2010s and could negatively affect them now. As a result, here are the possibilities that could occur. Reputational damage to the crypto market – The crypto market could suffer a reputational hit. Institutional investors pulling back – Institutional investors, already wary due to volatility and past incidents, might retreat once more. User concerns – Some users may fear that ongoing legal cases and repressive measures will ‘brand’ crypto as a national security threat (as seen in previous KYC/AML discussions). Tornado Cash and mixers – Double standards or necessary control Tornado Cash allows transactions on the Ethereum network to be mixed, obscuring the trail between sender and receiver. This increases privacy but also introduces risks, such as the following. Illicit use – Such services are often used to launder funds obtained illegally, including from sanctioned jurisdictions. Sanctions by OFAC (The US Office of Foreign Assets Control) – OFAC imposed sanctions on Tornado Cash, deeming it a tool for money laundering to circumvent sanctions. Vitalik Buterin stated that after Ross Ulbricht’s release, the next targets might be Tornado Cash team members Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm. If similar leniency is shown as with the creator of the largest darknet marketplace, it will raise additional suspicions that the new authorities are encouraging gray schemes. Risks for the crypto market and future scenarios 1. New wave of FUD (Fear, uncertainty and doubt) Potential amnesty for crypto market icons – The possible pardon of key figures in underground crypto markets could trigger negative media reactions. Public perception – Society might once again view cryptocurrency solely as a tool for criminal activities and money laundering. 2. Regulatory pressure Increased control – With the strengthening of Republican power and societal disagreements, regulators may begin to enforce stricter controls over crypto operations. New legislation – New laws could emerge that require the disclosure of user data. 3. Influence of major personalities Market volatility – If major players continue to abruptly change their views, pump or dump certain assets, volatility could increase sharply. Political missteps – An unsuccessful political maneuver could lead to lawsuits or impeachment, which would have immediate repercussions across the entire technology sector and further impact crypto. 4. Collapse or restructuring scenario Rebranding as a shadow economy – If cryptocurrency is once again branded as part of the shadow economy, institutional capital might decrease, and the market could enter another crypto winter. Industry cleansing – On the other hand, some analysts believe that after each such period, there is a cleansing of scam projects, and the industry becomes stronger in the new cycle. Conclusion The situation surrounding crypto remains contradictory. On one hand, there are signs of the mass adoption of digital assets. On the other hand, political factors, high-profile criminal cases and amnesties of scandalous figures could revert the market to a state of total distrust. High stakes in the political arena – toxic cases like Silk Road and Tornado Cash, as well as potential conflicts involving Elon Musk – heighten caution. It is not out of the question that in the coming months we will witness significant regulatory changes in the United States capable of affecting the global crypto market.

Parents Make a Direct Appeal (Report),https://cryptopotato.com/will-trump-pardon-sam-bankman-fried-parents-make-a-direct-appeal-report/,"The parents of the disgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried are looking into options to obtain a pardon for their son from former US President Donald Trump, according to a Bloomberg report. Stanford Law School professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried have reportedly held discussions in recent weeks with attorneys and individuals linked to Trump’s circle regarding potential clemency for their 32-year-old son, who was sentenced to 25 years for fraud in 2024. It remains uncertain whether they have directly contacted the White House. Pardon Uncertainty Following the collapse of FTX, a number of its former executives have benefited from sentence reductions in exchange for their cooperation with investigators. For instance, Caroline Ellison, who once led Alameda Research, was granted a reduced sentence for cooperating with prosecutors investigating FTX’s collapse. Sentenced to two years and beginning her prison term in September 2023, she secured an early release by three months. Former FTX executive Ryan Salame also received a sentence reduction – his original 7.5-year term was shortened by a year, with his expected release now set for March 1, 2031, under the First Step Act, which incentivizes good behavior. Additionally, FTX’s ex-technology chief, Gary Wang , and former engineering chief Nishad Singh similarly benefited from a reduced sentence after assisting authorities and managed to dodge prison. Both were sentenced to time served and three years of supervised release. The same cannot be said for Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison on March 28, 2024. The latest efforts to secure Bankman-Fried’s release follow a trend of seeking clemency for prominent figures behind bars. A notable example is Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road darknet marketplace, who was granted a pardon by Trump on January 21st after his supporters campaigned for years. However, Bankman-Fried may not receive the same level of backing as Ulbricht. Speculation about a possible pardon for Bankman-Fried surged in December, largely due to discussions about his Democratic Party connections. Tesla chief Elon Musk further fueled rumors by stating he would be “shocked” if a pardon weren’t granted. Despite this, prominent politicians, including former President Joe Biden, have not expressed support for clemency. FTX Reorganization Plan FTX’s court- approved reorganization plan, which took effect on January 3, will return up to 119% of creditor claims. Under this plan, an initial group called “convenience classes” – which includes users with claims of $50,000 or less – will be the first to receive payments.

However, very few analysts believe that ETH could be ready for a massive uptrend. With Vitalik Buterin’s assurance that the blockchain will never abandon its values and short-term holders capitulating, Ethereum price may be primed for a massive rally to $5,000 in February 2025. Ethereum performance in 2024 was disappointing. In 2025, while Bitcoin (BTC) is up 8%, ETH price today is around -1.4%. However, this outlook might have changed during month-end volatility that caused a massive capitulation. Ethereum Price Crash Triggers Holder Capitulation, Trend Reversal Likely On January 31, Ethereum price rose 5.87%, which was nothing unusual, but closed the day at a 1.65% gain. This sudden uptick and reversal, according to Santiment data , caused a massive capitulation. The Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) indicator flashed capitulation as 601 million ETH were exchanged at a loss. History shows that these capitulations are bottom signals, and price often kickstarts an uptrend soon thereafter. Here are some examples where capitulation was followed by double-digit uptrends: On August 5, 2024, when this indicator flashed capitulation signal, Ethereum price shot up 29% in the next three days. On September 10, 2024, ETH reversed 6% in three days but extended the gains to 17% in the next two weeks. Although the capitulation on November 19, 2024, was relatively small, it led to a 33% rally in the next 17 days. ETH Network Realized Profit/Loss The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio shows a similar outlook to the NPL indicator and confirms that capitulation could be from short-term holders. The 30-day, 60-day and 90-day MVRV that shows the average profit or loss of investors who purchased ETH in the past 30, 60 and 90 days ago sits at 0.62%, -3.88%, -2.36%, respectively. Only the 180-day MVRV hovers around 6.32%, which is the average profit of investors that purchased ETH 180 days ago. ETH 30, 60, 90, 180-day MVRV With many short-term holders sitting at a loss, the probability of Ethereum price triggering a reversal is high. Is $5,000 Possible in February 2025? There are multiple signs that suggest Ethereum price could hit $5,000 in February 2025. The first data point is the historical returns, which indicates that returns in the post-halving years are supporting altcoin rally. Furthermore, the daily chart shows Ethereum price is hovering inside a falling wedge setup. This pattern is formed by connecting ETH’s four lower highs and three lower lows since December 16, 2024. This technical formation forecasts Ethereum price target of $4,000 after a 17% rally. This target is obtained by adding the distance between the wedge’s first swing high and swing low to the breakout point of $3,222. ETH/USDT 1-day chart While the falling wedge is bullish, here are key resistance levels that could threaten the uptrend: $3,592, $3,975, and $4,069. Once the $4,000 psychological level is cleared, ETH will attempt a revisit to its ATH at $4,877. After clearing this level, Ethereum price prediction hints at a retest of the $5,000 psychological level.

This DOT-focused ETF is one of the more unusual crypto ETF applications made to the regulator this week. The 21Shares Polkadot ETF will track DOT prices using the CME CF Polkadot-Dollar Reference Rate. In addition to these updates, 21Shares noted that it will tap Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, which will hold the assets for the ETF product if approved. 21Shares files Polkadot ETF while competition in the crypto ETF space grows As per the S-1 filing, 21Shares said the firm plans to list the Polkadot ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The asset manager noted that the fund is a passive investment that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of DOT. Therefore, 21Shares pointed out that the funds will not conduct speculative trading, for instance, buying DOT low and selling high. 21Shares informed potential investors that it would not pursue its investment objectives through leverage or derivative products. Instead, it will exclusively track the price of DOT as listed on the CME CF Polkadot-Dollar Reference Rate. The firm characterized the protocol as a decentralized, distributed computing platform that functions on a peer-to-peer network. The 21Shares filing follows Tuttle Capital Management’s proposal earlier this week for a 2x leveraged Polkadot ETF, which was part of a broader package of 10 leveraged crypto ETFs. Yet, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas confirmed that Tuttle Capital has withdrawn its filing for all 2x leveraged ETFs. This is not the first time 21Shares’ filing has been featured on the ETF front this week. As reported earlier, the Cboe exchange refiled its Solana 19b-4 application alongside those of VanEck, Canary Capital, and Bitwise. A few hours ago, Grayscale also launched a Dogecoin Trust. The trust offers investors exposure to DOGE with a 2.5% management fee amid rising demand. Shortly after, Grayscale converted the trust filing into an ETF application. This was likely the first time a trust had been converted into an ETF on the same day. Eric Balchunas . Wrote: Man, the jockeying is intense. I’ve never heard of a trust launching and then looking to convert to ETF the same day. But they may now be in pole position in 19b-4 race. Also, we now up to four Doge ETF filings (including 2x). Gensler has only been gone for like two weeks. Eric Balchunas Grayscale also filed ETF applications for XRP, Litecoin, and Solana. The firm recently launched a Bitcoin Miners ETF, which provides exposure to Bitcoin-related companies without directly investing in cryptocurrency. This fund is designed to appeal to traditional investors. Trump’s appointments boost crypto industry, but Polkadot faces setbacks Things have started to look up in the crypto industry since President Donald Trump’s inauguration. First, the president appointed Mark Uyeda as acting Chairman of the US SEC and tapped Caroline Pham as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair. Mark Uyeda is leading the SEC on an interim basis as Paul Atkins, President Trump’s nominee, awaits the congressional process to become the permanent chair. The new appointees have already shown signs of being open to engaging with the crypto industry. In addition to establishing the Crypto Task Force, Mark Uyeda’s SEC has approved its first digital currency ETF product. Given this precedent, speculation is high that most of the newly filed crypto ETF products will also be approved. Interestingly, Polkadot’s price has shown no reaction to ETF news . Polkadot, the 18th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen disappointing price performance lately. According to CoinMarketCap data, its price has dropped by 5.16% over the past 12 months and 10.48% in the last month. The filing highlighted potential risks related to the Polkadot Network, including the possibility of an increase in the supply of DOT available for trading and the potential classification of DOT as a security “under federal laws.” It also cautioned that Polkadot’s price performance, whether in the short or long term, following the ETF launch is not guaranteed. As per the filing, there is no assurance that DOT will maintain its value in the long or intermediate term.

LTC has significantly outperformed LTCN, doubling in value while LTCN remained stagnant, highlighting the fund's premium collapse. With potential approval of a spot LTC ETF under a Trump SEC, there's no reason to pay a premium for LTC exposure through LTCN. Investors must understand the changing landscape for Grayscale funds, as new LTC investment options could impact capital flows and premiums to net asset values. Back in August I covered the Grayscale Litecoin Trust ( OTCQX:LTCN ) for Seeking Alpha. At that time, I called shares in the fund a 'hold' and even suggested longing Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) directly rather than LTCN if speculators were bullish LTC: On one hand, I think LTC is too cheap relative to peers. On the other hand, I think LTCN is too expensive relative to LTC. Despite what, I believe, are flaws in the product itself, LTCN is a fund that I've held long in the past and one that I certainly wouldn't rule out longing again in the future. That said, I don't want to pay double what the LTC is currently worth. I still think the better approach is owning LTC directly over holding LTCN shares. At the time that piece was published, LTCN shares traded at a roughly 100% premium to the net asset value of the underlying assets represented by each fund share. To no real surprise, Litecoin has drastically outperformed LTCN over the last 6 months. Since that early-August article, LTC has more than doubled while LTCN has effectively gone nowhere: LTC vs LTCN (Seeking Alpha) How could this be? In this update, we'll get into what is driving the collapse in the fund's premium, some of the on-chain data for Litecoin, and why I'm actually now willing to upgrade LTCN to a 'buy' from a 'hold.' Why The NAV Premium Is Essentially Gone One day after the general election in the United States, I offered one of the ways I was playing the ' Trump Trade ' for SA readers. Given the outgoing administration's regulatory approach to digital assets, my view for some time has been that a second Trump administration would be far friendlier to the cryptocurrency industry. Resulting in a better fundamental setup for 'altcoins' - essentially, anything other than Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). If there was any doubt about those assertions in November, certainly actions taken in the days leading up to the inauguration when President Trump launched his own memecoin might alleviate any concerns about continued regulatory pressure on the alts. To be sure, we're already seeing asset managers apply for spot ETFs offering exposure to no less than four additional digital assets. Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), XRP ( XRP-USD ), and Litecoin are on the list for the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider. Of which, a Litecoin ETF from Canary appears to be the furthest along judging by a request for public comment. LTCN NAV Rate (CoinGlass) At market close on January 30th, LTCN traded at a premium to NAV of just 4.7%. As of article submission on January 31st, LTCN is down 7% intraday, while LTC is down just 2%. For all intents and purposes, the premium is officially gone. Thus, if you like the investment prospects for LTC, LTCN is no longer a terrible way to express that idea. Of course, we could see LTCN trade down to a discount once again, as it did for most of 2022 and 2023. However, any concerns about such a scenario should be alleviated by the fact that Grayscale has already filed to convert LTCN to a spot fund. Is Litecoin Investment Justifiable? In my view, the short answer is 'yes' if you envision a future with competing digital currencies rather than one where Bitcoin reigns as the only cross-border settlement asset. Litecoin is competitive with Bitcoin in terms of usage metrics like daily active addresses. Over the last 30 days, Litecoin's daily active address figure is roughly 360k - this is just half that of Bitcoin but many multiples higher than competing payment-themed proof-of-work coins like DOGE and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ). Active Address Ratios (CoinMetrics) Where I think LTC makes its utility case quite clear is in the active address ratio. Though it is well off highs from early 2024, Litecoin's 30-day average active address ratio is 4.4%. Meaning, 4.4% of the non-zero wallet addresses that hold LTC are actively using the currency. This is more than 3x the active user base of Bitcoin. 30 Day NVT Ratio (CoinMetrics) From a valuation standpoint, LTC has been left in the dust in terms of network valuation multiple over the transacted value that the network is actually settling. At a 30 day average NVT ratio of just 64, Litecoin is the cheapest PoW payments network by a wide margin. The next closest NVT ratio is DOGE at 145. Bitcoin trades at a 30 day NVT ratio of 188. Meaning, LTC is comparatively cheaper than BTC. Closing Takeaways In my view, it is absolutely critical that investors in Grayscale funds understand the game that they're playing and how the setup in that game is drastically different from what it was three to five years ago. For LTCN specifically, there are implications from not just share lockup expiration , but the simultaneous spot LTC ETF applications from competing financial asset managers. Five years ago if a speculator wanted to get exposure to Litecoin through a traditional brokerage account, LTCN was the only option. Those days are likely coming to a close. With an approval of a spot LTC ETF, and I don't think it takes much imagination to see such a product hitting the market under a Trump SEC, there is absolutely zero reason to pay a premium for LTC exposure through LTCN. And the market appears to have already sniffed this out. Grayscale Fee Flight (Farside) One must also consider the implications of capital flows should new LTC investment options be available for TradFi brokerage accounts. We've seen the Grayscale 'fee flight' problem have an impact on the early net asset flow for the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs. Bitcoin's net flow story was positive in spite of exit pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) holders. It took four months following launch for the spot Ethereum funds to flip to positive net flow. However, the election results were absolutely the primary catalyst driving that sentiment shift for ETH. The same is likely to be true for LTC. I happen to bullish on LTC. For the first time since I started covering the fund, I'm also bullish LTCN.",LTCN|LTC-USD,EN,0,0,LTC|BCH|DOGE|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-01 04:59:26

The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization slipped from a $3.74 trillion high early in the week before stabilizing around $3.7 trillion by late Friday. The crypto fear and greed index dropped 7 points from the previous week to neutral levels at 54, reflecting the lack of momentum prevailing in the market. What happened with Bitcoin this week? Bitcoin remained confined within a tight range, trading between $98,380.59 and $106,462. A few factors can be attributed to the subdued performance, preventing the flagship crypto from retesting its all-time high. The early week jitters came after the world was introduced to DeepSeek, a Chinese-built artificial intelligence model that directly competes against US-made large language models like ChatGPT and Claude. Notably, DeepSeek was created on a fraction of the budget of its competitors, yet it offers comparable performance. As the Chinese alternative rose up app store charts, it sparked fears among the US tech markets, with major companies like Nvidia experiencing a 17% drop, erasing $589 billion from its market cap. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.1%, and the S&P 500 fell 1.5%. This downturn in the stock market spilled over into the crypto space, contributing to Bitcoin’s constrained trading range. Traders remained cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting, wary of a potential hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. However, bulls quickly reclaimed the key $103,000 support level after the Fed kept interest rates unchanged. Will Bitcoin go up? Currently, the report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, set for February 7, is expected to be a major deciding factor behind Bitcoin’s trajectory. Experts state that a strong labor market report would signal a resilient economy, thereby reducing the likelihood of further rate cuts, which wouldn’t bode well for BTC. On the contrary, a weaker-than-expected report could increase the chances of rate cuts, which could be the much-needed push that’s currently lacking in the market. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong, with institutional demand on the rise and its adoption as a reserve asset already gaining traction across various jurisdictions. Several countries are actively discussing its role in their financial systems, while some US states have introduced bills that are currently under consideration. In terms of technical analysis, a bullish case was presented by well-known trader Gladiator, who flagged that BTC had formed a cup and handle pattern on the daily chart. According to the analyst, this could position Bitcoin for a breakout above key resistance levels, potentially paving the way for a retest of its all-time high. Another perspective was presented by pseudonymous commentator CHADXBT, who did not rule out the possibility of an early February shakeout. However, the analyst expects the second month of 2025 to be “bullish overall.” He added: I also don’t think the top is in for this cycle. Ignore the people that say it is! When writing, Bitcoin was breaking past $105,500 but had posted a modest 0.3% loss on the weekly timeframe. Altcoin market lacked momentum Pressured by Bitcoin’s volatility, traders steered away from the much riskier altcoin market this week, which was defined by low trading volumes. Yet the altcoin season managed to climb four points to recover above 50. On X, some pundits speculated about the onset of alt season. Analyst Ash Crypto highlighted a resemblance between the current altcoin market structure and the historical pattern observed in 2020. Ash noted that the overall crypto market cap had broken out of a descending trendline, resembling the early stages of the 2020 rally. This breakout could signal the beginning of a bullish phase for altcoins if the pattern continues to develop as expected. However, broader market conditions, heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, remain a critical factor. Double-digit gains were posted by several of the top crypto projects. The best performers were: Mantra Mantra (OM), the RWA-focused layer-1 blockchain pulled the highest gains this week among the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Source: CoinMarketCap Over the last 7 days, OM rose 47.3%, exchanging hands at $5.30 at press time while its market cap was standing at over $5.1 billion. The gains also came amid a high-volume trading environment, with OM’s daily trading volume rising from around $80 million on Jan. 24 to $523 million when writing. Most of the weekly gains came from the hype of its major partnership with DAMAC, one of the largest real estate companies in Dubai. DAMAC will reportedly tokenize $1 billion worth of its real estate holdings on the Mantra blockchain. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s recent call for the U.S. securities regulator to approve the tokenization of stocks and bonds also acted as a tailwind for OM’s recent gains. Such a move could unlock trillions of dollars in assets within the stock and bond markets, with Mantra well-positioned to benefit from the expanding tokenization trend. Jupiter Jupiter (JUP) rallied 23.1% over the past 7 days, priced at $1.05 at the time of writing. Holding the 78th position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, the altcoin’s market cap was seated at $1.77 billion, with a circulating supply of about $1.68 billion in JUP tokens. Source: CoinMarketCap Most of the gains over the week likely came as the Solana DEX aggregator announced major platform changes at its recent ‘Catstanbul 2025’ event in Turkey. During the event, Jupiter burned 3 billion JUP tokens, reducing the total supply by 30%. The project’s founder also announced that half of the platform’s fee revenue would be used to buy back JUP tokens and lock them in a long-term reserve. Bittensor Recording gains of a little over 20% over the last 7 days, Bittensor (TAO) also made it among the leading gainers of this week. The AI coin was trading at $472.04 per coin with a market cap of over $3.8 billion at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap TAO rallied ahead of the mainnet launch of an overhaul of its integrated tokenomics and governance model dubbed ‘Dynamic TAO’. It replaces static control over TAO emissions, allowing emissions to adjust dynamically based on network activity and demand. A key feature of Dynamic TAO is the introduction of subnet-specific tokens, which will allow users to engage with and support individual subnets.

What Analysts Think!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-officialmagacoin-outperform-solana-in-2025-what-analysts-think/,"While Bitcoin (BTC) proved it’s possible by delivering exponential returns to early investors, the spotlight now shines on OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a newcomer that could replicate such success. With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity.

This 1.2% increase over the past hour reflects renewed optimism in the market. Amid this price performance, Crypto Dan, a CryptoQuant analyst has shared his analysis of on-chain data and market behaviors that may shape Bitcoin’s trajectory in the weeks and months ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Outflows Signal Bullish Strength As Demand Remains High At $100K – What This Means Bitcoin Bullish Market But Caution According to Dan, the amount of Bitcoin held for less than six months continues to show notable growth with each market cycle. This trend suggests that as Bitcoin’s appeal widens, new capital inflows—particularly from the expected introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs—could further drive demand. Dan anticipates that both institutional and retail investors will ramp up their involvement as these ETFs gain traction by the first half of 2025. Additionally, while current indicators remain bullish, Crypto Dan warns that surging interest in Bitcoin and altcoins, paired with an influx of new investors, could signal that the current cycle may be nearing its peak. If Bitcoin pushes through its all-time high with significant momentum, and altcoins follow suit, it could trigger a wave of inflows that may mark the cycle’s final stages. Dan advises investors to start considering risk management strategies.

According to recent Binance data, retail investors have significantly increased their BTC deposits over the past month, with inflows reaching approximately 6,000 BTC. In contrast, whale activity on Binance has dwindled, with their BTC inflows dropping to around 1,000 BTC—a fourfold decrease. Darkfost notes that retail investors often use exchanges to liquidate their holdings, whereas whales’ reduced inflows suggest they are holding onto their Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Enters Ascending Phase After Cup And Handle Formation At $105,000, Here’s The Next Target This contrasting behavior offers insights into broader market sentiment: retail participants appear eager to capitalize on short-term gains, while larger, more established investors maintain a more cautious stance.

Let’s Break Down What Top Analysts Predict,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-could-doge-hit-1-in-2025-lets-break/,"From $120 billion in December 2024 to $88 billion in January 2025, the decline of the meme sector is of concern to its investors. Dogecoin price prediction remains a debate among traders, with many questioning if it is possible for DOGE to reach $1 this year. Analysts have different views on whether DOGE has the momentum for such a move or if other factors could limit its growth. This article examines expert opinions, potential catalysts, and the challenges DOGE may face in its attempt to hit the psychological mark. Dogecoin: The Journey to $1 For the first time in four years, Dogecoin could be ending January without a double-figured price increase. This outlier event has seen the DOGE token drop 8th place on the market cap standings. With Dogecoin trading below $0.35 at a volatility of 6.9%, traders are concerned about the memecoin’s short term capabilities. The Dogecoin price prediction on CoinCodex highlights a 6.89% decline ahead of March 2025. Analyst Javon Marks predicts a potential 600% surge for DOGE , targeting a price of $2.28 based on historical patterns. Given that DOGE stepped out of trend in January, other analysts are not convinced the token would follow the same expectations. However, InvestingHaven forecasts a minimum price of $0.244 and a maximum of $1.445 in 2025. The recent election of Donald Trump and the appointment of Elon Musk as a special adviser have fueled optimism for DOGE . There are definitely parallels to Musk’s involvement in DOGE and historical investment successes. In the past week alone, large DOGE transactions have jumped by 41% and active addresses by 34.91%. The Possibilities are Endless With Panshibi Token traders are looking into Panshibi. The new meme coin has bulldozed its way into the meme sector, with projections suggesting that the SHIBI token could reach a $1 valuation by the end of 2025. This bold prediction is a result of Panshibi’s fundamentals, growing community, and well-designed ecosystem. Some of the driving momentum for its boom comes from Panshibi’s staking model that offers an impressive 1,200% annual reward incentive, making it an attractive opportunity for investors. This incentivizes long-term holding and creates a steady demand for the token. There’s even a governance mechanism in SHIBI, offering a direct voice for its community in deciding its future. Panshibi’s lore and branding also contributes towards its widespread appeal. Set in Bamboo Valley, the Panshibi Pandas represent decentralization, resilience, and innovation. This storytelling aspect has helped establish a strong community that unite against centralization and unnecessary intermediaries. Analysts also point to Panshibi’s security and transparency as major advantages. With a fully audited smart contract by Coinsult and locked liquidity for ten years, the project provides investors with a sense of stability. If current momentum continues, Panshibi’s path to $1 in 2025 may be more than just speculation—it could be a reality. Conclusion The best time to invest in projects is during the early stages of presale. Currently, Panshibi is in its second stage, with SHIBI tokens going for $0.003 apiece. With projections of $1, Panshibi’s worth could soar at least 33,000% in 2025 alone. Anyone could become a millionaire or a billionaire.

33767162,[object Object],1738389617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto Pundit Says Dogecoin Price At $1 Is Only A ‘Matter Of Time’,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-at-1-not-far-off/,"Dogecoin’s price movement remains a matter of discussion among crypto traders on social media , with a well-known analyst pointing to a major breakout pattern that could send DOGE soaring toward $1. Popular crypto analyst Lucky (@LLuciano_BTC) recently shared his bullish outlook with his 2.2 million followers on X, stating that the coveted $1 price target for Dogecoin is now only a matter of time. Bull Flag Pattern Signals Strong Momentum Although Dogecoin has shown strong bullish momentum at various points, it has yet to surpass its all-time high of $0.7316 in this cycle. However, many DOGE enthusiasts remain bullish on the meme coin, with many of them looking forward to an eventual break above $1 this bull cycle. Ironically, Dogecoin hasn’t even broken above $0.5, which is the halfway mark to reach the $1 target. Nonetheless, crypto analyst Lucky noted that it’s only a matter of time before DOGE starts to trade at $1. Lucky’s confidence is based on a technical pattern forming on Dogecoin’s price chart. Sharing his outlook in a post, he highlighted a bull flag formation on the daily candlestick timeframe. Interestingly, this bull flag has been in formation since November 2024, making it a multi-month pattern. The pattern began with a strong rally in mid-November until it reached a multi-year high of $0.484 in early December before facing rejection. Since then, price action has shifted into the flag phase of the structure, characterized by a period of corrections and bounces off the upper and lower trendlines of the flag. The formation of a bull flag is regarded as a strong signal for further upside, especially in bullish market conditions. If the meme coin breaks out of this structure with enough volume, it could set the stage for a sustained rally to new multi-year highs. As DOGE continues to build momentum within this setup, crypto analyst Lucky noted that the rally ahead “could be epic.” Can Dogecoin Really Reach $1? Reaching the $1 target would be a crazy milestone for Dogecoin, much like how Bitcoin broke above $100,000 for the first time this cycle. At the time of writing, the meme coin is trading at $0.3289 and has a market cap of $48.6 billion. If it were to reach the $1 mark, this would translate to a total market cap of about $147.8 billion. Although some might find this unrealistic due to its status as a meme coin, calculations suggest a $1 price for Dogecoin is surely possible. It only needs a few stimulants for this to happen. One such stimulant is a Dogecoin ETF, which could have the same effect as it did for Bitcoin. If approved, a Dogecoin ETF could significantly increase investment inflows and create sustained buying pressure for the meme coin. Another factor that could improve Dogecoin’s rise is broader utility, particularly if it becomes an official payment option on a major platform like X. Dogecoin at $1 is only a matter of time . However, it is also possible that DOGE could start to consolidate around this mark once it eventually attains it, similar to Bitcoin’s current behavior around $100,000 .",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|bitcoin|Bull Flag Pattern|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin ETF|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Lucky|meme coin,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-01 06:00:17

The BTC price is trading 2.17% down at $102,222 with daily trading volumes surging 14% to more than $44 billion. Bitcoin has been oscillating in the range of $101K-$106K for a while and breaking either end of this range would exacerbate a move in that direction. Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash Amid Tariffs Financial investor Robert Kiyosaki has weighed in on the potential impact of tariffs introduced under former President Donald Trump. He predicts a significant downturn coming for assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Kiyosaki stated that while these assets may experience a sharp decline, however, he views the situation as an opportunity to accumulate more. In his X post, Kiyosaki noted : “TRUMP TARRIFS BEGIN: Gold, silver, Bitcoin may crash. GOOD. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is DEBT….which will only get worse. CRASHES mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer”. Earlier this week, popular analyst Arthur Hayes also predicted a “mini financial crisis” in the making expecting a Bitcoin price crash to $70,000, before the mega bull run begins for $250K. BTC On-Chain Indicators Apart from Robert Kiyosaki’s views, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode has identified a significant price cluster for Bitcoin. It revealed that a substantial volume of BTC has exchanged hands in the $94,000 to $101,000 range over the past 45 days. This has created a dense supply zone, with $98,000 emerging as a pivotal support. As long as Bitcoin price stays above this support, the upward momentum could continue. Falling under $98,000 could open the gates for new lows to $90,000 and more. Source: Glassnode Trump Tariffs and Macros Under Radar As Trump tariffs are likely to go into effect starting February 1, investors can expect strong market volatility in the next week. Furthermore, the crypto market reaction will largely depend on next week’s US jobs data . “Tariffs may cause short-term disruption, but I’m not concerned about market reaction,” Trump remarked, underscoring his confidence in the long-term benefits of the policy. The DeepSeek disruption is also challenging the US AI dominance and Trump seems all prepared to put tariffs on chip exporters to China. “Eventually we are going to put tariffs on chips,” he added. Commenting on the DeepSeek saga, Robert Kiyosaki said: “The world is about to be turned upside down. Grateful Trump is President again”. This week, the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged amid a strong labor market and growing inflationary pressure. Although President Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, Fed Chair Jerome Powell refused to budge. Despite this strong market development, Bitcoin price has shown strength holding above $100K levels.

She observed that many cryptocurrency investors also have a strong relationship with God. Her post suggested that this was more than just coincidence—that there might be a deeper, divine reason behind it. The idea resonated with many in the XRP community, leading to a discussion about how faith influences financial decisions and how some investors feel guided by God toward XRP for a higher purpose. Faith-Driven XRP Investments Several XRP holders responded to The XRP Girl’s post with similar experiences. One individual stated , “I found XRP through Jesus. My faith and my crypto journey have been walking hand in hand.” Another commented , “I think it’s because God is blessing those of us that know we are just stewards of the money for His purposes.” For these investors, their faith is not separate from their financial choices. Instead, they see their involvement in XRP as a path guided by divine influence. Some also believe their ability to remain patient and navigate market fluctuations reflects their trust in God’s higher plan. Many in the XRP and broader crypto community are Christians, and well-respected Christian prophets have also shared prophecies on XRP’s future. Brandon Biggs, a prophet who predicted the assassination attempt on U.S. President Donald Trump, previously shared a revelation from God that XRP can reach $10,000 . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Viewing Wealth as a Responsibility A key theme among these faith-driven investors is stewardship—the belief that wealth should be used for a greater purpose. Rather than viewing XRP solely as a means of personal financial gain, some investors believe they must use any potential profits to help others. This perspective shifts the focus from mere accumulation to purposeful financial management. This belief was further reinforced when The XRP Girl posted again on January 31, writing: “Whether Crypto is involved in the beast system or not, I know in my heart, God has brought me towards XRP for the purpose of good.” Her statement suggests that, despite uncertainty about the future of cryptocurrency, she remains confident that her investment in XRP is part of a larger divine mission. Other Christian prophets have weighed in on a potential dominant future for XRP , and for those who see their investment as part of a divine plan, it is not just about financial returns, it is about fulfilling a higher purpose.

Before and after returning to office, he has repeatedly suggested imposing tariffs. Also, Tariffs could impact inflation by driving prices up. This, in turn, might affect the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates in the near future and beyond. Recently, Crypto saw a repeat of previous trends after a report about a tariff delay was quickly dismissed by the White House, indicating that market’s optimism was once again short-lived. Trump’s Tariff Announcement Sends Bitcoin Lower President Trump announced Thursday that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would start on February 1. Bitcoin, which had surged over $106,000, fell 2% to around $104,000 after the news. U.S. stocks gave up some gains but still ended the day higher. “The President will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada, and a 10% tariff on China for the illegal fentanyl that they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said during a White House press briefing. BREAKING: Karoline Leavitt confirms that the Reuters report is FALSE. Tomorrow, Feb 1st is the deadline for the tariffs There will be a 25% tariff on Canada, a 25% tariff on Mexico, and a 10% tariff on China No clarification on exemptions They will be LIVE in under 24 hours pic.twitter.com/7pzV9pblD9 — Autism Capital (@AutismCapital) January 31, 2025 On Friday, Reuters reported that tariffs would be delayed until March 1, with a process allowing countries to request exemptions for certain exports. However, the White House quickly rejected this, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirming that the tariffs, including a 10% levy on China, will take effect the next day. Notably, Trump’s tariffs and possible retaliation from Canada and Mexico could affect $1.6 trillion in North American trade, potentially ending the free trade system that has connected the three countries for over 30 years. Like Thursday, Bitcoin had risen above $106,000 and appeared ready to break the $109,000 mark. However, the tariff news caused prices to tumble down again, with Bitcoin trading just under $103,000, down 2.3% in the past 24 hours.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 06:18:45

Meanwhile, the delisting process will unfold in multiple stages, with automatic conversions of remaining holdings set for March 31, 2025. Kraken’s Delisting Plan and Timeline Recently Kraken emailed its users confirming that it will delist Tether (USDT) along with PayPal USD (PYUSD), Euro Tether (EURT), TrueUSD (TUSD), and TerraUSD (UST) stablecoins for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Damn, @Kraken is delisting USDT for Europeans on March 31st pic.twitter.com/FOlqu4DrV3 — Delta (@deltaxbt) January 31, 2025 The delisting process will begin on February 13, 2025, with margin trading for these assets being placed in “reduce-only” mode for EEA clients, meaning no new positions can be opened. Following this, spot trading will transition to a “sell-only” mode by February 27, preventing users from opening new positions with these stablecoins. Meanwhile, by March 17, any open margin positions involving these stablecoins will be closed automatically. All spot trading will cease by March 24, with all remaining orders canceled. Finally, after March 31, any remaining holdings in these stablecoins will be automatically converted to a compliant asset. Why Is Kraken Taking This Step? Kraken’s decision follows increasing pressure from European regulators under the MiCA framework, which introduces stricter rules for stablecoin issuers and exchanges. The exchange operates in several European countries, including Germany, Spain, Italy, and France, and is adjusting its services to ensure compliance with these new regulations. Thus users are encouraged to convert their affected holdings before the deadline to avoid automatic conversions. Other Major Exchanges Delisting Too Kraken is not the first major exchange to take such steps—Coinbase and Crypto.com have also announced plans to phase out support for USDT in Europe. While Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, the company thrives globally. In 2024, Tether reported a record-breaking $13 billion in net profits. Additionally, El Salvador recently welcomed Tether’s expansion, allowing the company to set up its headquarters in the country. Despite losing ground in the European market, Tether’s dominance in the crypto space remains strong.",News,EN,0,0,USDT|EXCHANGE|PYUSD|TRADING|TUSD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 06:25:35

Among them, Qubetics stands out the most, with its $TICS presale exploding past $11.5 million in raised funds and more than 453 million tokens sold to over 17,600 holders. With mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, early adopters are locking in their positions before prices soar. Let’s break down why these three projects are poised to ride the next bull run crypto wave. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Asset Tokenization for a Decentralized Future One of the biggest problems in finance today is illiquidity—assets like real estate, luxury goods, and fine art are difficult to trade, requiring expensive intermediaries and long settlement times. Qubetics is tackling this issue head-on with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace , which converts real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens, allowing them to be fractionally owned, traded, and instantly settled. Imagine owning a fraction of a high-rise property in Dubai, a Picasso painting, or a gold reserve—without the need for banks, brokers, or excessive fees. With Qubetics, these assets can be digitized, fractionalized, and traded on-chain with full transparency. This democratizes access to exclusive investment opportunities that were once reserved only for the ultra-wealthy. This innovation extends beyond individuals; institutions can use Qubetics’ platform to tokenize their own assets, unlocking new liquidity streams and expanding their investment reach. Whether it’s a private equity firm tokenizing a $100 million real estate fund or a company selling equity-backed digital securities, Qubetics is building a system where asset ownership is as simple as buying a cryptocurrency, making it the next bull run crypto . With smart contract automation, transactions that used to take weeks or months can now be settled in seconds. And thanks to blockchain’s immutable ledger, Qubetics offers unparalleled security, fraud resistance, and transparency, making it one of the most groundbreaking financial applications of Web3 technology today. Qubetics Presale: Investors Rushing to Get In Before the Price Surge The Qubetics presale is moving fast, and investors are locking in their positions before prices increase again. The presale follows a strict schedule, with each stage lasting only 7 days and a 10% price increase happening every Sunday at 12 AM. Right now, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0606, but prices will continue to rise as the presale nears its final stages. Analysts are predicting massive growth for $TICS, with forecasts suggesting it could hit $0.25 post-presale, delivering a 312% ROI. But the real gains could come after launch, with some projections placing $TICS at $1 (1548% ROI) or even $10 long-term (16,387% ROI). For example, an investor putting $1,000 into Qubetics at its current price would secure 16,501 tokens. If $TICS reaches $5 post-mainnet launch, that same investment would be worth $82,505—an absolutely mind-blowing return. With Qubetics’ mainnet scheduled for Q2 2025, this presale could be one of the last opportunities to buy at this price level before adoption accelerates. TICSScan: Boosting Transparency and Security in Web3 To enhance trust and transparency, Qubetics has launched TICSScan, its proprietary blockchain explorer. This platform allows investors, developers, and businesses to monitor transactions, verify asset ownership, and ensure compliance with on-chain audits. For example, an investor purchasing tokenized real estate on Qubetics can use TICSScan to confirm asset transfers, validate smart contract executions, and verify market liquidity. This level of visibility is unprecedented in traditional finance, giving investors full control over their on-chain assets. With blockchain adoption growing, TICSScan is set to play a vital role in increasing institutional trust in digital asset ownership. Internet Computer: Redefining How the Web Operates While Qubetics is revolutionizing asset trading, Internet Computer (ICP) is taking on an even bigger challenge—fixing the internet itself. Instead of relying on centralized cloud providers like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, ICP offers a fully decentralized web infrastructure where developers can build websites, dApps, and services without relying on traditional hosting. Right now, ICP is trading at $9.15, and the network is seeing increased adoption due to its scalability, speed, and reduced reliance on big tech corporations. Developers are using ICP to create decentralized applications that cannot be taken down or censored, making it one of the most promising next-gen blockchain ecosystems. With more developers migrating to decentralized hosting solutions, ICP is positioned to gain significant momentum in the next bull run. Filecoin: Solving the Global Data Storage Crisis In today’s world, centralized storage solutions are vulnerable to hacking, data loss, and corporate manipulation. Filecoin solves this by offering a fully decentralized cloud storage network, where users can rent out unused storage space to earn FIL tokens. Currently, FIL is trading at $4.75, with growing institutional demand for secure, censorship-resistant storage solutions. Recent partnerships with the Internet Archive and academic institutions have strengthened Filecoin’s use case for preserving critical data permanently. As data security becomes a bigger concern, Filecoin’s adoption is expected to skyrocket, making it a strong contender in the next bull run. Conclusion The crypto market is evolving, and Qubetics, Internet Computer, and Filecoin are leading the charge toward decentralized finance, web hosting, and data storage solutions. Qubetics is breaking barriers in real-world asset tokenization, making it easier for individuals and institutions to trade tokenized real estate, commodities, and financial instruments. Internet Computer is revolutionizing web hosting, offering a decentralized alternative to big tech-controlled cloud services. Filecoin is building a censorship-resistant data storage network, ensuring data sovereignty in a digital age. But if you’re looking for the biggest next bull run crypto , Qubetics’ $TICS presale is the clear winner. With weekly price increases every Sunday at 12 AM, early investors have a limited window to buy before the next surge.

Analysts Say Bitcoin Will Continue Sideways Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-the-crypto-market-satiated-for-now-analysts-say-bitcoin-will-continue-sideways-move/,"As the first month of 2025 comes to an end, Bitcoin (BTC) continues moving within its post-US election price range but nears two historical closing candles. Some analysts weighed in on the market’s state, suggesting that it could be satisfied with good news for the time being. Related Reading: SUI Rally Eyes Double-Digits: VanEck Analyst Forecasts $16 Price By Year-End Bitcoin Near Historical Monthly Candle Despite the recent corrections, Bitcoin has been moving inside the $90,000-$108,000 range since December 2024, consolidating within the mid-zone of its price range for most of this period. Some analysts have pointed out that the flagship crypto has had a decent performance this month, not staying away from the $100,000 mark for long. Moreover, its recent recovery of the $104,000-$105,000 range is setting the stage for a historical monthly and weekly candle. As noted by analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin is hours away from closing the month above the $100,000 barrier for the first time and “printing a new Monthly Candle to confirm a breakout from its Monthly Bull Flag.” Additionally, Bitcoin could see a “historic Weekly Close” if it ends the week above $104,416. According to the analyst, similar closes above major weekly resistances at this point of the cycle have historically preceded a “continued upside to new all-time highs.” Nonetheless, Rekt Capital has also pointed out that BTC is most likely preparing for the second leg of its Post-halving Parabolic Phase, which suggests that a new Price Discovery rally could start mid-February. The second leg has historically started around the 16th week of the Parabolic Phase, the analyst explained, while BTC is currently in the 14th week, recovering from the First Price Discovery Correction. Based on this timeline, the flagship crypto is expected to continue gearing up for the rally for another week and a half, and investors are advised to “patiently HODL” BTC. Is The Crypto Market’s Confidence Shaken? Another market watcher noted that Bitcoin has been “stuck in rage for a while now,” adding that he expected to see some bullish momentum after the FOMC news. The trader considers that the lack of significant price movement suggests BTC’s price will “be sideways for the coming few days.” Recently, Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research Analyst at Nansen, weighed in on the market’s current state. Barthere suggested that the market appears to be “satiated for now,” as most of the recent bullish news has been seemingly overlooked. The report highlighted the latest regulatory changes, including the overturn of SAB 121 and the executive order for a US Crypto Stockpile, have been “extremely bullish” and will likely facilitate a wider crypto adoption. Additionally, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is reportedly considering public blockchain to track and manage public expenses. However, the news has been ignored and followed by “underwhelming price action by BTC and the rest of the crypto market.” This suggests that the market is momentarily satiated and “more reactive to negative sentiment than positive news.” Barthere pointed out how the DeepSeek-triggered pullback from Monday bled into the crypto market.

Based on the price and volume action right after the shakeout, the analyst noticed “that ‘buyers’ confidence has been somewhat shaken,” resulting in an initially timid recovery. Nonetheless, unlike other higher-beta tokens, Bitcoin had a shallow and brief intra-day sell-off on Monday, which “shows an interesting level of ‘dispersion’ between tokens, with BTC still the darling token of this new, policy-driven, market environment.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Bullish Breakout|Bitcoin correction|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto analyst|Crypto Bull Run 2025|crypto market|crypto market correction|Crypto trader|Nansen,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-01 06:30:10

Since there are many tokens, it’s hard to pick out the best ones. Here, we highlight five crypto assets to buy. These tokens stand out for their innovation, community engagement, or established market presence: Solana , Cardano , Litecoin , Ethereum , and the intriguing Panshibi . Each of these assets has its strengths, but one in particular: Panshibi, merits special attention for its potential in the meme coin sector. Let’s take a look at these tokens Solana: Speed and Scalability Solana is known for its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second. Today, Solana has become a go-to platform for developers looking to create high-performance decentralized applications (dApps). Investors eyeing a crypto asset to buy might find the Solana ecosystem appealing. It features various DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces which are always busy. As one of the trending tokens, Solana’s continuous tech upgrades and expanding use cases make it an exciting prospect for February. Cardano: The Future of Blockchain Governance Cardano distinguishes itself with its approach to blockchain development. This platform simply aims for security and sustainability. With the help of the Ouroboros protocol, Cardano offers a proof-of-stake system that is both efficient and scalable. This has drawn interest from those concerned with environmental impact. Cardano has also been making strides in DeFi and smart contract capabilities. This gives it a perfect position as a crypto asset to buy for those who value long-term stability and potential. Litecoin: The Digital Silver Litecoin is known as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold. It offers quicker transaction times and a different hashing algorithm (Scrypt). Since its design makes it more accessible for everyday transactions, investors find it easier to use. Also, Litecoin integration of technologies like MimbleWimble for privacy ensures it remains relevant. For investors looking for a crypto asset to buy , Litecoin makes a compelling choice. As one of the trending tokens , Litecoin may continue to attract attention. Ethereum: The Backbone of Defi Ethereum is a part of the foundation of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) . With the transition to Ethereum 2.0, the network promises to tackle scalability issues and reduce energy consumption. This evolution enhances the performance of Ethereum and increases its appeal as a crypto asset to buy . For those tracking trending tokens , Ethereum’s extensive developer community and the constant innovation keeps it at the forefront of blockchain technology. Ethereum is not stopping anytime soon, and most investors should know that. Panshibi: The Meme Coin Sensation Panshibi is a cultural phenomenon that offers the charm of pandas coupled with the Asian culture.It integrates social-fi and AI to engage its community, offering token holders the chance to participate in quests, earn rewards, and gain access to exclusive clubs. Panshibi’s presale strategy is particularly noteworthy, with a cap at $10 million over 60 days, which is designed to increase token value significantly. Also, the project’s commitment to transparency and security is evident from its smart contract audit by Coinsult, ensuring no vulnerabilities. With 60% of its total supply dedicated to the presale, early investors have a unique opportunity. In addition, Panshibi’s plan to list on major exchanges like Uniswap shows a clear path to liquidity. Since the token’s price structure is expected to rise to 1,200% during presale and potentially 145,000% post-launch, Panshibi positions as a high-reward crypto asset to buy . The community’s enthusiasm, reflected on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and the strategic locking of liquidity and team tokens for 10 and 2 years respectively means Panshibi’s is here to stay. Conclusion Solana , Cardano , Litecoin , and Ethereum each offer unique advantages, from speed and scalability to academic rigor and market longevity. However, Panshibi’s approach to offer community, utility, and fun in one meme coin makes it the standout crypto asset to buy this February. With a robust presale structure, a clear roadmap for growth, and a vibrant community, Panshibi is not just a trend but potentially a market leader in the making. For those looking to capitalize on the next big thing, Panshibi could well be that gem among the trending tokens .

SAB 121 rollback celebrated, but broader regulatory alignment remains crucial. Traditional accountants criticized SEC’s SAB 121 for violating established GAAP standards. The rollback of the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 is a big win for both the U.S. crypto and banking industries. This decision removes a major obstacle that complicated U.S. banks’ ability to offer digital asset custody services. This change has been praised by many, especially in the crypto sector, who saw the original guidance as an unnecessary hurdle. But while this rollback is a definite victory, experts caution that further action is needed to ensure full industry integration.

The news was shared by crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) on X, generating significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community. BREAKING: PURPOSE INVESTMENTS INC, THE LEADER BEHIND THE FIRST BTC ETF & ETH ETFs, FILES PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS FOR THE WORLD‘S FIRST #XRP ETF! https://t.co/oFCxGg7Z7i pic.twitter.com/HQCKARbdkr — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) January 31, 2025 If approved, the Purpose Investments XRP ETF would provide institutional and retail investors with regulated access to XRP without the need to directly hold or manage the digital asset. This development follows a growing trend of major financial firms seeking to establish cryptocurrency ETFs, which aim to offer investors exposure to digital assets while mitigating risks associated with direct ownership. The filing by Purpose Investments indicates growing confidence in XRP as a viable investment option. This move also suggests that financial institutions recognize the increasing demand for diversified crypto investment vehicles beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Growing Interest in XRP ETFs The news of Purpose Investments’ filing comes amid a surge in interest surrounding XRP ETFs. Major firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares, began filing for XRP ETFs in January 2025, and Donald Trump’s election victory and return to the White House has increased confidence of the crypto community that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon approve these investment products. XRP gains traction as an institutional-grade asset, supported by its efficiency in cross-border payments and blockchain technology. The interest from multiple asset management firms suggests that XRP is recognized as a valuable component of the evolving digital asset market. Ripple’s president has publicly stated that XRP is next in line for ETF approval. She also believes the new administration will speed up the approval process. The introduction of these products would complement Ripple’s broader efforts to integrate XRP into global financial systems. Purpose Investments’ decision to file for an XRP ETF represents a significant milestone for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency industry. With firms like Purpose Investments, Grayscale, and CoinShares actively pursuing XRP ETFs, it is clear that demand for regulated investment vehicles tied to the asset is on the rise. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously described XRP ETFs as inevitable . With a crypto-friendly White House and SEC, the crypto world expects sensible and favorable crypto regulation, and 2025 could be the year XRP’s mainstream adoption soars through ETFs.

The meme coin is up by 6.74% over the past 24 hours, still it unclear what lies ahead for its long-term growth. Unlike emerging blockchain sectors such as DeFi, PayFi, and AI, which offer tangible use cases, PEPE’s primary driver is market sentiment. Without a sustainable use case or technological foundation, its potential for exponential growth appears limited.

Solana’s SOL: The Fast Lane of Blockchain Technology Solana is a blockchain platform built for speed and scalability. It offers a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps), standing alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. What sets Solana apart is its ability to process transactions quickly without relying on techniques like sharding or second-layer solutions. Developers can use multiple programming languages, making it flexible and accessible for building diverse projects. At the heart of Solana’s ecosystem is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. In the current market, SOL attracts attention due to its high-capacity network that can handle high-activity services without slowing down. While other platforms work on improving their scalability, Solana provides a fast alternative now. For those watching market trends, SOL’s technology and potential make it a notable player in the evolving world of cryptocurrencies. Chainlink: Connecting Blockchains to the Real World Chainlink is building bridges between blockchains and real-world data. It allows smart contracts to access information outside the blockchain securely. This means contracts can react to events like stock prices, weather updates, or sports results. Chainlink uses a network of “oracles” to fetch this data. To ensure accuracy, it combines information from multiple sources and rewards reliable data providers with its token, LINK. In today’s market, Chainlink stands out by solving a key problem: bringing external data into blockchains. As more industries explore blockchain technology, the need for trustworthy data connections grows. LINK tokens play a vital role in this system. They reward those who provide accurate data and help keep the network secure and decentralized. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Chainlink offers unique value by enhancing what smart contracts can do. With its practical use and growing importance, Chainlink looks promising in the current market cycle. Conclusion While SOL and LINK offer strong potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) distinguishes itself with a unique sports-meme ecosystem, poised for significant growth in the ongoing bull run.

Recent on-chain data revealed that whales accumulated 560 million Dogecoin, signaling a potential rally for DOGE price to $1. Further, in the wake of Grayscale’s new DOGE-backed Trust’s launch, investor sentiments surrounding the meme-themed asset have undergone a paradigm bullish shift. Dogecoin Whales On Buying Spree Signal Bullish Move Ahead In an X post by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez on February 1, it was spotlighted that Dogecoin whales purchased 560 million tokens in the past week. This massive buying signals heightened market confidence in the asset. Source: Ali Charts, X Notably, the analyst reveals that the buying spree follows an intense sell-off recently, thus flagging renewed interest among large-scale investors. As a response, broader market participants anticipate a bullish move ahead, primarily amid rising demand and buying pressure. Further, it’s also worth pointing out that CoinGape previously highlighted rising DOGE whale accumulations . Grayscale’s New Trust Launch Solidifies Market Optimism Meanwhile, the launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust has offered additional market support to the dog-themed meme crypto. The launch of a traditional financial investment product backed by a meme-themed asset paves the way for further money inflow into the crypto’s ecosystem. Simultaneously, it’s also worth mentioning that asset management company Bitwise submitted S-1 filing for a DOGE ETF previously. Overall, these recent endeavors, pushing the meme coin as a traditional investment product, have cemented investors’ bullish outlook for the token. Is Dogecoin To $1 Run Inevitable Amid Rising Whale Buying & Market Support? At the time of reporting, DOGE price continued showcasing a sideways trading session, exchanging hands at $0.3277. The crypto’s 24-hour low and high were $0.3243 and $0.3407, respectively. Amid the abovementioned bullish news surfacing across the market, intraday trading volume for the asset rose by 36% to $1.57 billion. Market watchers continue to anticipate further gains amid rising Dogecoin whale accumulations and broader developments. A recent Dogecoin price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the new Trust launch and ETF filing further amplify the token’s potential to hit $1. However, it’s worth mentioning that the coin must clear the $0.35 level promptly for further upside actions. The latest macroeconomic events, such as unchanged rates this FOMC and rising PCE inflation YoY, present the crypto market with uncertainty.

SEC Lawsuit: Here’s What Happened in January,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-heres-what-happened-in-january/,"TL;DR The SEC doubled down on its appeal against the 2023 ruling favoring Ripple, while the non-profit organization Better Markets sided with the regulator, arguing that XRP is a security. With pro-crypto Mark Uyeda replacing Gary Gensler at the SEC, analysts speculate on potential outcomes that could favor Ripple. The Tussle Goes on While the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started in 2020, its final resolution remains to be seen . The past few years were quite eventful, with numerous developments and partial court wins that seemingly tipped the scales in favor of the company. The first month of the new year also offered some key updates. In mid-January, the securities regulator officially filed its first opening brief as part of its appeal against a court decision concerning the XRP sold on exchanges years ago. It also insisted (once again) that Ripple’s native token should be classified as a security. A week later, Ripple requested a due date of April 16, 2025, for its brief. The SEC’s appeal concerns Judge Torres’ ruling from August 2023 when she found that the firm’s programmatic sales of XRP to retail clients through centralized exchanges did not breach the rules. And while the crypto industry has largely sided with Ripple in the lawsuit, some financial entities have voiced support for the Commission. On January 22, the non-profit organization Better Markets categorized XRP as a security. “The XRP tokens sold by Ripple Labs, Inc. (“Ripple”) are investment contract securities regardless of whether investors acquired them directly from Ripple or indirectly on secondary trading platforms. And they are investment contracts regardless of the purchasers’ level of sophistication. In all cases, investors were led to expect profits from the efforts of others, thus satisfying the third prong of the Howey test for investment contracts,” the brief reads. Gensler’s Departure An important event that may impact the Ripple v. SEC case is Gary Gensler’s resignation as a Chairman of the watchdog . He stepped down on January 20 (the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration) and was replaced by the pro-crypto Mark Uyeda. Gensler was considered a huge enemy of the crypto sector, and the XRP army interpreted the shifts in the SEC’s leadership as something that could lead to a potentially favorable resolution for Ripple. One person who presented three possible outcome scenarios following the changes is the American attorney John Deaton . First, he assumed that the SEC might stand by its appeal, thus prolonging the battle indefinitely. Second, he suggested that the regulator could dismiss the plea and insist that Ripple pay the previously ruled penalty of $125 million. Last summer, Judge Torres ordered the company to settle the amount due to violating certain rules. Some of the company’s execs were more than happy to abide by the rules, considering that the fine represented just a fraction of the $2 billion the SEC initially asked for. Deaton concluded that the third (most unlikely) scenario includes dismissing the appeal and scrapping the multi-million penalty. The post Ripple v.

According to the Jan. 31 SEC filing , the proposed 21Shares Polkadot Trust would be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with Coinbase designated as the custodian for DOT holdings. The development follows 21Shares’ earlier foray into Polkadot investment products. In February 2021, the firm made history by launching the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product (ETP) on Switzerland’s SIX Exchange, bringing institutional investment exposure to the blockchain network. Market Uncertainty Surrounding Polkadot ETF Polkadot, currently ranked 18th by market capitalization, has faced sluggish price performance despite its potential as a multi-chain interoperability protocol. CoinMarketCap data shows that DOT has lost 5.16% over the past year and has seen a 10.48% decline in the last month. Given this volatility, 21Shares acknowledged in its filing that there is no guarantee of future price appreciation, cautioning that the ETF’s success will be directly tied to Polkadot’s market performance. “There is no assurance that DOT will maintain its value in the long or intermediate term,” the filing stated. “In the event that the price of DOT declines, the Sponsor expects the value of the Shares to decline proportionately.” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart weighed in on the filing, emphasizing that market demand will ultimately determine whether a spot Polkadot ETF is sustainable. “The market will decide where value lies and if there’s value in launching such a product. If no one puts money into a Polkadot ETF—it will close. People are free to launch whatever ETFs are deemed to be allowed by the SEC,” Seyffart stated in a Jan. 31 post on X. idk who needs to hear this but the market will decide where value lies and if there's value in launching such a product. If no one puts money into a Polkadot ETF — it will close. People are free to launch whatever ETFs are deemed to be allowed by the SEC — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 31, 2025 The filing also outlined several potential risks associated with Polkadot’s network, including concerns about an increased supply of DOT tokens in circulation and the possibility of DOT being classified as a security under U.S. federal law. In February 2023, the Web3 Foundation, which oversees the Polkadot protocol, pushed back against the security classification concerns. The foundation asserted that it had carefully managed DOT distribution to prevent any single entity from gaining excessive control over the network. Additionally, it stated that it had rejected investment-only purchases from venture capitalists, focusing instead on promoting Polkadot’s technology rather than its token price. Crypto ETF Filings Surge Following Gensler’s Departure 21Shares’ latest filing comes at a pivotal time for the SEC and cryptocurrency ETFs, following the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Jan. 20. Gensler, known for his cautious stance on crypto regulations, stepped down amid increasing pressure for greater regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. His departure has triggered a wave of new crypto ETF filings, including Osprey Funds and REX Shares, which filed for meme coin ETFs covering Dogecoin (DOGE) , Official Trump (TRUMP), and Bonk (BONK) on Jan. 21. Meanwhile, the SEC has also granted initial approval for Bitwise Asset Management’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, which would track both BTC and ETH in a single fund—another significant step in the evolving landscape of crypto-based financial products.

Currently priced at $0.000000107 in its presale, PEPETO has already raised an impressive $4 million, positioning itself as a contender in the meme coin market while maintaining a focus on genuine utility. Trump and Melania Coin Values Stagnate After Days of High Gains Since their launch, Trump and Melania coins have drawn considerable attention, capitalizing on the popularity of the current US first family. However, their current state in the market has been met with skepticism. Trump Coin, at one point, boasted a market cap of $15 billion before falling to a more modest $4 billion. Meanwhile, Melania Coin reached a peak valuation of $2 billion before encountering the inevitable volatility associated with memecoins, dropping to $480 million, at press time. Despite their widespread recognition and financial gains, these tokens remain largely speculative, lacking any functional use cases or inherent utility. Critics continue to question the value of these coins, particularly given their political ties and the growing concern about the lack of real-world applications. While the coins may appeal to supporters and collectors, the absence of tangible benefits leaves many investors uncertain about their long-term sustainability. PEPETO: A Meme Coin With a Purpose Amidst the noise created by Trump and Melania coins, PEPETO has emerged as a meme coin with a difference.

The tweet, which included a video advertisement featuring Azimo’s use of RippleNet for global payments, was met with excitement and speculation regarding its timing and implications. The ad showcased RippleNet’s capabilities in facilitating seamless cross-border transactions, emphasizing the theme: “The Future of Finance Has No Boundaries.” BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! Ripple's New Ad Shakes Up Crypto: ""The Future of Finance Has No Boundaries"" $XRP pic.twitter.com/7XZw2YQktQ — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) January 30, 2025 Following Brett’s post, an X user, NetBastard, hinted at a potential connection between the resurfaced ad and the upcoming Super Bowl, scheduled for February 9, 2025. The user commented , “Hmm, If only there was some event airing on 02/09/2025 that is shown around the World to get an ad like this one out to the masses… Hmmmm what could that be?” This remark fueled discussions about whether Ripple could be planning a marketing campaign during the Super Bowl, one of the most widely viewed events globally. However, another X user, WatsonSherlock1887, countered the excitement by clarifying that the advertisement was not new. “Ad is from several years ago it isn’t a new ad,” the user noted . This statement aligns with the history of Ripple’s partnership with Azimo, which was officially announced in 2020. At that time, Azimo integrated Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution to enhance remittance services, particularly in corridors such as the Philippines. Azimo and Ripple’s 2020 Partnership In 2020, Azimo, a digital money transfer service, partnered with Ripple to leverage its ODL solution, which utilizes XRP for instant settlement. The collaboration aimed to reduce costs and improve the speed of international transactions. Azimo’s adoption of Ripple’s technology was seen as a step forward in the company’s mission to provide efficient cross-border payment services. At the time of the partnership, Azimo’s CEO, Richard Ambrose, highlighted the benefits of ODL, stating that it allowed the company to settle payments in real time while significantly reducing liquidity costs. The service was initially launched for remittances from Europe to the Philippines, a major remittance corridor with high demand for cost-effective transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Speculation and Potential Implications The sudden release of the advert has led to speculation about Ripple’s future marketing efforts . Some community members believe Ripple could prepare a broader campaign to promote XRP’s utility in global payments. The mention of the Super Bowl in user discussions further amplified expectations, as securing an advertisement slot during the event would represent a major step in mainstream marketing. Super Bowl commercials are among the most expensive and high-profile advertisements globally, often featuring major financial and technology firms. If Ripple were to sponsor an ad during the event, it would signify a strong push toward mainstream adoption and public awareness of its payment solutions. However, there is no official confirmation yet from Ripple regarding such plans. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Source: FLASH Recent price activity indicates a bounce from the lower trend line and the 0.786 Fibonacci level, hinting at a potential bullish reversal. However, confirmation of this trend is awaited. To sustain a bullish trajectory, the DOT price must breach a critical resistance level at $7.545, marked as a horizontal green line on the chart. A breakout above this level could pave the way for a rally toward a projected target of $14,605, as suggested by a bullish green arrow. Polkadot Positioned for Massive 650% Price Surge? Polkadot (DOT) may be gearing up for a significant rally, according to market analyst Javon Marks. In a recent statement, Marks highlighted DOT’s multiple breakouts as a sign of strong bullish momentum. If this projection materializes, it would represent a staggering DOT price climb of over 650% from current levels. “$DOT (Polkadot), by its multiple breakouts, looks to still be well positioned for another monumental surge in price, which could lead all the way to the $53.385 target, if not even higher,” Marks stated.

He believes that assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver could see a sharp dip as a result. Perhaps, Kiyosaki sees this as a golden buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern. Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Dip In a recent tweet post on X Robert Kiyosaki has warned that Bitcoin could face a sharp price drop as Trump’s new tariffs take effect. However, Kiyosaki’s tweet was clear, “Gold, silver, Bitcoin may crash. GOOD. Will buy more after prices crash.” For him, market crashes are like sales in a store. When prices drop, it’s the perfect time to invest in assets that have long-term value. TRUMP TARRIFS BEGIN: Gold, silver, Bitcoin may crash. GOOD. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is DEBT….which will only get worse. CRASHES mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 31, 2025 His warning comes as Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range of $101K to $106K. Market volatility could increase as Trump’s tariff policies take effect on February 1, influencing global financial markets, including crypto. The Real Problem: Debt While Kiyosaki is optimistic about buying assets during crashes, he also highlights a growing concern is debt. Meanwhile, he warned, that the “Real problem is DEBT which will only get worse.” He believes that the increasing levels of debt in the economy are a ticking time bomb. While market crashes can be managed with smart investments, the debt crisis is a deeper issue that needs attention. Bitcoin’s Key Price Levels Kiyosaki’s prediction aligns with recent comments from Arthur Hayes, another well-known analyst. Hayes expects a short-term decline in Bitcoin, possibly pushing its price down to $70,000, before a major rally towards $250,000 begins. Apart from bitcoin prediction, on-chain data from Glassnode shows a significant Bitcoin price cluster between $94,000 and $101,000. This suggests that many traders have bought Bitcoin in this range, making $98,000 a critical support level. If Bitcoin stays above this, it could maintain its bullish momentum. However, if it falls below, it might open the door for a drop toward $90,000 or lower.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BTG|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 07:28:25

Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing, wondering if this coin might be the next big thing. The potential for massive returns draws comparisons to past success stories. Investors are keen to discover whether this digital asset could redefine market expectations before 2025 wraps up. Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Denounces Fake AI Agents The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is a 100% meme coin . Agent A.I. is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: Agent A.I.’s True Identity Keep this under wraps: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs.\ Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount Dogecoin: From Meme to $50 Billion Crypto Phenomenon Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun twist on cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be plentiful. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there’s no maximum limit. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value exceeding $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and enthusiastic support from people like Elon Musk. The coin’s rise showed how powerful online communities and social media can be in the financial world. Dogecoin’s technology is similar to Bitcoin but with some tweaks. Transactions are fast and fees are low, making it suitable for everyday use. In the current market, Dogecoin remains popular. Its friendly community and widespread recognition set it apart from other coins. While it started as a joke, Dogecoin has shown that sometimes, even a meme can make a big impact. Conclusion In conclusion, while established coins like Dogecoin may offer less immediate potential, the emerging $AGENT token presents a unique opportunity. Agent A.I. is a genuine memecoin aiming to disrupt the influx of fake AI agents in the crypto space. With a community-driven presale offering significant early discounts and a capped supply of 5 billion tokens, it positions itself for substantial growth. The tokenomics are straightforward, focusing on staking and rewards without unexpected inflation.

A Complete Guide for New Investors,https://coinpedia.org/beginners-guide/what-is-nft-marketplaces/,"The post What Are NFT Marketplaces? A Complete Guide for New Investors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Have you ever heard of someone spending thousands of dollars on a digital picture of a cat or a pixelated punk? Sounds crazy, right? Welcome to the fascinating world of NFTs! If you’ve been curious but don’t know where to start, this guide will walk you through everything you need to understand about NFT marketplaces. What Are NFTs, Anyway? Before we explore marketplaces, let’s get the basics down. NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token . That’s a fancy way of saying it’s a unique digital item that can’t be replaced with something else. You can think of it like a one-of-a-kind baseball card or a rare piece of art. Unlike your regular dollars or Bitcoins (which are fungible and interchangeable), NFTs are special. Each one has its own value and identity. NFTs can represent anything digital—art, music, videos, tweets, virtual real estate, and even in-game items. They’re powered by blockchain technology , which is like a public ledger ensuring everyone knows who owns what. Why Are NFTs So Popular? Okay, imagine owning a piece of art from a famous artist but in digital form. It’s yours. You can show it off, sell it, or trade it. That’s what makes NFTs exciting. Plus, the scarcity factor—there’s only one or a limited number of each NFT. It’s like finding a golden ticket in a chocolate bar. Another reason NFTs are booming? They give creators more control. Artists can earn royalties every time their NFT is sold. So, instead of being at the mercy of galleries or record labels, creators get direct access to their audience. What Is an NFT Marketplace? Now that you know about NFTs, let’s talk about where the magic happens: NFT marketplaces . Think of these platforms as digital art galleries or auction houses where you can buy, sell, or even create your own NFTs. Each marketplace has its vibe, features, and focus. Some cater to high-end digital art, while others are playgrounds for gaming enthusiasts or music lovers. If you’ve ever used eBay or Amazon, the concept isn’t too different. The key difference? Instead of physical goods, you’re dealing with digital assets. How Does It Work? Let’s break it down into simple steps: Create an Account : First, you’ll need to sign up on a marketplace. Connect a Wallet : To buy or sell NFTs, you’ll need a crypto wallet (more on that later). Think of it as your digital purse. Browse the Listings : Scroll through collections, discover trending pieces, and pick your favorites. Buy, Bid, or Mint : Depending on the platform, you can purchase NFTs instantly, place a bid, or create your own NFT (called minting). Own It : Once the transaction is complete, the NFT is all yours. It’ll sit safely in your wallet. There’s more to consider. Popular NFT Marketplaces Here are some of the top NFT marketplaces you’ll want to know about: 1. OpenSea The giant of NFT marketplaces. opensea opensea - NFT Market Place is like the Amazon of NFTs. You’ll find everything here—from art to domain names and gaming items. It’s user-friendly, making it perfect for beginners. 2. Rarible A bit more community-focused, Rarible lets users vote on platform upgrades. It’s popular among creators who love its easy minting process. 3. Foundation This one’s all about high-quality art. It’s invite-only, so not everyone can sell here. Think of it like a VIP art club. 4. NBA Top Shot Into sports? This marketplace focuses on officially licensed NBA highlights. It’s like owning a piece of basketball history. 5. Axie Marketplace For gamers, Axie Infinity is the go-to place for buying and trading in-game items and characters. It’s fun and addictive! What About Crypto Wallets? To interact with NFT marketplaces, you’ll need a crypto wallet . This is where you store your cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum ) and NFTs. Popular wallets include: MetaMask : A browser extension wallet. Simple and widely used. Trust Wallet : Great for mobile users. Coinbase Wallet : User-friendly, especially if you’re already using Coinbase. Connecting your wallet to a marketplace is straightforward. Just follow the on-screen prompts, and you’re good to go. How Do You Buy an NFT? Alright, so you’ve found an NFT you love. Now what? Here’s the process: Check the Price : Some NFTs have a fixed price, while others are auctioned. Auctions mean you place a bid and hope it’s the highest. Pay with Crypto : Most marketplaces operate on Ethereum, so you’ll need ETH. Some also accept other cryptocurrencies. Confirm the Purchase : Once you pay, the NFT is transferred to your wallet. You’ll also pay a small transaction fee (called a gas fee). Show It Off : Your NFT is now yours. Display it in a virtual gallery or keep it as a valuable collectible. Can You Sell Your NFTs? Absolutely! Selling NFTs is just as easy as buying them. Upload your digital item, set a price, and list it on the marketplace. When someone buys it, the proceeds (minus marketplace fees) go directly to your wallet. Remember, you can also earn royalties if you’re the original creator. This means you’ll get a percentage of every future sale of that NFT. It’s a great way to keep earning long-term. Risks and Challenges It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, though. Here are some things to watch out for: High Gas Fees : Ethereum transactions can be expensive during peak times. Imagine paying $50 just to buy a $20 NFT. Frustrating, isn’t it? Scams and Fakes : Not all marketplaces are trustworthy. Stick to reputable platforms and double-check the authenticity of NFTs. Volatility : Crypto prices and NFT values can swing wildly. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Environmental Impact : Some blockchains consume a lot of energy. Fortunately, newer platforms are finding eco-friendly solutions. Real-Life Example: Beeple’s $69 Million Sale Let’s talk about the NFT that took the world by storm. In 2021, a digital artist named Beeple sold an NFT titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” for a whopping $69 million at a Christie’s auction. It’s essentially a collage of 5,000 digital images he created over 13 years. This sale put NFTs on the map. It showed the world that digital art can be just as valuable as physical masterpieces. Mind-blowing, right? The Future of NFT Marketplaces NFTs are still in their early days. But the potential is enormous. Imagine: Virtual Real Estate : People already buy and sell land in virtual worlds like Decentraland. Music Rights : Artists can sell songs directly to fans without middlemen. Tickets : NFTs could replace traditional event tickets, reducing fraud. The possibilities are endless. And with more people jumping in, NFT marketplaces will only get bigger and better. What next? There you have it! The NFT marketplace might seem like a wild jungle at first, but once you understand the basics, it’s an exciting place full of opportunities. Whether you’re an artist, collector, gamer, or just curious, there’s something for everyone. Start small. Explore a marketplace like OpenSea or Rarible. Browse, learn, and maybe even buy your first NFT. Who knows? You might discover a hidden gem or create something that takes the world by storm. FAQs What is an NFT marketplace and how does it work?

You can mint your artwork on platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, or Foundation and set a price or auction it for potential buyers. Are NFT marketplaces safe to use?

The Ultimate Guide for Beginners,https://coinpedia.org/beginners-guide/how-to-buy-and-sell-nfts/,"The post How to Buy or Sell NFT? The Ultimate Guide for Beginners appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Have you ever heard someone say, “ I just bought this NFT for $5,000 ,” and thought to yourself, “What on earth is an NFT?” Or maybe you’ve wondered if it’s too late to jump on the bandwagon? Don’t worry; you’re not alone. NFTs are the hot topic everyone’s buzzing about, but they can seem confusing at first. Let’s break it all down step by step. By the end of this, you’ll not only understand what NFTs are but also feel confident enough to buy or sell one yourself. What Exactly Is an NFT? First things first, NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token . Sounds fancy, right? Let me simplify it for you. Think of an NFT as a digital certificate of ownership. This certificate is stored on a blockchain (a secure digital ledger) and proves you own something unique. It could be a piece of digital art, music, a video, or even a virtual plot of land in the metaverse. Now, “non-fungible” means it’s one-of-a-kind. For example, a $10 bill is fungible. If I give you $10, you can give me another $10, and we’re even. But if I give you a rare collectible trading card, you can’t just give me any random card in return—it’s unique. That’s what makes NFTs special. Why Are People Buying NFTs? You might wonder, why would anyone pay thousands (or millions) of dollars for something digital? Great question. Ownership : Owning an NFT gives you bragging rights. It’s like saying, “I own this original Picasso.” Except it’s digital. Support Creators : Many people buy NFTs to support artists or creators they admire. Investment : Some see NFTs as an opportunity to make money. Buy low, sell high—you get the idea. Access : Certain NFTs give you perks, like VIP access to events or exclusive online communities. Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s get into the nitty-gritty: how to buy and sell NFTs. Step 1: Getting Started – Setting Up Your Digital Wallet Before you can buy or sell an NFT, you’ll need a digital wallet. This wallet holds the cryptocurrency you’ll use to make transactions. Think of it like a PayPal account, but for crypto. Choose a Wallet : Popular options include MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. MetaMask is a great choice for beginners. Download and Install : Go to the official website of the wallet you’ve chosen. Install it as a browser extension or a mobile app. MetaMask, for example, integrates smoothly with Chrome. Create Your Wallet : Follow the prompts to create a wallet. You’ll be given a “seed phrase” (a series of random words). Write this down and keep it safe. It’s like the master key to your wallet. Add Funds : To buy NFTs, you’ll need cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) is the most commonly used, but some platforms accept others. Buy ETH on exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, then transfer it to your wallet. Example : Let’s say you want to buy an NFT listed at 0.05 ETH. You’ll need to make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet, plus a little extra for transaction fees (called “gas fees”). Step 2: Picking an NFT Marketplace Now that your wallet is ready, it’s time to choose where to shop. Think of this step as deciding whether to buy clothes from Amazon, eBay, or a boutique store. Each NFT marketplace has its vibe. OpenSea : The largest and most beginner-friendly NFT marketplace. Rarible : Great for customizable NFTs. Foundation : Focuses on high-quality, curated art. NBA Top Shot : Perfect if you’re into sports collectibles. Tip : Stick to popular, reputable platforms to avoid scams. Step 3: Buying Your First NFT Here comes the fun part: buying an NFT. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet : Once you’re on the marketplace, click “Connect Wallet.” This links your digital wallet to the platform. Browse NFTs : Scroll through categories or use the search bar to find something you like. Pay attention to the price, description, and the creator’s reputation. Place a Bid or Buy Now : Some NFTs are sold at a fixed price (“Buy Now”), while others are auctioned. If it’s an auction, you’ll need to place a bid and wait to see if you win. Pay the Gas Fee : This is a transaction fee for using the blockchain. It fluctuates based on demand, so check the fee before completing your purchase. Confirm the Purchase : Once you pay, the NFT will be transferred to your wallet. You’re now the proud owner of a digital collectible! Example : Imagine you find a digital art piece priced at 0.1 ETH. You click “Buy Now,” pay the gas fee, and… congratulations, it’s yours! The NFT will show up in your wallet and your profile on the marketplace. Step 4: Selling an NFT So, you’ve bought an NFT and now want to sell it. Maybe the value has gone up, or you simply changed your mind. Here’s what you need to do: Go to Your Profile : On the marketplace, navigate to the NFT you own. List for Sale : Click “Sell” and set the price. You can choose between a fixed price or an auction format. Set Your Terms : Decide how long the sale will last and whether you want to include royalties. (Royalties give you a percentage of future sales.) Pay the Listing Fee : Some marketplaces charge a small fee to list an NFT. Wait for a Buyer : Once listed, potential buyers can view and purchase your NFT. When someone buys it, the cryptocurrency is transferred to your wallet. Example : Suppose you bought an NFT for 0.05 ETH and now want to sell it for 0.1 ETH. After listing it, a buyer snaps it up at your asking price. You’ve made a profit! Tips for Success Do Your Research : Not all NFTs are valuable. Check the creator’s history, the NFT’s rarity, and its demand. Watch Out for Scams : Only buy from verified creators or collections. Be cautious if a deal seems too good to be true. Start Small : If you’re new to NFTs, don’t spend a fortune right away. Experiment with low-cost items to understand the process. Stay Updated : The NFT world moves fast. Follow creators, join Discord communities, and keep an eye on trends. What next? Buying and selling NFTs might seem overwhelming at first, but it’s really just about taking it one step at a time. Set up your wallet, explore marketplaces, and start small. The more you engage, the more confident you’ll feel. Who knows? Your first NFT purchase might be the start of an exciting new hobby or even a profitable investment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : How to Create and Mint Your First NFT: A Simple Learning Guide , FAQs How do I buy an NFT for the first time?

You can sell NFTs on platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, or Foundation. List your NFT, set a price, and wait for buyers to make offers or purchase outright. Are NFTs a good investment? NFTs can be profitable but are risky. Research creators, rarity, and market demand before investing. Start small and monitor trends closely. What are gas fees in NFT transactions? Gas fees are blockchain transaction costs, varying by network demand. Higher congestion means higher fees, so check before purchasing or selling. Do I need cryptocurrency to buy an NFT? Yes, most NFTs are bought with cryptocurrency, mainly Ethereum (ETH).

Ripple attributed XRP’s resurgence to President Donald Trump’s executive order calling for regulatory clarity, fair banking access, and comprehensive legislation for crypto businesses in the U.S. This shift in policy has fueled optimism in the broader cryptocurrency market, contributing to strong institutional and retail demand for XRP. The report notes that prior to the SEC’s regulatory actions, XRP was the second most valuable cryptocurrency. However, Ripple claims that market manipulation by the SEC has hindered XRP’s growth and reduced trader confidence. With the easing of regulations, XRP has regained momentum, increasing investor interest. Related News: Controversial Founder Zhu Su Shares Price Prediction for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in 2025 XRP’s rally was accompanied by record-breaking trading volumes across major exchanges. Binance led the way with 36% of XRP’s spot trading volume, followed by Upbit Korea (20%) and Coinbase (9%). Following Trump’s election victory, XRP’s daily spot trading volume rose from $500 million at the beginning of Q4 to an average of $5 billion from mid-November to December. On December 2, CCData’s Top Tier exchanges traded nearly $25 billion in XRP spot volume, reaching an all-time high. Coinbase, in particular, doubled its share of total XRP trading volume, indicating growing confidence in the asset from U.S. investors. The report also points to long-term investor interest, emphasizing that most of XRP’s trading activity is driven by spot trading rather than short-term speculative bets. Institutional interest in XRP investment products continues to grow. WisdomTree and CoinShares have filed an S-1 for a spot XRP ETF, joining other ETF issuers such as Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares. Ripple’s report describes Q4 2024 as a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. With the Trump administration prioritizing innovation-friendly regulations and increasing institutional adoption, Ripple sees unprecedented growth potential in the crypto industry. “As regulatory clarity emerges and institutional demand strengthens, XRP is well positioned to capitalize on this new era of digital asset expansion,” the report concludes. *This is not investment advice.

In addition, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighting a flurry of positive developments has further fueled the market sentiments. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Highlights Key Developments Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has shared a slew of positive developments for the blockchain firm, sparking optimism for a potential XRP price rally ahead.

Besides, the report also highlights significant institutional interest, with WisdomTree and Coinshares filing for a spot XRP ETF. Simultaneously, Canadian asset manager Purpose Investments has recently proposed to launch the first XRP ETF in the world. Regulatory Shift Can Further Push XRP Price Meanwhile, Garlinghouse noted that the new US administration’s pro-crypto stance has paved the way for innovation and growth. The CEO also emphasized the XRP Ledger’s growing adoption, with notable partnerships and tokenization initiatives. Recently, former Ripple alumni Sean McBride also highlighted Ripple’s strategy to boost XRPL revenue. Additionally, he also highlighted Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD launch and its market cap hitting $100 million in a month. With the US SEC’s regulatory overhang easing, XRP price is poised for a potential rally. Experts predict a continued surge in XRP’s value, driven by increasing institutional demand and favorable market conditions. As the crypto market enters a new era of growth, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on the trend.

The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, announced on January 31 , will provide a regulated avenue for investors to gain access to DOGE, the leading memecoin by market capitalization. The asset manager described Dogecoin as “an open-source, peer-to-peer digital currency derived from Litecoin, which itself originated from Bitcoin.” Dogecoin Fund is Limited to Institutional Investors The trust is limited to institutional investors, offering them exposure to DOGE without the need to hold the asset directly. Dogecoin operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, similar to Bitcoin, but with less computational demand for transaction verifications and no upper limit on supply. This makes DOGE unique compared to many other digital assets. Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s head of product and research, emphasized Dogecoin’s growth, stating that it has evolved into a “potentially powerful tool for promoting financial accessibility.” Grayscale’s move comes amid growing institutional interest in memecoins, a sector that has historically been dominated by retail traders. The launch of the Trump (TRUMP) memecoin on January 18, ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, fueled a wave of speculation. The meme coin gained massive traction on the Solana network, generating so much activity that it caused network congestion for days. Following this surge, asset managers Osprey Funds and REX Shares filed to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for DOGE, TRUMP, and Bonk (BONK) on January 21, signaling that meme coins are becoming an increasingly serious asset class. With the Dogecoin Trust, Grayscale continues to expand its suite of single-asset crypto investment products.

Additionally, it has placed over 35 altcoins, including Worldcoin (WLD), Pyth (PYTH), and Rune (RUNE), on its watchlist for potential future investment products. As the world’s largest crypto fund manager, Grayscale oversees nearly $35 billion in assets as of December 2023. It is best known for its flagship Bitcoin and Ethereum investment trusts (GBTC and ETHE), which have played a major role in institutional crypto adoption. Gensler’s Departure Sparks Rise in Crypto ETF Filings Grayscale’s latest filing comes at a pivotal time for the SEC and cryptocurrency ETFs, following the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Jan. 20. Gensler, known for his cautious stance on crypto regulations, stepped down amid increasing pressure for greater regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. Just recently, Tuttle Capital Management filed applications for ten cryptocurrency-based leveraged ETFs, including funds tied to popular meme coins. Analysts suggest the filings are part of a broader strategy to test the boundaries of an SEC under Trump-era crypto-friendly regulators. The proposed ETFs include leveraged funds that aim to deliver twice the returns of their underlying assets, such as the meme coins Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania Meme (MELANIA). Furthermore, Osprey Funds and REX Shares have filed for meme coin ETFs covering Dogecoin (DOGE) , Official Trump (TRUMP), and Bonk (BONK) on Jan. 21. Meanwhile, the SEC has also granted initial approval for Bitwise Asset Management’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, which would track both BTC and ETH in a single fund.

Shibarium Layer-2 burned over 55 billion SHIB, but more adoption is needed. SHIB’s key resistance at $0.000020 could trigger a rally if broken. Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a sharp increase in its burn rate, fueling discussions about its price outlook. A 7,240% surge in token burns removed over 1 billion SHIB from circulation in a single day. Despite this, analysts question whether token burns alone can push SHIB to $0.01. SHIB Burn Rate Surges—What It Means for Prices SHIB’s burn mechanism reduces circulating supply, theoretically increasing scarcity and potentially boosting prices. In the past 24 hours, over 4 million tokens were burned, reflecting a 6,233% increase. The Shiba Inu community continues to push for value appreciation through these burns. However, reaching $0.01 remains a challenge. SHIB’s current supply sits at 589 trillion tokens.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the lives of early investors with its groundbreaking returns, and Ethereum (ETH) reshaped the crypto world with its smart contracts. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin, is being called the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Ultimate Choice 1. A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2. Record-Breaking Presale Success: Raising $1 million almost instantly, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven itself as a high-demand asset. This presale success has cemented its place as a token with unmatched growth potential. 3. Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token. SEI: Innovative but doesn’t have the same presale success or exclusivity. Secure Your Position Before It’s Too Late With its record-breaking presale and massive growth projections, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly becoming the most talked-about investment of 2025.

If given the green light, this ETF would enable investors to acquire direct exposure to Polkadot without the need to purchase and maintain the cryptocurrency themselves. The 21Shares Polkadot Trust, a proposed fund, is intended to be listed on the CBOE BZX Exchange. Coinbase will be the custodian for DOT tokens. Related Reading: Trump Effect?

The blockchain is known for its interoperability, allowing different networks to communicate and share data. 21Shares ETF filing with the SEC. Source: US SEC. 21Shares is trying to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world by offering an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This will make DOT a more attractive choice for investors who like controlled investments instead of owning cryptocurrencies directly. This follows rising demand for diversified crypto-based ETFs. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have garnered attention, Polkadot’s participation shows popular interest in alternative currencies. However, the success of this filing depends on how the SEC views Polkadot’s regulatory standing, a factor that could impact the outcome of the approval process. Market Performance Presents Obstacles Polkadot has encountered market obstacles, despite the enthusiasm that fueled the filing. The price of DOT has decreased by approximately 5% in the past year, and it has declined by more than 10% in the past month alone. DOT is currently trading at approximately $6.42, a significant decline from its previous all-time highs. The ETF filing acknowledges that the asset can be unstable and warns buyers about possible risks. Polkadot’s value could still be uncertain, even with an ETF setup, and there’s no guarantee that the token will rise or bounce back soon.

The SEC’s stance on digital assets is evolving, thus Polkadot’s security status may make it challenging for 21Shares to develop an ETF.

In a new video, Cowen tells his 863,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is approaching a “decision time” as traders and investors await the non-farm payrolls (NFP) report scheduled for release on February 7th. The NFP report discloses the number of jobs added or lost in the US, excluding those in the agricultural sector. Market participants use the data to gauge the health of the country’s economy. According to Cowen, Bitcoin could turn bullish if the unemployment rate stays at more or less the same level as last month’s reading of 4.1%. “If the unemployment rate comes in fine… 4.1%, 4.2% then my guess is that it’s more likely than not that Bitcoin would make another move up.” On the likely price targets for Bitcoin, the widely followed analyst says, “The labor market data comes in next week. It seems like Bitcoin’s done the same exact thing it did last year. The question is, can it just simply follow through and get that next leg higher? I would probably say somewhere between $120,000 to $140,000, $150,000. Somewhere kind of in that zone if it’s just simply going to repeat last year.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Cowen also says there’s a possibility of Bitcoin reaching a cycle top in a couple of months based on historical data. “So there’s always a chance that if you do get another rally in say February or March, that it could lead into a major market cycle top depending on how aggressive it is. Remember [during the] last cycle, the top was basically in April [of 2021].” Bitcoin is trading at $102,491 at time of writing.

Notably, the rally was recorded following a massive surge in the Quantum computing stocks yesterday. Considering the present market sentiments, investors are curious with questions like “How high will QTUM go?” and “Top reasons why QTUM altcoin is rising?” In this article, we have covered the market sentiments and possible short-term QTUM price analysis just for you! Qtum (QTUM) The QTUM price jumped 46.15% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $1.037 billion, a change of 2,507.87. Moreover, it has added ~43% to its valuation in seven days and has a YTD return of +37.54%. Moreover, with a market cap of $436.1 million, it has secured the 148th position. TradingView: QTUM/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) records a strong bullish curve in the daily time frame. Moreover, it constantly acts as a support to the price chart. This suggests an increase in the buying-over-selling pressure for the altcoin in the crypto market. On the other hand, the MACD indicator displays a rising green histogram with its averages witnessing a bullish convergence in the QTUM price chart. This highlights a positive outlook for the 149th largest crypto token during the upcoming week. How High Will Qtum Price Go? If the bulls outrun the bears, the QTUM price could retest its resistance level of $4.450. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for this altcoin to head toward its upper resistance level of $5 in the upcoming time. However, if a bearish reversal occurs, this could pull the price toward its support level of $3.750. Furthermore, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, the QTUM crypto may plunge toward its important support trendline of $3.085 this month. Are you one of many who are closely watching QTUM crypto following its breakout rally? Read the latest QTUM Price Prediction to explore the possible long-term possibilities! FAQs Is QTUM a good investment? If the bullish sentiment sustains, the QTUM coin price could reach a maximum trading value of $10 this year. What is the 5 year forecast for QTUM?

In a recent X post, Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has shared that the Fed is legally limited about what it can actually put on its balance sheet. GOOLSBEE: ASKED ABOUT #BITCOIN RESERVE, SAYS FED IS LEGALLY LIMITED ABOUT WHAT IT CAN PUT ON ITS BALANCE SHEET — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 31, 2025 Notably, Chair Jerome Powell previously mentioned that the Federal Reserve is legally barred from holding Bitcoin under the Federal Reserve Act and that the institution has no interest in changing the law. In 2021, he also stated that Bitcoin isn’t a reliable store of value because of its high volatility. In a recent press conference, Powell said that banks could offer cryptocurrency custody services now that the SEC dropped the controversial SAB-121 guidance. The crypto community reacted positively to the statement, causing Bitcoin to rise. Several States Working Towards BTC Reserve Last month, Powell described Bitcoin as a digital version of gold, aligning with views from its strong supporters. As for a Bitcoin reserve, that idea now seems less likely, with the chances of it happening by the end of April dropping to just 16%. However, most expect the reserve to be established sometime later this year. Besides, several states like Texas, Florida, and Ohio are working on creating local Bitcoin reserves, although it’s unclear about how many will succeed. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, who proposed last year that the U.S. Treasury buy Bitcoin, recently said that establishing the reserve will be her top priority as the head of a new Senate subcommittee on digital assets. Concerns Over Bitcoin’s Security, Liquidity There are critics as well to the idea as recently, ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that she is confident Bitcoin will not be included in the European Union’s reserves. She emphasized that central bank reserves must be secure, liquid, and free from suspicion of criminal activities like money laundering. Her rejection of the idea came after the head of the Czech National Bank proposed investing up to 5% of its reserves in Bitcoin, sparking new debates about Bitcoin’s place in national reserves. Time To Act Fast: Senator Lummis In response to recent events, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a supporter of a national Bitcoin reserve, emphasized the need for quick action to gain a competitive edge. “If you’re not first, you’re last,” Lummis said, urging the U.S. to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and secure its future. The Trump administration is exploring the benefits of such a reserve but has not yet made any official announcements.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-01 08:06:47

Technical and on-chain analysis suggests the two altcoins are poised for further gains next week. Bitcoin’s flash crash under $100,000 and its return above $104,000 have fuelled optimism among crypto traders. U.S. macroeconomic data releases, performance of tech stocks and equities, and developments in artificial intelligence are the key market movers for Bitcoin. Altcoins like LTC and OM follow Bitcoin closely as the correlation remains high. Table of Contents Litecoin and Mantra could extend gains, technical analysis shows On-chain analysis supports bullish thesis Market movers push Litecoin and Mantra higher Bitcoin catalyzes rally in Litecoin and Mantra Strategic considerations Litecoin and Mantra could extend gains, technical analysis shows Technical analysis supports gains in LTC and OM, on the daily timeframe. Mantra (OM) consolidated in a range-bound manner for several weeks between mid-December and January. OM broke out of the range between $4.5352 and $3.1730. At the time of writing, on Friday, OM trades at $5.6263, close to its all-time high of $5.9500 as observed in the TradingView chart below. On the daily timeframe, OM formed a support zone between $4.443 and $4.069. This is a key imbalance zone and a correction could see MANTRA bouncing off this range. Two key technical indicators, the Relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator support a bullish thesis for OM . RSI reads 76 and is sloping upward. While this typically generates a sell signal, when combined with MACD’s green histogram bars above the neutral line, it highlights underlying positive momentum in OM price trend. A retest of OM’s all-time high is likely next week if the token sustains its upward momentum. OM/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Litecoin was consolidating within the upper and lower boundaries of the range at $129.11 and $92.57. LTC ended its consolidation and broke out of the support zone, less than 8% under its 2025 peak of $141.22. Litecoin trades at $131.64 at the time of writing, early on Friday. The LTC/USDT daily price chart shows an imbalance zone between $102.57 and $114.04, two key levels for Litecoin in the event of a correction in the altcoin. RSI and MACD show underlying positive momentum in Litecoin’s price trend. RSI reads 61 and is sloping upwards and MACD shows green histogram bars above the neutral line. Traders need to watch for a re-test of the 2025 peak and an attempt to rally towards 2024 high of $147.06.

On-chain analysis supports bullish thesis Santiment metrics highlight the rising relevance and demand for Litecoin among traders this week. The total open interest across derivatives exchanges in LTC climbed to nearly $420 million on January 30, marking a spike in the chart below. The total number of LTC holders has climbed steadily between December 2 and January 31, according to Santiment data. On Friday, the metric climbed to 8.13 million. The number of active addresses remains above the 2024 average, and total funding rates aggregated by LTC read positive, meaning derivatives traders maintain a bullish bias on Litecoin. Litecoin on-chain analysis | Source: Santiment In the case of Mantra (OM), the total amount of holders is climbing slowly, reached nearly 44,000 on Friday. Key metrics like funding rate show a bullish bias and a positive value for nearly two weeks, confirming the token’s relevance and demand in the derivatives market. The Network realized profit/loss metric used to track the net profit/loss of all tokens moved on the chain on a given day shows several positive spikes in January, signaling profit-taking. Traders need to watch for large positive spikes as that would imply large volume sell-off by traders de-risking their portfolio, and this could result in a correction in OM price. The total open interest in OM hit its highest level on January 30 above $348 million.

As the SEC officially acknowledges the 19b-4 filing from Canary Capital for a spot Litecoin ETF, traders are hopeful of an approval. Typically a spot ETF approval generates demand and interest among institutional investors and large wallet traders. The developments in the ETF could fuel further gains in Litecoin next week. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst commented on the development in a tweet on X: News but expected. Even Gensler’s SEC would approve these. That said, they approved in 45 days vs waiting 240 days. I really want to interpret this as a sign the new SEC will be faster but no way to know really. Litecoin on deck, know more soon https://t.co/xqlXusHuyN — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 31, 2025 Mantra’s recent announcement about a partnership with the DAMAC Group, a real-estate giant, for tokenizing assets on their chain is a key market mover for OM token this week. JP Mullin, co-founder and CEO of Mantra said, “This partnership with DAMAC Group is an endorsement for the RWA industry. We’re thrilled to partner with such a prestigious group of leaders that share our ambitions and see the incredible opportunities of bringing traditional financing opportunities on chain.” The other key market mover is Bitcoin’s recovery from the flash crash under $100,000 on Monday. The correlation between the tokens and Bitcoin remains relatively high, supporting their gains. Bitcoin catalyzes rally in Litecoin and Mantra The three-month correlation between Bitcoin and Litecoin is 0.84, and between Bitcoin and Mantra is 0.87. The relatively high correlation suggests that Bitcoin’s price trend influences the prices of LTC and OM, therefore further gains in BTC could push the assets higher. A flash crash in Bitcoin could push traders on edge as BTC could drag out assets correlated with it, wiping out millions of dollars in market capitalization. U.S. macroeconomic releases, the movement of U.S. based tech stocks and equities and institutional investor activity typically influenced Bitcoin price. LTC and OM holders need to watch Bitcoin’s daily price trend to predict sudden movements in the two altcoins. Strategic considerations Traders who accumulated LTC under the $100 level could consider taking profits on a percentage of their holdings, at least 30% before a correction in Litecoin. Staggered profit-taking is recommended while Litecoin holds steady above the range-bound consolidation zone. Traders holding OM acquired under $3.87 should ideally consider staggered profit-taking while the altcoin trades above $5. Sidelined buyers can enter when OM is closer to $4 and wait for a re-test of the all-time high at $5.95 before taking profits. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

This prediction, shared by market analyst Amonyx (@amonbuy) on X, has sparked discussions among cryptocurrency investors and analysts. The increase in probability comes when institutional interest in XRP ETFs appears to be growing, with major financial firms exploring regulatory pathways for such investment products. JUST IN: Poly Market Data predicted 83% $XRP ETFs will be approved soon. Are U bullish or no? pic.twitter.com/gy7jLW2OOK — Amonyx (@amonbuy) January 31, 2025 Institutional Interest in XRP ETFs Grows The rise in confidence regarding an XRP ETF approval follows Grayscale Investments’ recent filing with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to launch an XRP-based ETF. This development marks a significant step in the mainstream adoption of XRP-based financial products. Grayscale, known for its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, is now seeking regulatory approval to expand its offerings to include XRP. In addition to Grayscale, other investment firms such as Bitwise and Canary have also pursued standalone XRP ETFs . These applications reflect a growing demand for diversified crypto investment products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. As institutional demand for XRP exposure increases, the probability of regulatory approval for an ETF linked to the asset has gained traction. Market Reaction and Sentiment The data from Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, shows that confidence in an XRP ETF approval has risen by 13%, reaching 83%. This suggests that market participants are increasingly optimistic about the likelihood of approval by regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor sentiment around XRP is being influenced by recent developments in the cryptocurrency market. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 set a precedent for further crypto-based financial products, with Ethereum ETFs also gaining attention. If XRP follows a similar path, it could provide investors with a regulated and more accessible way to gain exposure to the asset. Regulatory Considerations Despite the optimism, the approval of an XRP ETF will depend on regulatory decisions. The SEC has been scrutinizing cryptocurrency-related financial products. Its stance on XRP has been debated since its lawsuit against Ripple Labs. Although Ripple secured a partial victory in 2023 , with a U.S. judge ruling that XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets, regulatory uncertainty remains. However, the SEC’s willingness to approve Bitcoin ETFs suggests a shifting regulatory landscape that could favor additional crypto ETFs, including XRP. Market stability, investor protection, and institutional demand would influence the final decision. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Nevertheless, in spite of this temporary rebound, PEPE has faced challenges in the last month, dropping by 31.14%. As the value of PEPE demonstrates signs of bouncing back, three other digital currencies— Neo (NEO), Minotaurus (MTAUR), and Lido DAO (LDO)—are surpassing it in both momentum and potential for growth. PEPE Price Performance In the last 24 hours, PEPE’s price has soared by 7.10%, raising its market cap to $5.82 billion, while trading volume reached $1.42 billion. Although this recent increase has occurred, the coin’s performance in the past week and month has been more negative, reflecting decreases of 7.93% and 31.14% respectively. This implies that although there has been a short-term increase in its value, PEPE finds it difficult to maintain a steady upward trajectory over extended durations. 3 Coins Are Outshining It as February Kicks Off NEO, LDO and MTAUR are outperforming PEPE as February jets in. 1. Neo (NEO): A Surge in Trading Volume Neo (NEO) has outshined PEPE price with an 11.79% increase in the past 24 hours, bringing its market cap to $1.07 billion. Over the past week, NEO has risen by 10.09%, with a 4.95% gain in the last month, demonstrating steady momentum. Neo (NEO) price chart A significant factor contributing to NEO’s recent rally is the sharp increase in trading volume. Reports indicate a 463.75% surge in trading activity across major exchanges like Bitget, Upbit, OKX, Bithumb, Kucoin, and Binance. Such volume spikes typically signal heightened investor interest and bullish sentiment. Moreover, the integration of Neo X with Ledger support has further strengthened the ecosystem. Neo has also partnered with SUPRA Labs , integrating powerful oracle and randomness services that enhance the blockchain’s infrastructure for developers building decentralized applications (dApps). These developments have positioned NEO as a strong contender in the evolving blockchain space. 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR): A Gaming Revolution The Minotaurus (MTAUR) presale has drawn the interest of gamers and crypto fans, raising over 1,400,000 USDT to date. With a presale price of 0.00006001 USDT, MTAUR presents an attractive opportunity relative to its anticipated listing price of 0.00020 USDT. Those with a preference for early-stage cryptocurrencies who entered at 0.000040 USDT have already seen their deposits double, showcasing the token’s significant potential. As one of the new cryptocurrencies to buy, Minotaurus is distinguished by its focus on gaming as a priority. The ecosystem enables players to have personalized avatars, game enhancements, and unique entry to premium content. As the casual gaming industry keeps growing, Minotaurus is ideally situated to take advantage of this development. The project is fundamentally based on security and community confidence. Thorough audits conducted by SolidProof and Coinsult confirm the platform’s reliability, and a 100,000 USDT giveaway, referral initiatives, and vesting arrangements promote involvement and enhance its expanding community. These efforts demonstrate the team’s dedication to providing value to its supporters. The presale procedure is straightforward and reachable through the official Minotaurus site. Regardless of whether you’re a newcomer to crypto or an experienced enthusiast, obtaining MTAUR tokens is easy. With the cost poised to increase shortly, this is an excellent opportunity to get involved and solidify your position in the Minotaurus ecosystem. 3. Lido DAO (LDO): Technical Breakout Fuels Growth Lido DAO (LDO) has demonstrated notable performance with a current price settling at $2.31. Surging by 9.13% in the past 24 hours and gaining 15.50% over the past week, LDO’s one-month performance stands at a solid 25.78% increase, significantly outperforming PEPE price. Lido (DAO) price chart LDO’s recent breakout from a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart is a key bullish indicator. Technical analysts suggest that this could push LDO toward price targets of $3.00 to $3.60 in the coming days. Furthermore, Lido Finance has made a strategic move by making its Community Staking Module (CSM) permissionless . This allows anyone to become a validator with reduced bond requirements, making Ethereum staking more accessible. With the total value locked (TVL) on Lido increasing, the token’s utility and demand are also rising. Final Thoughts: PEPE Price Struggles as These 3 Cryptos Surge Ahead While PEPE price has managed a short-term recovery with a 7.10% daily gain, it remains in a downward trend over the past month. In contrast, Minotaurus (MTAUR) is gaining traction through its gaming ecosystem, Neo (NEO) is benefiting from increased trading activity and ecosystem growth, and Lido DAO (LDO) is experiencing a technical breakout alongside major staking upgrades. As February unfolds, these three cryptos are proving to be stronger contenders compared to PEPE price, offering better potential for long-term gains.

Being built on the Base chain, it has been offering crypto, NFTs, and DeFi tools, where investors fueled its demand based on its utility. However, the question remains the same: will the TOSHI price hit $1 in 2025? Let’s discuss. Toshi Meme Coin Price Analysis and History The popular meme coin , TOSHI, had a rough start, as it took months to gain bullish momentum in 2023. At that time, the price hovered around $0.00003 before gaining any upward momentum in December, followed by a significant surge in January 2024. March 2024’s bullish market hit this cat-themed meme coin for good, reaching its first major peak of $0.0006. Interestingly, this is nothing compared to its recent peak, when the TOSHI surged more than 1500%, jumping from $0.0001313 to $0.002273 in just two weeks. However, it also experienced significant volatility in this journey, including its current situation. At present, TOSHI trades at $0.001014 after an 11% drop in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $414.08M. Moreover, since the ATH of $0.002273 just six days ago, the price has declined by 55% per CoinmarketCap . Interestingly, despite the drop, the trading volume was $104.45M, with a 115% surge, which could aid in its recovery. Factors Driving The TOSHI’s Market Hype During January’s TOSHI price rally, the Coinbase listing, meme currency frenzy, and institutional demand were the biggest factors. Although a controversy built around Coinbase listing, as investors questioned the exchange’s listing criteria, this buzz helped with its exponential growth. The same factors could fuel its recovery, especially amid high trading volume, which signifies high investor interest. Moreover, whale activity is also high for this cat meme coin, with one buying $3M worth of tokens. Interestingly, crypto analyst Cavell Anderson commented on this, predicting a 2- 5x rally soon, claiming that ‘smart money is still buying.’ Will Toshi Meme Coin Price Hit $1 in 2025? The TOSHI/ USDT trading pair shows that after following the peak, the value stabilized at its current level. This could result in two scenarios: a recovery or a further drop. A bullish recovery can push the token to the next resistance level at $0.00100. Once the token reaches this key resistance, it can aim toward $0.001346 and $0.002355 (the current ATH). However, in contrast, if the price failed to hold the support at $0.000990, it could follow the downtrend projection, dropping lower to $0.000490. Any further declines could result in long-term bearish sentiment. In conclusion, the most optimistic scenario for the Toshi meme coin is that its price will reach the current ATH. However, that will also depend on market sentiments and its trading volume. As a result, TOSHI’s $1 target in 2025 is less likely, but a Bitcoin bull run may change the trajectory. Investors should analyze the token periodically to understand its future price trajectories clearly. Bottom Line TOSHI’s January performance has made it one of the best-performing meme tokens. However, the $1 mark remains too big a target in the current scenarios. However, things could change with the bull run, the upcoming development of the Toshi meme coin, and its role in the DeFi space. With that, investors can watch the key support level of $0.001289, as that could be the defining zone for this cryptocurrency.

Crypto traders who just joined recently have acquired different coins in the market. According to Shiba Inu news, new crypto traders who have little knowledge about the space acquired Shiba Inu and are connecting with other veterans within the community. Although the community has been quite helpful to them, the market hasn’t been so favorable. This has caused these new investors to panic and search for other options. With the emergence of Panshibi , a newly and rapidly developing coin, it might be a chance for these new investors to restart. This meme coin offers everything an investor needs and even more. In this article, we will discuss this new meme coin. Read ahead. Crypto Traders Picks Newly Growing Coin Ahead of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has been around for a while. It has an exciting community filled with some of the best crypto enthusiasts. Its attractive community makes it easy for newbies to invest in the coin even without properly assessing it. Shiba Inu has given great returns to traders who have invested in the coin over the years. These traders have also suffered major losses. Despite how attractive Shiba Inu is, it doesn’t get close to Panshibi. From Shiba Inu news, there are a lot of exciting perks in the Panshibi community that Shiba Inu holders who have held the coin for the longest time haven’t enjoyed. According to Shiba Inu news, a lot of investors now prefer to invest in Panshibi than Shiba Inu. It is only a matter of time before Panshibi overtakes Shiba Inu in the market. Panshibi To Get Listed On Major Exchanges After Launch Panshibi is taking over the place of other coins in the market. Traders who hold other coins are getting their Panshibi tokens as they do not want to be left out. One of the best things about this coin is the kind of community they plan to build. This community will be a perfect place for new crypto investors to network with other meme enthusiasts from different parts of the world and learn more about the cryptocurrency world. There will be games for those who love to have fun and winners will be rewarded with prizes. And with his token, you can become a part of the team that gets to make important decisions that affect the community. As it stands, Panshibi is in the second stage of presale where it is worth $0.003. There are 15 stages of presale before this coin is launched. Now is the best to acquire this coin. When the coin moves through these presale stages, the value of the coin rises. All through the presale stage, the value is tipped to rise by 1200%. When it gets launched, it is expected to move upwards even more by 145,000%. Right now, there are 1.2 billion tokens available for the presale stage and this represents only 60% of the total supply of the coin. Getting this token now comes with a lot of perks. It can increase your chance of earning high APYs of up to 1200% annually. You can also get the chance to join exclusive VIP clubs like Bamboo Private VIP Members Club which other crypto traders might not gain access to. After the launching of the coin, the token ownership will be relinquished which will allow token holders to take full ownership of the coin. The coin will also be listed on major exchanges like Uniswap and multiple centralized exchanges. To be transparent, this coin has consulted the Blockchain security firm Coinsult to help them audit and verify its full smart contract. The auditing process has to be passed without any setback while the verification process confirms some essential details. This is important as it lets crypto traders fully place their trust in the coin. Conclusion A recent analysis made earlier this year says that the meme coin market accounts for 10% of the total cryptocurrency market. Experts believe that Panshibi, which is tipped to be the biggest Asia-inspired coin, will be the front-runner of the meme market and will even make the numbers even better. According to Shiba Inu news, many Shiba Inu investors are already joining the Panshibi project as they believe it will earn them more benefits.

The crypto market moves fast, and traders now shift focus to trending altcoins with stronger upside potential. FXGuys ($FXG) has emerged as a top choice, attracting those looking for gains. FXGuys has two key features that set it apart. Its Trade2Earn model rewards every trade with $FXG tokens, making activity on the platform more rewarding. It also runs a Trader Funding Program, which lets users trade with large accounts without personal risk. These unique benefits appeal to traders who want more than just speculation. Could FXGuys be the next 50x breakout? Find out here! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE PEPE’s Wild Ride: Volatility Sparks a Price Drop For One of the Top Meme Coins PEPE, one of the top meme coins, has seen a sharp drop in value. Whales have sold big chunks of their tokens. This selling pushed more PEPE coins onto exchanges, making prices drop even more. Smaller, smarter investors are also stepping away. The number of these holders dropped to 69 from 91 last year . Together, they now hold 9.5 trillion PEPE coins, much less than the 12 trillion they had before. Over the past week, the price of PEPE and other meme coins have been dropping. PEPE is trading at $0.0000123, a 23% decline from last week. Meanwhile, top experts believe that PEPE will still surge in the coming weeks due to its high volatility. PEPE also has an active community. As such, it could still rise to $0.0000195 soon. Sui’s Ecosystem Growth: A Bullish Sign for Investors? Sui’s ecosystem has seen big progress, crossing 50 million accounts . This shows more people are joining the platform. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) now stands at $1.63 billion , slightly down from $1.75 billion at the end of 2024. Even with this drop, activity in the ecosystem remains strong. However, SUI’s price movement has not been encouraging lately. The CoinMarketCap data show that SUI’s price has been dropping since last week, just like the rest of the crypto market. SUI is valued at $3.72, a 21% decline from last week. Moving forward, some experts predict a surge in SUI’s value due to the recent rise in its TVL. With this in mind, SUI could surge to $5 soon. On the other hand, Sui’s RSI suggests a downtrend. Its RSI is currently at 33 , which means the bearish trend could persist. If this happens, SUI could fall to $3.30 soon. Due to this bearish outlook, investors are looking to the $FXG token to secure over 50x gains after its presale. FXGuys Rises: Could It Surpass Trending Altcoins Like SUI and PEPE?

XRP is a Strong Contender for Explosive Growth Over the previous week, Ripple’s XRP has exhibited good indicators of recovery, climbing from an initial price of $3.13 to a high of $3.27 before suffering a minor fall. Despite a negative breakout that temporarily pushed the price down to $2.74, the altcoin regained bullish momentum and surged back above the $3.14 mark. This fluctuation highlights XRP’s resilience and validates its spot as one of the top altcoins to watch. Notably, the recent month has been even more positive for Ripple’s XRP, with a 46% surge in its price. The community outlook remains extremely hopeful about its future. Analysts are projecting that Ripple’s XRP may shortly retest its ATH of $3.84. In fact, Ripple’s XRP remains one of the top crypto investment choices for traders and investors looking to boost their portfolios. Its recent price movement, paired with technical indicators such as the MACD and Moving Averages, is providing a buy signal , which reinforces its growth potential. Ripple’s XRP enjoys a market cap of $181 billion, making it a well-established token in the crypto market. However, $FXG presents a more attractive investment option to investors looking for a DeFi altcoin with more room for growth. SUI: One of the Top Altcoins Poised for a Strong Recovery Over the previous week, SUI has seen a decrease of more than 21%, starting trading at $4.43 before gaining momentum to $4.77 and, at some point, falling to $4.10. It then consolidated between $4.24 and $4.09 before a bearish breakout dropped the price to $3.71 . SUI’s price performance over the past month has also been quite disappointing, with a decline of over 9%. The crypto community’s sentiment towards SUI remains firmly bullish, with many investors maintaining expectations for a return. Although the altcoin is still over 30% below its ATH of $5.35, analysts are hopeful about a potential retest of this ATH later this year, making SUI one of the altcoins to keep a watch on. A technical indicator, the Simple Moving Average, is indicating buy signs , which suggests a potential recovery shortly. While SUI has had an excellent 176% gain over the past year, $FXG has exceeded that growth with an incredible 300% gain in just a few months. This rapid surge indicates $FXG’s excellent potential for short-term growth, making it a more attractive alternative for investors looking for quick returns. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Accumulate the $FXG DeFi Token Before It Soars!

SUI’s price has risen in the past 24 hours, while JUP experienced a 26% surge following a token burn and increased liquidity. Remittix is also gaining attention, having raised over $10 million during its initial coin offering (ICO), and is currently valued at $0.0521. Is an altcoin season brewing? Where Does JUP Stand Among the Top Altcoins? Jupiter (JUP) is in a key position. On shorter time frames, its price moves within a tightening range while facing strong resistance on the higher charts. This setup suggests that a big price swing could be on the horizon, depending on how the market reacts. With many investors searching for the best crypto to invest in , JUP remains a top contender. However, it faces competition from other projects that are making waves, such as Sui . The SUI price has been climbing steadily, gaining more attention in the altcoin space. Sui could outperform many rivals if the momentum continues, drawing in more traders looking for high-potential assets. SUI Price Surges as Trading Volume Hits New Highs Sui (SUI) has been showing some impressive price actions. After a strong run, the token is currently trading at $4.16, following a 5.96% decline last week. While this correction might raise some eyebrows, SUI still ranks as one of the top altcoins with high return potential. Analysts are optimistic about a reversal that could push SUI back toward $5, making the current price an attractive entry point for investors. Sui’s fundamentals remain solid, with its Layer 1 blockchain focused on scalability and developer adoption. The innovative Move programming language continues to attract new applications, making Sui one of the best crypto to invest in right now. If history repeats itself and the token follows its past recovery patterns, SUI price could see strong growth in the near future, cementing its place as a high-potential asset in 2025. As SUI continues to evolve, its unique features and growing network make it an exciting project to watch. Remittix: The Future of Fast, Secure, and Low-Cost Global Money Transfers Remittix (RTX) is changing the game in global money transfers by simplifying the process of sending FIAT currency to any bank account using crypto. With its blockchain-powered system, users can transfer money straight from their crypto wallets without dealing with traditional banks or expensive fees. Unlike most financial services, Remittix doesn’t charge FX fees, making it a much cheaper alternative to existing options. Thanks to the platform’s use of blockchain technology, every transaction is documented on an open, impenetrable ledger. The inability to change a payment once it has been documented lowers fraud and improves security for both senders and recipients. The absence of intermediaries in transactions between users also reduces the possibility of data leaks or illegal access to private financial data. Businesses can accept crypto payments while reducing chargebacks by using Remittix’s payment system and its Remittix Pay API. With rewards of up to 18% APY, the platform’s VIP program also provides investors with the opportunity to generate passive income. Remittix Presale is Taking Over the Market The success of Remittix’s presale is a clear indication of why it’s the best crypto to invest in . Over 425 million tokens have already been sold, raising more than $10 million, with tokens currently priced at $0.0521. This strong presale performance highlights the increasing confidence investors have in the project’s potential. Those who purchase tokens during the presale at $0.0498 are locking in a low price, which could see significant appreciation as the project gains momentum.

The token leverages the mindblowing power of lithium, which has been the backbone of modern energy solutions. It aims to outperform traditional industrial standards and brings a new change with blockchain technology. The Power of Lithium Meets Blockchain At its core, Bitcoin Lithium harnesses the power of lithium, a critical component in battery technology. Lithium’s versatility in powering electric vehicles, energy grids, and sustainable technologies perfectly aligns with Bitcoin Lithium’s mission to drive eco-friendly innovation. In this way, Bitcoin Lithium acts as a central point between digital assets and sustainability solutions. Hence, it has become one of its kind to address environmental concerns in the cryptocurrency landscape. A Platform with Purpose Bitcoin Lithium’s mission isn’t just to capitalize on the green energy revolution—it’s to lead it. The platform emphasizes environmental stewardship, tokenized carbon credits, and crowdfunding for social impact. By tokenizing carbon credits, Bitcoin Lithium allows users to invest in a cleaner future, creating a market where businesses and individuals can offset their carbon footprint seamlessly. Its crowdfunding channels are also streamlined and transparent, with impressive campaigns. The team presents their pitch to several funding institutes, investors, businessmen, and crypto enthusiasts to build a sustainable crypto ecosystem. From renewable energy installations to community-driven environmental campaigns, Bitcoin Lithium empowers changemakers to build a better future. Tokenomics: Built for Growth The $BTCL token is the lifeblood of the Bitcoin Lithium ecosystem. Its deflationary design ensures long-term value creation for investors. Here’s a sneak peek at the tokenomics: Total Supply : Limited to ensure scarcity and increase demand. Presale Allocation : Designed to reward early adopters with significant discounts before $BTCL hits the open market. Community-Focused Distribution : A portion of the tokens is allocated to social impact projects, aligning profit with purpose. Bitcoin Lithium’s presale strategy is poised to generate enormous interest, and analysts predict a sharp increase in value as the token gains traction post-launch. Roadmap The Bitcoin Lithium roadmap is ambitious yet achievable, designed to maximize investor returns. Key milestones include listing on major exchanges, integrating blockchain-based battery charging networks, and expanding the reach of tokenized carbon credits. With the presale starting in just 3 days, investors have a limited window to secure $BTCL at its lowest entry point. Industry analysts are buzzing with excitement, and many forecast that Bitcoin Lithium will be a game changer in the world. This potential tenfold increase in presale prices has sparked a wave of investor interest, creating FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) among savvy buyers. Why Now Is the Time to Invest The presale launch is expected to create a frenzy in the crypto community. Bitcoin Lithium’s unique position at the intersection of blockchain and sustainable energy gives it an edge over traditional cryptocurrencies. Early investors stand to gain not just from potential price surges but also from the satisfaction of contributing to a platform that prioritizes environmental impact. Don’t wait until it’s too late—Bitcoin Lithium is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be part of a movement that could reshape the future of both cryptocurrency and sustainable energy. Secure your stake in $BTCL when the presale begins in just 8 days and watch as it takes the market by storm.

The post quickly gained traction, with opinions ranging from strong bullish optimism to cautious market-based reasoning. XRP’s Recent Price Surge The attached image, a CoinMarketCap screenshot, shows XRP trading at $3.106, reflecting a long-term increase of 52,743.43%. While this surge indicates renewed investor confidence, XRP still trades below its all-time high of $3.84 from early 2018. The key question is whether XRP can surpass previous highs and enter double-digit territory. Diverging Opinions on XRP’s Future Price Some users, like ANT1, strongly believe XRP is undervalued and misunderstood. He argued that once the regulatory case is resolved, XRP will experience an explosive price surge due to the scale of money flowing through the XRP Ledger . He predicted that XRP could reach hundreds of dollars within hours once institutional adoption kicks in. This aligns with the long-held belief that XRP’s role in cross-border payments and financial infrastructure will drive growth in the future. On the other hand, CryyptoCrazyy provided a more measured perspective, stating that the market cap increase required for XRP to reach $10 isn’t realistic in 2025. He estimated that such a move would require an $18 billion surge, which he doesn’t see happening in the short term. Instead, he believes XRP is more likely to cap out at around £5–6 by the end of the year, suggesting a slower and more sustainable growth trajectory. Another user, Paul Roussel, criticized the constant speculation surrounding XRP’s price, questioning why JackTheRippler repeatedly asks the same question. He suggested that people should focus on earning and accumulating XRP to help drive adoption and price rather than engaging in endless debates. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What Could Drive XRP to $10? While opinions vary, XRP’s ability to reach $10 will depend on several key factors: Regulatory Clarity – Institutional adoption could accelerate if XRP gains full legal clarity in the U.S. and other major markets. Many believe this would remove a key barrier to price growth. Institutional Adoption – Increased use of XRP in banking and financial settlements could drive demand, pushing prices higher. Market Sentiment & Liquidity – A broader crypto bull run and increased institutional investment could provide the momentum needed for XRP to reach new highs. Utility and On-Chain Volume – Greater transaction volume on the XRP Ledger, particularly for remittances and real-world payments, would strengthen its fundamental value. JackTheRippler’s post highlights the ongoing debate within the XRP community about the token’s future price potential. While some, like ANT1, believe $10 or higher is inevitable, others, like CryyptoCrazyy, argue that market realities make such targets difficult in the short term. Ultimately, XRP’s price trajectory will be dictated by regulatory developments, adoption trends, and broader market conditions.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin price continues to struggle below $106K despite Donald Trump signing multiple executive orders, favoring the crypto market. Over the last 30 days, BTC’s price consolidated around $105K. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $102,516 Market cap $1,238,914,422,643 Trading volume $22,318,495,561 Circulating supply 19,719,062 All-time high $108,268, December 17, 2024 All-time low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $104,888 24-hour low $104,112 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 102,239 Price Prediction $ 131,678 (28.40%) Fear & Greed Index 76 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 4.06% Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $ 99,178 200-Day SMA $ 77,031 14-Day RSI 58.76 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a sharp decline toward $101,560 Resistance for BTC is at $103,017. Support for BTC/USD is at $101,259. The BTC price analysis for 1 February confirms that the BTC price faced a sharp decline toward the low of $101,560. However, buyers immediately rebounded the price above $102K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price struggles to hold above resistance Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faces intense selling pressure as it faces a strong decline toward $101,560. However, the price of BTC faced a minor buying pressure and surged above $102K toward the immediate Fib channel. The 24-hour volume has surged to $1.97 billion, raising interest in trading today. BTC is trading at $102,516, dropping by over 0.8% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades above the buying region at 52, hinting that a bullish pressure is still on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the EMA trend lines. However, bulls maintain buying confidence as the BTC price aims for an upward correction. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.47, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence. Bitcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 100,217 BUY SMA 5 $ 100,441 BUY SMA 10 $ 103,337 SELL SMA 21 $ 101,290 BUY SMA 50 $ 99,178 BUY SMA 100 $ 92,151 BUY SMA 200 $ 77,031 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 100,069 BUY EMA 5 $ 98,563 BUY EMA 10 $ 97,360 BUY EMA 21 $ 96,968 BUY EMA 50 $ 94,899 BUY EMA 100 $ 88,344 BUY EMA 200 $ 78,936 BUY What to expect from BTC price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $103,017, it will fuel a bullish rally to $106,282. BTC/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $101,259, beginning a bearish trend to $98,580. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin down today? As BTC price failed to hold the $106K region, it resulted in a wave of selling pressure. Short-term holders quickly cashed in for profits, resulting in a sharp decline toward $101K. Will BTC Price Recover? If Bitcoin rebounds above the immediate 23.6% Fib channel and holds above $103K, we might see a recovery rally in the BTC price chart. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde stated that Bitcoin will not be held in European Union bank reserves, despite some EU countries exploring it as a foreign reserve asset. Bitcoin price prediction February 2025 Though BTC price made a new ATH in January, it was a neutral month for Bitcoin as it recorded only an 11% gain, characterized by significant upswings and downswings. Will BTC price establish a new ATH in February 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $103,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $95K. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction February 2025 $95,000 $103,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $95,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval. Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to reach a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-01 08:57:10

Although several have recorded healthy gains, many others are not performing well. For instance, data from MarketWatch shows that XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has gained 49.62% year to date. Over the last three months, XRP has returned over 517% to investors. On the other hand, Sui (SUI) has only returned 0.37% this year, according to TradingView data, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) has lost nearly 11%. Fortunately, this instability in the altcoin market is unlikely to affect Pepeto (PEPETO) , a new meme coin offering the crypto market a lot more than speculation. Will Altcoins Remain in Limbo? The outlook on altcoins is mixed, with varying reviews from different quarters. Recently, popular analyst Rekt Capital noted that a new “Hype Cycle” is possible for altcoins next month because February was a good month for altcoins in both 2023 and 2024, suggesting this trend could be repeated in 2025. According to Rekt Capital, altcoins are currently at their “Lowest Hype areas” and will likely rise in the coming weeks. For another analyst, Ali Martinez, alt season is unlikely because the market is saturated. In an X post , Martinez writes that a massive supply of altcoins has significantly changed the market. He notes that there are currently more than 36.4 million altcoins, much more than the 3,000 altcoins available during the 2017-2018 alt season, and 500 altcoins in the 2013-2014 period. Another Economist Alex Krüger agrees with Martinez, stating that there are already too many tokens, with an infinite number set to join the list. According to Krüger, the oversupply is why a desire for alt season is a misplaced expectation. Whether or not altcoins eventually struggle, the new #PEPETO meme coin is charting a different course and is likely to buck the trend and soar. PEPETO Creating New Inroads in the 2025 Crypto Market While there are many promising cryptocurrencies for the year, PEPETO is the one to watch out for. The new meme coin is at the end of a successful presale phase, where it successfully raised more than $4 million.

The launch of Bitcoin ETFs and growing institutional adoption by pension funds and corporations signal a shift toward mainstream acceptance, driving increased capital inflows and investment opportunities. Technological advancements like the Lightning Network, expanding use cases as a payment method and potential regulatory clarity under a crypto-friendly U.S. administration could define 2025 as a transformative year for Bitcoin’s global adoption. By Christopher Gannatti, CFA Bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, has evolved dramatically since its inception in 2008-09. Created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was initially a niche experiment - 10,000 bitcoins were famously used in 2010 to purchase two pizzas. 1 This early anecdote now stands as a stark reminder of Bitcoin's extraordinary growth, which has made it a global financial phenomenon. Over the past 15 years, Bitcoin has demonstrated one of the most impressive growth trajectories in financial history, despite ongoing volatility and adoption challenges. Global Economic Uncertainty Geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and potential recessions could drive investors toward alternative assets. Historically, extensive government spending has undermined fiat currencies, as highlighted in Ray Dalio's research on financial systems over 500 years. 2 Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply position it as a compelling alternative in this context. Potential Inflation Hedge Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a potential inflation hedge. While gold has served this role for centuries due to its scarcity and historical acceptance, Bitcoin offers distinct advantages: digital divisibility, portability and resistance to physical theft. Its adoption by tech-savvy investors underscores its growing role in modern financial systems and potential portfolio diversification. However, since Bitcoin's price has experienced significant fluctuations, it may be a risky asset to rely on if seeking a more stable inflation hedge. Performance against the U.S. Dollar Despite the dollar's recent strength, Bitcoin's market growth and increasing adoption make it an asset that cannot be ignored. As a relatively uncorrelated asset, Bitcoin appeals to investors seeking diversification and resilience against systemic risks. Bitcoin-Specific Developments Increased Institutional Adoption Institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to expand, including among pension funds: State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB): Disclosed $164 million in Bitcoin exposure in early 2024. 3 State of Michigan Retirement System: Reported significant Bitcoin investments as of mid-2024. 4 These examples highlight Bitcoin's integration into diversified, long-term investment strategies. The Launch of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) The January 2024 launch of Bitcoin ETFs was a milestone for the financial markets, drawing widespread attention. ETFs provide a regulated, accessible mechanism for investors to gain Bitcoin exposure without direct ownership, legitimizing the asset and driving capital inflows. As of this writing, there were more than $100 billion in assets in these ETFs. 5 Wider Adoption as a Payment Method Bitcoin's utility as a payment method continues to grow: PayPal and Venmo Integration: 6 Enabled millions of users to buy, sell and spend Bitcoin seamlessly. Retail Adoption: 7 Companies like Overstock and Shopify now accept Bitcoin. Cross-Border Transactions: 8 The Bitcoin remittance market is also gaining traction, with transactions reaching $3.5 billion in 2022, up 50% from the previous year. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for cross-border payments, with Bitcoin offering a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional methods, saving users up to 90% in transaction fees. Technological Advancements The Lightning Network, a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, addresses scalability and transaction speed issues. Recent upgrades have enhanced reliability, platform integration and liquidity management, significantly increasing the network's capacity and usability. Regulatory Clarity The current Trump administration has pledged strong support for the cryptocurrency sector. Proposed initiatives include: Creating a National Bitcoin Reserve: Trump's administration has referenced that it aims to establish a strategic stockpile of Bitcoin to solidify U.S. dominance in the digital economy. Appointing a Crypto Czar: David Sacks, tasked with overseeing cryptocurrency regulation, is expected to implement crypto-friendly policies to encourage innovation. Ending Regulatory Crackdowns: The administration plans to ease enforcement actions by agencies like the SEC, fostering a more supportive environment for crypto businesses. These actions signal a favorable environment for Bitcoin innovation and adoption. Steps toward Establishing a National Bitcoin Reserve Establishing a National Bitcoin Reserve would require coordinated efforts and strategic planning. Below are the key steps that would likely be involved: Legislative Framework: Enactment of laws to authorize and fund the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. Defining the reserve's purpose, such as stabilizing the national economy or bolstering strategic digital asset dominance. Acquisition Strategies: Direct purchases of Bitcoin from exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) markets to avoid significant price fluctuations. Collaborating with ""crypto whales"" or large holders to facilitate transactions without disrupting market liquidity. Incentivizing domestic Bitcoin miners to sell directly to the government. Infrastructure Development: Establishing secure, government-managed cold storage facilities for safeguarding private keys and digital wallets. Investing in cybersecurity measures to protect the reserve from potential breaches or theft. International Coordination: Engaging with global allies to share insights and best practices for national Bitcoin reserves. Ensuring compliance with international financial regulations to maintain global trust and transparency. Market Impact Mitigation: Implementing strategies to minimize the reserve's impact on Bitcoin's market volatility, such as dollar-cost averaging over time. Transparent communication with the public to prevent speculative bubbles or panic. Public and Stakeholder Engagement: Educating the public on the benefits and risks of holding Bitcoin in a national reserve. Working with financial institutions, miners and exchanges to align national interests with private-sector innovation. The establishment of a National Bitcoin Reserve would not only enhance the U.S.'s position in the digital economy but also set a precedent for how nations can integrate decentralized assets into their fiscal strategies. Notably, countries such as El Salvador have already made strides in this area. El Salvador, for instance, declared Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 and has since accumulated Bitcoin in its national reserve, using it to promote financial inclusion and attract foreign investment. While El Salvador's approach is unique, it demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating Bitcoin into national economic strategies. Conclusion Bitcoin's growth in 2025 may be driven by macroeconomic factors and key developments within its ecosystem. For stakeholders, monitoring the following will be crucial: Institutional Adoption: Announcements from major funds and corporations. Technological Progress: Innovations in scalability and usability, particularly with the Lightning Network. Regulatory Environment: Policy shifts in major economies. Market Trends: Bitcoin's response to economic and geopolitical events. Payment Adoption: Growth in retail and cross-border use cases. Competitive Landscape: Challenges from emerging digital assets. Despite risks such as volatility, regulatory uncertainty and competition, Bitcoin's adaptability and resilience position it as a transformative force in global finance. President Trump's proactive stance on crypto-friendly policies and the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve may further catalyze its prominence, making 2025 a potentially pivotal year for Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem.

Important Risks Related to this Article Crypto assets, such as bitcoin and ether, are complex, generally exhibit extreme price volatility and unpredictability, and should be viewed as highly speculative assets. Crypto assets are frequently referred to as crypto ""currencies,"" but they typically operate without central authority or banks, are not backed by any government or issuing entity (i.e., no right of recourse), have no government or insurance protections, are not legal tender and have limited or no usability as compared to fiat currencies. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use, transfer, exchange and value of crypto assets, and regulation in the U.S. and worldwide is still developing. Crypto asset exchanges and/or settlement facilities may stop operating, permanently shut down or experience issues due to security breaches, fraud, insolvency, market manipulation, market surveillance, KYC/AML (know your customer/anti-money laundering) procedures, noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations, technical glitches, hackers, malware or other reasons, which could negatively impact the price of any cryptocurrency traded on such exchanges or reliant on a settlement facility or otherwise may prevent access or use of the crypto asset. Crypto assets can experience unique events, such as forks or airdrops, which can impact the value and functionality of the crypto asset. Crypto asset transactions are generally irreversible, which means that a crypto asset may be unrecoverable in instances where: (i) it is sent to an incorrect address, (ii) the incorrect amount is sent or (iii) transactions are made fraudulently from an account. A crypto asset may decline in popularity, acceptance or use, thereby impairing its price, and the price of a crypto asset may also be impacted by the transactions of a small number of holders of such crypto asset. Crypto assets may be difficult to value, and valuations, even for the same crypto asset, may differ significantly by pricing source or otherwise be suspect due to market fragmentation, illiquidity, volatility and the potential for manipulation. Crypto assets generally rely on blockchain technology, and blockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology that operates as a distributed ledger. Blockchain systems could be subject to internet connectivity disruptions, consensus failures or cybersecurity attacks, and the date or time that you initiate a transaction may be different than when it is recorded on the blockchain. Access to a given blockchain requires an individualized key, which, if compromised, could result in loss due to theft, destruction or inaccessibility. In addition, different crypto assets exhibit different characteristics, use cases and risk profiles.

BTC to $102K The largest cryptocurrency started the business week on the wrong foot as the AI mania that started in China called DeepSeek sent the entire market into a severe correction. On Monday morning, the asset fell by over $7,000 and dropped below $98,000 for the first time in almost two weeks. After an unsuccessful recovery attempt later that day, the bulls finally stepped up on Tuesday and pushed BTC back into six-digit price territory. The markets calmed a bit on Wednesday in anticipation of the first yearly FOMC meeting, but once that concluded that it became known, as expected, that the Fed won’t change the interest rates, BTC started to lose value . Within less than an hour, the asset dropped from $103,000 to $101,500. However, it bounced off and surged to $106,500 on Thursday. It remained on that solid ground on Friday morning as well, with a daily peak of $106,000. Nevertheless, it slumped hard in the evening to $101,300 (on Bitstamp). Although it has recovered some ground since then, it’s still more than 2% down on the day and struggles beneath $102,000. Its market capitalization has slipped below $2.020 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 55.6%. BTCUSD.

Bitcoin Ready For $150,000 Price Target – Analyst In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with username Percival has touted Bitcoin to achieve a $150,000 price in the current bull cycle. Commenting on the present market state which might be unsettling to certain investors, Percival states that Bitcoin’s price trajectory, marked by sharp upward spikes and periods of consolidation, resembles the structural dynamics of any mature financial asset. In regards to future price movement, the analyst references a Fibonacci expansion from Bitcoin’s cycle low at $15,450 in November 2022 to the consolidation at $48,934 in 2024. In translating this historical data to the current market, Percival identifies a Bitcoin price target between $136,000 – $150,000 which is further supported by data from Bitcoin Realized Price Bands – a market metric that analyses supply based on different buying levels. However, for Bitcoin to trade at $150,000, the asset must attain a total market cap of $3 trillion. Currently, there is strong historical data in support of this postulation. For context, Percival explains that Bitcoin Realized Cap rose by 470% in the previous bearish cycle in 2021. Presently, the realized Cap has only grown by 111% suggesting more potential for market growth. Furthermore, the analyst identifies possible sources of demand to drive up the projected $3 trillion market expansion, one of which is the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Notably, these investment funds registered nearly $40 billion in inflow during their debut trading year in 2024. With the US expected to adopt a pro-crypto stance in the Donald Trump administration, institutional demand is also likely to surge stronger through these ETFs. In addition, Percival includes the Bitcoin Futures market which is currently valued at $95 billion as another potential bullish driver for the projected market expansion Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Extends To 1.1 Million BTC As Profit-Taking Continues BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at 102,334 reflecting a 1.66% decline over the last day.

According to data from the prediction site CoinCodex, market sentiments remain bullish with the Fear & Greed Index of 76 which indicates extreme greed among investors. Looking forward, the analysts at Coincodex predict Bitcoin could trade at $113, 658 and $132,823 in the next five and thirty days respectively.

The announcement came after Trump’s proposition for the US government to hold a Bitcoin reserve. But more interestingly, experts predict that this announcement could help position the marker towards a positive front. El Salvador became the first country to make this bold move, and with the USA now on the list of countries giving crypto a nod, the crypto market might be set for a brighter future. However, since these announcements, the Bitcoin price has remained steady, with a 12.50% growth in the last 30 days, and many altcoins have also moved slightly. Hence, there is rising concern about how much this new development from the US government and other players could affect the crypto market. Meanwhile, a new crypto asset seems to grow higher in the last couple of days, commanding strong attention from investors. The Remittix token ICO is a new cryptocurrency ICO that could start a bull rush earlier than any other crypto this season. How New Whales Might Trigger An Earlier Bull Run This Year Speculators and analysts have been vocal about the possibility of a strong bull run that might happen this year. But, many of these analyses have taken the BTC as a focal point. This gave birth to the raging speculation of the BTC to 100k after the Bitcoin halving last year. However, the move was massively delayed last year, primarily because of the fear of two things expected from the US last year: the Fed Rate cut report and the US election. Many feared being trapped in a bear circle, which could have been triggered had these two actions happened differently. However, the biggest defining moment came after the election when Donald Trump was announced as the winner. This meant two things: an end to the big crypto scrutiny from the SEC chairman, who doesn’t seem to be a big crypto fan, and the return of a pro-crypto president. This saw the crypto market react with an instant bullish move, seeing Bitcoin and many altcoins set a new record high. However, the latest developments speculate a massive adoption from the United States, Trump media, Arizona, and the Bank of Japan, among others. With these Whales’ contribution to the crypto market, they can spark a bull rage in the coming months. Remittix Maintains a Clear Edge as the Best Crypto Coin to Buy Now With a promise of a bull surge, identifying the best crypto coin to buy might make all the difference. While BTC continues to dominate the market, its ability to go 2x reduces as the price climbs. However, many new cryptos with lower prices are fast becoming the favorites for this bullish move. But again, it’s important to understand that not all new cryptos have the potential to benefit from the coming bull run. The new cryptocurrency ICO from the Remittix platform has become the talk of seasoned investors in the past few days. This is because many believe it has the potential to become a bigger and more recognized token in the future. The payment solution the Remittix platform is introducing makes it a potential frontrunner in the payment and remittance sector. Many payment solutions in the crypto market today make crypto-to-crypto their focal point, leaving FIAT solutions in the hands of Peer-to-peer transactions. But with Remittix, crypto-to-fiat transactions can now be done smoothly and at a lower conversion fee than traditional banks. The Remittix new cryptocurrency ICO has become the best crypto coin to buy today as it possesses the potential to usher in a smooth transition to crypto as a payment solution.

Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $54.35 level by 2027 and above $111.56 by 2031. Why is UNI down?

If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved this same year. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Will UNI reach $100? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is expected to reach near $100 by the fourth quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting as the coin’s value will increase more than tenfold in this scenario. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana faces congestion as Musk It surges 500%, fueled by Errol Musk’s claims of ownership and rising trading volume. The rise of Musk It (MUSKIT) has caused another wave of congestion on the Solana blockchain as the meme coin frenzy continues to overwhelm network capacity. With MUSKIT pumping over 500% and hitting $0.069, trading volume has exploded, driving increased activity on Solana and pushing transaction fees higher. The sudden spike in interest was caused by Errol Musk, Elon Musk’s father, who claimed ownership of the Musk It project and dubbed it Musk Institute. The MUSKIT coin launched in mid-December last year, but public affiliation with the Musk family only came to light earlier today. According to Errol Musk, the project’s goal is to raise funding for Musk Institute, a for-profit think tank focused on scientific pursuits, including the development of flying vehicles. $MUSKIT Musk It meme coin nears deal with Musk Institute, secures MEXC Exchange listing @elonmusk @POTUS #memecoin $BTC $ETH $SOL https://t.co/pc29RrNrnX 9So52ugZh2BLBT3f7p61947q91uQh2DyvbfyMDeRpump pic.twitter.com/pCTVeX0xjE — Just Michelle (@MaryMichelleNay) January 31, 2025 Despite network strain on Solana, investor sentiment remains bullish, and traders continue accumulating MUSKIT, expecting further gains as market momentum builds. Meanwhile, investors are also backing the new Solaxy project, which is building the first Solana Layer-2 to ease congestion issues and has raised over $16 million through its ongoing presale. You might also like: Solana faces congestion woes as TRUMP, MELANIA coins soar; Solaxy layer-2 offers hope MUSKIT breaks key resistance levels: Where is the price headed next? This recent MUSKIT price surge follows a dramatic increase in demand, fueled by speculation and strong community backing. Solana’s network, already known for previous slowdowns during high-traffic periods, is once again facing delays and higher gas fees. The congestion highlights the urgent need for scalable Layer-2 solutions capable of absorbing the load from surging projects like MUSKIT. Despite congestion issues, the technical outlook for MUSKIT suggests continued upside potential following its latest breakout. The MUSKIT price is currently hovering around the key resistance level of $0.038, turning it into a new support zone and signaling strong buyer confidence. However, earlier today, MUSKIT saw a huge, even if biref, spike to $0.69 signaling the potential for new heights. On the four-hour chart, MUSKIT remains in a clear uptrend, trading well above its 9-period EMA and 50-period SMA, confirming bullish momentum. A golden cross between these moving averages further suggests continued upward movement. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) show strong buying pressure, currently sitting at 63, just below overbought territory. This suggests room for additional gains before a potential short-term correction. The Bollinger Bands are widening, indicating higher volatility, with price action trending toward the upper band, a sign of continued strength. If buying pressure holds, MUSKIT could target the next resistance level at $0.045 before attempting to reach the psychological barrier of $0.05. However, traders should watch for short-term retracements, as profit-taking could lead to temporary pullbacks toward the $0.035 support zone before another rally. While Oscillators are in the red of the “Sell” zone, which is mainly caused by the serious volatility and the unprecedented price hike to $0.69 earlier today, the moving averages are steadily flickering in the “Strong Buy” area, signaling that MUSKIT has a lot more potential. The overall sentiment remains bullish, and with trading volume surging, MUSKIT may continue to gain traction as speculative interest drives further accumulation. Solaxy is layer-2 solution for Solana’s scalability issues As MUSKIT’s success strains Solana , investors are looking for the next big project that can address congestion issues while offering major upside potential. Solaxy (SOLX) has emerged as the first Layer-2 scaling solution designed specifically for Solana’s expanding ecosystem, making it an attractive option for long-term growth. By integrating advanced Layer-2 technology, Solaxy improves transaction speeds and significantly lowers fees, resolving the congestion issues that projects like MUSKIT continue to expose. The project’s Ethereum-Solana bridge enhances cross-chain compatibility, allowing seamless transfers between two of the largest blockchain networks. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1882459105467433452 Solaxy’s SOLX token plays a critical role in securing transactions and powering the ecosystem. With its early presale pricing at $0.00162, investors can enter before the next price increase. Additionally, staking rewards of up to 240% APY provide passive income opportunities, making SOLX an attractive long-term investment. As demand for scalable blockchain solutions grows, Solaxy is well-positioned to surge in value, especially as Solana continues to experience congestion from meme coin activity.

Notably, it has also led to the exit of a top-ranking official of the agency, sparking further market discussions. Besides, it also comes as Musk has shared ambitious plans for DOGE, which has caught the market’s attention. Having said that, a flurry of investors anticipate the development to have an impact on the Dogecoin price ahead. Elon Musk’s DOGE Targets US Treasury Recent reports indicate that David Lebryk, a high-ranking US Treasury official, is stepping down after disagreements with allies of Elon Musk. According to a Washington Post report cited by Reuters , the conflict stemmed from DOGE’s request to audit a crucial payment system. This system processes over $6 trillion annually, including Social Security, Medicare, federal salaries, and tax refunds. While it remains unclear why Musk’s team sought access, the development has raised eyebrows in financial and political circles. The report noted that a DOGE spokesperson declined to comment, and the US Treasury has yet to respond to media inquiries. Musk Alleges US Treasury Fraud Reacting to the news, American activist Robby Starbuck questioned why government officials would resist an audit. He suggested that DOGE was investigating excessive spending and potential inefficiencies within the Treasury. Elon Musk, in response to Starbuck’s claims, alleged that Treasury officials were instructed to approve all payments, even to fraudulent or terrorist groups. In the latest X post, Musk stated: “The DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.” This bold accusation has fueled public concern over financial mismanagement within the federal government. Ambitious Plans For Elon Musk’s DOGE Amid the US Treasury controversy, the tech mogul has laid out an aggressive cost-cutting vision for DOGE. Elon Musk has reiterated his previous goal of cutting $4 billion in daily federal spending by 2026, targeting a deficit reduction from $2 trillion to $1 trillion. In a recent X post, Musk shared an optimistic update: “I am cautiously optimistic that we will reach the $4B/day FY2026 reduction this weekend.” If successful, this would mark a significant shift in government efficiency. Market Reactions & Dogecoin Speculation With Elon Musk’s DOGE making headlines, investors are speculating on its impact on Dogecoin’s price. Historically, Musk’s involvement with the meme coin has driven sharp fluctuations. While no direct connection exists between DOGE and Dogecoin, the resemblance in the department’s acronym and the meme coin’s ticker often influences the market sentiment. Having said that, several experts anticipate these developments to impact the Dogecoin price ahead. In addition, Dogecoin whales are also making headlines with their latest accumulation trend, indicating the growing investors’ confidence in the asset. Considering all these aspects, it appears that Elon Musk’s DOGE development is likely to influence Dogecoin price ahead. Simultaneously, the market watchers are keeping close track of the Department’s tactics in cutting the US federal spending in the coming days.

Ecosystems like Cardano may benefit from alternatives like RLUSD for liquidity growth. RLUSD offers legal advantages, making it a stronger stablecoin option for Cardano. Circle and its USDC stablecoin are having a major impact on the broader crypto market, but not always in a good way. Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, thinks while USDC is widely accepted across numerous blockchains, its near monopoly-like control over liquidity distribution is cause for concern.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ripple’s court win boosts XRP’s outlook, while Elluminex eyes DeFi growth on the expanding TON network. Table of Contents Elluminex’s proprietary premarket feature attracts growing interest Ripple maintains strong bullish momentum in monthly rally Conclusion Ripple (XRP) has established its footprint across the global financial landscape, especially after its recent court victory against the U.S. SEC. This achievement has propelled the XRP price to unprecedented highs, with market forecasters touting a double-digit price for the top altcoin during this bull cycle. Meanwhile, new interesting projects are emerging. Elluminex (ELX), a fast-rising presale star that aims to solve similar challenges as Ripple but with a twist. In its own case, Elluminex aims to expand DeFi capabilities on the rapidly growing TON network by leveraging its robust DeFi infrastructure and proprietary premarket features. Elluminex’s proprietary premarket feature attracts growing interest For every blockchain network that has scaled significantly over the past two decades, there is always a cross-chain solution(s) that drives network adoption and liquidity aggregation. SushiSwap and Uniswap did it for Ethereum, PancakeSwap for Binance, and Jupiter for Solana. As a unified DeFi Hub, Elluminex aims to achieve the same and more for the TON blockchain. However, deviating from the traditional module, Elluminex introduces proprietary features such as premarket access as well as an AI-powered portfolio tracker that streamlines the overall DeFi experience for both new and experienced users. Additionally, Elluminex offers other key solutions including a comprehensive DEX protocol, advanced staking and farming mechanism, and cross-chain liquidity solutions. There is also an Academy that aims to eliminate DeFi illiteracy to the barest minimum, which further underscores Elluminex’s effort to deliver true financial liberty for its core users. This, coupled with exposure to the fastest growing network with over 950 million active users and over 1 billion recorded transactions, is drawing a massive interest to Elluminex presale, where the native ELX token currently sells for $0.06 with a potential for an exponential rally by launch.

However, the past week has been met with a severe fluctuation as XRP price hovers around a weekly price range of $3.24 and $3.18, reflecting a roughly 2% decline during the period. Regardless, XRP coin still maintains a generally bullish outlook, especially considering its year-to-date price gain of over 500%. As such, there has been sustained optimism for the native XRP coin among community members and market forecasters alike. Meanwhile, technical analysis on TradingView reveals that XRP coin’s moving averages maintain a bullish position, suggesting that the top altcoin holds a strong potential to break past its recently registered all-time high of $3.84 in the coming weeks. It could possibly hit double digits before the end of this bull cycle as top analysts like Ali Chart predicted. Conclusion While both ELluminex and Ripple have a primary goal of expanding DeFi access to the masses, it’s hard to conclude which one has the most potential to dominate the DeFi market. Elluminex in particular, is set to expand DeFi capabilities on the TON network, which in itself holds a lot of unrealized potential for the base network and broader crypto market.

Massad, who currently serves as a research associate at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School, voiced his disapproval in a recent interview. He argued that the Trump Organization was using the timing of the inauguration for financial gain, potentially opening the door for domestic and foreign organizations to purchase the tokens in an effort to curry favor with the new administration. Related News: BREAKING: 21Shares Files Spot ETF for Unexpected Altcoin “I think it was clearly wrong of them to issue these,” Massad said. “The Trump Organization took advantage of the President’s upcoming inauguration to make money. In addition, they did so in a way that created the potential for further conflicts of interest, because domestic or foreign firms or foreign governments could now purchase these memecoins to curry favor with the administration.” Massad also criticized the move for undermining efforts to create a responsible regulatory framework for crypto. “The stated purpose of the Executive Order is to support the responsible development of digital assets on the blockchain. I cannot think of an action more contrary to that purpose than issuing these memecoins right as I am taking office,” he added. During his tenure at the CFTC, Massad played a key role in classifying Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities. In evaluating this decision, he explained that the legal definition of a commodity extends beyond traditional goods like wheat, cotton, and corn. Bitcoin’s recognition as a commodity was based on its role in financial markets and its use in derivative contracts. *This is not investment advice.

This rapid progress has fueled excitement among early investors who recognize the rarity of such an innovative presale format. At present, 1 APC is priced at $0.000047, presenting a golden opportunity before prices rise in the next phase. With over $740,000 already raised, Arctic Pablo is proving its market demand. Investors who join at this stage could potentially see an ROI exceeding 16,936%, given the final presale price of $0.0008 and an expected launch price of $0.008. With each new phase, the entry price increases, making this the perfect time to get in while it remains affordable. The question is—will you secure your spot before the next location unlocks? TRUMP Coin’s New Utility Boosts Adoption The TRUMP meme coin has taken a major step toward mass adoption as select online stores now accept it as a form of payment.

As more platforms explore integrating TRUMP coin transactions, its demand continues to rise among both crypto investors and political supporters. Despite market fluctuations, TRUMP has maintained strong community backing. The latest updates suggest further developments that could expand its reach even more. With ongoing discussions about potential partnerships, the coin’s presence in the meme coin space is solidifying, making it one to watch in the coming months. Snek Coin’s Market Activity Sparks Interest Snek (SNEK), a meme coin built on the Cardano blockchain, is gaining traction as its community-driven efforts continue to shape its progress. Recent trading data shows SNEK is priced at around $0.00645, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $2.38 million. Although the coin experienced a minor 1.21% dip, its overall engagement remains strong, reflecting consistent investor interest. The Snek community plays a crucial role in the coin’s momentum, frequently rallying support across social platforms. With discussions about upcoming developments, Snek maintains its position as a prominent player in the meme coin sector. As market conditions fluctuate, the project’s long-term vision and community involvement remain key factors in its performance. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Leads the Charge in Meme Coin Innovation With meme coins evolving beyond simple internet jokes, projects like Arctic Pablo are redefining what’s possible in the crypto world. While TRUMP and Snek continue to push forward with new developments, Arctic Pablo’s adventurous presale concept sets it apart from the rest.

It has retraced since then, and the question now is whether it will be able to go into uncharted territory this year. Here’s DeepSeek’s answer. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP to New ATH Finally? The daily chart above shows that XRP was stuck below $1 for years, and it was predominantly trading within a tight range between $0.35 and $0.6. It stood close to the latter as the US elections took place, but once it became known that Donald Trump will return to the White House, Ripple’s cross-border token exploded in value. More positive news for the company behind it came from Gary Gensler’s departure announcement from the SEC, and this sent XRP further north. By the year’s end, the token had neared $3 and broke above it in January. Its peak came in the middle of the month, at just under $3.4 , which is the 2018 ATH, according to CoinGecko. Since then, XRP has been unable to push further and is even close to breaking below $3. However, there are more positive speculation in the US about its future, including a possible resolution of the SEC lawsuit as well as its introduction into strategic crypto reserve in the country. DeepSeek, which made the headlines earlier this week by possibly becoming a cheaper version of ChatGPT, outlined the lawsuit against the US securities regulator as the most important factor behind another XRP rally. “The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a significant overhang on XRP’s price. A favorable outcome for Ripple could lead to a surge in XRP’s price as it would remove a major uncertainty.” Other Factors DeepSeek also mentioned the overall regulatory environment not only in the US but across the globe. Positive news on that front could “boost investors’ confidence,” especially those who tend to stay away from the uncertainty regarding XRP’s status in the States. This could also enhance the XRP adoption rates, as well as lead to more strategic partnerships for the company behind it. The AI chatbot further indicated that the overall market conditions, meaning mostly BTC’s price movements, have to remain as bullish as they were in the past few months or even go beyond for XRP to resume its rally. Lastly, DeepSeek said XRP could benefit a lot from an altcoin season. It’s currently the second-largest alt and, given ETH’s underperformance lately, could be among the leaders in terms of further gains against the dollar and BTC. However, there have been many industry experts who doubted the existence of an altseason under the current market conditions. In conclusion, the ChatGPT alternative said it’s quite probable that XRP can indeed reach a new all-time high this year, but it needs the alignment of at least a few of the aforementioned factors.

The stablecoin has already crossed the $100 million market capitalization mark, proving its growing adoption. Additionally, Ripple’s decentralized exchange (XRPL DEX) recorded an on-chain trading volume of $1 billion in Q4, showcasing the growing activity within its ecosystem. XRP’s Eyeing $4 Mark The Ripple quarterly report also highlighted XRP’s remarkable 280% price increase in late 2024. This surge was driven by strong demand from top exchanges like Binance, Upbit Korea, and Coinbase. Despite a recent dip, with XRP trading at $3 and a 1% decline, experts remain bullish. Market analyst Dark Defender has set a short-term target for XRP, emphasizing the importance of holding the 3.07 support level. As per Coinpedia’s report , veteran trader Peter Brandt has spotted a bullish pattern in XRP’s price chart. If the pattern plays out as predicted, XRP could skyrocket to as high as $4.8. The SEC’s Changing Stance The report also touched on the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who returned to MIT as a lecturer. Gensler’s tenure was marked by controversy, with critics arguing that his policies created confusion in the crypto space.

TRON’s TRX: Empowering Creators in a Decentralized Digital World TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform that launched in 2017. It aims to give full ownership rights to digital content creators. Instead of big companies like YouTube or Facebook taking most of the profits, TRON allows creators to earn more rewards for their work. It does this by letting content consumers reward creators directly. TRON also supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, known as dApps. This means developers can build applications on TRON’s network and offer content without worrying about high fees. TRON’s potential lies in its focus on a decentralized internet. By cutting out middlemen, it puts power back into the hands of creators and users. In the current market, TRX looks attractive due to its unique approach and growing ecosystem. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, TRON offers faster transactions and lower fees. As more people seek alternatives to traditional platforms, TRON could see increased adoption. The trend towards decentralization and user empowerment makes TRX a coin to watch. Cardano’s ADA: The Sustainable Crypto Powerhouse Shaping the Future Cardano is emerging as a significant player in the cryptocurrency world, offering a flexible and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. This enables the development of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is a strong competitor to Ethereum’s ETH, allowing users to store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally sustainable approach. It utilizes the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient compared to the energy-intensive proof-of-work model used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The innovation doesn’t stop there. Cardano’s blockchain is uniquely divided into two layers—the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This division enhances its transaction processing capabilities, potentially reaching up to a million transactions per second. The introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021 has set a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability, offering secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In the current market cycle, ADA’s advanced technology and commitment to sustainability make it an attractive option for investors.

39773535,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=125870,1738404024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,🔥 Forget PEPE & SHIB—This New Meme Coin Could Be the Ultimate 7000% Moonshot Before 2026!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/%f0%9f%94%a5-forget-pepe-shib-this-new-meme-coin-could-be-the-ultimate-7000-moonshot-before-2026/,"In the lively crypto market, a new meme coin is catching attention. It’s making waves by promising impressive returns. As popular tokens like PEPE and SHIB make headlines, this emerging coin stands out with potential gains of 7000% by 2026. With the current bull run, investors are keen to see if this coin will deliver extraordinary rewards. Agent A.I. Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Agent A.I. is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins , two of the most prominent trends today . Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use “AI” as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Agent A.I. Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Agent A.I. aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility , while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Agent A.I. stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Agent A.I. is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform . According to its developers, the project’s AI framework can: Analyze massive datasets in milliseconds to improve decision-making Scale up processing power to match top cloud platforms Continuously refine its performance, learning and adapting over time. The development team behind Agent A.I. is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Agent A.I. has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices . The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token costs $0.003333333. It will go through 28 stages and reach $0.151515152 by the end of the presale. Those who buy at the first stage get a huge 98% discount . This pricing strategy means that the earlier you invest, the bigger the discount . Secure Your $AGNT Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Agent A.I. combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market : AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Agent A.I. Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Shiba Inu’s Roller Coaster: Is SHIB Set for a Surge or a Slip? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen ups and downs recently. Over the past week, the price dropped by -6.90%. In the past month, it decreased by -11.22%. However, in the last six months, SHIB gained 32.11%. This shows short-term declines but significant growth over the longer term. The current price ranges between $0.00001802 and $0.00002117. The nearest support level is at $0.00001694, and the nearest resistance is at $0.00002324. If the price breaks above resistance, it could reach $0.00002639, about 24% higher. If it falls below support, it might drop to $0.00001379, around 23% lower. Technical indicators are mixed. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are close, at $0.00001866 and $0.00001854, suggesting consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is at 55.32, indicating neutral momentum. The stochastic is at 38.43, not overbought or oversold. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.0000000159, hinting at potential bullishness. Based on these factors, SHIB could be poised for movement, but it’s uncertain if it will be up or down. Pepe Price Drops 34% in a Month – Rebound Ahead? Pepe (PEPE) has seen significant price changes recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 15.42%. In the last month, it declined by 34.89%. Despite these decreases, the coin’s value has grown by 50.55% over the past six months. Currently, PEPE is trading between $0.00001278 and $0.00001638. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00001877, while the closest support level is at $0.00001155.

If it falls below the support, it might drop to the second support at $0.000007949, a decrease of around 32%. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.00001296, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.00001272. This suggests a minor upward trend. The Relative Strength Index is 50.76, indicating a neutral position. The stochastic value of 22.83 suggests the coin may be oversold, hinting at potential upward movement.

Conclusion While SHIB and PEPE have made waves in the crypto market, their short-term potential may be limited as the bull run picks up pace. Agent A.I. steps into the spotlight as a new meme coin with ambitions to surpass these names. It aims to expose fake AI agents and inject humor into the space, all while offering the chance for significant gains. With a community-driven presale and a capped token supply, Agent A.I. presents a fresh opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the current market momentum before 2026.
