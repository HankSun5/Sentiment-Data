According to reports, the meeting finished without Trump specifically saying he would hand off every tariff move he intended to make after being sworn in as president next year. Donald Trump has been vocal about his intentions to levy tariffs on specific countries, especially those with trading agreements with the country. Although Trump views the meeting as ‘productive’, he remains unsold on the idea of abandoning his tariff plans. Canada, on the other hand, has been lumped into the same category as countries like Mexico due to the increased flow of migrants and drugs into the United States. Justin Trudeau and Trump confirms positive conversations After the meeting between both leaders, positive intonations were echoed from both parties. While Trudeau described their conversation as ‘excellent’, Donald Trump said in a lengthy post on Trust Social that they discussed several topics they need to cooperate to tackle. Trump mentioned that one of the issues that needs to be addressed is fentanyl and the drug cartel that had destroyed many lives after entering the country illegally. Trump also confirmed they discussed fair trade deals that will not harm the American working population and the United States trade deficit with its supporters in the North. Trump revealed that Trudeau showed his commitment to helping the United States end the fentanyl menace that had destroyed many families. He said the Prime Minister assured him that the country will end the movement of fentanyl through its border into America. Donald Trump had planned a 25% tax on products entering the country’s borders from Canada and Mexico, a law that will take effect when he assumes office. The fentanyl scourge, without a doubt, has been America’s bane, with the country’s agents seizing 43 pounds of the product at the Canadian border. In addition, it also seized 21,100 pounds of the banned product at Mexico’s border. Detailing immigration numbers, border patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October while 23,731 individuals were arrested at the Canadian border from October 2023 to September 2024. However, Canadian officials mentioned new investments in security at its border to prevent these issues from happening. Trudeau details the implications of Trump’s tariff posts According to an anonymous source with inside knowledge, Justin Trudeau initiated the meeting with Trump following the latter’s post concerning Tariffs on Monday. The source mentioned that officials in other countries are interested in how the meeting was arranged, asking for advice. During the dinner, which sources said lasted about three hours, the officials talked about different topics including energy, and trade. The statement from Trudeau’s office mentioned productive discussions. Although Trump had bad words for the Canadian Prime Minister during his first tenure, Trudeau was the first to congratulate him. Before the meeting, Trudeau noted that Trump did not talk about tariffs during his campaign but suddenly wants to add 25% to the costs of goods coming into the country. He said that he feels Trump is serious about the tariff, noting that if the American president-elect says he wants to do something, nothing is stopping him. However, he pointed out that the move could hurt Americans and Canadians. “Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,” he said. If Trump goes ahead with the Tariff move, it could prove costly, destroying the trade pact both countries signed during his first term in office. However, Trudeau mentioned that they were able to renegotiate a deal, saying it was a win for both countries. During his first spell as president, Trump imposed higher tariffs and other countries cranked up theirs too. Canada announced billions in new duties against America in response to taxes on steel and aluminum from the country. Canada is the top export destination for most of the US states, accounting for $2.7 billion worth of goods every day. Canada is trade-dependent, with 77% of its goods being moved into the United States.

Ondo Finance (ONDO) Ondo Finance is changing the game by combining the stability of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. It takes reliable, income-generating assets from the real world and turns them into tokens on the blockchain. This means more people can access high-quality financial products that were once only available to a few. By using blockchain, Ondo makes financial systems better and more accessible to everyone. It has two main parts: one creates tokenized financial products, and the other builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to make these products more functional and scalable. In a market that's often uncertain, Ondo stands out by focusing on trust and security. It works with well-known partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase to keep crypto assets safe. Ondo sets high standards for transparency and follows legal and regulatory rules closely. One of its key products, USDY, acts like a stablecoin but offers yields. It's backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits, giving it stability. For non-US investors, this means access to top-quality, regulated, and clear financial products. With the current interest in secure and transparent crypto options, Ondo's approach could appeal to many looking for reliable investments in the blockchain space. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, known by its token AVAX, is turning heads in the blockchain world. It's a Layer-1 platform that's eco-friendly, boasts low fees, and processes transactions at lightning speed—up to 4,500 per second. One standout feature is its ability for users to launch customizable Subnets, offering flexibility and scalability. Avalanche uses a unique consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto methods, ensuring transactions are finalized in less than two seconds. The platform operates with three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—which handle different tasks like transactions and smart contract execution. AVAX serves as the backbone of the Avalanche ecosystem. It's used for paying transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and powering multiple Subnets. This strong utility positions AVAX well in the current market. With the growing demand for fast and affordable blockchain solutions, Avalanche stands out among competitors. Its eco-friendly approach and rapid transaction times address key challenges in the industry. While markets are always shifting, Avalanche's technology and versatility make it a noteworthy player in today's crypto landscape. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects these digital agreements to real-world data. This means a smart contract can access information like weather reports or stock prices. Chainlink does this through a network of oracles, which are like messengers that bring data from outside sources to the blockchain. They use a reputation system to make sure the data is accurate and reliable. In the current market, Chainlink stands out because it solves a big problem: getting real-world data onto blockchains. This makes smart contracts more useful and opens up new possibilities. Unlike many other coins that focus on payments, Chainlink focuses on data and functionality. Its token, LINK, rewards those who provide data and helps secure the network. As more businesses look to use blockchain technology, the demand for Chainlink's services could grow. This unique approach makes LINK an interesting option to watch in today's market. Mantra (OM) MANTRA is a new blockchain platform that puts security first. It's designed to meet real-world regulatory requirements, making it a trustworthy choice for institutions and developers. With MANTRA, you get a blockchain that's open to everyone but can also support applications that need special permissions. This means businesses can build on MANTRA without worrying about breaking any rules. What makes MANTRA stand out is its strong technology foundation. It's built using the Cosmos SDK, which means it's compatible with other blockchains and supports smart contracts through CosmWasm. It can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, so it's ready for large-scale use. Plus, it offers tools to create and manage assets that comply with regulations. In today's market, where many are looking for secure and compliant blockchain solutions, OM, the coin of MANTRA, looks promising. It could be a strong competitor to other coins that don't focus on regulatory compliance, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion While ONDO, AVAX, LINK, and OM are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as a groundbreaking memecoin poised for exceptional growth in the 2024 bull run.

Helium (HNT) Price Prediction, Eyes on 18% Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News HNT, the native token of Helium, a blockchain-based network and leading DePIN token is poised for a notable upside rally as it has formed a bullish price action pattern. Helium (HNT) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, HNT has broken out of a consolidation zone that it formed after breaking out of a falling channel price action pattern. This consolidation breakout has shifted the overall sentiment for HNT toward the bullish side. Source: Trading View Based on historical price momentum, the recent price action which began with a breakout followed by consolidation, is considered one of the more successful patterns. Following this development, there is a strong possibility that HNT could soar by 18% to reach the $8.10 level in the coming days. On the positive side, HNT’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a potential upside rally in the coming days, as its current value stands at 60, below the overbought mark of 70. Bullish on-Chain Metrics However, HNT’s bullish price action appears to have attracted significant trader interest over the past 24 hours, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Rising Open interest Recent data shows that HNT’s open interest (OI) has surged by 31% in the last 24 hours and 9.2% in the past four hours. This growing OI reflects traders’ strong confidence and interest in the top DePIN token amid a bullish price action pattern. HNT Spot Inflow/OUt flow In addition to traders, whales and long-term holders are providing further support for this altcoin, as revealed by the Coinglass data center. According to HNT spot inflow/outflow data from exchanges since the beginning of November 2024, there has been a significant outflow from exchanges. Source: Coinglass The data also shows that, out of the past 30 days, exchanges experienced inflows on only 7 days, with the remaining 23 days marked by continuous outflows. This trend suggests that whales have significantly accumulated HNT tokens over the past month, during which the HNT price has remained stable. Current Price Momentum At press time, HNT is trading near $7.20 and has experienced a price surge of over 10.5% in the past 24 hours.

According to on-chain data, the breakout occurred as derivatives trading volume surged by over 420% to $983.06M, reflecting renewed interest from market participants. Additionally, open interest in THETA derivatives rose by 75.35% to $108.91 million, indicating that more traders are taking positions in the asset. This spike in activity coincided with THETA’s price moving past critical resistance levels at $2.40 and $2.50, confirming the start of a strong uptrend. Analysts Predict Further 348% Upside Concurrently, technical analysts are optimistic about the potential for further gains in THETA’s price. The chart provided by “World of Charts” indicates that the breakout from the descending triangle could lead to a rally targeting $9.00, a projected 348% surge from current levels. The measured move from the triangle’s base supports this bullish outlook. Javon Marks, a market analyst, pointed out that THETA’s ability to break its long-term trendline suggests a reversal of bearish momentum. Marks noted, “The steep upward trajectory and higher highs confirm that the bulls are in control, and the rally could extend to $8.00 in the near term.” He also highlighted that the price has yet to encounter significant resistance, which could enable continued growth in the short term. THETA Price Technical Analysis THETA’s technical indicators further support the bullish outlook. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is significantly above its signal line, confirming strong upward momentum. The widening gap between the MACD and the signal line suggests that the uptrend remains intact. Additionally, the Money Flow Index (MFI) is at 93.69, which places THETA in the overbought zone. While this indicates strong buying pressure, analysts caution that a minor pullback or consolidation could occur before the next leg up. THETA/USD (source: TradingView) Concurrently, the 50-day moving average is also approaching a bullish crossover with the 200-day moving average, signalling the potential for a “golden cross.” This technical pattern is often a precursor to sustained price increases hence backing the potential THETA price breakout.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. It started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, with half sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB's profile. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for NFT platforms and decentralized governance. These features contribute to its potential appeal in the current market cycle. Stellar (XLM): A Decentralized Network for Global Fund Transfers Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized blockchain network enabling quick, low-cost global fund transfers. It supports any currency, including national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Since 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major companies. Unlike cryptocurrencies that aim to replace financial systems, Stellar connects them, offering a unified network for collaboration. Individuals can transfer funds worldwide using Stellar apps. Businesses can develop blockchain applications or use the network for payments and currency conversion. The Stellar Development Foundation promotes network use, including NFT creation and smart contracts. With its focus on enhancing existing systems, Stellar's technology shows potential in the current market cycle. Terra Classic (LUNC): A Blockchain for Stable Global Payments Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain protocol that employs fiat-pegged stablecoins to enable price-stable global payment systems. Launched in April 2019, it merges the price stability of traditional currencies with the censorship resistance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Terra Classic offers fast and affordable settlements using stablecoins pegged to various currencies, including the U.S. dollar and South Korean won. In May 2022, the original Terra chain was rebranded to Terra Classic after launching a new chain named Terra (LUNA). The platform's technology aims to enhance financial accessibility by providing a decentralized system for global payments, leveraging blockchain to facilitate efficient and stable transactions worldwide. PEPE Memecoin: Embracing the Pepe the Frog Phenomenon on Ethereum PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Launched without transaction taxes and embracing a lack of utility, PEPE maintains a pure memecoin identity. In mid-2023, it achieved a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, igniting a memecoin frenzy and building a vibrant community. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. Unique features like a burning mechanism enhance scarcity, while a redistribution system rewards long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake security. Its presence on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin makes it accessible to many. In the current market cycle, PEPE continues to engage crypto enthusiasts. Conclusion Although SHIB, XLM, LUNC, and PEPE may become well-known by 2025, their short-term potential seems limited. In contrast, DOGEN is crafted for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and potential for massive returns, it builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

Initially designed as a three-year initiative, the company could achieve this goal in four months, thanks to its aggressive purchasing pace. This bold move is set to transform MicroStrategy’s financial future, with the company betting big on assets’ long-term value . Michael Saylor’s Strategy: A Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin journey began in August 2020, and the company has consistently made headlines with its purchases. This month alone, the firm spent $12 billion on BTC, including its most recent purchase. On Nov. 11, the company purchased 27,200 BTC for $2 billion, followed by another $4.6 billion worth of BTC on Nov.18 . Five days ago, the firm acquired another 55,500 BTC for $5.4 billion. These purchases are part of a strategy to consolidate its position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy follows a plan to acquire more Bitcoin, reflecting the vision of its executive chairman, Michael Saylor. With its latest acquisition, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 386,700 BTC, valued at nearly $22 billion at the current market price. MicroStrategy is willing to invest its financial resources in the acquisition of BTC. The company funded one of its latest Bitcoin purchases by leveraging its at-the-market share issuance program. To raise the required capital, MicroStrategy sold about 13.6 million shares. MicroStrategy Bet Big on Bitcoin, the Future of Digital Gold MicroStrategy’s approach also underscores its firm belief that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset. The firm believes BTC is a transformative financial instrument with the potential to reshape global finance. By accumulating over 380,000 BTC, the company has positioned Bitcoin as a cornerstone of its treasury reserve strategy . It is treating it as “digital gold,” a store of value that can withstand inflation and economic uncertainty. With Bitcoin trading near $100,000, MicroStrategy’s investment has more than doubled in value, turning its holdings into a formidable financial asset. However, this strategy has significant risks. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, with price swings that can lead to substantial losses as quickly as gains. Despite the risks, MicroStrategy’s bold moves have captivated attention. Crypto enthusiasts see the company as a pioneer and a symbol of Bitcoin’s growing mainstream adoption.

37065229,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655900,1733005852,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Breaks Multi-Year Resistance – Main Target Remains $2,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/xrp-breaks-multi-year-resistance-main-target-remains-2/,"XRP has broken through a key resistance level, reaching price points not seen since its multi-year highs set in 2021. The cryptocurrency has been on an aggressive upward trajectory for over three weeks, signaling strong bullish momentum in the market. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring XRP’s price action, as it shows no signs of slowing down. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a compelling technical analysis, suggesting that XRP is poised to reach the $2 mark in the near future. His analysis highlights XRP’s robust breakout above critical resistance levels, supported by strong trading volume and positive market sentiment. Martinez believes this momentum could propel the token to achieve its next significant milestone much faster than anticipated. As the altcoin market continues to flourish, XRP stands out as one of the top-performing assets , drawing increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether XRP can sustain its bullish pace and surpass further resistance levels. With technical indicators aligning with optimistic projections, XRP appears ready to continue its ascent, cementing its place as a leading cryptocurrency in this market cycle. XRP Testing Past Cycle’s Top XRP has reached an impressive $1.93, testing critical supply levels that marked the top of its last cycle. In 2021, Ripple was entangled in legal challenges with the SEC, creating uncertainty for the cryptocurrency. However, the landscape has shifted significantly since then, with Ripple gaining favorable momentum in the lawsuit and renewed investor confidence, propelling XRP to new heights. Martinez has provided an optimistic outlook, sharing a technical analysis on X that suggests XRP will likely surpass the $2 milestone soon. Martinez identifies this level as a key target as the cryptocurrency’s momentum builds. The price of XRP has surged by over 280% in less than a month, reflecting the strength of its current uptrend. Analysts are closely monitoring whether XRP can break above the psychological $2 mark, a level that would signal a continuation of its rally toward multi-year highs. The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP is further supported by increasing trading volume and strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. As the token approaches multi-year highs, the focus shifts to whether it can sustain this rally and break through the crucial resistance zone. For now, XRP continues to show remarkable resilience and upward potential, positioning itself as a standout performer in the crypto market. Technical Details XRP is trading at $1.93, following a remarkable 16% surge yesterday and an additional 7% rise today. The cryptocurrency continues its aggressive push toward the critical $2 level, capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. This sustained rally reflects growing confidence in XRP’s potential as it tests supply zones that once marked last cycle’s peak. Despite the bullish momentum, there’s a strong possibility that XRP may consolidate below the $2 mark for a few days. Such a pause could set the stage for a more explosive move as the broader crypto market gears up for a potential breakout. Historically, consolidations at key resistance levels often precede significant price rallies, and the current setup aligns with this pattern. XRP’s aggressive break above the $1.62 level was a pivotal moment, reinforcing bullish sentiment across the market. Many investors now expect XRP to challenge and surpass its previous cycle’s all-time high (ATH), setting the stage for a new price discovery phase. With momentum on its side and increasing interest from both retail and institutional players, XRP’s path forward could redefine its position in the market, marking a significant milestone in its price journey.

It is designed to be fast, low-cost, open, and borderless. Operating on a decentralized system without a central authority, XRP makes transactions irreversible and secure. It does not require a bank account for settlements, allowing for seamless transfers across different currencies. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled supply release. The name XRP, derived from ""ripple credits,"" reflects its aim to facilitate smooth payment transfers worldwide. Exploring ADA: Cardano's Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts. It helps developers make decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. ADA is its native cryptocurrency. Like Ethereum's ETH, ADA lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. This is different from energy-heavy proof-of-work models. The blockchain has two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This setup can boost transaction processing up to 1,000,000 transactions per second. Cardano's native tokens allow secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. Conclusion While XRP and ADA have been influential in the crypto arena, their short-term growth potential appears limited. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a technologically advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities. By utilizing AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO maximizes earnings. Its features include attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. Users enjoy a superior experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO stands out as a promising project.

In his latest comments, Anthony Pompliano explained the math behind the strategy and the potential risks associated with it. Pompliano acknowledged that the strategy could be lucrative but warned that there are risks investors must consider before fully embracing it. Anthony Pompliano Discusses the Risks Behind MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy In a recent interview , Anthony Pompliano analyzed MicroStrategy’s approach of using convertible debt to purchase Bitcoin. The company has been selling future equity at a 55% premium to fund Bitcoin acquisitions, an attractive proposition from a financial standpoint. By selling shares at higher prices than its current stock value, MicroStrategy is able to generate significant capital to buy Bitcoin. Anthony Pompliano emphasized that this method makes sense mathematically but warned investors about the risks that are often overlooked. He pointed out there are many unknowns that could impact the outcome of the Bitcoin Strategy. The key concern raised by Pompliano is that many investors blindly believe that nothing can go wrong with this strategy. He warned against this, stating, “Now, the counterweight to that is there’s a hell of a lot of people I see saying nothing can go wrong. I’m not in that camp. I couldn’t sit here and tell you what can go wrong, but what I can tell you is that an alarm goes off in my head when I start seeing everyone saying nothing can go wrong.” Despite these speculations, recently, the Bitcoin advocate revealed that Donald Trump holds Bitcoin and is a strong supporter of the cryptocurrency. According to Anthony Pompliano, Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance could reshape U.S. economic policies and lead to the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. Extreme Risks Associated With The Bitcoin Strategy One of the extreme risks Anthony Pompliano highlighted is the possibility of Bitcoin being banned in the United States. While he noted that this is unlikely to happen, he mentioned that such an event would damage MicroStrategy’s stock price. In a recent report, IntoTheBlock highlighted four major risks that MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy poses to the crypto market. Despite these being low-probability risks, Pompliano stressed that it’s essential for investors to consider the most extreme scenarios. Additionally, Pompliano suggested that the risks associated with this strategy are amplified by the crypto market volatility. While it is difficult to predict all risks, BTC volatility and the regulatory uncertainty must be taken into account. Amid the discussion, the Capital Management founder and CEO recently proposed that the United States should consider creating a Bitcoin reserve. He called for the U.S. government to allocate $250 billion to purchase Bitcoin as an hedge against dollar devaluation.

CYBRO is set to challenge the dominance of established platforms like Polkadot and Polygon. With such impressive early support, could CYBRO redefine the future of blockchain technology? The crypto community is watching closely to see if this newcomer will deliver on its promise. CYBRO Presale Climbs Past $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million DeFi Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This cutting-edge multichain DeFi platform offers investors unparalleled opportunities to maximize their earnings across various blockchains in any market condition.

It enables secure communication between different blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. This means value and data can be shared across chains. Polkadot uses parachains to boost speed and scalability, handling more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within the network. Holders can participate in developing the protocol and verifying transactions. Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, developed Polkadot. The Web3 Foundation maintains it. Polkadot aims to create more connected and efficient blockchains, improving how they work together. Exploring Polygon's Utility Token: Staking, Governance, and Exclusive Access The Polygon Ecosystem Token is a digital asset used within the Polygon network. It plays a key role in various operations across the ecosystem. Holders can use it for staking, locking up their tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards based on the amount staked. The token also allows holders to participate in governance, voting on proposals that shape the network's development. Additionally, it provides access to exclusive services and features within the ecosystem. As the network grows and adds more applications, the token's demand may increase due to its multiple uses within the ecosystem. Conclusion In the current bullish market of 2024, projects like CYBRO are capturing attention for their advanced features and strong potential. While coins like DOT and POL may offer less short-term growth, CYBRO distinguishes itself as a cutting-edge DeFi platform. By leveraging AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, it provides investors with unparalleled opportunities to maximize earnings. Its user-friendly experience includes seamless deposits and withdrawals, lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. With a strong emphasis on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO is attracting significant interest from crypto whales and influencers.

Heavyweights like $FIL (+19.67%) and $WLD (+26.08%) are dominating the spotlight, but the AI crypto sector, once dormant, has now awakened with a vengeance. Yesterday, we delved into Fetch.ai ($FET – link here ), showcasing its potential to redefine the AI blockchain sector. Today, the spotlight shifts to Render Network ( $RNDR )—the "" Nvidia of blockchain computing."" With Ethereum ($ETH ) approaching 0.040 BTC , signaling a potential altseason breakout, Render is gearing up to test its $10 psychological barrier, a critical level for reclaiming its March 2024 highs. Let’s dissect the setup for this fascinating AI infrastructure project and its roadmap toward a potential breakout. Render Network’s Core Value Proposition Render Network decentralizes GPU rendering by connecting creators and GPU node operators, leveraging blockchain technology to monetize idle computing power. It’s tailor-made for the growing AI-driven content creation sector. Key Metrics: Circulating Supply: 517.69M Market Cap: $4.69B Max Supply: 644.17M Render boasts strong tokenomics with minimal inflation risks. Coupled with its real-world utility in GPU rendering and AI applications, $RNDR is uniquely positioned to ride the next wave of AI and crypto adoption. Technical Breakdown: Where Are We Now? 1W Chart: The Battle for $10 The weekly chart shows a methodical recovery from its August 2024 lows at $3.40, a spring point in a textbook Wyckoff Accumulation schematic. Key Support Levels: The $6.90-$7.15 zone aligns with the 50W MA ($6.95) and previous resistance turned support, forming a strong base for accumulation. Critical Resistance Zones: $8.30-$9.90: Render is currently battling within this range, a pivotal zone left by March’s explosive “God Candle.” $10: The psychological threshold where confidence will either surge or falter. $13.85: The all-time high, a likely target for bulls once $10 is conquered. RSI: Slightly above 60, indicating momentum without overextension. Volume & Momentum: Weekly volumes are picking up post-U.S. election but remain below November 2023 levels, leaving room for explosive moves. As the 50W MA rises, dynamic support strengthens, increasing the probability of long-term upside. 1D Chart: The Anatomy of a Breakout Render’s daily chart highlights precise technical developments: Golden Cross Incoming: The 50D MA ($6.06) is set to cross above the 200D MA ($6.63), signaling the return of a long-term bullish trend. Dynamic Supports: The $6.90-$7.15 zone continues to align with horizontal support, bolstered by diminishing pullback volumes and volume spikes on breakouts. Battle for $10: Price is testing this psychological level, with RSI confirming strength. A breakout above $10 could trigger Price Discovery Mode. Explosive Rhetoric Alert: A clean break above $10 may lead to quick leg-ups toward $12 and $13.85, but volatility remains a factor—so patience is key. Render vs. Bitcoin (RNDR/BTC): Relative Strength Render’s BTC pairing highlights its relative outperformance: Support Flip: Render flipped 322 SATs (50W MA) into support, with minimal resistance toward 380 SATs. Volume Profile: Minimal resistance above current levels signals potential for accelerated price movement relative to Bitcoin. 3 Key Takeaways from Both Charts Consolidation Zones Building Momentum: Both charts highlight Render consolidating within major resistance zones ($8.30-$9.90), setting the stage for an explosive move. Golden Cross & Wyckoff Spring: The upcoming Golden Cross and Wyckoff Accumulation spring ($3.40 lows) are powerful confluences, signaling a strong bullish setup. Dynamic Supports Rising: Fast-rising moving averages bolster $6.90-$7.15 as a high-probability entry point for disciplined traders. 3 Entry Strategies for $RNDR 1. Closing Above $10 Rating: 8/10 – ""Parabolic Potential."" Rationale: A confirmed close above $10 signals strength and Price Discovery Mode, targeting $12 and $13.85. Stop Loss: $9.50 – Manage volatility. Advice: Wait for volume confirmation. Without it, false breakouts can be devastating. Take Profit Levels: $12.00-$12.50 – Immediate resistance zone. $13.85 – March ATH. $15-$16 – Short-term overshoot. 2. $6.90-$7.15 Zone (Dynamic + Horizontal Support) Rating: 9/10 – ""Solid Foundation."" Rationale: A confluence of horizontal support and the fast-rising 50W MA ($6.95). Stop Loss: $5.80 – Wide enough to avoid noise. Advice: Use laddered entries and monitor price action. Institutions are likely accumulating here. Take Profit Levels: $10-$11.95 – Psychological & technical resistance. $13.85 – March ATH. $20+ – If the trend accelerates. 3. $5.90-$5.00 (Stink Order Zone) Rating: 7/10 – ""Patience Pays Dividends."" Rationale: Flash crash levels aligned with historical pivot points and rising dynamic support. Stop Loss: $4.50 or monitor live. Advice: These levels are rare opportunities but require patience. Take Profit Levels: $8-$9.90 – Quick recovery zone. $11.95-$12 – Pre-ATH levels. $13.85+ – Aiming for the moon. Optimistic 2025 Targets Triple Market Cap Target: $27-$30 – A realistic target if Render triples its market cap. Parabolic Blow-Off Top: $50-$60 – The speculative climax of a 2025 bull run, driven by AI hype. Summary: The Battle for $10 Render’s battle for $10 is more than psychological—it’s the gateway to reclaiming its ATH and entering Price Discovery Mode. A clean break, supported by volume, could trigger the next leg up in its bullish cycle. Key Takeaways: Accumulate Smart: Focus on strong support zones like $6.90-$7.15. Don’t Chase Pumps: Wait for confirmations. Execute Strategically: Stick to your plan—volatile markets reward discipline. As November’s ""Moonvember"" comes to a close, here’s to another spectacular month ahead. Stay disciplined, and get ready for the next AI coin spotlight: Opulous ( $OPUL )—a project with even bigger potential than Render.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 23:07:03

The class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Friday evening and names OpenAI, its CEO Sam Altman, President Greg Brockman, Microsoft, and several others associated with the companies. Tesla CEO’s lawyers say that OpenAI has changed its focus from a non-profit organization and is using tactics that are damaging to the competition in the AI sector. Elon Musk Files Lawsuit Against OpenAI and Microsoft According to Elon Musk’s lawyers, OpenAI and Microsoft are engaging in market manipulation to deter investments into competing AI ventures, including Musk’s xAI. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI coerced investors into not supporting rivals such as xAI that has recently secured funding. Musk’s attorneys refer to the fact that OpenAI compelled investors in its last funding round not to invest in competing AI ventures, which presents a challenge to organizations like xAI. Additionally, the injunction aims at stopping OpenAI and Microsoft from taking other actions that may be detrimental to the market such as sharing of property information and invention. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI has changed the governance of the platform to that of a for-profit business model which is the opposite of what was promised initially. Musk’s legal team claims that this shift violates the initial mission of OpenAI to contribute its AI technologies to the public for the common good. Microsoft’s Role and Financial Interests Another key factor of Musk’s case is the vast financial support that Microsoft has provided to OpenAI. Since 2019, Microsoft has pumped in more than $13 billion into OpenAI and in the process has booked itself a large share of the company’s revenue. The complaint states that Microsoft has been using this partnership to acquire information and assets from OpenAI, including the AI models, hosted on Microsoft’s cloud services. The filing also reveals possible concerns over conflicts of interest. For example, it discusses how Sam Altman, the chairman of OpenAI, has a financial interest in Stripe, the company that OpenAI used for payments. Musk’s team claims that Altman’s relationship with Stripe will create a conflict that can influence OpenAI in a wrong way and hinder competition within the market. These allegations suggest a wider scheme of self-enrichment that Musk’s lawyers state is damaging the AI environment. xAI’s Growth and Investor Backlash Although xAI has struggled with fundraising, the company has recently announced that it has closed a $5 billion funding round, with investment from firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Fidelity. Despite Musk’s allegations that OpenAI’s actions have made some investors refrain from investing in xAI, the recent funding received by the company indicates that it has not faced challenges in raising capital. The lawsuit also mention that Musk’s xAI, which was founded last year, has created its own generative AI named Grok. This model supports several features on Musk’s social network X (previously Twitter). Although xAI is already a financially backed company in the AI field, Musk’s team claims that the current OpenAI’s practices may be detrimental to the company’s future. Despite these claims, Sam Altman’s OpenAI recently announced a $1.5 billion investment facilitated through a tender offer. The move allowed employees to sell shares to SoftBank, which now holds a significant stake in the company. This transaction adds another layer of complexity to Musk’s claims, as his legal team contends that OpenAI is further distancing itself from its original nonprofit mission in favor of financial gain.

But with so many coins out there, it’s easy to wonder: which ones are worth it? Two cryptos are making waves for their unique functionalities and solid potential among the sea of digital assets. Toncoin has emerged as a leader in blockchain-based communications, offering seamless integrations for messaging platforms. Stellar, meanwhile, continues to innovate in cross-border transactions, providing fast and affordable financial solutions. But let’s talk about Qubetics ($TICS)—the rising star that’s redefining the Web3 space. With an ecosystem that boasts groundbreaking tech like a decentralised VPN (dVPN) and an electrifying presale that’s got analysts predicting jaw-dropping returns, this one’s making serious excitement. This article will dive into Qubetics, Toncoin, and Stellar to help you discover your next top crypto to invest in. Qubetics: The Future of Web3 Privacy and Security Qubetics is setting a new standard in Web3 infrastructure with its revolutionary decentralised VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralised systems that can log user data, censor access, or even suffer from single points of failure, Qubetics flips the script. Its dVPN runs on a peer-to-peer, blockchain-powered network where no central authority has control. What does that mean for you? Total freedom and privacy online. Your data is encrypted end-to-end, ensuring anonymity while bypassing censorship. Multi-hop routing shields your internet traffic through multiple nodes, making it nearly impossible for anyone to trace. Even better, Qubetics incentivises users to share the bandwidth by rewarding them with $TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining marketplace where security meets economic opportunity. In short, it’s not just a VPN; it’s a game-changer for online privacy. Toncoin: Redefining Blockchain-Based Communications Toncoin, the brainchild of the Telegram Open Network, is making strides in integrating blockchain and communication technologies. Built to complement messaging platforms, it enables seamless payments, smart contracts, and decentralised applications within the ecosystem. Its focus on scalability and ease of use has positioned it as a leader in the evolving crypto landscape. For those interested in projects that combine practicality with innovation, Toncoin is worth keeping an eye on. Stellar: The Powerhouse of Cross-Border Transactions Stellar continues to prove its value in the world of decentralised finance, specifically for cross-border payments. By offering a blockchain-based solution that’s fast, affordable, and inclusive, Stellar has created a platform that connects financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. Whether you’re sending remittances or managing business transactions, Stellar’s network ensures low fees and reliable speeds. It’s a solid contender for anyone seeking the top cryptos. Early Bird Wins! Qubetics Presale Offers Massive Growth Potential If you’ve ever dreamed of catching the next big crypto before it takes off, here’s your chance. Right now, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.025 during the presale. Imagine this: $1,000 today gets you a whopping 40,000 $TICS tokens. Now, let’s talk numbers—because they’re wild. Analysts are predicting that $TICS could skyrocket to $10 in the near future. That means your $1,000 investment could balloon to $400,000—an astonishing ROI of 39,900%. And if it climbs even higher to $15? You’re looking at $600,000, with an ROI of 59,900%. These aren’t just numbers; they’re life-changing possibilities. But here’s the kicker—presales like this don’t last forever. The early bird gets the worm, and in this case, the worm might just be a golden ticket to your financial freedom. If you’re hunting for the top crypto to invest in , Qubetics should be on your radar. Conclusion: Which Crypto Will Shape Your Future? The right investment today could transform your tomorrow. Toncoin is innovating communication, Stellar is revolutionising cross-border finance, and Qubetics is pioneering Web3 privacy and security. Each has its strengths and potential to deliver significant returns. But if you’re looking for excitement, unparalleled potential, and a chance to be part of something transformative, Qubetics stands out. Its dVPN is set to reshape how we think about online privacy, and its presale is the kind of opportunity that investors dream about.

However, a joint report by Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets research suggests significant growth potential, with experts projecting expansion to 10% of the US money supply (M2) and foreign exchange (FX) transactions. Regulation Could Unlock Stablecoins’ Full Potential According to the report titled ‘Stablecoins: The First Killer App,’ the utility of stablecoins has evolved well beyond their original role in cryptocurrency trading. Initially used as a bridge asset for trading, stablecoins are increasingly employed in cross-border payments, payroll, trade settlements, and remittances. These applications demonstrate their ability to address inefficiencies in existing financial systems, such as high costs, delayed transaction times, and limited accessibility in underserved regions. By providing faster and cheaper transactions, stablecoins offer a compelling solution for international remittances and business operations, positioning themselves as a pivotal tool in modern finance. The analysis also highlighted the implications of stablecoin adoption for the broader financial ecosystem. At present, stablecoins’ total market capitalization is dwarfed by the $21 trillion US M2 and $2.1 trillion in daily FX spot transactions. However, achieving a 10% share could transform them into a dominant force in global finance, thereby reshaping the landscape of digital payments and settlements. Regulation is seen as the key to this transition. While previous US administrations have made little progress in establishing stablecoin-specific policies, the report suggests that a Trump-led government in 2025 might prioritize these efforts. In fact, this regulatory clarity is expected to unlock stablecoins’ full potential, enabling them to scale and diversify their use cases further. Stablecoin Adoption Soars in Emerging Markets Geographically, USD-backed stablecoins dominate the market, comprising 99.3% of current stablecoin market capitalization. Tether (USDT) leads with a 73% market share, followed by Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) at 21%. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered’s Thursday report cited a YouGov survey that found compelling use cases. Across five emerging markets – Brazil, Turkey, Nigeria, India, and Indonesia – it was observed that 69% of respondents use stablecoins for currency substitution, while 39% employ them for cross-border payments and goods and services transactions.

American author Robert Kiyosaki made a controversial stand after commenting that the psychological phenomenon of the fear of missing out (FOMO) can be a positive driving force that will push investors to buy the top crypto before it reaches the $100,000 level. Bitcoin: The Challenge To Invest Kiyosaki warned that once Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 level, it would be challenging for the middle class to invest significant amounts in the firstborn crypto, urging them to invest now that the digital currency is still below the said level. “Once Bitcoin passes $100,000 it will be almost impossible for the poor and middle class to catch up,” Kiyosaki said. The American author explained that once Bitcoin becomes more accessible only to the ultra-wealthy, holders of traditional fiat currencies such as the dollar, euro, and yen will lose out. Kiyosaki, who is an advocate of alternatives to fiat currencies such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin, argued that if BTC breaks the $100,000 level, “only the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence.” THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WiLL BE RICHER?A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WhO WILL BE POORER?A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad“Savers are losers…because… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 29, 2024 Embracing FOMO Ever since Kiyosaki has been promoting investment in Bitcoin, he believed that the crypto offers an opportunity to better protect wealth than the traditional currencies. Now that BTC is nearing a new all-time high, Kiyosaki urged people like those in the middle class to invest in Bitcoin, saying that if they are hesitant, they can embrace the FOMO mentality. “FOMO is good. Don’t be left behind!” he added. He explained that the fear of missing out on the Bitcoin opportunity could pull people to invest in the crypto so they could benefit when the coin reaches new heights. Fiat Savings Not Good The author dispelled people from saving, saying that ‘savers are losers” because, in his opinion, “cash is trash.” Kiyosaki explained that holding Bitcoin is better than saving in cash because traditional fiat currencies have to contend with inflation which reduces its value over time. In an X post, he urged people to diversify their assets and invest in alternatives such as Bitcoin, claiming that government monetary policies and inflation will continue to “erode the purchasing power of traditional currencies.” He pointed out that today is the right time to invest in BTC because once the coin breaches the $100,000 milestone, it will be nearly impossible for most people to get hold of it. As of press time, BTC is being traded at $96,722 per coin, with a total market capitalization of $1.9 trillion.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB.

Charles took to X (formerly Twitter) to sound the alarm on the aftermath of Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which he claims has devastated businesses, hurt economies, and crushed innovation worldwide. “So many people put their head in the sand for political reasons, saying it’s not as bad as the industry made it out to be,” Charles wrote. “It is worse and global. So many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed.” He warned that the fallout from this crackdown will take years to heal and urged the crypto community to unite, adding, “We have a small window of time to get a law passed.” Charles’s comments were prompted by Binance chairman Gabriel Abed, who revealed his own experience of being debanked outside the United States. Abed recounted how First Citizens Caribbean Bank shut down his accounts—accounts he’d held for over a decade—because he received a bitcoin-related deposit. The bank’s CEO explained that working with crypto companies posed too high a risk to their American correspondent banking relationships. Abed’s experience, he said, is not unique. International banks were severing ties with crypto clients to comply with “standards” set by their U.S. counterparts. “This isn’t just an American issue,” Abed said. “It’s global.” Crypto industry blames Biden administration for financial suppression The crypto community believes it knows who’s behind this assault: the Biden administration. Industry leaders accuse the government of reviving the controversial Obama-era Operation Chokepoint under a new guise. The original program, launched in 2013, pressured banks to cut ties with industries considered “high risk,” such as payday lenders and firearms dealers. Critics argued that legitimate businesses were being unfairly targeted. Operation Chokepoint officially ended in 2017, but crypto insiders say it made a comeback in 2021, this time with blockchain firms in its crosshairs. Elon Musk reignited the discussion with a single question: “Did you know that 30 tech founders were secretly debanked?” Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, jumped in immediately. “Yes,” he responded. “I was debanked because I’m in crypto, as was Gemini. The number is probably much larger than 30. That’s just in the a16z portfolio alone.” Tyler accused the Biden administration of “assassinating” banks that dared to serve the crypto industry. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, backed Tyler with his own allegations. “Can confirm this is true,” Brian said, calling the debanking of crypto companies one of the most unethical moves in American history. He pointed fingers at Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler, claiming they orchestrated a deliberate attempt to “kill” the industry. “My guess? We’ll find Warren’s fingerprints all over it. Biden himself was probably unaware,” Brian speculated. He revealed that Coinbase is using Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover who exactly was involved. https://twitter.com/brian_Brian/status/1861890800268775923 “This was a major factor in the Democrats losing the election,” Brian continued. “The party should realize Warren is a liability and distance themselves if they want any hope of rebuilding.” Marc Andreessen, the highly-respected venture capitalist, appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast to call out what he sees as blatant financial censorship. “This is about control, not compliance,” Marc said, describing how at least 30 tech founders, himself included, were targeted and debanked for political reasons. He pointed to the broader implications: “This goes beyond crypto. This is about freedom.” The global fallout of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Andrew Torba, founder of Gab, shared his story of relentless account closures. “Without a bank account, you can’t store cash, run payroll, or pay bills,” he said. “That’s the point—choke businesses until they die.” Andrew said he opened accounts with major banks, credit unions, and even Christian financial institutions, only to be repeatedly shut out. “The reason was always the same: ‘Our terms say we can do this anytime, for any reason, or no reason at all.’” According to him, banks have admitted off the record that they were being pressured by the government with threats of audits and regulatory scrutiny. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, has also been vocal about her experience. Long confirmed that her company has been debanked multiple times and is now suing the Federal Reserve. Her case is scheduled for oral arguments on January 21, just one day after Inauguration Day. John Deaton, a well-known crypto lawyer and former US Senate candidate, called Caitlin’s lawsuit “arguably the most important fight against unelected bureaucrats and the deep state protecting the banking system’s status quo.” Payment processing veteran Brian Roemmele shares these concerns. He described how Operation Chokepoint 2.0 has destroyed trust in the financial system. Roemmele has worked in merchant processing since the 1980s and said the Biden-era version of the program is even more destructive than the original. “This time, it’s vengeful,” Roemmele said, adding that thousands of businesses have been wiped out overnight. He claimed the crackdown has made doing business ten times more expensive and accused the government of using banks as tools of state corruption. Gabriel Abed’s story offers a glimpse into how this suppression plays out on the ground. After receiving a bitcoin-related deposit flagged as high risk, his decade-old accounts were shut down. He called the debanking crisis a “clear example of how far-reaching the consequences of U.S. banking policies are,” adding that local banks are often caught in the crossfire. “Barbadian banks face immense pressure to comply with U.S. standards or risk losing their correspondent relationships.” Charles, for his part, is urging the crypto industry to unite. He believes the community has a small window of time to push for legislative reforms to ensure such a campaign is never repeated. “We have to come together to prevent this horror from ever happening again,” he said.

However, the L2 network stated it would focus on dApp building and developer empowerment moving forward. It even asked for input on how best to improve its services. Base’s focus is on dApp development and encouraging developers Jesse Pollak, founder of Base and Head of Protocols at Coinbase, revealed in a post on X that they had no intention of launching a native token; instead, the platform will prioritize dApp building. He said : And finally, there are no plans for a Base network token. We are focused on building, and we want to solve real problems that let you build better. I want your feedback on what we can be doing better. ~ Jesse Pollak In another post, Pollak tagged the platform’s “greatest strengths” as its open source, open standards, and open markets, which, according to him, breed faster innovation and more fun. He gave the example of Clanker on the platform. He’s even encouraged developers to build on the platform, saying, “Build, and we will be rewarded.” Base’s VIRTUAL is in surprisingly high demand, with its market cap growing by over 60% Although the L2 network does not intend to release a native token on its network anytime soon, some of the products on its blockchain are doing exceedingly well, including the VIRTUAL Token and aixbt. According to Coingecko , by November 29, Virtual Protocols Ecosystem on Base’s platform’s market cap had soared by over 50.4%, reaching $1.78 billion. Currently, it is close to surpassing $2.4 billion, rising by 61%. The token VIRTUAL‘s 24-hour trading volume is at $498,352,940. It is currently trading at $1,79, a 35% rise in the last 24 hours and up by 206% in the last seven days. Aixbt’s price has also risen by over 323% in the last week, trading at $0.201. Pollak even commented on Aixbt’s rise, saying the AI agent ranks first in on-chain mindshare. Analysts have attributed the growing interest in the Virtual Products Ecosystem to the escalated demand for AI agents and AI-based programs, which are efficient and fast at completing tasks. Greg Isenberg, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, projects even more revenue growth for AI agents like Aixbt. He believes the market for AI agents could easily grow to a trillion-dollar market, saying the world will soon replace human workflows with AI agents.

Crypto analysts like Dark Defender have provided insights into what could come next for XRP. XRP Price Could Rally To $5 Next In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender suggested that the XRP price could rally as high as $5 on its next leg to the upside. This came as he noted that the first target of $1.8 for XRP in this bull run has happened, which led to the crypto hitting the $100 billion market cap mark. With the first target out of the way, XRP could reach $5.8, which Dark Defender’s accompanying chart highlights as one of the median targets. Interestingly, the chart also highlights $18 as a median target, indicating that the crypto could reach this level at some point. Dark Defender also recently used his Elliot Wave theory analysis to show how XRP could hit $18 in this market cycle. The chart showed this parabolic rally would occur on the Wave 5 impulsive move to the upside. Meanwhile, in another X post , the crypto analyst warned about how critical the Fibonacci level at $1.8815 is in the short term. He noted that the XRP price touched $1.9508 and then bounced back to this Fib level. In line with this, he stated that the crypto must stay above $1.8815 for at least three candles. According to Dark Defender, the first step is to stay 12 hours above this level, followed by a 3-day close above this level. A sustained close above this Fib level could confirm that as a significant support level and propel XRP to new highs. Amid the recent XRP rally, it is worth mentioning that the crypto has flipped BNB to become the fifth-largest crypto by market cap. Dark Defender believes XRP could flip Solana next to become the fourth-largest crypto by market cap. The analyst had before now also boldly predicted that the crypto would flip Ethereum at some point. Double Digits Price Target On The Horizon Crypto analysts like Egrag Crypto and Mikybull Crypto have also suggested that a double-digit price target for the XRP price is on the horizon. In his analysis, Egrag Crypto stated that FOMO will ignite if XRP closes above the $2 level. He added that if history repeats itself, XRP will likely trade in double digits between $20 and $27. From the accompanying chart, the analyst looks to be referring to the 2017 bull run, in which XRP recorded massive gains on its way to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.8. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also stated in an X post that the XRP price is giving off 2017 rally vibes. Based on this, the analyst predicts that XRP will hit $2 and then experience a pullback before it continues its “vertical hated rallies” to a new cycle top of probably $10. In another X post, he told market participants to watch what will follow after XRP breaks a new ATH. The crypto analyst added that the 2017 kind of massive rallies are about to be unveiled before everyone’s eyes. With XRP flying high at the moment, a recent CoinGape market analysis also raised the possibility of the crypto’s ATH being imminent .

This key level, acting as a significant hurdle, is widely seen as the launchpad for a potential parabolic rally. If DOGE manages to break above this barrier, it could enter uncharted territory and achieve new all-time highs. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a detailed technical and macro analysis on X, highlighting Dogecoin’s strong potential for continuing its bullish momentum. According to Martinez, DOGE is positioned for a parabolic rally, driven by growing interest and increasing adoption in the market. His analysis underlines the importance of the $0.43 resistance level, suggesting that a decisive breakout could trigger substantial upward price action. The meme coin, known for its vibrant community and unpredictable price moves, has gained traction as broader market sentiment turns bullish. With consolidating price action and strengthening technical indicators, Dogecoin appears ready to embark on its next major leg up . The coming days will be critical for determining whether DOGE can overcome this resistance and fulfill the expectations of a parabolic rally. Dogecoin About To Enter Bullish Phase Again Dogecoin’s history of explosive rallies has made it one of the most closely watched cryptocurrencies. The last time DOGE began a significant rally, it surged over 215%, delivering substantial gains and fueling widespread speculation about its price potential. Now, as the meme coin consolidates, investors and analysts are eyeing the next big move. Martinez has provided valuable insights into DOGE’s current price action . He notes that Dogecoin is firmly in a consolidation phase, testing investors’ patience during this parabolic run. Drawing comparisons to similar market conditions in 2017 and 2020, Martinez highlights a critical pattern: the appearance of a TD Sequential sell signal, often signaling a brief correction before the rally resumes. This historical perspective suggests that DOGE’s temporary pause may set the stage for an even more aggressive surge. As the broader market continues to rise, expectations for Dogecoin remain high. Many investors are optimistic that DOGE will soon replicate its past performance and embark on a massive upward trajectory. Martinez predicts that such a surge will likely align with Bitcoin breaking its all-time highs and crossing the $100,000 threshold, a milestone anticipated as early as next week. If Bitcoin delivers, Dogecoin could follow suit with a breakout to new highs. DOGE Testing Supply Level Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.426, just below the critical resistance level at $0.43. This resistance has so far prevented a bullish continuation, making it a pivotal point for DOGE’s next price action. If the price manages to break above $0.43 and sustain this level for a few days, it could pave the way for a strong breakout and further upside momentum. Investors and traders are closely monitoring this area as a decisive move could trigger a significant rally. However, the $0.43 mark also represents a potential barrier. A failed breakout at this level would likely lead to a correction, pulling the price back to retest lower support zones. In such a scenario, DOGE could drop to around $0.35, depending on broader market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price action. The next few days are crucial as Dogecoin approaches this resistance with heightened market anticipation. Bulls aim for a breakout to sustain the parabolic run, while bears may seize the opportunity to push prices lower if momentum falters. For now, the $0.43 level remains the key to determining DOGE’s immediate direction and whether it will embark on a bullish continuation or face a pullback.

In a market full of innovation, three projects stand out for their potential to shape the future. While each brings something unique, one newcomer is stealing the spotlight. Ethereum has long been a pioneer in decentralised applications, while Kaspa focuses on speed and scalability. But then there’s Qubetics ($TICS)—a revolutionary blockchain platform redefining interoperability. The presale creates waves, offering massive ROI potential and a chance to get in early. This article will explore Qubetics, Ethereum, and Kaspa and explain why they are the best cryptos to buy now. Let’s start with the rising star: Qubetics. The Web3 Aggregator That’s Redefining Crypto: Qubetics Is Here The current blockchain ecosystem is like a bustling city with no bridges. Each network operates in isolation, limiting the potential for seamless transactions and data sharing. This siloed approach creates headaches for developers and hinders mass adoption of blockchain technology. Enter Qubetics, a Web3-aggregated chain that’s tearing down these barriers. Qubetics unifies multiple networks into a single, interconnected framework. This groundbreaking approach enables smooth asset transfers, efficient data sharing, and true cross-chain functionality. For developers, enterprises, and users, Qubetics means fewer limitations and more opportunities. Imagine an app that easily communicates with other networks or seamless asset swaps without complex workarounds. Qubetics is setting the stage for decentralised technologies to work together like never before, unlocking blockchain’s full potential. Ethereum: The OG Smart Contract Platform Ethereum needs no introduction. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, it paved the way for decentralised applications (dApps). Its ecosystem is home to thousands of projects, from DeFi to NFTs, making it a cornerstone of the crypto world. Despite its success, Ethereum faces challenges like high fees and slower transaction speeds, which newer competitors are eager to address. However, with Ethereum 2.0 upgrades rolling out, including proof-of-stake consensus, the network is evolving to stay competitive. For those looking for a solid long-term bet, Ethereum remains one of the best cryptos. Kaspa: Speed Meets Scalability Kaspa is all about speed. Designed as a proof-of-work blockchain, Kaspa delivers ultra-fast transaction confirmations without sacrificing decentralisation. Its innovative design ensures scalability, making it a great option for real-time applications and high-demand networks. Kaspa’s focus on speed and simplicity sets it apart in a complex market. While it’s still growing, its unique architecture and developer-friendly ecosystem make it a standout for those seeking efficiency. For many, it’s emerging as one of the best cryptos. Why $TICS is the Best Crypto to Buy Now? Qubetics’ presale is where the excitement hits a fever pitch. Currently, in Phase 10, this presale is structured to reward early adopters. Every week, token prices climb by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike at the final stage. Right now, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.025, and the numbers are jaw-dropping: $3.8 million raised 5000+ holders 239 million tokens sold If you’re looking to maximise returns, this phase is your golden ticket. Analysts predict a post-presale value of $0.25 per token, translating to a staggering 900% ROI for those who get in now. But that’s just the start. Let’s talk numbers. A $100 investment at $0.025 would secure 4,000 $TICS tokens. If the token price hits $10, that $100 turns into $40,000. At $15, you’re looking at $60,000—a mind-blowing ROI of 59,900%. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about timing. The best crypto to buy now is the one with massive growth potential, and $TICS checks every box. Conclusion: The Best Crypto to Buy Now with Massive Growth Potential As the crypto market evolves, three projects stand out: Ethereum, Kaspa, and Qubetics. Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralised innovation, while Kaspa offers unmatched speed. But Qubetics ? It’s the game-changer. Analysts are excited about the insane ROI potential of Qubetics’ presale. With its vision of unified blockchain interoperability and a token price poised to skyrocket, $TICS offers something no other crypto does right now. The presale is your chance to be part of the next big thing. If you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy now, don’t let Qubetics’ presale pass you by. It’s not just an investment—it’s a leap into the future of blockchain. Get in now and secure your place before the price takes off.

Here’s Your Chance to Redeem Yourself,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-bitcoins-rise-heres-your-chance-to-redeem-yourself/,"Remember when Bitcoin was just a few dollars per coin? If only you had invested back then, your portfolio might look completely different today. Missing out on Bitcoin’s early days still stings for many investors. But what if we told you there’s a new project creating just as much buzz? Enter Qubetics , a blockchain marvel poised to transform the crypto space. With features like a decentralised VPN (dVPN), it tackles real-world issues such as privacy risks, data control, and online security. Analysts predict Qubetics could hit $10–$15 after its mainnet launch, making it the best crypto to invest in now. This might just be the second chance you’ve been waiting for. Bitcoin Was Just the Beginning, but Qubetics Is the Future When Bitcoin first launched, it promised a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial system. And while it changed the world, it’s not without its flaws. Bitcoin lacks many modern functionalities, leaving gaps in privacy, scalability, and accessibility. This has left the door wide open for innovative projects like Qubetics to step in. Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s a game-changer. With its decentralised VPN, it addresses issues Bitcoin never could, like securing user privacy in a highly surveilled online world. If you missed the Bitcoin revolution, don’t let Qubetics slip by. It’s shaping up to be the best crypto to invest in now , combining innovation with unmatched potential. How Qubetics Solves Privacy Problems In today’s digital age, privacy is increasingly rare. Traditional VPNs claim to secure your data but often fall short, storing logs that can be accessed or hacked. Centralized solutions also leave users vulnerable to government interference and corporate misuse of personal data. Qubetics revolutionizes this space with its decentralised VPN, which removes central control entirely. Users retain full ownership of their data while benefiting from enhanced security and anonymity. This makes Qubetics more than just a blockchain—it’s a solution for an era where privacy is under siege. Its presale offers an incredible opportunity to get involved in the best crypto to invest in now. Tackling Security Risks with a dVPN Cybersecurity threats have skyrocketed, with hackers targeting everything from financial institutions to individual users. Centralized VPNs, while helpful, are often the weakest link, becoming single points of failure in an increasingly hostile digital landscape. Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these vulnerabilities. By decentralizing the network, Qubetics ensures there’s no single point of attack. This provides unparalleled security, making it an essential tool for anyone concerned about their online safety. With its presale already creating waves, Qubetics is undeniably the best crypto to invest in now for those who value both security and innovation. Restrictive Data Practices Are No Match for Qubetics Many VPNs and online tools restrict how users can access and share data. These limitations stifle creativity and freedom, forcing people to operate within narrow parameters set by centralized systems. Qubetics challenges this status quo with its decentralized approach. With Qubetics, users regain control over their data and online activities. There are no middlemen imposing restrictions or profiting from your information. This makes Qubetics a leader in the fight for online freedom and positions it as the best crypto to invest in now . Presale Momentum—Why Qubetics Is Your Next Smart Move The Qubetics presale is more than just an investment opportunity; it’s a chance to be part of a revolutionary project from the ground up. Tokens are currently priced at just $0.025, and with predictions of hitting $10–$15 post-mainnet launch, the potential returns are staggering. Missing Bitcoin was painful, but you don’t have to make the same mistake twice. Qubetics offers innovation, security, and privacy, all while being accessible to early investors. It’s more than a blockchain—it’s the best crypto to invest in now , and the time to act is now. Conclusion Missing Bitcoin’s early days taught us all an invaluable lesson: opportunities in crypto don’t wait. Qubetics represents the next frontier, tackling issues like privacy, security, and data restrictions with its innovative dVPN technology. The presale is already underway, and the clock is ticking. Don’t let Qubetics become another “what if” moment. With its potential to reshape the blockchain landscape and deliver massive returns, it’s the best crypto to invest in now . Seize the moment before it’s too late. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics The post Regret Missing Bitcoin’s Rise?

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Altcoins have consistently provided unique value propositions, from blockchain interoperability to decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions. In 2024, three standout projects—Qubetics (TICS), Cosmos (ATOM), and Polkadot (DOT)—have solidified their positions as some of the best altcoins to buy this weekend. Whether you’re looking for a revolutionary project with high potential returns, or a proven crypto mainstay offering stability, there’s plenty to explore. Polkadot and Cosmos, each with their strong foothold in the market, represent resilience and continued innovation. But a rising star, Qubetics , is turning heads with its record-breaking presale and ambitious goals. If you’ve been searching for a game-changer, now’s your chance to learn more. Let’s tune into what makes these altcoins exceptional choices, starting with Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator that’s setting a high bar for innovation and investor excitement. Qubetics: Revolutionising Web3 with $TICS and the QubeQode IDE Qubetics isn’t just an altcoin; it’s a movement. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics has captured the attention of investors and developers alike with its seamless integration of blockchain technologies and real-world applications. Currently in the 10th stage of its presale, Qubetics has already raised an impressive $3.8 million, selling over 239 million tokens to more than 5000 holders. Priced at just $0.0257 per token, $TICS offers an unmatched opportunity for early investors to capitalise on a projected ROI of up to 58,213% after its mainnet launch. What truly sets Qubetics apart is the QubeQode IDE, a cutting-edge integrated development environment designed to streamline Web3 project creation. Imagine this: a business professional managing supply chain logistics could leverage QubeQode’s intuitive interface to integrate blockchain-based data storage. Instead of juggling traditional, siloed systems, they gain secure, decentralised data access at their fingertips. For artists, the IDE could offer a transformative way to mint NFTs, track ownership rights, and even monetise their digital works in real time—all with zero coding experience required. Now consider the financial implications. An artist investing $10,000 in $TICS at $0.0257 could see jaw-dropping returns of $378,700 if $TICS hits $1 post-presale. If the token reaches $5, that same investment could balloon to $1.93 million. With the presale price set to increase by 10% in the 11th stage, waiting even a day could mean missing out on what analysts call a once-in-a-generation opportunity. The buzz around Qubetics isn’t just hype; it’s backed by a bold vision, tangible innovation, and the kind of investor enthusiasm that rarely goes unnoticed. Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Cosmos, often referred to as the Internet of Blockchains, is one of the most established names in the cryptocurrency world. Since its inception, Cosmos has positioned itself as a leader in blockchain interoperability, allowing disparate networks to communicate and share data seamlessly. For investors seeking reliability, Cosmos delivers a well-rounded proposition: robust technology, active developer communities, and a proven track record of adoption. But what makes Cosmos one of the best altcoins to buy this weekend? It’s all about its adaptability. While many blockchain projects struggle to remain relevant, Cosmos thrives by solving real-world problems. Consider this: you’re a tech entrepreneur running a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform. With Cosmos, you can connect your platform to other blockchains effortlessly, enabling faster transactions, lower fees, and access to a broader user base. That’s the power of the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos has also earned a reputation for serving as an alternative investment instrument. It caters to those disillusioned with traditional finance by offering exposure to cutting-edge technology. Whether you’re a long-term holder or a swing trader, Cosmos provides the kind of stability and innovation that keeps portfolios balanced, even during turbulent market conditions. Polkadot: A Pioneer in Blockchain Innovation Polkadot, the brainchild of Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood, stands tall as a pioneer in blockchain innovation. Known for its groundbreaking parachain technology, Polkadot enables multiple blockchains to operate within a single network, making it a go-to choice for developers and enterprises. In the crypto community, Polkadot has earned a loyal following for its scalability, security, and forward-thinking approach to decentralisation. For investors, Polkadot represents an opportunity to be part of a project that consistently pushes boundaries. It’s not just about owning a token; it’s about being part of a movement that aims to redefine how blockchain technology interacts with the world. Think of Polkadot as the engine that powers next-generation decentralised applications (dApps), from supply chain management to digital identity verification. Polkadot’s appeal also lies in its ability to weather market fluctuations. While newer projects often experience volatile price swings, Polkadot remains a symbol of resilience, proving that established altcoins can still deliver impressive returns. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned trader, Polkadot offers a solid foundation for diversifying your investments. The Best Altcoins to Buy This Weekend As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, Qubetics, Cosmos, and Polkadot stand out as compelling choices for investors. Qubetics dazzles with its record-breaking presale, revolutionary QubeQode IDE, and unparalleled growth potential. Meanwhile, Cosmos and Polkadot continue to serve as stalwarts in the market, offering reliability, innovation, and long-term value. Don’t wait too long. With the $TICS price set to increase soon, now’s the time to act. Visit Qubetics’ presale page, explore Cosmos’ groundbreaking solutions, or dive into Polkadot’s unparalleled ecosystem.

37074982,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51091,1733023617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto Founder Predicts Cardano (ADA) Rally to $5 or $10. Here’s when,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-founder-predicts-cardano-ada-rally-to-5-or-10-heres-when/,"Cardano (ADA) has recently captured significant attention after regaining the $1 price level—a milestone many investors and analysts believed might not be reached again. This development has reinvigorated confidence in the cryptocurrency and sparked discussions about its future trajectory. Dan Gambardello, a renowned analyst suggests that Cardano’s current consolidation phase is setting the stage for even greater price milestones, with targets ranging from $5 to $10. $1 Milestone: A Symbol of Resilience for Cardano Cardano’s recapture of the $1 price level is a significant event in the cryptocurrency market. After years of struggling to overcome this psychological barrier, the token’s achievement highlights its strength and resilience. For long-term investors, this marks a moment of validation after enduring multiple market corrections and bearish trends. Ranked as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Cardano (ADA) has demonstrated solid growth. Over the past week, its value increased by 27.53%. As of report time, the token is trading at $1.05, indicating strong support around this crucial price level. Gateway to $5–$10 The market’s response to ADA’s rally has been mixed. While many in the crypto community celebrated the achievement, others have used this milestone as an exit point, taking profits after enduring prolonged underperformance. Analyst Dan Gambardello has a different perspective. He sees the ongoing consolidation around the $1 mark as a positive sign. According to him, this phase allows for redistribution among investors, setting the stage for a more significant upward movement. Once the consolidation phase is complete, Gambardello predicts that ADA could break through to new highs, with $5 and $10 becoming realistic targets soon. Other analysts have shared even more ambitious projections for Cardano. They believe the ADA could hit $10–$12 within the next 6 to 12 months, aligning with bullish forecasts for the broader cryptocurrency market. Predictions for Bitcoin (BTC) to reach $250,000 and Ethereum (ETH) to climb to $7,000 lend credibility to these expectations. As one of the leading altcoins, Cardano is likely to benefit from the overall bullish sentiment toward large-cap cryptocurrencies. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence Adding to the bullish outlook, Cardano whales have been increasing their holdings. Recent reports indicate that after ADA surpassed the $1 mark, whales purchased over 130 million tokens, bringing their total holdings to 3.2 billion ADA as of November 27. This accumulation trend suggests that large investors position themselves for a potential bull run. Despite profit-taking, the market has shown remarkable resilience, with ADA maintaining a steady upward trajectory over the last three weeks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Factors Driving Cardano’s Momentum Several factors, including technological advancements, contribute to ADA’s renewed momentum. Cardano’s focus on scalability, interoperability, and energy efficiency continues to differentiate it from competitors. The ongoing development of its ecosystem reinforces investor confidence. In addition, broader market sentiment contributes to ADA’s momentum, a bullish outlook for major cryptocurrencies often spills over to altcoins like ADA. As Bitcoin and Ethereum rally, Cardano is expected to follow suit. Also, growing institutional interest in Cardano’s blockchain technology and real-world applications has fueled demand for ADA tokens. The Road Ahead for Cardano Cardano’s ability to maintain its position above the $1 mark will likely determine its future success. Analysts like Gambardello believe this consolidation phase is a necessary step before ADA can target higher price levels. With the support of long-term holders, increasing whale activity, and optimistic market sentiment, Cardano appears well-positioned to achieve its ambitious targets. While risks remain, the outlook for ADA is undeniably promising as it sets its sights on $5, $10, or even higher price levels. Cardano’s resurgence to the $1 mark represents a critical juncture in its journey. The consolidation phase is not a sign of stagnation but a precursor to potential exponential growth. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, ADA is emerging as a contender to watch, backed by technological advancements, investor confidence, and the vision of a decentralized future.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB.

These comparisons have sparked speculation that the current market could precede a significant bull cycle akin to 2021. Market Overview The recent rally across cryptocurrency markets, initiated following the U.S. election, has resulted in substantial price increases for several major assets. Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $99,655 on November 22, while Solana (SOL) peaked at $263 shortly afterward. Despite these developments, some altcoins, including Shiba Inu (SHIB), have not yet achieved new ATHs during this bullish momentum. Shiba Inu’s price increased notably to $0.00003031 on November 12, climbing from a monthly low of $0.00001626. However, this price remains 69.8% below its ATH of $0.00008616, recorded on October 28, 2021. The disparity has raised concerns among investors about whether Shiba Inu has been sidelined in the ongoing market rally. Historical Context and Lucie’s Insights Lucie, a prominent figure within the Shiba Inu team, addressed these concerns by drawing parallels to the token’s historical performance. She noted that the current trend resembles the market behavior of 2020, just before the explosive gains witnessed in 2021. Shiba Inu launched in August 2020 with a price carrying ten zeros after the decimal point. By November 28, 2020, the token had dropped to its all-time low (ATL) of $0.000000000056. At that time, the asset showed little price movement, leaving many investors doubtful about its future. However, the scenario shifted dramatically in 2021 when increased demand, notable exchange listings, and the token’s largest burn event drove significant interest in SHIB. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 One pivotal moment occurred in May 2021, when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sent over 410 trillion SHIB tokens to a dead wallet, effectively removing them from circulation. This event, alongside widespread market adoption, propelled Shiba Inu to its ATH later that year. Lucie believes the current cycle mirrors the period leading up to SHIB’s breakout in 2021. She has identified 2025 as a potential turning point, calling it the “year of the super cycle,” which could lead to an even larger bull run. She has encouraged investors to remain patient and consider assets with a high tendency for growth. Predictions for Shiba Inu’s Future Price Despite trading below its ATH, many analysts foresee significant price growth for Shiba Inu during the 2024/2025 bull cycle. SHIB is valued at $0.00002598 at the time of writing, reflecting a 3.54% increase in the past 24 hours. Projections for Shiba Inu’s future price vary. Bitcoin investor Dona has predicted that SHIB could reach $0.000114, while cryptocurrency analyst Javon Marks suggests an even higher target of $0.0001553 . Both forecasts indicate confidence in the token’s potential to exceed the $0.0001 threshold during the ongoing market cycle. Whether Shiba Inu will achieve these ambitious price targets before the bull cycle concludes remains uncertain. However, historical trends and current market activity suggest that the token may yet experience a substantial upward trajectory.

As the token powers up, its next target could be the $16.9 mark, a critical level that could set the stage for even greater gains. With momentum building, the question is whether UNI can break through this resistance and push toward new heights . The aim of this article is to analyze Uniswap’s recent surge, focusing on its potential to break through the key $16.9 resistance level. This analysis will determine if UNI is poised for further gains or challenges in breaking through this critical price point by examining the factors driving UNI’s rally, including technical indicators and market sentiment. Examining UNI’s Recent Momentum Surge On the 4-hour chart, UNI is showing strong bullish strength, attempting to break out of its consolidation zone. Trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), the token is targeting the key $16.9 resistance level, signaling the potential for additional upward movement if it maintains its position above the SMA. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the RSI has climbed back above the 61% threshold after experiencing a decline to 56% signaling a resurgence in buying pressure, reflecting renewed bullish movement in the market. A persistent climb would indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting robust demand and the possibility of more price growth. Also, the daily chart showcases UNI’s robust upward momentum , highlighted by the formation of a positive candlestick pattern as the price rebounds, indicating the potential for further gains. Its position above the SMA solidifies the positive trend, signaling consistent strength. As UNI continues its ascent, it inspires growing market confidence and paves the way for an extended increase. Lastly, the daily chart’s RSI recently hit 70%, suggesting that Uniswap has entered overbought territory, reflecting strong bullish sentiment . While this suggests an extended upside, it also raises the risk of a pullback if buying pressure becomes excessive. Will Uniswap Reach New Heights? Tracking The Path Toward $16.9 Uniswap is exhibiting strong upbeat strength, with $16.9 acting as a key resistance level to watch out for. If the token maintains its upward trajectory, it could soon test this level. A successful breakout above $16.9 could open the door to new highs, setting the stage for gains and a possible rally to even higher price targets. However, if UNI fails to maintain its momentum, a pullback or consolidation may follow, potentially driving the price toward the $11.8 support level. A decisive break below this level might lead to more declines, with the next support zone at $10.3 and below.",UNI|Consolidation Zone|Relative Strength Index|RSI|Simple Moving Average|SMA|Uniswap|uniusd|UNIUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-01 04:30:26

As a result, some countries have leaned towards over-regulation, stifling development (the EU), while others, like the US, have adopted a more hands-off approach to the industry. As of December 2024, various countries have legally besieged AI startups like OpenAI on claims of breaches in data privacy policies and regulations. Most recently, Canadian media houses, including the Toronto Star, Metroland Media, Postmedia, The Globe and Mail, The Canadian Press, and CBC, joined a lawsuit , reportedly the first of its kind in the country. They all sued OpenAI for allegedly ignoring safeguards like paywalls or copyright disclaimers meant to prevent the unauthorized copying of content. “Journalism is in the public interest. OpenAI using other companies’ journalism for their own commercial gain is not. It’s illegal,” the media organizations claimed in a joint statement. The group, which includes the publishers of Canada’s top newspapers, demands damages of C$20,000 per article ($14,300, £11,000) that OpenAI allegedly used to illegally train ChatGPT. The total could amount to billions of dollars in compensation. The news organizations also want an order that would force the company to share profits made from using their articles, as well as an injunction prohibiting OpenAI from using them in the future. Meanwhile, OpenAI says its models are “trained on publicly available data” and that the software is “grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation.” “We collaborate closely with news publishers, including in the display, attribution and links to their content in ChatGPT search, and offer them easy ways to opt out should they so desire,” the company has said. The New York Times and other publishers filed a similar lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft in the US last year. OpenAI faces different regulatory standards around the world China was one of the first countries to set up a regulatory framework for generative AI technology as it issued the final version of its Generative AI Measures on 10 July 2023. Seven Chinese central government agencies jointly adopted the Generative AI Measures, which took effect on 15 August 2023. Compared to the first draft of the Generative AI Measures released for public consultation in April 2023, the new Generative AI Measures encouraged the development of and investment in generative AI technology and services. However, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and similar services are banned due to censorship laws and fears of misinformation. This pushed Chinese developers, many of whom used OpenAI’s API in their products, to scramble for domestic AI alternatives. The government has also supported these alternatives as they align with its regulations. On the other hand, Russia has taken a more reserved stance regarding artificial intelligence. The country now has restrictions in place to counter what it perceives as risks of US influence through AI. It also cites cybersecurity concerns. In the months leading up to the US election, there were several reports claiming Russia was using AI to influence perspective although many brushed it off as propaganda. In North Korea, the government treats AI with suspicion and great caution, as it does many external innovations. The government has banned ChatGPT and similar technologies in a bid to maintain strict control over information and prevent potential misuse. The EU is behind in the AI race Many experts have accused Europe of stifling AI innovation through its EU AI Act. The EU AI Act is the regulation created to harmonize the legal framework for AI systems across the EU. According to the Act, AI applications fall into three risk levels: unacceptable risk (banned), high-risk (subject to strict requirements), and low-risk (largely unregulated). The Act prohibits AI practices that are manipulative or deceptive, but there are exceptions for certain law enforcement uses. Flouting the Act can result in fines of up to EUR 35 million or 7% of global turnover. Europe’s cautious approach to AI was on full display as Italy’s data privacy regulator clashed with OpenAI over access to one of its media houses’ content. The core purpose of the partnership was to use Italian language content from GEDI’s news portfolio to train and improve OpenAI’s products, a step to train ChatGPT models on Italian content. In response, GEDI stated, “The project has not been launched yet therefore no editorial content has been made available to OpenAI at the moment and will not be until the reviews under way are completed.” The clash comes almost a year after another Italian authority, known as Garante, one of the European Union’s most proactive in assessing AI platform compliance with the bloc’s data privacy regime, banned ChatGPT. It alleged breaches of the European Union (EU) privacy rules, but the service was reactivated after OpenAI addressed issues such as users’ right to decline to consent to the use of personal data to train algorithms. In an e-mail statement, OpenAI said it believes its practices are aligned with the EU’s privacy laws. “We actively work to reduce personal data in training our systems like ChatGPT,” it said, adding it “plans to continue to work constructively with the Garante.” Europe is behind in the AI race while places like America continue to leap forward. Currently, American companies, including OpenAI’s parent company, Microsoft, dominate the ranks of the largest AI firms by market valuation. The nation’s measured response has no doubt paid off for its AI businesses, at least in the short term. Very recently, Kanye West, a Grammy-winning American rapper, became the latest to embrace the technology as he debuted a music video created using generative AI for his single titled, BOMB. While many places cite concerns about the ethics of AI usage as the rationale for their tight restrictions, they also appear to be because of political tensions and efforts to protect national interests. If nothing changes, the world may be far ahead by the time Europe finally catches the AI bug.

Taking to X, he claimed , “99.999% of people have no idea what $XRP is about to do.” While Farina is well-known for his optimism regarding XRP, his tweet sparked a spirited discussion among community members with varying opinions. XRP Community Reacts A notable response came from X user Pablo Fernandez, who criticized the lack of reasoning behind such claims. Fernandez argued , “This hype is not helpful, saying that something is going to happen and not explaining your logic is like Disneyland for kids, just empty illusion. We all want something big to happen.” He further contended that statements without supporting evidence could lead to emotionally driven investment decisions, stating, “Pushing hype like this makes people FOMO without any base of logic. All emotional, after a month of this, I’m getting tired of it.” Fernandez also highlighted the practical challenges of XRP reaching significant price levels, asserting that for XRP to exceed $10, widespread adoption by banks and the injection of billions to trillions of dollars into the asset would be necessary. His comment encapsulates a growing frustration among some investors who are wary of speculative hype without substantial evidence. Another user, InvestorSauce, took a more neutral stance, acknowledging the unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. “100% don’t know. It’s a market with unlimited possibilities where no one can predict certainly,” they remarked. This perspective emphasizes the inherent volatility and uncertainty of digital assets, even those with strong utility narratives like XRP. Balancing Optimism with Realism Farina’s statement underscores the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding XRP, especially given its use case in cross-border payments and its potential for institutional adoption. However, critics like Fernandez raise valid concerns about the implications of unsubstantiated claims in a market where emotional decision-making can lead to financial risks. The cryptocurrency market has seen substantial price movements driven by speculation and hype. While XRP’s potential utility in the financial sector is widely recognized, achieving large-scale adoption by banks globally and integrating trillions of dollars in liquidity remains a complex and gradual process. Such developments depend on regulatory clarity, technological integration, and institutional support. Ultimately, whether XRP will deliver on its potential remains to be seen. As with any investment, individuals must base their decisions on sound research and realistic expectations, rather than succumbing to speculation.

This week’s reports of hacks show that many platforms have security weaknesses. These problems also raise concerns about rules and safety in the industry. Dexx Hack Affects More Than 8,620 Solana Wallets The DEXX trading platform, aimed at trading in meme coins, was hacked on November 16th. The attack emerged due to a private key leak to steal more than 8,620 Solana wallets and siphon $30m. In the same case, at least 900 users were affected out of which one person lost more than one million dollars. However, the platform has engaged in mitigation measures like; tracking the hacker’s wallets and negotiating for the funds’ return, yet the outcome is often unpredictable. Pump Science Wallet Hack: Developer Negligence Sparks Token Fraud Pump Science, a Solana-based decentralised science (DeSci) platform, shared news about the breach, which resulted from the recklessness of one of its developers. The attacker used a leaked private key to mint fake URO and RIF tokens into the system voluntarily. The fake tokens circulated into the market erasing the reputation and trust of the project. Pump Science has since explained that any tokens produced by the said wallet since its compromise are fake. The team has also warned users to stay away from fake accounts while trying to contain the losses made so far. MrBeast Gets Accused of Crypto Manipulation and Insider Trading A popular YouTuber MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson) misused his 31.2M subscribers by using forums to promote pump-and-dump schemes. Researchers claim that he manipulated token prices using his status to gain control over them to pump the prices and dump them for a $23 million profit. Key projects tied to these allegations include: $SUPER: $11.45M, $ERN: $4.65M, $PMON: $1.72M, $STAK: $1.31M and $AIOZ: $1M This has again caused many people to ponder on the kind of ethical practices there are in crypto marketing. Crypto Losses in November: A $71M Blow to Defi Analyzed by ImmuneFi , 26 hacking and fraud cases in November led to $71 million in losses. This has reduced by 79% from that recorded in November 2023 when $343 million was drained from the accounts. However, challenges persist, particularly for DeFi platforms, which accounted for: 100% of incidents and losses, $70.99M from 24 hacks and $25,300 from 2 rug pulls Major incidents included: Thala Labs: $25.5M and DEXX: $21M The BNB Chain was the most attacked blockchain with 14 attacks and a total loss worth 46.7%; Ethereum received a 30% loss. Conclusion: Creating a Safer Crypto Space This week’s events show that there’s a need to attend to security loopholes and other malpractices taking place in the crypto industry. Although the total amount of losses has gone down compared to last year, cases such as DEXX and Pump Science clearly indicate the importance of hard technical security measures. In the same way, MrBeast’s case suggests that the FCA should pay more attention to the financial promotions of influencers. Looking ahead to the last quarter of 2024, the key to change and growth of the crypto community is trust, transparency and security to make the ecosystem stronger in 2025.",News|Hack,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|AIOZ,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-01 05:13:21

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 05:22:46

The announcement by Cointelegraph on X highlights a critical milestone for Ripple on RLUSD as the stablecoin approaches regulatory clearance to operate within New York’s highly regulated digital finance ecosystem. JUST IN: Ripple’s stablecoin nears NY approval, clearing the path for RLUSD to operate within New York’s regulated digital finance market. pic.twitter.com/1Liepk3Iac — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) November 29, 2024 What Is RLUSD? RLUSD is Ripple’s proposed stablecoin designed to provide a digital asset pegged to the US dollar, ensuring price stability. Stablecoins like RLUSD are often seen as tools for reducing volatility in cryptocurrency transactions and facilitating seamless financial operations. This stablecoin aligns with Ripple’s broader vision of promoting faster, more cost-efficient payments globally, particularly for businesses and institutions seeking a reliable, stable medium of exchange. Community Insights: RLUSD’s Impact on XRP The introduction of RLUSD has raised certain questions and discussions among cryptocurrency enthusiasts regarding its implications for XRP. One X user expressed concern, asking, “I don’t understand how the stable coin will impact XRP cause wouldn’t the money go into the stable coin?” Hassan, another user, provided a detailed response, stating that XRP’s utility remains intact. RLUSD, being a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is primarily designed for domestic use and dollar-based transactions. In contrast, XRP remains the core tool for bridging various currencies and ensuring liquidity across diverse financial corridors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further into his tweet response, Hassan noted that RLUSD’s introduction could attract a broader range of businesses and institutions to Ripple’s ecosystem. While some may primarily use RLUSD, others might leverage XRP for international payment solutions, increasing the overall utility of Ripple’s technology stack. Strategic Advantages for Ripple Securing approval in New York is a significant achievement for Ripple considering the state’s stringent regulatory standards. This license would position RLUSD as a trustworthy and compliant stablecoin, potentially bolstering Ripple’s reputation among financial institutions wary of regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, RLUSD could open doors for Ripple to expand its product offerings, catering to clients seeking solutions that combine the stability of a pegged asset with the efficiency of blockchain technology. This dual approach—providing stablecoin solutions and XRP-powered cross-border payments —may enhance Ripple’s competitiveness in the global digital finance space.

BTFD Coin Could Be Your Next Shot at Greatness!,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-neiros-boom-btfd-coin-could-be-your-next-shot-at-greatness/,"If you were one of the unlucky few who missed out on Neiro’s explosive ICO and the incredible profits that followed, you might be feeling a bit like you’ve missed your chance at meme coin glory. But don’t fret—there’s another opportunity on the horizon that could be your ticket to the next big thing in crypto. Enter BTFD Coin, the meme coin that’s been making waves with its presale success and strong community backing. Neiro may have had its moment, but the hype around BTFD Coin is just getting started, and the numbers speak for themselves. With over $295,000 raised in its presale and 10 billion coins already sold, BTFD Coin is setting up to be the next meme coin legend. If you missed Neiro’s launch, this might be your second shot at riding the meme coin wave to serious gains. Let’s take a closer look at why BTFD Coin could be the best opportunity to jump into right now. Neiro: The Meme Coin That Left Investors Speechless Often seen as the little sister to Dogecoin, Neiro carries the same meme magic but with a story all its own. Adopted by the same person who once owned Kabosu—the iconic dog behind Doge—Neiro takes the mantle of meme coin royalty and runs with it. Neiro made a serious splash during its ICO, deploying first on the Ethereum network and drawing the eyes of none other than Vitalik Buterin himself. In a surprise twist, Vitalik publicly backed Neiro on August 4th, 2024, during a rare moment of the New Moon. Shortly after, the Ethereum founder made waves again by donating over $500k to an animal welfare fund, marking a key turning point in Neiro’s journey. This was only the second time Vitalik interacted with a meme coin, the first being with the SHIB token in 2021. Talk about a major endorsement! But Neiro’s story isn’t just about big names and crypto stardom. It’s about redemption. After being abandoned by its original dev and sent to a shelter, Neiro has risen from the ashes—just like any true meme coin. Today, the project is 100% community-owned, with an enthusiastic group of supporters driving its growth. With a charitable mission at its core, the coin has already made donations to the shelter that took in Neiro, and more initiatives are in the works. This commitment to giving back is what makes Neiro stand out in the crowded world of meme coins. BTFD Coin: Your Second Shot at Meme Coin Glory For everyone kicking themselves over Neiro, BTFD Coin is ready to deliver redemption. This meme coin is making waves with its revolutionary approach to community-driven growth, gamification, and high APY staking rewards. Oh, and let’s not forget its wildly successful presale performance. In less than 24 hours, BTFD Coin raised over $150,000 during its presale, and it hasn’t slowed down since. To date, it’s surpassed $295,000 in funding, with over 10 billion coins already sold. The current price sits at $0.00005—meaning early investors still have time to secure their slice of the pie before the price increases again. Why is everyone so hyped about BTFD Coin? Let’s break it down: High Staking APY: Offering an average annual percentage yield of 90%, BTFD Coin makes your investment work overtime, ensuring rewards stack up fast. Play-to-Earn Game: With a four-level gamified ecosystem, users can convert in-game rewards into real tokens, adding serious value for crypto gamers. Bulls Squad Characters: This isn’t just another meme coin. BTFD Coin has built an engaging narrative around its quirky mascot team—Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull—capturing the hearts of investors and creating a sense of belonging. Investment Potential: Turning $1,000 Into a Dream Let’s say you decide to jump into BTFD Coin right now. With an investment of $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.00005, you’d snag a whopping 20 million BTFD Coins. Now, here’s where it gets exciting: If BTFD Coin achieves a price of $0.0006—an entirely realistic target based on its trajectory—you could see your $1,000 investment skyrocket to $12,000. That’s a 12x return, folks. And remember, this doesn’t even factor in additional gains from staking rewards or P2E game earnings. Why Choose BTFD Coin Over Neiro Now? While Neiro made its mark and created millionaires, its initial boom has passed, and the hype has started to plateau. BTFD Coin , on the other hand, is still in its growth phase, making it a prime opportunity for savvy investors looking for the next breakout star. Don’t let history repeat itself—secure your BTFD Coins during the presale and position yourself for what could be one of the most profitable moves in your crypto journey. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin The crypto world rarely gives second chances, but BTFD Coin is the exception. With its explosive presale, game-changing features, and a community that’s growing by the day, it’s shaping up to be the redemption story you’ve been waiting for. Jump into the presale today and grab your share of this rising star before prices climb even higher. It’s your time to turn missed opportunities into massive wins.

Lunex Network’s non-custodial exchange and cross-chain interoperability have established new standards in crypto trading. With access to over 50,000 cryptocurrencies and staking rewards, Lunex Network is changing how traders utilize DeFi. With rising demand and whale investments, this platform is emerging as a vital player bringing fundamental changes to the DeFi sector. BNB’s (BNB) Price Expected To Fall BNB is the native token of the Binance ecosystem and remains amongst the biggest altcoins in terms of market value. However, contrary to other highly ranked altcoins, BNB didn’t experience an impressive price boost after Donald Trump’s election victory. Although BNB has stayed over $600, BNB hasn’t beaten $700 or even close to its all-time high price. For most of the entire year, BNB has traded between $450 and $600. This stagnation has disappointed many BNB holders but what do analysts predict about its future? The consensus is that BNB is facing low volatility and declining interest. If buying pressure increases, BNB might experience a rise. However, based on its recent trends, it is more likely to fall. XRP (XRP) See Over 100% Price Increase In A Month Ripple lost out to Dogecoin in Elon Musk’s X stakes, but the Ripple ecosystem has several bullish factors stacked in its favor. The prospects for Ripple ETF becoming approved in the U.S. have improved lately with the announcement that SEC chair Gary Gensler is leaving in January. Some XRP analysts think the lawsuit against Ripple Labs will be resolved in a short while and the legal fights will end. Additionally, XRP has gained over 176% in a month. While XRP’s all-time high of $2.44 may not hold much longer, this surge could continue as clarity about the SEC leadership unfolds. XRP’s exchange-traded product, now renamed the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP, has also sparked renewed investor interest. Ripple has invested heavily in this renamed ETP, contributing to the growing interest in XRP. Multi-Chain Support: Lunex Network’s Competitive Edge in DeFi Lunex Network (LNEX) is changing decentralized trading by combining off-chain efficiency with on-chain security through a hybrid architecture. This approach creates an ideal trading environment for over 50,000 multi-chain currency pairs across more than 40 blockchains. Lunex Network addresses key issues like high slippage and rejected transactions, making trading smoother for users. In addition to redefining crypto trading, Lunex Network rewards its users. Lunex Network offers staking rewards of up to 18% APYs through a unique revenue-sharing model. Traders who add $LNEX tokens to their staking pools can begin receiving rewards in as little as 30 days. Since presale investors get their tokens immediately, many are already taking advantage of this opportunity to earn returns before $LNEX officially launches on the open market. During its presale session, Lunex Network, valued at $0.0033, has already attracted over $3.7million in investments. Lunex Network’s unique features and market potential have made it a hot topic in the decentralized exchange space. The growing fear of missing out (FOMO) is drawing more investors, with experts predicting a potential 1,800% return after its exchange listing debut. As 2025 approaches, many crypto investors are looking for tokens that could bring significant returns. Lunex Network stands out as one with high ROI potential, surpassing other favorites like XRP and BNB, which focus on business adoption and sharding techniques. Now is the perfect time to join the Lunex Network’s presale and enjoy the unique benefits of this rapidly growing crypto.

Ripple’s XRP sustained a price rally, nearing $2 against the backdrop of legal maneuvers in favor of the American blockchain payments company. Simultaneously, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw bullish dynamics fueling market optimism surrounding the meme coin. On the other hand, Bitcoin (BTC) continued to consolidate near its ATH this week, sparking market discussions. Here’s a brief report on some of the most buzz-worthy cryptocurrency market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Ripple’s Crypto Sustains Rally Amid Legal Developments Notably, the Ripple-backed crypto saw a highly bullish week, extending weekly gains to 30% and resting near $1.90. This rising trajectory has sparked noteworthy optimism, which is in line with recent legal developments regarding the blockchain payments company. Primarily, the lawsuit against the U.S. SEC could end under the “new SEC,” CoinGape Media reported. This optimistic anticipation comes against the backdrop of SEC Chair Gary Gensler announcing his exit and pro-crypto Donald Trump securing a win in the U.S. elections. Moreover, pro-XRP attorneys Bill Morgan, Fred Rispoli, and Jeremy Hogan also revealed that the appeals are likely to get dismissed, hinting that the lawsuit against the U.S. SEC could drop soon. Overall, as the much-awaited conclusion for the lawsuit comes, market sentiments surrounding the Ripple-backed asset have turned highly bullish. Intriguingly, amid these optimistic events, the coin also overtook BNB in terms of market cap , marking a monumental stride. Simultaneously, the asset’s futures OI topped $2.5 billion this week, echoing investor optimism. Further, with Ripple eyeing RLUSD stablecoin launch ahead with indications that New York’s top financial regulator, the Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), is poised to approve the product, market sentiments remain bullish on future movements. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Steals Spotlight Simultaneously, Shiba Inu has gained significant traction this week, witnessing remarkable burns and ecosystem developments. CoinGape Media reported the SHIB burn rate to have soared remarkably over the past seven days, sparking optimism surrounding the coin’s future price movements. Simultaneously, even the coin’s layer 2 network, Shibarium, saw a maintenance upgrade, enhancing functionality. While these events significantly bolstered prices, it’s also noteworthy that Shiba Inu whale holdings were reported to be on the rise. This stat has underscored heightened market interest in the asset amid a bullish Q4. In turn, crypto market enthusiasts are extensively eyeing the token for further gains in light of the abovementioned optimistic stats. BTC Consolidates Near ATH Meanwhile, the flagship crypto has faced some market turbulence near its ATH, resting above the $95K level as the week closes. Notably, Robert Kiyosaki warns amid this turbulent movement that Bitcoin could surpass $100K soon, making it harder for the middle class to invest, urging FOMO for early investors. This statement sparked noteworthy optimism for the cryptocurrency, while other bullish events also unfolded across the broader market. Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim proposed Bitcoin as a reserve asset this week, underscoring the asset’s market potential. Additionally, a stockpile of bullish on-chain metrics weighing in has added to intrigue on the asset’s future movements. A recent Bitcoin price analysis by CoinGape media indicated that the coin eyes further gains, mirroring historical trends and increased market interest. Overall, the abovementioned cryptocurrency market headlines have significantly impacted investor sentiments globally.

With its playful mascot and a community of fervent supporters, Dogecoin has evolved from a meme into a formidable altcoin, sparking discussions about its potential for massive gains. As analysts scrutinize the charts and market behaviors, one altcoin rival, RCO Finance (RCOF), is emerging as a contender that could deliver astonishing returns, projected at an eye-popping 9,505%. Dogecoin Price Déjà Vu: Echoes of 2021’s Meteoric Rise Dogecoin’s journey from a meme-inspired altcoin to a significant player in the market is nothing short of extraordinary. In 2021, the Dogecoin price experienced an unprecedented surge, skyrocketing over 800% daily, largely fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Fast forward to November 2024, and the Dogecoin price is at approximately $0.418, reflecting a 5.67% increase from the previous close. Analysts note that its current price patterns resemble those preceding the 2021 surge. Technical analysis indicates a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart, a bullish indicator that historically signaled significant upward movements for the Dogecoin price. This pattern, combined with increased market interest and favorable regulatory developments, suggests that the Dogecoin price might be poised for another substantial rally. However, the altcoin market’s inherent volatility necessitates cautious optimism. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Dogecoin Rival on the Rise Amidst the renewed interest in the Dogecoin price movements, RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a formidable rival in the altcoin space. RCOF is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that leverages crypto AI to optimize investment strategies, offering users access to various financial instruments. RCO Finance democratizes advanced trading tools, leveraging AI and machine learning to make sophisticated strategies accessible to all. It offers security and profitability, positioning itself as a reliable choice for investors in a volatile market. One of RCO Finance’s standout features is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, which personalizes investment strategies based on individual user profiles. This tool analyzes market data and user preferences to create tailored recommendations, allowing even those with minimal financial knowledge to navigate complex trading environments effectively. The Robo Advisor continually adapts to real-time market changes, confirming that users’ portfolios remain optimized without constant monitoring. This level of automation improves user experience and significantly reduces the risks associated with manual trading. RCO Finance goes beyond mere altcoin trading; it offers access to an astonishing array of over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes. This diverse selection includes traditional investments such as stocks and bonds, digital assets, and tokenized RWAs like real estate. Such breadth allows users to construct highly diversified portfolios that balance risk and return across various sectors, making RCOF an attractive option for conservative and aggressive investors. RCO Finance stands out with its KYC-free ecosystem, empowering users to engage in DeFi without identity verification. This approach improves privacy, simplifies processes, and provides quick access to trading opportunities, setting it apart from traditional financial systems.

Following its surge to $98,000, a crypto analyst has asserted that the BTC price has officially entered the parabolic phase of this four-year market cycle . Bitcoin Price Enters Parabolic Phase Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital has declared to his 517,800 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has officially and completely transitioned into its “ Parabolic Upside phase ” this bull cycle. The analyst shared a chart illustrating the coin’s price action during the 2021 bull run and the current bull cycle. After its halving event in 2022, the Bitcoin price experienced a massive rally that pushed it to its 2021 all-time high of over $64,000. At the time, Bitcoin had experienced a significant correction before fully entering its bullish upside phase. Interestingly, a similar trend can also be seen in this bull cycle, signaling a possibility of more price rallies. In the last few months, the BTC price entered a re-accumulation phase characterised by slight declines and consolidation before recording a subsequent rally above $99,000 . Rekt Capital disclosed that after BTC hit $98,000, the pioneer cryptocurrency had successfully entered its parabolic upside phase. This phase suggests that Bitcoin could rise even higher, matching analysts’ expectations in this bull market. On November 27, Rekt Capital also shared a post illustrating the crypto asset’s steady progression into the parabolic phase. He pointed out that the cryptocurrency was on the verge of exiting a reaccumulation phase and transitioning into the parabolic upside, as indicated by the green zone on the price chart. Bitcoin Price: $100,000 ATH – Now Or Never The crypto community is on an intense bullish ride, as analysts and investors widely anticipate the Bitcoin price surge to $100,000. The leading cryptocurrency has been trading just shy of the $100,000 mark , experiencing a price increase above $98,000 at some point in the past week. A crypto analyst identified as Trader of Crypto on X is tapping into this strong bullish trend, announcing that “the clock is ticking” for Bitcoin to reach $100,000. His statement underscores how close Bitcoin is to reaching the milestone during this cycle. Trader of Crypto has also stated that it is only a matter of time before Bitcoin breaks past the anticipated $100,000 all time high. While the analyst has maintained a bullish outlook on Bitcoin , he has also presented a price chart that suggests that the cryptocurrency could experience a crash towards $46,757 if bears take over. The Bitcoin price is currently trading at $96,965, marking a 1% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

Davis foresees Cardano (ADA), currently ranked as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reaching $10 this bull cycle. This target is approximately an 817% increase from its current value. BREAKING: Lark Davis says "" #Cardano 's getting the attention and the hype, we could see $10.00 $ADA ."" pic.twitter.com/oOpCx0DuI6 — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) November 29, 2024 Cardano’s Recent Surge and Ecosystem Growth Cardano has recently emerged as one of the strongest-performing cryptocurrencies in the market, recording a monthly gain of over 210%. The asset’s market cap is closing in on that of USD Coin (USDC), currently the eighth-largest cryptocurrency. This performance underscores the growing interest in Cardano, which Davis attributes to substantial hype around the ecosystem. Davis emphasized that this attention creates a favorable macroeconomic environment for the asset, stating that Cardano could experience significant momentum in the ongoing bull market. Lark Davis’ Price Targets for Cardano Davis’ bullish outlook on Cardano suggests the asset will first aim for its previous all-time high of $3.16, achieved during the last cycle. From there, he anticipates further increases, projecting a rise to the 1.618 Fibonacci level of $4.80, representing a 332% gain from its all-time high. Beyond this, Davis predicts ADA will target the 2.618 Fibonacci level at $7.70 before reaching his ultimate goal of $10 at the 3.618 Fibonacci level. He said it is achievable given the current market dynamics and Cardano’s growing adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Dominance and Price Correlation To substantiate his prediction, Davis referenced Cardano’s market dominance during the previous cycle, which peaked at around 4%. If Cardano achieves a similar level of dominance in the current market, its market cap would need to increase tenfold to approximately $370 billion. According to Davis, this rise in market valuation aligns with his Fibonacci-based price projection of $10. Other analysts share similarly optimistic views about Cardano’s future. For example, Dan Gambardello has predicted ADA could rise to between $5 and $10 after stabilizing above the $1 mark. On-Chain Indicators Support Continued Growth On-chain data and trading activity indicate Cardano may be gearing up for further gains. Recent statistics from CoinMarketCap reveal that Cardano’s 24-hour trading volume has surpassed that of Binance Coin (BNB), suggesting a growing interest from market participants. Additionally, analyst Jake Wujastyk has identified strong technical signals for Cardano’s next move. He highlighted the “volume shelf” indicator in his analysis, which suggests that ADA could see another significant upward trajectory. Current Market Performance As of now, Cardano is trading at $1.09, representing a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours. This price movement reflects sustained momentum and investor confidence, aligning with analysts’ expectations of further gains in the ongoing bull cycle. With substantial market activity, technical indicators, and optimistic predictions from industry experts, Cardano appears to be positioned for further growth. If Davis’ $10 target materializes, it would mark a historic achievement for the asset, cementing its status as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in the market.

Each offers unique value propositions, making them prime contenders for anyone looking to diversify their digital portfolio. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just testing the waters, understanding the nuances of these projects could unlock massive potential gains. Among them, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged as a dark horse, sparking excitement in the crypto space with its revolutionary Web3 aggregator platform and impressive presale performance. While Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) are already well-established names known for their reliability and innovation, Qubetics is quickly positioning itself as a disruptor with unparalleled utility and growth prospects. If you’re wondering where to put your money this week, it’s worth diving deep into what makes each of these projects unique. This exploration might just give you the edge you need to make a strategic and profitable decision. Qubetics: A Revolutionary Force in the Web3 Space Qubetics ($TICS) is the talk of the town, and for good reason. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it’s not just offering a token; it’s redefining how businesses and developers interact with blockchain technology. At the heart of its innovation lies the QubeQode IDE , a groundbreaking tool that simplifies blockchain development for professionals without technical expertise. Imagine you’re a freelancer, wanting to leverage blockchain without spending months—or a fortune—learning complex coding languages. QubeQode steps in with drag-and-drop functionalities that make creating smart contracts and decentralised applications as simple as building a presentation. The presale numbers further underscore Qubetics’ momentum. Currently in its 10th stage, Qubetics has already sold over 239 million tokens to more than 5000 holders, raising a staggering $3.8 million. At just $0.0257 per token, this is a window of opportunity that savvy investors won’t want to miss. Analysts predict that $TICS could soar to $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering a jaw-dropping 871% ROI. But that’s not all. With projections of $1 post-presale and a staggering $15 after the mainnet launch, early investors could be looking at returns exceeding 58,000%. Consider this scenario: A freelancer investing $1,000 at the current price of $0.0257 would secure approximately 38,910 tokens. By the time $TICS hits $1, that $1,000 grows to $38,910. And if the ambitious $15 projection holds true? A life-changing $583,650. Litecoin: The Veteran Altcoin That Still Delivers Litecoin (LTC) is the wise elder in the cryptocurrency world, and its staying power is nothing short of remarkable. Often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin was designed to offer faster and cheaper transactions, and it’s delivered on that promise for over a decade. While newer projects grab headlines with flashy innovations, Litecoin quietly continues to serve as a reliable workhorse in the crypto ecosystem. First, its robust technology and extensive adoption. Litecoin is widely regarded as one of the most secure blockchains, making it a trusted choice for peer-to-peer transactions and as a payment method for merchants worldwide. Moreover, its finite supply ensures scarcity, which often translates to long-term value retention. Litecoin’s ongoing commitment to innovation also keeps it relevant. The recent MimbleWimble upgrade, enhancing privacy and scalability, has solidified its position as a go-to for investors seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. While its price movements may not match the volatility of meme coins or newer tokens, Litecoin’s strength lies in its stability and reliability—making it an excellent hedge against riskier bets. Cardano: The Smart Contract Powerhouse Cardano (ADA) has long been celebrated for its visionary approach to blockchain technology, earning a reputation as one of the most academically rigorous projects in the space. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano was built with a mission: to solve the scalability, sustainability, and interoperability issues that plague first-generation blockchains. Over the years, it has firmly established itself as one of the best altcoins to buy this week, offering a potent mix of innovation and real-world utility. The recent surge in Cardano’s price reflects growing investor confidence in its ecosystem. With its proof-of-stake mechanism leading the charge for energy-efficient blockchains, Cardano has become a favourite among eco-conscious investors. Its smart contract capabilities, enabled by the Alonzo upgrade, have opened the floodgates for decentralised applications and DeFi projects. Developers can now create everything from NFT marketplaces to decentralised finance protocols, making Cardano a playground for innovation. Community trust is another hallmark of Cardano’s success. Its transparent development process and rigorous peer-reviewed approach foster confidence among both retail and institutional investors. As decentralised finance continues to grow, Cardano is well-positioned to play a pivotal role, with its ADA token serving as a cornerstone of its thriving ecosystem. Don’t Miss Out on These Altcoin Opportunities When it comes to the best altcoins to buy this week, Qubetics, Litecoin, and Cardano each offer compelling reasons to take a closer look. For those seeking a cutting-edge opportunity with unparalleled growth potential, Qubetics’ ongoing presale presents a rare chance to get in before a likely price explosion. Meanwhile, Litecoin and Cardano remain stalwarts in the crypto space, offering stability, innovation, and long-term promise. But the clock is ticking. With $TICS poised for a 10% price increase as it moves to the next presale stage, the time to act is now. Securing your stake in Qubetics today could be the move that transforms your financial future.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 06:40:00

Armstrong, a prominent crypto commentator, made the remarks following XRP’s recent significant milestone, where it surpassed Binance Coin (BNB) to claim the fifth spot among cryptocurrencies by market cap. $XRP has flipped $BNB , and it's just a quick, easy pump away from flipping $SOL . $ETH you can run, but you can't hide! — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) November 29, 2024 XRP Outpaces BNB, Climbs to Three-Year High On Friday, XRP overtook BNB after reaching $1.70, propelling its market capitalization to $97 billion. This marked a significant achievement for XRP, which has since gained momentum. As of the latest data, XRP is trading at $1.86, reflecting a slight pullback from its recent peak of $1.94—the highest price recorded in three years. The asset currently holds a $107 billion market capitalization, solidifying its position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies. This development has widened the gap between XRP and BNB, solidifying XRP’s fifth-place position. The new valuation brings XRP within striking distance of Solana (SOL), the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Solana holds a market capitalization of $117 billion, maintaining a $10 billion lead over XRP. Analysts suggest XRP could surpass Solana if its price reaches $2.10, assuming Solana’s price does not see a proportional increase. Achieving this milestone would position XRP directly behind Ethereum , which leads the altcoin market. Ethereum Under Pressure from XRP’s Surge Amid XRP’s recent progress, Armstrong has emphasized his long-standing prediction that XRP will surpass Ethereum. In a tweet, Armstrong stated, “ETH, you can run, but you can’t hide (from XRP),” signaling his confidence in XRP’s upward trajectory. Ethereum currently trades at $3,705, with a market capitalization of approximately $446.27 billion. By comparison, XRP’s market cap of $107 billion highlights a significant gap between the two. For XRP to match Ethereum’s valuation, its price would need to quadruple, reaching roughly $8. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although such a scenario may seem ambitious, XRP’s recent performance suggests it is not impossible. Since November 4, XRP has surged from $0.4968 to $1.94, representing a remarkable 291% increase. In contrast, Ethereum’s price has grown by just 40% over the same period. If XRP’s growth continues at this pace and Ethereum’s rise remains modest, the possibility of XRP closing the gap becomes more plausible. Can XRP Reach Ethereum’s Market Cap? Reaching Ethereum’s market valuation would require XRP to sustain its bullish momentum. Should XRP achieve a market cap of $445 billion, the asset’s price would align with the projected $8. However, some critics view this target as overly optimistic, citing the likelihood of resistance between the $3 and $5 price levels. Despite these concerns, many XRP proponents remain confident that the cryptocurrency could reach double-digit prices during this cycle, potentially leading to the much-anticipated “flip” of Ethereum. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether XRP can maintain its upward trajectory and challenge Ethereum’s dominance. Armstrong and other bullish commentators remain steadfast in their belief, but market dynamics will ultimately dictate the outcome.

This increase has propelled XRP to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, now exceeding $107 billion. As of the latest trading data, XRP is priced at $1.87, reflecting a remarkable 99% increase over the past two weeks. This performance has allowed XRP to surpass Binance Coin (BNB) in market capitalization , signaling a resurgence of investor interest. XRP Breaks Free From Three-Year Stagnation The recent rally marks a significant turnaround for XRP, which had been consolidating between $0.30 and $0.60 for nearly three years. This period of stagnation was largely attributed to the end of the 2021 bull run and the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC’s classification of XRP as an “unregistered security” has created substantial uncertainty for investors, particularly in the US, which has impacted the token’s market performance. However, recent political developments in the United States have contributed to a renewed sense of confidence among crypto investors. Following Donald Trump’s victory on November 5, where he defeated current Vice President Kamala Harris, the cryptocurrency market saw a significant recovery. Bitcoin, in particular, reached a new all-time high of $99,540, leading this resurgence. Trump’s election promises to overhaul regulatory frameworks, including the dismissal of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office, have further fueled optimism. Gensler has announced his departure from the agency effective January 20, coinciding with the presidential inauguration, raising hopes that the protracted legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC may soon be resolved. This potential resolution could pave the way for increased investment in XRP and the introduction of new investment products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on the token, with several asset managers having already filed applications. New Price Targets And Support Levels In terms of technical analysis, crypto analyst DarkDefender has noted that XRP has successfully broken through a critical resistance level at $1.44. With the recent uptrend recorded for the fifth largest token on the market, DarkDefender outlined new targets for XRP, including $3.4176 and $11.3233, while also revisiting historical targets of $5.85 and $18.22. Furthermore, the analyst highlighted new support levels at $1.44, $1.28, $1.14, and $1.03. The 4-hour chart indicates a new market structure for XRP, with expectations of touching $2.13 before any potential corrections. New resistance levels are identified at $4.11 and $6.42 within this timeframe, aligning with the main target of $5.85 following the anticipated move above $1.88.

As the crypto markets enter the final month of 2024, ETH is looking to end the year on a high and extend its rally beyond $4,000. Ethereum (ETH) Sees Surge In Investor Interest Ethereum (ETH) is trading just below the $3,700 level and could rally to test the resistance at $4,000. Trading data shows that ETH has established a foothold above the crucial $3,500 level, indicating growing investor confidence in the asset. Its recent price action also points to strengthening market dynamics as ETH looks to maintain its upward trajectory. ETH’s price chart shows a consistent recovery phase, with prices remaining above crucial support zones. Data from Kraken reveals buyers consistently stepping in above $3,500, suggesting the formation of a strong foundation and support zone at this level, providing a base for future price discovery. Trading volumes have also jumped, indicating active participation across derivatives and spot markets and broad-based interest at current prices. This level of market activity indicates strong market engagement rather than short-term speculation. Ethereum CME futures open interest (OI) has been significantly higher since the US elections and has consistently risen with the price of ETH. The Ethereum CME open interest gives an idea of US investor interest in ETH derivatives. The ETH CME open interest crossed $2.8 billion for the first time last week, indicating surging interest among US traders in the altcoin. The bullish sentiment also sent ETH’s CME futures surging. Spot Ethereum ETFs have also seen consistent inflows, outpacing spot Bitcoin ETFs, and have recorded $225 million in inflows over the past four days. Ethereum Sets Sights On $4,000 Ethereum (ETH) has been steadily climbing over crucial levels as it looks to end the year on a high. Following the US election, ETH surged past the 200-day SMA and $3,000, levels it has struggled to cross. It faced a decline after reaching this level as sellers attempted to drive the price below $3,000. However, ETH found strong support at around $3,100, preventing a further decline. After trading between $3,100 and $3,200 for a few sessions, ETH rallied on Thursday (November 21) to go above $3,000 and settle at $3,360. The price faced considerable selling pressure on Friday, falling back in the red, dropping by 0.96% to $3,328. Source: TradingView The weekend began with ETH surging towards $3,500. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching $3,502, and ETH fell to settle at $3,396, an increase of just over 2%. Sellers returned to the market on Sunday as ETH faced significant volatility, dropping by 1.01% to $3,362. ETH recovered on Monday, rising by 1.60% to hit an intraday high of $3,547 before dropping and settling at $3,415. It fell back in the red again on Tuesday, registering a drop of almost 3% and settling at $3,325. Despite Tuesday’s bearish session, ETH rallied on Wednesday, surging nearly 10% to go above $3,500 and settle at $3,657. However, it could not go above the resistance at $3,700 and fell back on Thursday, dropping over 2% to $3,580. Buyers attempted a recovery on Friday but could only manage a marginal increase and move the price to $3,694. However, ETH has seen momentum build during the ongoing session as it went past $3,700 to $3,733 before declining to its current level of $3,665, up 2%. Where Next For Ethereum (ETH)? Ethereum faces resistance at $3,700. If ETH can rally and move above this level, it could move to $4,000. A break above $4,000 could see the altcoin hit a new yearly high above $4,522. The RSI indicates bullish sentiment, hinting we could see a rally towards the $4,000 mark. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Top Cryptos to Watch Now,https://timestabloid.com/btc-whales-are-loading-up-massive-rally-predicted-top-cryptos/,"The crypto market is on the cusp of another rally, and investors are getting set to take full advantage of it. This is due to Bitcoin’s boom, a development that has sent BTC whales buying copious amounts of Bitcoin . But Bitcoin is not the only coin investors are keeping an eye on– Rollblock is also heating up, and Binance Coin BNB is on the minds of many as well. Veteran investors believe these are the crypto to watch during this period. This article explains why you should pay attention to them. A surging revolution in the GambleFi market Unknown to most people, the GambleFi market is worth an astonishing $500 billion. In fact, this market is on course to hit $1 trillion in a few years, and Rollblock is well-positioned to dominate the space. This is because the online crypto casino integrates blockchain technology into its processes to provide a provably fair gaming experience for gamblers. Rollblock users play without anxiety and worry because the platform is committed to trust and transparency. Every betting odd, stake, transaction, and other important metrics are recorded on the blockchain, which makes them immutable and makes Rollblock incapable of sharp practices. Since this feature is very rare in the GambleFi space, Rollblock effectively qualifies as a crypto to watch out for. Its presale is tearing things up, having raised $6 million for investors alone. And it should, since it’s got an attractive entry price of $0.0037, with the potential for a significant price appreciation in the upcoming crypto surge. BTC price prediction sends the crypto market on a bullish run Ever since Bitcoin hit a new all-time high close to $100k, BTC price predictions have gone through the roof. Several people believe a rally to $150K is imminent, while others expect a correction. However, one thing is clear: the crypto market is set to embark on a massive price rally! This is due to the massive influence Bitcoin has on prices. With Microstrategy’s Michael Saylor about to pour billions into BTC , things could get crazy any time soon. Will BNB ride the upcoming crypto boom? Binance Coin BNB appreciated handsomely over the last year. It rode a bull wave to hit an ATH of $700, but that was its highlight for the year. BNB only appreciated modestly during the last post-US election boom, and this leaves much room for doubts. After appreciating to an impressive $600 last March, BNB has traded mostly in a straight line. It dropped below $500 but struggled to break a resistance level of $600. After Donald Trump’s victory, most coins shot through the roof, but BNB barely crossed $700. This doesn’t inspire confidence in its ability to ride the upcoming crypto bull run. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rally is surely going to set the crypto market on an extremely bullish momentum and Rollblock tops the coins to watch out for during this period. Unlike Bitcoin and BNB , it has an affordable entry price of $0.037. Also, going by their recent price history Rollblock is more likely to ride the upcoming wave than BNB . This makes it the ideal crypto investment for ambitious investors. If you missed out on Bitcoin , Ethereum, and Solana when they were worth less than a dollar, Rollblock has provided a brand new opportunity to join a revolutionary movement that is heading to the top. Don’t miss out on it. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

In a Fox Business interview on Wednesday, Giancarlo suggested that the SEC might abandon its appeal against Ripple after a series of courtroom losses. Crypto Dad Claims SEC Will Drop The XRP Case On being asked whether the SEC would drop the XRP case, the ‘Crypto Dad’ responded saying “I think they should, I bet they would. I would recommend, it’s time for regulatory agencies to drop a lot of these cases which they have lost at the trial court,” he noted. Giancarlo’s remarks come amidst waves of optimism in the crypto industry following a Trump victory, in expectations of more crypto-friendly regulations. Particularly in the backdrop of Gensler’s exit and Trump taking office the same day, this matter has gained widespread traction as there is renewed confidence in the community after years of backlash against the “regulation by enforcement” approach backed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ‘The Crypto Czar’ Notably, Trump’s team has revealed plans to decentralize crypto oversight, potentially shifting some responsibilities to the CFTC and appointing a dedicated ‘Crypto Czar’. Trump’s former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo is a lead contender for the role of White Crypto Czar. This new position could usher in a new era of pro-crypto policy in Washington, noted Fox Business. Previously, the former CFTC Chair had shared that he does not wish to clean up the mess that former SEC Chair Gary Gensler created when there were rumors that he was being considered for the position. On asking his views on who will be the next SEC Chair, Giancarlo hopes that it is someone who has both the institutional knowledge of the building and a deep commitment to innovation and crypto agenda. He suggested that Paul Atkins, who is among the top names in consideration, could be the next SEC Chair. Atkins is widely respected for his deep understanding of cryptocurrencies and the SEC’s operations, making him a likely ally for the crypto industry. Will Trump Accomplish His Promises? On asking if Trump will deliver his promises of making the US the crypto capital of the world and creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Giancarlo emphasized that this is the reason why he believes a Crypto Czar is critically important to materialize all the promises. He believes that Trump is committed to all this and aims to create ‘the second industrial revolution in America’. “If we can go from where we’ve been in the last few years, which was resistance to innovation, to really furthering innovation, we might be able to get to that 4.5% growth rate and get us out of our debt problems,” underscored the former CFTC Chair. With the incoming Trump administration that prioritizes innovation and clarity, the crypto industry may see a significant turnaround in its U.S. prospects, paving the way for growth and investment.",News|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-01 07:35:49

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/legal-expert-is-certain-ripple-sec-case-appeal-will-be-dropped-heres-why/,"Bill Morgan, a prominent lawyer in the cryptocurrency sector, recently responded to a tweet by Charles Gasparino, Senior Correspondent at Fox Business, regarding the potential implications of Donald Trump’s re-election for the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. The comment has sparked significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community. Gasparino’s original tweet highlighted the possibility that a new SEC administration under Trump could drop the appeal concerning the portion of the case Ripple won. The appeal will be dropped because there was no error made in the part of the case the SEC lost and the political motive for continuing a near hopeless appeal will largely disappear when its main internal SEC enabler Gary Gensler resigns on 20 January 25. https://t.co/HfaepDv95c — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) November 28, 2024 Gasparino quoted Christopher Giancarlo, the former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who expressed a similar belief during a Fox Business segment. Gasparino described this scenario as plausible, noting that the political landscape under Trump could significantly influence the SEC’s litigation strategy. In response, Bill Morgan asserted that the appeal would likely be dropped regardless of political dynamics. Morgan stated that the SEC’s appeal of the summary judgment , which ruled that certain XRP sales did not constitute securities transactions, is “near hopeless” due to the absence of any judicial error in the decision. He further emphasized that the political motivations driving the appeal would diminish once Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, steps down, which he projected to occur on January 20, 2025, coinciding with the presidential inauguration. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal and Political Implications Morgan’s response underscores a key legal consideration in the SEC’s case against Ripple. The court’s ruling in July 2023 differentiated between institutional sales of XRP, deemed securities, and programmatic sales to retail investors, which were not. This split decision was a partial victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Morgan’s assertion that “there was no error” in the court’s ruling aligns with many legal experts who view the SEC’s prospects on appeal as weak. The case has drawn significant attention due to its implications for crypto regulation in the United States. The SEC leadership under Gensler has been criticized for its aggressive enforcement actions against cryptocurrency firms. A change in the SEC’s administration following the 2024 presidential election could impact its regulatory approach, particularly if Trump appoints officials with a more favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies.

In a new discussion on the Wealthion podcast with SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, the Fundstrat head of research says the current technical trajectory of BTC and the incoming pro-crypto presidential administration are putting Bitcoin in a position to achieve his massive price target. “Over the next twelve months, I think something over $250,000 is possible, but maybe highly probable based on just following this price cycle. The second reason I think Bitcoin has maybe more upside than that is because the new administration has run on a pro-Bitcoin platform, and I think the possibility of the US not only legitimizing Bitcoin but making it a strategic reserve asset, I think raises what would be the possible price scenarios for Bitcoin because if the US government, as the intend, ultimately gets to a million Bitcoin it will be the largest Bitcoin holder in the world and they exert an enormous positive influence on legitimizing Bitcoin. I would add to that… It’s almost like taking a playbook from MicroStrategy because MicroStrategy has proven that using Bitcoin as a balance sheet asset has really created a lot of value for MicroStrategy shareholders.” In a recent interview with Natalie Brunell, Lee said that Bitcoin’s market cap could soar about 750% from its current value to hit $16 trillion. Lee believes investors will increasingly flock to Bitcoin as a more useful store of value than gold. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,943.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin nears $1, sparking investor excitement as SHIB and DOGEN gain traction, signaling a potential new crypto wave. Table of Contents DOGEN: The meme token for alphas who always dominate Dogecoin: From meme coin to cryptocurrency powerhouse Shiba Inu: A meme-inspired token with expanding utility Conclusion After a remarkable surge, Dogecoin’s value is edging closer to the coveted $1 milestone. This impressive climb is fueling excitement among traders and investors. At the same time, other meme-inspired cryptocurrencies like SHIB and DOGEN are gaining traction. These developments hint at a possible new wave in the crypto market that could redefine digital currency trends. DOGEN: The meme token for alphas who always dominate The DOGEN vision revolves around the life many aspire to live—luxury cars, wads of cash, and making heads turn wherever. That’s the DOGEN dream. For those all about leveling up and never backing down, it’s time to get in on DOGEN. Built for those who always come out on top, this meme token is for the true alphas. Hold like a king, rule the market DOGEN is about to take off! With a 700% surge projected even before the presale ends, this is just the beginning. DOGEN is poised for those mind-boggling gains that only meme tokens can bring. Get in now, take your position, and let the rest chase after you. Missed WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new leader in the Solana meme token space, joining the ranks of BONK, WIF, and Popcat—projects that each saw incredible 1000% gains. DOGEN might still be under the radar, but not for long. With the upcoming bull run, this is the chance to get ahead. DOGEN is dropping some serious rewards. Get tokens in the presale, flex those social muscles, and start recruiting with a referral link. Users will earn a hefty 20% of the Golden Points from each recruit’s token purchases. Build a DOGEN army, and start cashing in. You might also like: Dogen to skyrocket from $0.0008, Cardano looks to Hit $2 and Tron $0.5 Dogecoin: From meme coin to cryptocurrency powerhouse Dogecoin, created in 2013 by software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, began as a humorous alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring the Shiba Inu meme as its iconic logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no supply limit, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute, making it highly abundant. Once regarded as a “memecoin,” Dogecoin skyrocketed in 2021, reaching a market capitalization of over $50 billion and securing its place among the top cryptocurrencies. This rise was fueled by social media buzz and high-profile endorsements, including Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s journey highlights the power of community and social influence in shaping the cryptocurrency market. Despite ongoing debates about its future, its widespread recognition and utility sustain investor interest. Shiba Inu: A meme-inspired token with expanding utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by the pseudonymous developer Ryoshi. Initially minted with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, SHIB gained attention when half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, significantly boosting SHIB’s profile. Running on Ethereum, SHIB benefits from ecosystem compatibility, enabling projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future plans for NFTs and decentralized governance. These developments position SHIB as a notable player in the current market cycle, blending meme appeal with functional innovation. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of its presale, DOGEN follows in the footsteps of tokens like BONK and Popcat. Building a community of leaders, it offers real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters, aiming for unmatched success this altcoin season.

Moreover, with Bitcoin’s price hovering close to the $100k mark, the crypto space has achieved a new ATH. Will the top 3 cryptocurrencies resume the month of December on a bullish note? In this article, we have covered the short-term market sentiments of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) crypto tokens. Bitcoin (BTC) Despite recording a neutral trend over the last seven days, the BTC price surged ~39% in November. Moreover, with a market capitalization of $1.909 billion, the Bitcoin token currently holds a market dominance of 56.13%. BTC Dec End Analysis The Simple Moving Average (SMA) supports the BTC price chart in the daily time frame. Further, the RSI indicator is hovering close to its overbought range. This indicates an increase in the market’s bullish sentiment for the star crypto. If the bullish sentiment sustains, the Bitcoin price will surpass its target price of $100k and head toward its upper high of $110k. On the flip side, a bearish reversal could pull the price toward its lower support level of $81,000. To understand the long-term possibilities of the BTC token?

Further, with a monthly return of 47.07%, this altcoin has surpassed the $3,650 level. ETH Dec End Analysis The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a constant green histogram with its averages recording a steady rise. Moreover, the EMA 50/200-day displays a Golden Cross daily, highlighting a bullish outlook. Maintaining the price above its resistance level of $3,697 could set the stage for the ETH coin price to head toward its high of $4,100. Conversely, if the bears outrun the bulls, the altcoin leader may retest its lower support level of $3,000. Ripple (XRP) The XRP price has continued gaining momentum despite ongoing market turmoil. The Ripple price has soared 264.89% this month, resulting in it surpassing the $1.8 mark. With a market cap of $106.76 billion, it has secured the 05th position. XRP Dec End Analysis The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues hovering above its overbought range in the 1D time frame, with its average trendline experiencing a bullish crossover. This suggests that the Ripple token may continue gaining momentum in the upcoming week. If the market favors the bulls, the XRP price will head toward its upper high of $2.5. On the contrary, if a trend reversal occurs, the Ripple crypto token may retest its support trendline of $1.50 this year.

According to its filing, the SEC claimed the investment firm misled investors by lying about its liquidity and the potential profits users would earn from its crypto asset mining platform. In the statement published by the regulator, the firm defrauded about 1,200 United States investors. The regulator claimed that Touzi Capital misrepresented its capabilities, offering a fraudulent securities offering of its mining fund to investors. The SEC also revealed that it made a cumulative $95 million from the fraudulent scheme. The agency said the firm convinced investors by telling them to invest in their crypto mining platform, a claim the SEC found untrue. Touzi Capital lied to investors about its capabilities The SEC’s filing revealed that instead of carrying out the services it was paid for, it mixed all the funds from the investors and pushed it into other subsidiaries. Notably, the subsidiaries had no direct link to a crypto service or a mining facility. The SEC said Touzi Capital refused to explain the risks involved in its investment to investors, lying about the profitability level of its venture. The SEC also discussed the fund’s stability, showing dissatisfaction with how the firm presented it. “The SEC alleges that the defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements as to the stability of these investments – comparing them to high-yield money market accounts,” the filing read. The SEC also revealed that the investment was highly risky, with those in charge of its activities still accepting new customers even after things started to go bad. Uncertainty surrounds SEC cases amid dismissal threats There have been uncertainties surrounding the cases that the SEC has tried over the last few years, with some risking dismissal. For instance, a United States Judge struck out an appeal from a promoter of an allegedly fraudulent crypto scheme to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against the company. The Scheme was said to have scammed users’ funds worth $18 million. In his arguments, Kristoffer Krohn highlighted that the SEC failed to establish in its complaint letter if the green boxes, the lawsuit’s basis, were securities offerings or investment contracts. Despite Krohn largely arguing on why the SEC lawsuit should be canceled, including noting that the SEC confused elements that defined Securities in its Howey test, the Judge sided with the regulator. However, there is a likelihood that most of the SEC’s legal battles against firms in the crypto sector will fade away soon. This is, in part, due to the emergence of Donald Trump as the president of the United States of America in the last election. Trump, during his campaign, made several promises to the crypto industry, with the industry looking to hold him to his promises when he takes office. One such promise is to fire current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is set to step down before the new administration is sworn in. With Gensler stepping down, there have been intensified efforts to find a pro-crypto replacement. However, speculations still trail the cases tried by the SEC, with market participants predicting a likely dismissal of most cases. Consensys CEO Joe Lubin discussed it at the DevCon 2024 in Thailand, highlighting changes in the future. “Maybe not all the cases, maybe not all elements of the case, but I have a feeling that our industry is going to save hundreds of millions of dollars going forward,” he said.

At launch, the HYPE token was valued at $3.90, bringing the total distribution to $1.2 billion, according to CoinGecko data. The token’s value surged by 63% within 12 hours, trading at $6.16 at the time of reporting. Its market capitalization is now nearing $2 billion. Token Distribution and Ecosystem Hyperliquid, a layer-1 blockchain based on a proof-of-stake mechanism, is designed to handle up to 200,000 transactions per second. The HYPE token plays a central role in the ecosystem, functioning as the staking asset for consensus and the gas token for the Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible layer, HyperEVM. Hyperliquid revealed that 31% of its 1 billion HYPE tokens were distributed during the genesis event. Of the remaining supply, 38.8% is allocated for future emissions and community rewards, 6% for the Hyper Foundation treasury, and 0.3% for grants. Core contributors will receive 23.8% of the total supply under a one-year lock period, with vesting schedules extending through 2028. Hyperliquid clarified that no allocations were made for private investors, centralized exchanges, or market makers. Comparisons to Previous Airdrops Hyperliquid’s airdrop ranks among the largest in DeFi history. In 2020, Uniswap distributed 400 UNI tokens to over 250,000 addresses, initially valued at $3.40 each, totaling $1,300 per recipient. UNI’s value later skyrocketed to over $42 during the DeFi summer of 2021. Similarly, Arbitrum conducted a significant airdrop in 2023, distributing ARB tokens to over 625,000 wallets, with a total market value of approximately $812,500. The Role of Airdrops Airdrops serve various purposes, from rewarding early adopters to promoting new cryptocurrencies.

Cosmos is celebrated for its interchain connectivity, EOS is advancing blockchain scalability, and Qubetics stands apart with its groundbreaking multi-chain wallet designed to make blockchain management seamless. While Cosmos and EOS excel in their respective niches, Qubetics leads the charge with its forward-thinking solutions, revolutionising how users and businesses interact with blockchain ecosystems. Qubetics ($TICS): Transforming Blockchain with Its Multi-Chain Wallet Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s an ecosystem poised to redefine blockchain utility. At the centre of this revolution is its multi-chain wallet , which eliminates the need for juggling multiple wallets across different blockchains. This innovation allows users to store, manage, and transact across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more—all from one secure interface. Imagine a small business owner who deals with payments in various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Instead of navigating multiple wallets and platforms, Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet simplifies the entire process. Professionals and investors can monitor assets across several blockchains, reducing time and complexity. The wallet isn’t just convenient—it’s robust. With quantum-resistant cryptography, Qubetics ensures top-notch security while delivering a user-friendly experience. Even a casual crypto enthusiast can transfer tokens, stake assets, and interact with decentralised apps (dApps) without needing advanced technical know-how. Qubetics is currently in its 10th presale stage, with over 239 million tokens sold and $3.8 million raised. At $0.025 per token, it’s a bargain for investors looking to get in early. A $1,500 investment could grow to $13,050 if $TICS reaches $0.25 at the presale’s end. Long-term projections are even more exciting. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $15 post-mainnet launch, turning the same $1,500 investment into a staggering $900,000. With unmatched utility, the multi-chain wallet cements Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2024 . Cosmos (ATOM): Pioneering Blockchain Interoperability Cosmos is often called the “Internet of Blockchains,” and for good reason. Its ecosystem is designed to connect multiple blockchains, allowing them to exchange data and tokens seamlessly. This interoperability addresses a significant limitation in the blockchain space, enabling decentralised networks to collaborate rather than operate in isolation. For example, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform built on Ethereum can leverage Cosmos to integrate with other networks like Binance Smart Chain, enhancing user experience and expanding functionality. This connectivity makes Cosmos a cornerstone for dApp developers and blockchain innovators. Trading at approximately $8, Cosmos is an appealing option for investors betting on blockchain interconnectivity. A $1,500 investment in ATOM could yield substantial returns as more projects adopt its technology. However, Cosmos’ utility is mostly limited to developers and blockchain integration specialists, making it less accessible to everyday users. EOS: Scaling Blockchain for dApp Development EOS has long been a favourite among developers for its high-speed transactions and minimal fees. Designed to support decentralised app (dApp) development, EOS provides a scalable blockchain infrastructure capable of handling thousands of transactions per second. This scalability has positioned it as a competitor to Ethereum, particularly for projects requiring fast and cost-effective transactions. Picture a gaming company launching a blockchain-based game. With EOS, they can ensure seamless user experiences without worrying about network congestion or exorbitant gas fees. This focus on scalability has made EOS a go-to platform for developers building dApps across industries like gaming, DeFi, and supply chain management. Currently priced around $0.65, EOS offers a low entry point for investors seeking exposure to blockchain scalability. A $1,500 investment could yield decent returns as dApp adoption grows. However, EOS’ success largely depends on developer activity and competition from other platforms like Solana and Avalanche. Compared to Qubetics, EOS lacks the user-centric innovations that make $TICS a game-changer. While EOS excels in scalability, it doesn’t address the broader blockchain challenges that Qubetics tackles with its multi-chain wallet . Conclusion: Qubetics Outpaces Cosmos and EOS In the race to be the best crypto investment of 2024 , Qubetics emerges as the clear winner. Its multi-chain wallet simplifies blockchain interactions, making it a must-have for businesses, professionals, and casual users alike. While Cosmos excels in blockchain interoperability and EOS leads in scalability, neither matches the versatility and innovation of $TICS. With $TICS priced at $0.025 and a 10% price hike just days away, there’s no better time to invest. Analysts project massive ROI, turning modest investments into life-changing wealth. Secure your $TICS tokens today and be part of the blockchain revolution.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 08:31:07

The President-elect has asked these countries to promise not to create a new BRICS currency or support any other currency that might replace the dollar, otherwise, they will face 100% tariffs and lose access to the US Market. The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2024 Formed in 2009, BRICS is the only major international group of which the United States is not a part. Its other members are South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates. Notably, over the past few years, a few of its member countries, particularly Russia and China, are seeking an alternative to the US Dollar to create their own BRICS currency. However, India has so far not been a part of the move. In an X post on Saturday, November 30, Trump warned these countries of such a move. “We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,” the President elect underscored. ‘No Chance BRICS Will Replace USD’ He firmly made known that there is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in international Trade, and further noted that any country that tries, should wave goodbye to America. At a recent summit, Russian Vladimir Putin blamed the United States of America for ‘weaponizing’’ the dollar, terming it as a big mistake. Putin highlighted that Russia is not choosing to abandon the dollar but is forced to look for other options because of US restrictions. Notably, Trump on his campaign trail pledged that he would make it costly for countries to move away from the US dollar. And threatened to use tariffs to ensure they complied. Efforts To Keep USD Dominance Intact Trump and his economic advisers have been discussing ways to punish allies and adversaries alike who seek to engage in bilateral trade in currencies other than the dollar. Those measures include considering options such as export controls, currency manipulation charges, and levies on trade. Trump has long stressed that he wants the US dollar to remain the world’s reserve currency, saying in a March interview with CNBC that he “would not allow countries to go off the dollar” because it would be “a hit to our country.” BRICS Members Express Frustration The US dollar has been the bedrock of global commerce for a long time and continues to dominate as the world’s most widely used currency. However, members of the BRICS alliance and from the developing nations have expressed frustration as they believe that America has outsized control over the global financial system. The president-elect has already intimidated the world markets ahead of his second term with threats to levy an additional 10 per tariff on goods from China and 25 percent tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada if these countries do not take actions to control the flow of illegal drugs and undocumented migrants across US borders.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-01 08:32:19

A top analyst sees parallels between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin’s price breakout, with WallitIQ AI token also set for growth. Table of Contents Shiba Inu price set to replicate the Dogecoin price breakout WallitIQ’s crypto wallet: The driving force behind its rise as a top investment pick Conclusion A leading analyst noticed similarities between the Shiba Inu price chart and the Dogecoin price breakout, stating that history may repeat itself. While the possibility of the Shiba Inu price mirroring the Dogecoin price performance is probable, the emerging WallitIQ AI token could also see fast growth due to its innovative wallet functionalities. Shiba Inu price set to replicate the Dogecoin price breakout In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), a leading analyst, Ali Martinez, observed that the Shiba Inu price behavior closely resembled the Dogecoin price historical trajectory. The Dogecoin price, which surged from $0.1 to $0.4 earlier this month, experienced double-digit gains driven by bullish catalysts such as the US presidential elections and Elon Musk’s influence. Similarly, the Shiba Inu price appears to be tracing a comparable pattern in its price chart. Martinez noted that between 2021 and 2024, both the Dogecoin price and Shiba Inu price showcased parallel actions, including major rallies, sharp declines, and periods of consolidation. For instance, the Dogecoin price historic 2021 surge to its all-time high of $0.73 was followed by a drop to $0.05 in 2022. After a recovery above $0.1 in 2023, the Dogecoin price saw steady consolidation and eventually rallied back to $0.4 in 2024. The Shiba Inu price trajectory aligns closely with this. After reaching an ATH of $0.000083 in 2021, the Shiba Inu price plummeted to $0.000007 in 2022, entered a prolonged consolidation phase, and started recovering in 2024. The Shiba Inu price recently climbed above $0.000044 before retracing to $0.00001.

In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Marcus claimed that Diem, which initially launched as Libra, was on track for a limited launch in 2021 after clearing all regulatory concerns. However, he accused key figures in the US government of orchestrating the organization’s collapse. Marcus specifically claimed that then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen privately warned Fed Chair Jay Powell that approving the Diem project would amount to “political suicide.” The Fed then reportedly pressured banks to sever ties with the project, effectively leaving the payments system to die. This points to one of the most direct accusations, which links the government’s influence to the broader difficulty of using crypto in traditional financial systems. Related News: Legendary Bullish Forecaster Tom Lee Assesses Bitcoin's $250,000 Target Next Year, Answers the Question of Whether Altcoin Season Will Come Marcus’ comments reignited discussions about “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a term used by crypto advocates to describe allegations that the government is pressuring banks to sever ties with crypto firms. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long responded to Marcus’s comments by saying that her bank had faced similar targeting. “One day… I will be able to tell the real story of what the Fed did to Custodia Bank,” she wrote, accusing the Fed of corruption. Prominent investor Marc Andreessen echoed similar sentiments in a recent interview, claiming that over 30 tech founders have been “debanked” over the past four years. Other crypto leaders, including Sam Kazemian, have accused major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase of shutting down accounts linked to government-sponsored crypto assets. Allegations against U.S. regulators and financial institutions are not new. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges, previously accused the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of discouraging banks from partnering with crypto firms through vague “safety and soundness” reviews. *This is not investment advice.

According to the SEC’s statement released on November 29 , Touzi Capital allegedly raised nearly $95 million from more than 1,200 investors through its crypto mining fund. The firm reportedly claimed that the funds would be used exclusively for cryptocurrency mining operations. SEC Claims Touzi Capital Diverted Funds to Unrelated Ventures However, the SEC contends that Touzi Capital diverted investor funds to unrelated ventures through its subsidiaries. The complaint also alleges that Touzi Capital misled investors about the risks and potential returns of the investment. The firm purportedly likened its offerings to stable, high-yield money market accounts, despite the SEC’s assertion that the fund was “risky and illiquid.” Additionally, the SEC claims that Touzi Capital continued soliciting new investments even after its ventures began failing. This case is the latest in a series of legal actions targeting fraudulent practices within the crypto industry. Recently, a U.S. federal judge rejected an appeal by Kristoffer Krohn, accused of promoting an $18 million fraudulent crypto mining scheme. Krohn’s argument that the SEC had not adequately demonstrated the Green Boxes were securities was dismissed. As legal battles between crypto firms and the SEC persist, some industry leaders suggest a potential shift in regulatory attitudes with political changes. Speaking at DevCon 2024, Consensys CEO Joe Lubin speculated that Donald Trump’s potential return to the presidency could alleviate the financial strain on the crypto sector, potentially reducing ongoing litigation costs. SEC Is Under Scrutiny As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies , opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players. As reported, a coalition of seven U.S. states has come together to challenge the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulation of cryptocurrency. Led by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, the states have filed an amicus brief arguing that the SEC’s attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies constitutes a “power grab” that would stifle innovation, harm the crypto industry, and exceed the agency’s authority. The coalition includes Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, with Oklahoma becoming the latest state to join. Earlier this year, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said that the regulatory agency is currently operating in an “enforcement-only mode” when it comes to the regulation of cryptocurrencies. As reported, President-elect Donald Trump is considering selecting Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Atkins – who previously served under SEC chairs Richard Breeden and Arthur Levitt – is both “crypto savvy” and has a “deep understanding of the inner workings of the agency.” Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has regularly vowed to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory framework upon returning to the Oval Office.

37084558,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656164,1733043608,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Key Bitcoin Levels Under The Spotlight This Weekend: Insights From Glassnode,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/key-bitcoin-levels-under-the-spotlight-this-weekend-insights-from-glassnode/,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a remarkable uptrend over the past three weeks, inching close to the elusive $100,000 mark. This follows Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election over Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris, which boosted investor confidence in a new era for the broader industry. This has led to increased adoption of the leading crypto, with major corporations worldwide adopting it as a strategic reserve asset . In addition, inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have increased, further contributing to the bull run. However, after its recent 7% correction, the Bitcoin price fell to around $91,000. Then it regained the $96,000 mark, raising questions about its ability to break through the psychological $100,000 barrier before the end of the year. Critical Support At $92,700 The peak price of $99,540 achieved last week has left investors wondering whether Bitcoin can sustain its momentum or if selling pressure will lead to further consolidation. Despite the uncertainty, Glassnode founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel have provided insights into Bitcoin’s potential trajectory as December approaches. They acknowledge the challenges ahead but maintain that the $100,000 target remains feasible. In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), Allemann and Happel outlined critical levels to watch in Bitcoin’s price action. They noted that while Bitcoin is currently in a bullish channel, resistance at $97,200 has yet to be overcome. Should this resistance hold firm, a retest of the $92,700 support level—aligned with the Daily 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA)—is likely. This support zone is deemed crucial by the two founders for maintaining the bullish channel and keeping the $100,000 target within reach. Bitcoin Could Surge To $125,000–$140,000 By Year-End Adding to the bullish sentiment, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted historical trends indicating that Bitcoin has typically surged in December following US presidential elections. In the last two cycles, Bitcoin recorded gains of 30% and 46%, leading Martinez to speculate that if history repeats itself, Bitcoin could close out the year in the range of $125,000 to $140,000. Martinez further pointed out that long-term Bitcoin holders have been taking profits as the price climbed from $62,000 to $99,000. However, he emphasized that this profit-taking behavior is typical during bull markets and should not be interpreted as a signal to short the asset. The analyst asserts that according to historical patterns, long-term holders often realize gains as prices rise, which can create short-term volatility but does not necessarily indicate a shift in the overall market trend. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,500, down a slight 0.3% in the 24-hour time frame and down nearly 2% in the past week.

But investors don’t care,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trumps-economic-plans-us-stock-market/,"Trump’s economic agenda has Wall Street on a sugar high, pushing the stock market into dangerous territory. The S&P 500 is smashing records, clocking 53 highs this year alone. Retail investors are going all in, throwing caution and cash into the market’s riskiest corners. But Trump’s policies could light the match that sets this overhyped market on fire. Think protectionist trade wars, skyrocketing inflation, and corporate tax cuts — all against the backdrop of geopolitical chaos and rising interest rates. And while the market seems to be loving the chaos, not everyone is. The small-cap Russell 2000 Index, long a laggard, is suddenly the darling of Wall Street. It’s up 20% this year, outpacing the S&P 500’s 26% gain. Traders are betting big on Trump’s “America First” doctrine, which favors domestic-focused companies. Small caps and tech: A bubble brewing? Small-cap stocks have latched onto Trump’s trade war rhetoric like it’s a lifeline. The logic is simple: less exposure to international markets equals less risk in a protectionist world. But here’s the problem. Small-cap earnings are weak, and rising borrowing costs could cripple these debt-dependent companies. And then there’s tech — semiconductors, to be exact. AI hysteria sent chip stocks soaring, but the party might be over. Trade wars are looming, and chipmakers, with their global supply chains, are sitting ducks. The tech sector, which led the market for years, is now underperforming. Jonathan Krinsky from BTIG warned , “Bulls really need to see semis stabilize here to prevent a bigger breakdown into 2025.” In other words, tech could be the domino that starts the chain reaction. Trump’s economic fireworks aren’t just a U.S. problem. Emerging markets are bracing for impact too. South Africa is a standout though, having managed to slash inflation to 2.8% — which is a far cry from its post-Covid peak of 7.8%. Its bonds offer juicy returns, and its stock market is outpacing peers. Investors are all in Retail investors are acting like it’s 1999, dumping cash into stocks at record levels. Data from Bank of America shows households’ equity holdings are at an all-time high. Risk? What risk? Everyone’s betting the market will keep climbing, but history says otherwise. Eric Diton of the Wealth Alliance said, “We know from history that when investors are too bullish, the question is who’s left to drive the market higher?” Institutional investors are also piling on, driving the S&P 500 to back-to-back annual gains of over 20% in 2023 and 2024.

However, meme coins are highly volatile and many lack intrinsic value, making thorough research and cautious investment crucial to avoid significant losses. The Multi-Million Trade Meme coins are extremely volatile and allow people to make substantial profits, assuming they enter in the early days and cash out at the right time. One savvy trader followed that strategy, purchasing 416.8 million Cat in a Dogs World (MEW) tokens in July this year. The transaction was worth around $2.42 million at the time. Lookonchain recently revealed that the whale sold the stash for 16,270 SOL ($3.94 million), making a profit of 6,270 SOL ($1.52 million). The cat-themed meme coin saw the light of day in March this year and it s price was hovering at approximately $0.003 when the trader jumped on the bandwagon . Currently, MEW is worth $0.009, representing a 200% increase since the July levels. The trader’s actions caused mixed reactions among X users. Some highlighted the multi-million trade, while others suggested that the whale could have waited a bit longer before cashing out since the market is in a bull mode. Not long ago, another trader spent just $158 worth of SOL to purchase 12.4 million CHILLGUY tokens. As of this writing, the stash equals nearly $5.6 million. Recall that CHILLGUY began trading in mid-November and was worth around $0.007. It experienced an impressive rally in the following days and is currently standing at approximately $0.45. Beware the Risks While dealing with meme coins can indeed lead to substantial profits, it may also result in crucial losses. After all, many of these assets are based on temporary trends and lack fundamental value in terms of utility or intrinsic worth. This means their prices might head south in a very short period of time . Those about to enter the ecosystem should follow some key rules to avoid a devastating outcome, such as investing only as much as they are ready to lose and conducting proper research beforehand.

37085454,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620572,1733045113,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37085454.jpeg,AI tool promises precise prediction of the day you’ll die,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ai-precise-prediction-day-die/,"An app promises to do what humans have wondered about forever: tell you the exact day you’ll die. The Death Clock, launched in July, claims to predict your death date using artificial intelligence. It has already pulled in over 125,000 downloads, according to Sensor Tower, and it’s backed by data from over 1,200 life expectancy studies covering 53 million participants. You plug in details like your diet, exercise habits, sleep schedule, and stress levels. The result? A personalized death date—morbid, maybe, but apparently accurate. The app charges $40 a year and isn’t shy about its theme. Users get a “fond farewell” death card complete with the Grim Reaper, and a countdown timer that ticks off your remaining life by the second. Brent Franson, the app’s creator, says this is no gimmick. It’s a serious upgrade from the actuarial tables insurance companies and governments have used for centuries. Life expectancy isn’t just a personal concern. It’s the backbone of critical financial systems. Insurance companies, pension funds, and governments use it to decide everything from policy premiums to Social Security payouts. The United States, already lagging behind other developed countries in life expectancy, could see its outdated mortality models upended by AI. Is there actually a need for Death Clock? For years, mortality data has been frustratingly broad. The Social Security Administration, for example, predicts that an 85-year-old man in the U.S. has a 10% chance of dying within a year, with an average 5.6 years left to live. That might work for general estimates, but Franson says it’s useless for individuals. Death Clock’s AI skips the averages and tailors predictions based on your unique inputs. It claims to be a “significant” improvement over traditional methods. The app’s approach has already sparked interest in academic and economic circles. In recent months, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) published two papers exploring mortality and its economic impact. One, titled On the Limits of Chronological Age, argues that age-based policies, like mandatory retirement, are outdated. People age differently, and their capabilities don’t always align with their calendar years. Death Clock’s personalized predictions could help shift the focus from age to actual functionality. Another NBER study looked at the “value per statistical life” (VSL), a calculation used in cost-benefit analysis for things like environmental regulations and workplace safety. Typically, VSL is estimated based on compensation for dangerous jobs. The researchers behind The Value of Statistical Life for Seniors used a different approach: how much older Americans spend on healthcare to lower their risk of dying. They found that a healthy 67-year-old values their life at $2 million, compared to $600,000 for someone in poorer health. How AI predictions could reshape economics The implications of accurate mortality predictions are massive. For regular folks, it could mean smarter financial planning. Decisions about saving, investing, and withdrawing retirement funds often rely on rough estimates. Death Clock’s precision could make those plans less of a guessing game. For governments and corporations, the stakes are even higher. Pension funds, life insurance, and Social Security programs all depend on life expectancy estimates. If people live longer than expected, funds run dry. If they die earlier, resources are wasted. But there’s a catch. Extended life expectancies bring their own problems. Longer lives mean longer retirements, which require more savings. Investment strategies may need to move toward higher-risk, higher-return assets like stocks. Traditional fixed-income approaches may not cut it for people planning to live well into their 90s. It’s not just about investments though. AI-powered mortality predictions could influence public policies, from healthcare to labor laws. Age-based benchmarks like statutory retirement might become irrelevant if personalized data becomes the norm. Governments might need to rethink how they structure everything from taxes to pensions. Longevity gaps and the role of money Not everyone will benefit equally from these advances. Longevity isn’t just about health, it’s about wealth. Rich Americans live significantly longer than poor ones. Research by the American Medical Association found that at age 40, the richest 1% of men live 15 years longer than the poorest 1%. For women, the gap is 10 years. Angus Deaton, a Nobel-winning economist, linked this disparity to “deaths of despair” caused by economic inequality. AI tools like Death Clock could expose these gaps even further. A person’s ability to change their predicted death date depends largely on their resources. The app suggests lifestyle changes to extend your life, but not everyone can afford healthier food, gym memberships, or stress-reducing vacations. Without addressing these inequalities, AI predictions might widen the gap instead of closing it. There are also intangibles that AI can’t account for. Loneliness, for example, is known to shorten life expectancy. Gratitude, on the other hand, may extend it. A Harvard study found that women who reported feeling the most grateful had a 9% lower risk of dying within three years. These factors aren’t easily quantifiable, but they matter.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 09:30:00

As a global car marketplace and real-world asset (RWA) platform , CryptoAutos allows users to buy vehicles or participate in fractional ownership of high-value automobiles using 1,000+ cryptocurrencies . With over $58 million in sales , 180,000 monthly visitors , and a network of 1,100+ dealers , CryptoAutos is delivering real-world use cases for digital assets, aligning seamlessly with Binance’s mission to drive crypto adoption. Its innovative approach and growing ecosystem have sparked rumors of a potential Binance listing. Speculation: Is a Binance Listing Imminent? The crypto community is buzzing with speculation that $AUTOS might be the next project to debut on Binance. Here’s why the rumors are heating up: Influential KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) are increasingly mentioning CryptoAutos in connection with Binance, signaling strong industry anticipation. People close to the project hint that CryptoAutos has completed its Binance application and that the process is moving forward. Partnership potential with Binance’s ecosystem suggests deeper integrations may soon be revealed. These whispers from the industry, coupled with CryptoAutos’ achievements and strategic moves, lend credibility to the possibility of a Binance listing. $BNB Integration: A Game-Changer The recent integration of $BNB on the CryptoAutos platform has fueled speculation further. By allowing users to pay with $BNB, CryptoAutos has effectively deepened its relationship with Binance’s ecosystem. Key impacts of this partnership include: Unlocking access for millions of $BNB holders to purchase vehicles and rentals via CryptoAutos. Projecting a $5M+ monthly transaction volume , demonstrating the growing adoption of $BNB as a real-world payment solution. Strengthening the case for $AUTOS as a viable Binance listing candidate by showcasing its alignment with Binance’s push for real-world crypto utility. This integration suggests a growing partnership between CryptoAutos and Binance, with $BNB playing a pivotal role in the ecosystem’s expansion. Experienced Leadership & Visionary Tokenomics At the helm of CryptoAutos is a seasoned market maker with a proven track record on Binance-listed projects. Harley’s deep industry connections and expertise in centralized exchange operations inspire trust and confidence in the project. His publicly stated belief in tokenomic structures that balance meme tokenomics with traditional economics resonates with Binance’s recent emphasis on fair and sustainable models . Harley’s insights and leadership have enabled CryptoAutos to adopt tokenomics that appeal to retail and institutional investors alike, addressing challenges of the low float, high FDV model while ensuring long-term sustainability. Tokenomics and the Low Float, High FDV Debate One of the standout aspects of $AUTOS is its tokenomics, which reflect a strategic response to the challenges posed by the low float, high FDV model. This structure, characterized by a small circulating supply and a high fully diluted valuation, has faced criticism for benefiting early investors at the expense of retail participants.

Powell's speech will take place at 21:45 Turkish time (UTC+3). The speech comes amid rising expectations following the release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve's November monetary policy meeting, which revealed policymakers are taking a cautious stance on future rate cuts. Federal funds futures suggest markets are pricing in interest rates to fall from the current 4.5%-4.75% range to around 3.8% by the end of 2024. That’s a significant shift from September’s forecast, with expectations now pointing to cuts of more than 100 basis points next year. Powell’s speech was set against the backdrop of a strong performance in U.S. stock markets, with the S&P 500 Index posting its biggest monthly gain since November 2023, supported by steady inflows into global equity funds. These funds attracted $12.19 billion this week, a 32% increase from last month and extending a streak of nine consecutive weeks of inflows, according to LSEG Lipper data. Related News: Founder of Facebook's Former Cryptocurrency Project Diem Reveals Why the Project Was Actually Shut Down - Serious Allegations Ahead of Powell’s speech, the market’s attention is focused on upcoming U.S. labor market data. Strong nonfarm payrolls could signal continued resilience in the labor market, dampening expectations for aggressive rate cuts. Additional data points, such as the October job openings report and the November ADP employment report, are expected to provide more insight into employment trends. Analysts are weighing the Fed’s next moves in light of improving economic conditions. The Fed is increasingly assessing how much easing is necessary for the economy and the labor market, said Sameer Samana, senior strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. *This is not investment advice.

Originally slated for January 2025, the controversial tax will now take effect in 2027, following a compromise with the ruling People’s Power Party (PPP). Park Chan-dae, the floor leader of the KDP, confirmed the decision during a press conference on December 1. This delay marks the third time South Korea has pushed back the implementation of its digital asset capital gains tax, reflecting ongoing debates over its timing and impact. Heated Debate Over Timing and Impact The crypto gains tax, first proposed in 2021, has faced multiple delays due to mounting concerns from investors and industry stakeholders. Initially scheduled for 2023, the tax was postponed to 2025 , and now 2027. The PPP, South Korea’s ruling party, had even suggested extending the grace period to 2028, arguing that premature taxation could drive investors out of the market. In the lead-up to this decision, the KDP strongly opposed any further delays. As recently as November 20, the party criticized the PPP’s proposal as a political maneuver, accusing them of pandering to voters ahead of future elections. Instead of deferring the tax, the KDP suggested raising the taxable gains threshold from $1,800 to $36,000, aiming to shield smaller investors while targeting larger players. However, under mounting political pressure and in the spirit of compromise, the KDP has now aligned with the government’s recommendation for a two-year delay. What This Means for Investors Once implemented, South Korea’s crypto gains tax will impose a 20% levy on digital asset profits exceeding the taxable threshold. The tax’s initial intent was to create a fairer financial ecosystem while generating revenue from a rapidly growing industry. However, its repeated postponements highlight the challenges governments face in regulating emerging markets. The decision to delay the taxation has been welcomed by many in the crypto community, as it allows more time for the industry to mature. Yet, critics warn that such deferrals could create uncertainty and hinder long-term policy planning. As South Korea grapples with balancing investor protection and market growth, the extended timeline may provide an opportunity for clearer regulations. For now, crypto investors in the country can breathe a sigh of relief—at least until 2027.

Chainlink is gaining momentum with a potential price breakout toward $50, while AAVE remains a solid pick for decentralised finance enthusiasts. Meanwhile, Qubetics , a rising star in the Web3 ecosystem, has raised over $3.8 million in its presale and is poised to disrupt the blockchain landscape with its revolutionary QubeQode IDE. If you’re searching for the best cryptos to buy today, these three are worth your attention. But what makes these projects so compelling? Let’s dive into their unique offerings and explore why they’re capturing the interest of investors and analysts alike. Qubetics: A Game-Changer for Blockchain Usability and Scalability Blockchain technology has been around for over a decade, yet its complexity remains a barrier for many. Enter Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator, which aims to simplify blockchain development and adoption. At the heart of Qubetics is the QubeQode IDE, an innovative tool designed to make blockchain programming accessible to businesses, developers, and everyday users. One of the biggest hurdles in blockchain adoption is its lack of user-friendly tools. Developers often grapple with unintuitive interfaces and the steep learning curve of programming for decentralised systems. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE solves this problem by providing a seamless, easy-to-use platform for creating and deploying smart contracts. Imagine a small business owner who wants to implement blockchain for supply chain tracking. Instead of hiring expensive developers or navigating complex coding, they can use QubeQode IDE to set up a secure and efficient system in hours, not weeks. Scalability is another major issue in blockchain. Many platforms struggle with limited transaction processing capacity, leading to congestion and high fees. Qubetics addresses this by enabling seamless integration with existing blockchain networks, allowing businesses to scale operations without sacrificing performance. For instance, think about an NFT marketplace experiencing rapid growth. Qubetics’ tools ensure that such platforms can handle increased traffic without crashing or slowing down. Impressive Presale Numbers and Predictions Qubetics is currently in the 10th phase of its presale, having already sold over 239 million tokens to more than 5000 holders, raising a staggering $3.8 million. With tokens priced at just $0.025, early investors are eyeing significant returns. Analysts predict that Qubetics’ token price could climb to $0.10 within months of its mainnet launch, offering an impressive 4x return for presale participants. Consider this: if you invest $10,000 now, you could own 400,000 $TICS tokens. When the price hits $0.10, your investment could grow to $40,000. With the presale ending soon and prices set to increase by 10% in the next phase, now is the time to act. Chainlink: The Backbone of Smart Contracts As blockchain technology evolves, the need for reliable and secure data feeds has never been greater. This is where Chainlink shines. Known as the go-to oracle network, Chainlink bridges the gap between blockchain and real-world data, enabling smart contracts to function seamlessly. Chainlink’s recent performance has been nothing short of stellar. The token’s price has been steadily climbing, with analysts projecting a breakout toward $50 in the near term. According to a recent analysis on Coinpedia, the growing adoption of decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi platforms has driven demand for Chainlink’s services. This surge in utility is expected to propel its price to new heights. AAVE: A DeFi Pioneer with a Bright Future In the world of decentralised finance (DeFi), few names carry as much weight as AAVE. This platform revolutionised the lending and borrowing sector by allowing users to earn interest on their crypto assets or take out loans without traditional intermediaries. AAVE’s unique selling point lies in its versatility. Unlike traditional financial systems, AAVE enables users to deposit various cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools and earn interest in return. Borrowers can use these pools to secure loans, all while maintaining complete control over their assets. This peer-to-peer model eliminates the need for banks, offering a decentralised alternative that’s both efficient and secure. Imagine a freelance graphic designer looking to fund a new project. Instead of going through the hassle of securing a bank loan, they can use AAVE to borrow funds against their crypto holdings. This flexibility makes AAVE an attractive option for both individuals and businesses. Conclusion: Which Crypto Should You Buy Today? Choosing the best cryptos to buy today ultimately depends on your investment goals and risk tolerance. If you’re looking for a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, Qubetics offers unparalleled potential with its groundbreaking QubeQode IDE and impressive presale performance. Chainlink, on the other hand, is a safer bet for those seeking long-term stability and utility, thanks to its critical role in powering smart contracts. Finally, AAVE remains a top pick for DeFi enthusiasts, offering a decentralised alternative to traditional financial systems. All three projects have unique strengths and are poised for significant growth. But if you want to capitalise on early-stage innovation and maximise your returns, Qubetics stands out as the clear winner. Don’t miss the chance to join over 4,600 investors who have already recognised its potential. Head over to Qubetics’ presale page today and secure your $TICS tokens before prices increase this weekend. The future of blockchain is here—and you don’t want to be left behind.

Martinez tells his 91,000 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE has just given a bearish sell signal on the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential indicator on the weekly chart. The TD Sequential indicator flashes buy and sell signals based on the closing prices of a given time period, and in this case, nine weeks. However, Martinez notes that the indicator gave off the exact same bearish signal in both 2017 and 2020 right before massive rallies to new cycle highs and beyond. “DOGE is going to test your patience in this parabolic run! Just like in 2017 and 2020, we got a sell signal from TD, anticipating a brief correction before the bull rally continued.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez’s chart suggests that DOGE is in a large ascending channel that could push the memecoin to $14 if it reaches the upper bound of the pattern once again. At time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.42. Turning to Bitcoin, Martinez remains bullish on BTC despite many market participants calling for a correction after its sizeable multi-week rally near $100,000. Looking at social media metrics that track mentions of “pullback” and “100K,” Martinez says that the price may move in the opposite direction of the predominant market sentiment. “Everyone’s anticipating a pullback after Bitcoin reclaimed $95,000 – just look at how often it’s mentioned. But markets often move against the crowd’s expectations. Don’t be surprised if BTC pushes even higher!” Source: Ali Martinez/X The analyst also backs up his bullish stance by noting the average mining cost of Bitcoin, which refers to how much it costs miners to earn one BTC. “Seeing lots of chatter about Bitcoin BTC dipping below $90,000. Keep in mind that the average mining cost is $90,524. Historically, during a bull run, BTC has never fallen below its mining cost.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,523.

However, the meme coin’s performance has somewhat slowed down in the past week, struggling to make a play for the psychological $0.45 level. However, a popular analyst on the X platform has said that the price of Dogecoin won’t be in consolidation, with a bullish breakout on the horizon. In fact, the meme token is being touted to outperform Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Here’s How Dogecoin Might Outperform Bitcoin In a recent post on the X platform, prominent analyst Ali Martinez put forward a bullish prognosis for the price of Dogecoin against the Bitcoin price over the coming months. According to the pundit, the meme coin is set to outperform the premier cryptocurrency by a whopping 2,400%. The rationale behind this projection is the formation of a bull flag pattern on the Dogecoin price chart on the monthly timeframe. A bull flag pattern is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a period of steep upward price movement (the flagpole) and a short period of consolidation or slight downward trend (the flag). Typically, the bull flag formation serves as a strong continuation signal for an upward price trend. Nonetheless, a price breakout from the flag (or the consolidation range) is a prerequisite to confirming the continuation of the uptrend. As observed in the chart above, the price of Dogecoin against Bitcoin has been moving mostly sideways since 2021. However, DOGE/BTC appears to be breaking out of the consolidation range at the moment, suggesting the continuation of the current market trend. According to Martinez, if the price of Dogecoin against BTC successfully breaks the upper boundary of the flag, it might be ready to soar by more than 2,400%. The target of this projection was calculated using the initial flagpole as a template, as the breakout usually replicates its length. Ultimately, this would push the value of DOGE against BTC from the current level of 0.0000043 to an unprecedented 0.00009375. A Dogecoin rally this huge would also support the numerous predictions of an altcoin season before the end of the current cycle. DOGE Price At A Glance As of this writing, Dogecoin is valued at $0.4246, reflecting a mere 1.2% increase in the past 24 hours. The price performance of the meme coin is not any less insignificant on the weekly timeframe. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of DOGE is down by 1.7% in the last seven days. The meme token ranks as the seventh-largest asset in the sector, with a market capitalization of $62 billion.

Of course, there are some exceptions to this, including the new Hyperliquid token that is doing rounds, so let’s dive deeper. Bitcoin Price Flat Around $97K During the past day, Bitcoin failed to note any considerable movements and is trading at a slight increase of around 0.4%. For the most part, it traded below $97,000 and was even close to falling below $96,000 at one point, but the bulls were quick to stop the assault and prevented further declines, as seen in the chart below. Source: TradingView All eyes are still on Bitcoin, though, as the entire industry expects it to break above $100,000. However, at the same time, its dominance – the metric that tracks BTC’s share relative to that of the rest of the industry, has been dwindling lately. It declined by more than 3% during the past seven days, which is a clear sign that altcoins are popping and are gaining more ground. One clear example of that is the new token that was airdropped a couple of days ago – Hyperliquide (HYPE). HYPE Leads Altcoin Gains Hyperliquid (HYPE) is trading at above $9, achieving a total market capitalization of upwards of $3 billion in the first couple of days since it was airdropped to users. This is nothing short of impressive, and it’s the best-performing cryptocurrency from the top 100 following its airdrop. Another runner today is the meme coin Brett (BRETT) and Hedera’s HBAR, both of which have gained more than 20% in the past 24 hours. Source: Quantify Crypto Meanwhile, the majority of the large-cap cryptocurrencies such as SOL, ETH, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, XRP, and so forth, are trading relatively flat during the past day, charting differences in the range between -2% and +2%.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 10:51:57

Floor leader, Rep. Park Chan-dae, disclosed the postponement agreement in a press conference. The decision marks a turnaround, given that the party had earlier kicked against the moratorium, calling for the immediate implementation of the tax as planned. However, the KDP has now changed its tune, making it more likely that the moratorium will now be implemented. The tax regime that would have imposed a 20% tax on virtual assets’ capital gains was meant to become effective by January 2025. Park Chan-dae said : “We have decided to agree to a two-year moratorium on the implementation of cryptocurrency taxation proposed by the government and ruling party.” With this agreement, one of the key tax issues that has caused disagreements between the ruling People Power Party (PPP) and the opposition KDP has now been resolved. The disagreements had earlier led to the failure to convene the plenary session for the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee. South Korean crypto tax regime delayed for the third time With the KDP now agreeing to the moratorium, the virtual asset tax regime will likely not go into effect until 2027. This aligns with the government’s desire, although it falls short of the ruling PPP’s request for a grace period of 3 years. This latest delay means that the tax has been postponed three times since 2021 and will not be implemented for at least six years since it was first considered. In 2021, the government attempted to implement crypto taxes, but disagreements with opposition parties pushed the discussion until 2023. The delays are a welcome development for crypto investors and highlight the South Korean government’s pro-crypto approach. The ruling party insisted on the delay because it believed that a quick implementation of crypto taxes could harm the country and force investors to flee. South Korea is the leading country in crypto adoption in East Asia, ranking 19th globally in grassroots adoption, according to Chainalysis . It is also the largest in cryptocurrency value received, with $130 billion, and its transaction share continues to rise. Other tax issues remain unresolved Meanwhile, there are still pending issues that might delay the implementation of the tax amendments. The KPD chair, Rep. Lee Jae-Myung, said his party will oppose the government’s proposal to reduce the inheritance and gift tax rate to 40% while increasing child deduction for inheritance tax from 50 million won to 500 million won. However, the KDP has agreed to several other amendments, including scrapping financial investment income tax. The government has sought to remove the tax on stock dividends for investors, but the KPD initially opposed the bill before eventually agreeing to it last month. At the time, the KDP chair said he could not continue to ignore the 15 million investors who were against the tax, given the difficult stock market. The South Korean stock market and its currency have been among the worst performers this year. Only the Japanese yen performed worse than the Korean won among the 40 major economies. Still, it remains to be seen whether the KDP’s proposal to increase the threshold for crypto capital gains tax from 2.5 million won ($1,800) to 50 million won ($36,000) will be retained. The KDP proposed a time when it was opposing the moratorium and argued that implementing that effectively abolishes crypto tax because it only means that only the major investors and not the small low-income investors will pay taxes on their crypto gains.

Table of Contents DOGEN: The next big meme coin opportunity What Makes DOGEN Different? DOGEN’s bold path forward: A visionary roadmap for the future Conclusion Success in crypto often takes an unpredictable path, arriving from the most unexpected corners of culture. This time, it came from TikTok’s viral meme – Just a Chill Guy. No drama, no hype, just a laid-back, relatable character created by artist Phillip Banks. This easygoing figure, who stays chill despite life’s challenges big or small, resonated deeply with a Gen Z audience on TikTok. As a result, the CHILLGUY meme coin has skyrocketed, surging from a modest $10 million market cap to nearly $500 million in just a few days after its launch, turning heads across the crypto world. The star of this story was a lucky trader who invested $1,000 in CHILLGUY during its token launchpad phase. Riding the coin’s meteoric rise, the trader made a savvy move by selling their holdings at the peak of the frenzy, resulting in a mind-blowing profit of $1 million in less than a week. This story underscores a golden rule in crypto trading: timing is everything. This trader’s ability to seize the moment turned a modest investment into life-changing wealth. You might also like: Top trader claims XRP will never drop below $1 again as Cardano and Dogen eye big gains DOGEN: The next big meme coin opportunity If stories like CHILLGUY inspire you, then it’s time to pay attention to the next potential breakout in the meme coin space: DOGEN . Currently in its presale stage, DOGEN is already generating buzz as the next big player in the meme coin ecosystem. While CHILLGUY captured attention with its chill, stress-free, and laid-back nature, DOGEN is all about boldness, ambition, and unapologetic success. Dogen’s origin merges the internet’s beloved Swole Doge with the daring crypto “Degen” culture, symbolizing strength, confidence, and a fearless approach to risks. As a bold figure in the crypto world, Dogen embodies the spirit of high-stakes investing, where courage and quick thinking reign supreme. Dogen is a representation of a new crypto era, where confidence and audacity drive the biggest wins. For those who dare to follow, Dogen offers the spirit of boldness and belief in a world where only the fearless rise to the top. At a low price of $0.0009 during presale Stage 7, DOGEN is projected to surge by 500% before the presale even ends. For investors who recognize potential early, this is the kind of opportunity that could turn small investments into life-changing gains. Here’s a glimpse of DOGEN’s potential: A $100 investment at the first presale stage price of $0.0003 would have yielded 333,333 tokens. By the final presale stage, when the price hits $0.0019, that investment would grow to $633.33, delivering a 533.33% return. The message is clear: early adoption pays off, and DOGEN offers a golden opportunity to get in before the rocket takes off. What Makes DOGEN Different? While many meme coins are fleeting, DOGEN is built for longevity. The backbone of DOGEN is its strong and engaged community—an energetic group of investors ready to seize the next big opportunity. With over $2,00,000 already raised, DOGEN has proven its appeal among crypto enthusiasts. Adding to its allure is DOGEN’s unique multi-level referral program, which rewards community participation: 7% in USDT from direct referrals 2% from second-tier referrals 1% from third-tier referrals In addition to the referral program, DOGEN’s Golden Points airdrop initiative adds another layer of rewards for active investors. The more DOGEN an investor buys, the more Golden Points they accumulate, directly increasing their share in future airdrops. For example, buying $10–$250 worth of DOGEN yields a 6% Golden Points boost, while purchases over $10,000 earn a 12% boost. This program extends to referral-based purchases as well, meaning investors can further amplify their rewards as their network grows. DOGEN’s bold path forward: A visionary roadmap for the future DOGEN doesn’t entirely rely on hype, it is building an ecosystem that is set to last. The journey starts with DogenTap v1, a Telegram app that connects the community like never before. Staking options will let holders grow their earnings, while a powerful marketing liftoff puts DOGEN in the spotlight. Next up? DEX and CEX launches will take DOGEN mainstream, making it more accessible than ever. Then comes DogenTap v2, introducing PvP battles and clans to amp up the excitement, while DogTournaments bring competitive action and rewards to the community. It’s not just a token; it’s an experience! Then comes the AIRDROP phase, where DOGEN levels up again with DogenTap v3—seasonal events, NFTs, and the game-changing DogenWallet Telegram App. Where other tokens fizzle out, DOGEN keeps delivering with utility, innovation, and a roadmap designed for explosive growth. Don’t just watch the change—be part of it! DOGEN is here to dominate, and this is the chance to get in early. Conclusion The incredible story of CHILLGUY shows what’s possible in the meme coin market with a small bet and the right timing. Now, DOGEN is offering its own chance at life-changing gains, with a roadmap and community that promise long-term success.

Bitcoin Price Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart The daily chart demonstrates a clear picture of the last 9 months of Bitcoin’s price action, where the market has been consolidating until the beginning of this November. Yet, following the price’s stabilization above the 200-day moving average, which is currently located around the $68K mark, the market began to rally aggressively and create new all-time highs daily. Meanwhile, the price experienced a pullback a few days ago, just before reaching the $100K mark. However, the $90K support level has pushed the price back higher, and Bitcoin could finally reach the $100K level in the next few days. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart offers a clearer picture of the recent price action. The price has been gradually correcting since a rejection from the $99K level, but a V-shaped recovery at the $90K support zone has seemingly ended this correction. As a result, the market is now climbing toward the $100K level again, and it could only be a matter of time before a 6-figure BTC price is witnessed. Source: TradingView On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Active Addresses (100-day Moving Average) Bitcoin’s network is built on the activity of peers, which is observable because the blockchain system is transparent. Higher network activity can lead to higher BTC prices, as it has before. This chart presents the Bitcoin active addresses metric, which counts the number of addresses sending and receiving BTC. The number of active addresses has been rising recently as the price is making new record highs. Yet, it is still much lower than what it was earlier in 2024, when BTC was trading around $40K. Therefore, even higher Bitcoin prices could be expected in the coming months if network activity continues to rise.

The regulator claims the company raised nearly $95 million under false pretenses, marking another high-profile case of alleged misconduct in the cryptocurrency sector. According to a statement released on November 29, the SEC alleges that Touzi Capital misled investors by portraying its crypto asset mining fund as a stable, high-yield opportunity comparable to money market accounts. Instead, funds were reportedly misused across unrelated ventures, leaving investors exposed to substantial risks. Misleading Claims The SEC’s complaint paints a grim picture of the alleged scheme. Investors were led to believe their contributions would support crypto mining operations, but Touzi Capital allegedly “commingled” the funds with those of its subsidiaries. The SEC claims that much of the money was diverted to projects entirely unrelated to crypto mining, with investors kept in the dark about the true nature of the fund’s activities. Despite mounting issues, Touzi Capital continued soliciting new investors even as its projects began to fail. The SEC alleges that the fund’s assets were not only illiquid but also far riskier than portrayed in promotional materials. By downplaying these risks, the company is accused of violating securities laws and undermining investor trust. This case underscores the ongoing challenges regulators face in curbing fraudulent activity within the crypto industry, as firms exploit the hype surrounding digital assets to attract unsuspecting investors. Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation The SEC’s legal action against Touzi Capital comes amid heightened scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. This case adds to a growing list of enforcement actions aimed at holding bad actors accountable , but some industry insiders believe a political shift could reshape the regulatory landscape. Joe Lubin, CEO of Consensys, suggested in a recent interview at DevCon 2024 that many SEC cases against crypto firms might be dismissed if Donald Trump is reelected as U.S. president. Lubin predicts a more lenient regulatory approach could save the industry millions in legal fees and create an environment for innovation.

While the price is poised to challenge the $4K resistance soon, periodic consolidations within the $3.5K to $4K range are likely as the market digests recent gains. Ethereum Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum’s upward trajectory has faced a pause after an impressive surge above the $3.5K resistance level. This breakout was a significant milestone, but the subsequent loss of bullish momentum led to a consolidation period, returning to the $3.5K mark. This pullback has triggered renewed buying interest, leading to a slight rebound that demonstrates the market’s intention to sustain its upward movement. However, the bearish divergence in the RSI indicator suggests a weakening bullish momentum. It indicates that Ethereum might face a mid-term consolidation correction phase before resuming its climb. As the price progresses toward the $4K psychological resistance, periods of reduced volatility and retracements are expected. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart During the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum’s bullish strength remains evident, with its breakout above the ascending wedge pattern and the critical $3.5K resistance level. The price’s pullback to this region and subsequent rebound confirm the continuation of the uptrend toward the $4K mark in the mid-term. However, the bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator on the 4-hour chart suggests increasing seller activity and waning bullish momentum. This scenario implies that while the price will likely move toward the $4K mark, it may face periods of sideways trading and minor corrections within the $3.5K-$4K range. Such movements would allow the market to consolidate before another impulsive move. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis By Shayan Ethereum’s price has rebounded at the critical $3.5K support level, maintaining its bullish trajectory. However, while price action indicates potential upward movement, the futures market metrics reveal an alarming divergence that could significantly influence market dynamics. The open interest metric, which tracks the total number of open perpetual futures positions across all exchanges, has reached a new all-time high. This spike suggests unprecedented speculative activity in Ethereum’s derivatives market. Interestingly, this surge in open interest is occurring without a corresponding new all-time high in Ethereum’s price. This divergence raises concerns of increased volatility and substantial liquidation cascades. If the price faces a sudden downturn or consolidation, the overleveraged positions in the Futures market could trigger a wave of forced liquidations, leading to rapid price declines.

According to the authorities, the suspect, Finbar Hughes, is wanted on several charges, including possession of materials to commit arson and setting fire to a dwelling. The police noted that Hughes may have decided to set the house on fire after failing to extort Bitcoin from its residents. The Calgary police were alerted to a fire incident at a dwelling around 3 AM on the morning of November 19. After several attempts, the fire service successfully extinguished the fire, leaving the house with minimal damage. The fire happened after residents in the area reported receiving threatening letters on their doorsteps, asking them to transfer Bitcoin to a wallet address. The authorities also noted that there had been reports of fire incidents around Edmonton. However, they have yet to find any connection between both incidents. Calgary police urge the public to help find Finbar Hughes According to an official statement, the police have enjoined the public to help them find Hughes, noting they had exhausted all options at the time of the publication on Saturday. The police said that anybody with details of his whereabouts should come to the local station, or call them. This is not the first arson crime that occurred in the region this year. Police arrested and charged 40-year-old Gavin Peter Robinson for arson and disregard for human life in October. Although the police said the motive for the act was unknown at the time, they will add subsequent charges as the investigation proceeds. Robinson was said to have used an accelerant to set fire to his home, causing a huge explosion. The fire affected four other homes, rendering them unlivable and displacing their occupants. According to his neighbor Gladys, Robinson lived with his partner and dog. Gladys said the fire was intentional, noting that she was away with her family when it happened. Gladys and the other neighbors who have lost their house to the fire have called for justice, asking the police to speed up Robinson’s prosecution. Bitcoin threat epitomizes dangers in the crypto sector This is not the first time Bitcoin and other digital assets have been demanded with threats of physical harm. While the Calgary police are continuing their investigations to tie the fires to the Bitcoin threat, it has become normal for bad actors to carry out vicious acts like this. According to a Chainalysis report , crypto ransomware rose in the first half of 2024. The report revealed an increase of $10.7 million in ransomware inflows from 2023, noting that the 2024 figure, $459.8 million, is well on course to smash the record for the highest-grossing ransomware year. The year also saw the largest ransomware payment, the $75 million received by the Dark Angels group. However, ransomware payments decreased by 27% over the same time frame. Threats for Bitcoin and ransomware are not the only bad acts in the crypto sector as other illegal activities remain. It is left for the market to remain vigilant and users to safeguard their assets in the best way possible. Bitcoin and other digital assets will only become more attractive to criminals as they continue on their sustained upward momentum.

XRP zoomed nearly 10% in a 24-period from Friday to Saturday, reaching a local high of $1.92 to set prices previously seen in January 2018, when it briefly touched an all-time high above $3.40. The surge brought 7-day gains to 30%, outperforming bitcoin (BTC) and other majors, while 30-day gains stand at nearly 300%, data from CoinGecko show. Saturday’s move came following a Fox Business report that the New York Department of Financial Services had indicated to payments firm Ripple — closely related to XRP — about approving the company’s RLUSD stablecoin. Ripple will be allowed to legally offer the RLUSD token to the public if approved, with a possible launch date of Dec. 4 Several fundamental and regulatory developments have pushed the XRP price in the past weeks, with bulls now eyeing the $2 mark in a sign of renewed strength for the previously embattled token. The rise started in early November after Republican victories in the U.S. elections renewed investor confidence in tokens with links to U.S. companies, such as XRP's closely related Ripple Labs. Some traders also expect an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., especially those anticipating a more lenient regulatory environment.

The indicator shows that the number of traders betting on the price drop has increased. Consequently, high price volatility would be expected for the asset since any movements could potentially trigger increased liquidations. Data from the market intelligence platform shows positive social sentiment and discussions around the blockchain have significantly increased over the last 30 days. This could raise the fear of missing out among investors. Most notably, price rallies that emerge on the back of FOMO (fear of missing out) tend to be highly volatile due to the lack of major catalysts. Theta Network was co-founded by Mitch Liu and Jieyi Long in 2017. Liu is a veteran in the video and gaming industries, who previously founded startups like Tapjoy and Gameview Studios. IronSource purchased Tapjoy for $400 million. Long is a specialist in blockchain, virtual reality and live-streaming.

The latest move pushes the tax’s implementation to 2027, marking a significant shift in the country’s stance on digital asset taxation, allowing the market additional time to adapt. “After extensive discussions, we concluded that additional institutional arrangements are necessary for the virtual asset taxation,” DPK floor leader Rep. Park Chan-dae said during the press meeting at the National Assembly. “We have agreed to defer taxation for two years.” Park also noted that the decision was made after a ‘prolonged deliberation, debate, and political judgment.’ This decision comes after months of disagreement between the ruling PPP and the KDP. While the PPP supported a three-year grace period, the KDP had previously pushed for implementing the tax in 2025 and had accused the ruling party of using delays as a political strategy regarding South Korea crypto tax policies. South Korea’s Journey In Crypto Taxes South Korea’s journey toward taxing cryptocurrency gains began in 2021 when the government proposed a 20% tax on digital asset profits exceeding $1,800 annually. However, criticisms from investors and industry stakeholders led to repeated delays. Notably, the South Korea crypto tax’s implementation was initially pushed to 2023, then to 2025, and now to 2027. The current tax framework charges taxes on gains exceeding 2.5 million won, whereas stock trading profits are taxed only above 50 million won, a disparity that has been heavily criticised. Government’s Plans To Impose Crypto Taxes Beginning next year, the government had planned to impose a 22 percent tax, including local taxes, on annual income exceeding 2.5 million won ($1,790) from virtual asset investments. Although the policy had already been postponed twice, the DPK initially intended to implement the taxation plan by raising the tax exemption threshold to 50 million won. However, the widespread criticism from the increasing number of crypto investors and opposition from the ruling People Power Party (PPP) led the party to agree to a further postponement. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Regulations in South Korea 2024 , South Korea Remains Key Player In Global Market South Korea remains a key player in the global crypto market .

According to Peter Brandt, Bitcoin bull cycles have significantly ‘degenerated in magnitude’ over time, noting that Gen Z and millennials may have set their expectations regarding digital currency too high, he said in an X post on December 1. “Bitcoin bull cycles have exponentially degenerated in magnitude. BTC is likely to remain a great hedge vs. fiat busts. But, the bloom is off the rose. Gen M & Zers who view BTC as the road to financial glory are likely to be very disappointed,” he said. To back this assessment, Brandt shared data mapping Bitcoin’s historical price surges, from a 483-fold rise in 2010-2011 to a much more subdued 6.4-fold advance between November 2022 and November 2024. History of Bitcoin parabolic advances. Source: Factor LLC While Bitcoin has far outpaced traditional investments like the Dow Jones, gold , and even technology giants like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) over decades, Brandt suggested the cryptocurrency’s days of explosive growth are fading. Despite this, he remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s properties, saying it remains an ideal hedge against fiat currency devaluation. What next for Bitcoin His warning comes as the market anticipates Bitcoin reaching the $100,000 mark, with some proponents maintaining that the asset has the potential to rally to $1 million. To this end, MicroStrategy’s (NASDAQ: MSTR ) executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has projected that Bitcoin might trade as high as $13 million by 2045—a prediction author and investor Robert Kiyosaki endorsed . In the same vein, Kiyosaki warned that once Bitcoin hits the $100,000 mark, investors should expect a shift in ownership. As reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki believes ownership will be dominated by the ultra-rich, potentially locking young investors out. Indeed, some key drivers are seen as favorable for Bitcoin, including the possibility of the United States incorporating the cryptocurrency into its strategic reserves and implementing crypto-friendly regulations .

While Bitcoin’s growth is slowing, its possible role as a hedge against fiat and potential for future rallies keep it a key focus. However, investors need to monitor the tempered expectations by analysts.

Despite this loss, market sentiments on premier cryptocurrency remain highly bullish amidst a 61% price gain that stretches to early October. However, Bitcoin’s impressive ascent to new points over the past few weeks has resulted in potentially bearish market developments. Bitcoin Realized Price Up ‘Only’ $37,000 Amidst Charge To $100,000 In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with username Grizzly shared an intriguing insight on Bitcoin’s realized price following the asset’s recent price surge. According to Grizzly, as Bitcoin moved from $60,000 to almost $100,000 in the past two months, its realized price only rose from $31,000-$32,000 to $37,000 indicating a widening gap between both values which produces multiple implications. For context, realized price means the average price at which all Bitcoin in circulation was purchased, effectively representing the aggregate cost basis of all holders. It is often applied in investor behavior analysis as well as identifying market cycles. A rise in realized price is generally a positive development which indicates heightened capital inflows as new investors are purchasing Bitcoin at elevated price levels. Furthermore, an increased realized price also signals a reduced selling pressure from long-term holders despite significant price gains which is a strong representation of market confidence. However, Grizzly explains that a widening gap between market price and realized price as presently seen traditionally signals short-term overheating that indicates an unsustainable price growth driven by speculation with no underlying fundamentals. Albeit, the analyst also highlights that historical data has shown Bitcoin to witness similar widening gaps in previous bull seasons with sustained price growth. This phenomenon can be attributed to the rapid price appreciation recorded in a typical bull run. Therefore, the current widening gap between Bitcoin’s realized price and market price may likely bear no influence on the asset’s present bullish trajectory. BTC Records Largest Exchange Withdrawal In Two Years In other news, the crypto community has now experienced the highest outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges since December 2022. According to the team at CryptoOnChain , this development strongly signifies that BTC’s bullish rally has much room to run. At press time, the crypto market leader is valued at $96,468 following a 0.08% decline in the past day. However, Bitcoin remains in profit on larger time frames as evidenced by a 38.22% gain in the past thirty days. With a market cap of $1.91 trillion, the premier cryptocurrency remains the largest digital asset accounting for 55.9% of the total crypto market.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin exchange outflow|Bitcoin Realized Price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-01 12:00:11

This significant reduction in circulating supply has ignited optimism among investors, especially with the Shiba Inu price currently trading at yearly highs. Shiba Inu Weekly Burn Reaches New Highs Shibburn, the official platform tracking SHIB token burns, revealed on social media platform X a 7,418% spike in SHIB’s weekly burn rate during the week leading up to November 30 . This sharp rise resulted in the removal of approximately 1.937 billion SHIB tokens from circulation, a significant milestone in the ongoing effort to reduce the token’s massive supply. Following this X post by Shibburn, the momentum of SHIB burns has only increased alongside the Shiba Inu price. At the time of writing, the total number of SHIB tokens burned over the past seven days has exceeded 2 billion, reaching an impressive 2.15 billion SHIB tokens. From this, 386.5 million of these tokens were burned within the last 24 hours alone. How Burn Mechanics Impact SHIB Price Token burns are a mechanism by which cryptocurrency supply is deliberately reduced, aiming to increase scarcity and, in turn, create upward pressure on the asset’s price. For Shiba Inu, which started with an enormous circulating supply, consistent and sizable burns are critical to its long-term valuation prospects. Shiba Inu was created with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, but SHIB burn endeavors have reduced the circulation by almost half. The latest Shiba Inu burn figures underscore the community’s dedication to this strategy, with over 2 billion tokens removed from circulation within a single week. At the time of writing, the total circulating supply of the meme coin is 589.26 trillion SHIB tokens. The aim has always been to burn a majority of the SHIB tokens created. According to Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama, this ambitious goal can be achieved . However, he did note that burning 99% of the total SHIB tokes created is also hard for a few reasons . Furthermore, he noted that burns are not the only way SHIB wins. There is the need to give the memecoin utility and ensure it gets to a point through viral distribution that people don’t want to burn the token anymore. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at $0.00003059, having increased by about 13% in the past 24 hours. Notably, the Shiba Inu reached an intraday high of $0.00003146, bringing it very close to setting a new price high in 2024.

Investors embraced a bullish optimism on pro-digital asset policies from the incoming Donald Trump administration, with the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) soaring since his presidential victory earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones on its way to $100,000. It feels like the days of Tulip Mania for Bitcoin are back as its price surpassed $98,800 to touch a new record on Nov 21 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced Chair Gary Gensler will step down effective Jan. 20, the day Donald Trump is scheduled to be sworn into the White House. The Bitcoin fever is hot and global once again.

Organized through the International Federation of American Football’s 75 national member federations, flag football recently became the official game of the NFL Pro Bowl and was confirmed as part of the 2028 Summer Olympics. Leading the charge is eleven-year NFL veteran and Super Bowl Champion Russell Okung, a prominent advocate for athletes’ financial sovereignty and the first professional athlete to receive his salary in Bitcoin. George Mekhail, Vice President of Operations at BTC Inc., commented on the topic: “ The flag football match at our Bitcoin event is no accident—it embodies the collaboration and resilience of the Bitcoin community. Russell Okung’s push to empower athletes with Bitcoin is a forward-thinking vision that moves us more into mainstream consciousness. We’re proud to host this mission at the Bitcoin Conference, bringing purpose and excitement to our attendees .” The star-studded lineup also includes over 22 football legends, such as Antonio Brown, Le’Veon Bell, Johnson Bademosi, Jurrell Casey, and Jared Evans. The roster further includes celebrated players such as Dez Bryant, Dontrelle Inman, Mohammad Sanu, Randell Johnson, Michael Thomas, Craig Robertson, and Wesley Woodyard, representing an array of talent from across the NFL. The Bitball Flag Football game will be part of the official lineup of side events at this year’s Bitcoin MENA 2024, December 9-10, 2024, the largest global gathering of Bitcoin investors, developers, and stakeholders. All Bitcoin MENA ticket holders will have free access to watch the Bitball Flagg Football match live on December 10 at the Al Nahyan Stadium in Abu Dhabi starting at 7 pm. Separate tickets for the event that blends sports, technology, and digital assets will be available for purchase at PlayBitBall, which will be distributed globally via live streaming on Bitcoin Magazine’s platform, Rumble, and YouTube, allowing global audiences to witness this unparalleled fusion of Bitcoin and professional football, that marks a cultural milestone for the UAE as well as the wider GCC region. Digital asset taxation Some good news for the Bitball Flagg Football players is that the United Arab Emirates has no income tax and has recently abolished value-added taxes on digital asset transactions. By exempting individuals and businesses from a VAT on the transfer and conversion of digital assets, the UAE has positioned itself as a potential hub for digital currencies (see Coincub Tax Report here ). So, the players will not be subject to double taxation on their digital asset income in the absence of a UAE and the US Income Tax Treaty. Nevertheless, the Bitball Flagg Football players will be subject to worldwide US taxation on their digital assets, which are treated as property and are subject to income tax or capital gains taxation. Digital assets taxed as income in the US The IRS provides guidelines on when digital assets count as income rather than a capital gain. Transactions that are viewed as additional income subject to income tax include: Getting paid in digital assets (such as the Bitball Flagg Football players). Mining digital assets (on a hobby level). Receiving an airdrop. Receiving new digital assets from a hard fork. Staking rewards. Referral bonuses. Earning interest through lending protocols. Earning new liquidity pool tokens, governance, or reward tokens on DeFi protocols. Learn to earn rewards. Watch to earn rewards. Browse to earn rewards. GameFi rewards. Digital asset taxation as an investment in the US Digital assets that are held as investments are subject to taxation at different tax rates. Short-term gains (held 1 year) at 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your taxable income and filing status. NFTs deemed collectibles may be taxed at 28%. Digital asset losses can offset gains and can reduce ordinary income by up to $3,000. Any unapplied losses can be carried forward to future tax years until they’re fully used. The IRS does not let digital asset investors claim lost or stolen crypto as a capital loss, so if a digital asset investor lost a digital asset due to a hack, scam, or loss of private keys—the investor is out of luck, and the best thing is simply to write it off. Digital asset tax breaks American digital asset investors can benefit from a few tax-free allowances that can help them pay a little less tax: Gifting digital assets under $18,000 : You can gift up to $18,000 in digital assets per person tax-free (for 2024). This is known as the annual gift tax exclusion. This can help you take advantage of lower Income Tax rates in your household and pay less tax overall. If you gift over this amount, provided you’re under the lifetime gift tax exemption of $13.61 million in 2024—you won’t need to pay gift tax. However, you may need to file Form 709 (more on this below). For 2025, this increases to $19,000 with a lifetime exemption of $13.99 million. Capital gains tax-free allowance : If you earned less than $47,026 in 2024 in total income (including your digital asset gains), you’ll pay no capital gains tax on long-term gains. For 2025, this increases to $48,350. Long-term capital gains tax rate : If you hold your crypto for more than a year, you’ll pay a lower long-term capital gains tax rate of between 0% and 20%, depending on how much you earn. How to report digital assets on tax returns A digital asset owner files digital asset taxes with their annual tax returns by answering the IRS’s digital asset transactions question. A variation of this seemingly innocuous question appears at the top of Forms 1040, Individual Income Tax Return; 1040-SR, US Tax Return for Seniors; and 1040-NR, US Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. The question was also added to these forms: Forms 1041, US Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts; 1065, US Return of Partnership Income; 1120, US Corporation Income Tax Return; and 1120S, US Income Tax Return for an S Corporation. The IRS asks this question with variations for corporations, partnerships, estates, and trusts: “At any time during the year, did you: (a) receive (as a reward, award or payment for property or services); or (b) sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?” Yes or No? The box indicates that they had digital asset tax reportable transactions. Report digital asset disposals, capital gains, and losses on Form Schedule D (1040) and Form 8949. Report digital asset income on Form Schedule 1 (1040) or Form Schedule C (1040). Report digital assets held in foreign exchanges, such as an exchange in the UAE on FATCA Form 8938 and FBAR FinCEN Form 114. Digital asset tax disclosure deadline The US tax year is from January 1 to December 31. Digital asset tax deadlines match traditional assets: April 15 for most individuals. If a digital asset investor is a US expat, then you have until June 15. If you filed for an extension to file your taxes using Free File or Form 4868, you’ll automatically have an extension until October 15. Can the IRS and state tax departments track my digital assets? Yes—both the IRS and state tax departments can track digital assets. The IRS has won cases against Coinbase, Kraken, and Poloniex, forcing them to share customer data, and the IRS has cross-border reach for tax evasion. This February, the IRS levied its first stand-alone crypto tax fraud case, which led to a guilty plea by Frank Richard Ahlgren III for filing a false tax return underreporting gains from selling $3.7 million in Bitcoin. USA v. Ahlgren was the first crypto case with tax evasion allegations unrelated to another crime; it is now also the first stand-alone crypto tax fraud case to result in a guilty plea. Ahlgren faces up to three years in prison. At the state level, billionaire Bitcoin bull and MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, who evaded more than $25 million in local income taxes from 2005 to 2022 through falsified records and statements, paid $40 million to settle a lawsuit alleging he committed massive local and state tax fraud by lying to authorities for years about where he lived. Ahlgren, Saylor, and the DOJ’s case against Roger Ver (also known as “Bitcoin Jesus”) underscore the IRS, State Tax Department, and DOJ’s commitment to prosecuting digital tax evasion. The IRS indicated earlier this year that its audit focus would be on digital assets and high-network individuals. In light of these developments, digital asset owners and investors may wish to reevaluate their tax reporting and filing obligations to ensure compliance.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 12:12:00

The platform had seen consistent growth in November, with revenues peaking during the fourth week of the month. From Nov. 18–24, Pump.fun generated $33.83 million in weekly revenue, according to DefiLlama. This marked a 60% increase compared to the previous week and an almost 400% surge from the start of November. However, the following week, Nov. 25 to Dec. 1, revenues dropped dramatically. DefiLlama data revealed a 66% decline to $11.31 million, reversing the prior growth trend. The revenue decline followed mounting community concerns over harmful actions being livestreamed by users attempting to boost their tokens’ popularity. Livestream Backlash On Nov. 25, Beau, safety project manager for Pudgy Penguins, reported a troubling incident where a livestreamer threatened suicide if their coin didn’t reach a specific market cap. Beau called on Pump.fun to intervene, urging the platform to disable its livestream feature and provide support to the individual. Other social media users reported similarly disturbing behavior. One user claimed a streamer threatened to harm a dog, while another alleged a threat of school violence. In response, Pump.fun disabled the livestream feature indefinitely. In a community note on Nov. 25, the platform acknowledged the concerns over the violent content and stated it had paused livestreams until proper moderation systems could be implemented. Industry Reactions Yuriy Brisov, a partner at Digital and Analogue Partners, called the incident “a legitimate reason for a criminal investigation and civil lawsuits.” Mikko Ohtamaa, co-founder of Trading Strategy, suggested Pump.fun might face swift police action or eventual regulatory shutdown as authorities assess the situation.

Analysts Predict 100% Surge by 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/ethereum-ready-for-a-massive-rally-analysts-predict-100-surge-by-2025/,"Ethereum (ETH) could be on the brink of a major price surge, with a potential 97% gain by the end of Q1 2025, according to insights from leading crypto analysts. The formation of a classic “cup and handle” pattern on Ether’s price chart is fueling this optimism, signaling a major breakout if critical resistance levels hold. Pseudonymous crypto analyst venturefounder highlighted in a November 30 post on X that Ethereum’s three-year technical pattern is nearing completion, with the $3,800 mark being a pivotal support level for confirmation. Ethereum Price Targets Venturefounder outlined a bullish trajectory for Ether, projecting three key price targets: $5,349, $6,457, and $7,238. Achieving the highest target would reflect a near-doubling of Ether’s current price, which stood at $3,690 at the time of writing. Despite a 47% rally since the beginning of November, Ether has yet to experience its anticipated “explosion,” the analyst noted. The delay is attributed to the resilience of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which has maintained strength in the 100-106 range. Historically, significant breakdowns in the DXY have often preceded major cryptocurrency price movements. Other crypto analysts have joined the conversation, with Titan of Crypto noting that the weekly Ichimoku Golden Cross—a key bullish indicator—has finally materialized. Titan forecasted a price target of $5,800 for Ether, while trader Wolf predicted an even more ambitious range of $9,000 to $10,000 by May 2025. Growing Interest in Spot Ether ETFs Adding to Ether’s bullish narrative, spot Ethereum ETFs recently hit a record daily inflow . On November 29, $332.9 million poured into nine-spot Ether ETFs, surpassing the previous high of $295.5 million set earlier in the month. This surge in inflows underscores growing institutional interest in Ethereum, aligning with the broader market’s optimism for the asset’s mid-term prospects. Pseudonymous trader Doctor Profit described prices below $4,000 as a “gift for the mid-term” in a December 1 post, encouraging investors to consider current levels as an entry point. As Ethereum approaches the critical $3,800 support, the coming weeks could determine whether the crypto asset achieves its ambitious price targets. The post Ethereum Ready for a Massive Rally?

With blockchain technology evolving rapidly, a few projects are standing out for their innovation and potential for massive returns. One such standout is Qubetics ($TICS) , which has introduced a cutting-edge decentralised VPN (dVPN) to tackle real-world privacy issues. Joining Qubetics on this list are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Polkadot (DOT)—each offering unique value and growth potential. Here’s why these five cryptos are worth your attention this month. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Privacy with Decentralised VPN Technology Qubetics is making waves with its game-changing decentralised VPN (dVPN). Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralised servers, Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a decentralised network, offering unparalleled privacy, security, and freedom for its users. In a world where surveillance and data breaches are rampant, this technology is a lifesaver for individuals and businesses alike. The Qubetics dVPN allows users to access the internet securely without fear of their data being tracked or misused. For freelancers working remotely or businesses handling sensitive information, this solution offers a layer of protection that centralised systems can’t match. Imagine accessing geo-restricted content, safeguarding financial transactions, or ensuring anonymity—all powered by blockchain technology. What’s more, Qubetics has seamlessly integrated its dVPN with its broader ecosystem, making it accessible to anyone holding $TICS tokens. This integration positions Qubetics as not just a tool but a comprehensive solution for online privacy in the Web3 era. Currently priced at just $0.025, $TICS is in its 10th presale stage, with analysts predicting valuations of $10-$15 post-mainnet launch. That’s a potential 58,213% ROI! For anyone seeking the best altcoins to buy in November 2024 , Qubetics is a no-brainer. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): The Crypto Market’s Bedrock Bitcoin remains the undisputed leader in the cryptocurrency market. As the first and most widely recognised digital currency, BTC serves as a store of value and an entry point for new investors. With institutional adoption on the rise and recent regulatory clarity, Bitcoin is poised for steady growth. As market sentiment shifts towards a bullish trend, Bitcoin continues to solidify its position as a safe and reliable investment. If you’re looking for long-term stability in a volatile market, Bitcoin’s history speaks for itself. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Powering the Decentralised Economy Ethereum has always been at the forefront of blockchain innovation, thanks to its smart contract functionality and thriving ecosystem of decentralised applications (dApps). Its transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0 has significantly improved scalability and energy efficiency, making it even more appealing to investors. With the rise of decentralised finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Ethereum’s role in the blockchain world remains indispensable. Its versatility and ongoing upgrades ensure it’s a must-have in any crypto portfolio. 4.

The nine products combined booked $332.9 million in net inflows during Friday's shortened trading session, data compiled by Farside Investors shows. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) led, attracting $250 million and $79 million in fresh funds, respectively. Friday was the fifth consecutive session with net inflows for the group, and concluded the second strongest week with $455 million in net inflows, per SoSoValue data . It was a shorter week as U.S. traditional markets were closed on Thanksgiving Thursday. Ether ETFs also outpaced flows into their spot bitcoin counterparts, which gathered $320 million inflows on Friday and suffered net outflows during the week. After falling out of investors' favor and lagging behind bitcoin in price action and ETF flows this year, ether has enjoyed a resurgence recently as Donald Trump's election victory rejuvenated interest in altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Along with strong ETF inflows, open interest for ETF futures on the institutional-focused Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surged to all-time records of almost $3 billion, per CoinGlass , underscoring the improving sentiment towards the asset.

Surging Metrics Show Otherwise Noting the strong ETF inflows, crypto trader Edward Morra called ETH ""the most obvious catch-up trade of this cycle,"" in a Saturday X post . While bitcoin spent the week consolidating below $100,000, ETH also showed relative strength against the largest crypto. ETH's price hit a five-month high above $3,700 on Saturday and outperformed BTC on both a weekly and monthly basis, although it's still lagging year-on-year, CoinDesk Indices data shows. It's possible that the ETH-BTC ratio is forming a major bottom after trending down for about three years, Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in a Friday note.

37090943,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620607,1733056344,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37090943.jpeg,Balaji Srinivasan proposes Zethereum to boost Ethereum privacy using ZK tech,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/zethereum-ethereum-privacy-using-zk-tech/,"Crypto entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan has proposed a concept to improve Ethereum privacy. In a post on X, Srinivasan termed the concept Zethereum, saying it would involve adding zero-knowledge (zk) technology to Ethereum smart contracts. According to Srinivasan, all it takes is for a pseudonymous engineer, whom he chose to call Zatoshi, to add private transactions and zk stack features to Ethereum as optional smart contracts. He believes a developer must have high-level OpSec knowledge to implement the changes. Srinivasan said : “Essentially it would be a way to ship much of Justin Drake’s impressive five year ZK roadmap in three months…except via smart contracts rather than the base layer. This would enable our hypothetical Zatoshi to move quickly and take more risk.” He believes that going this route is more efficient as it ensures that Ethereum could have privacy features within months instead of years. With the implementation, Zethereum could function like Tornado Cash, the crypto mixer that a recent US court ruling declared not illegal. However, the entrepreneur admitted that developing Zethereum could be risky even though the legal position on Tornado Cash has become more favorable. Thus, it is better for any developer working on such a project to do it anonymously. He observed that until Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev are pardoned, anyone building such technology will be taking a major risk with their freedom. Why build on Ethereum? Srinivasan discussed why he chose Ethereum for this idea and not any other blockchain network. According to him, Ethereum is the best option because the recent Tornado Cash ruling concerns an Ethereum smart contract. This ensures that anyone who builds Zethereum on Ethereum could directly rely on the ruling as a defense. He further noted that other chains do not have the qualities that make Ethereum ideal. Bitcoin, for instance, has an immutable base layer, and the community is more focused on “political innovation than technical innovation.” As for Zcash, which is a pioneer in ZK technology, he noted that it is not as popular as Ethereum. He said: “Zooko and his old team are of course the pioneers in zero knowledge. And Zcash arguably has already done much of this in terms of base-layer privacy. But Zcash doesn’t have the distribution of Ethereum.” Meanwhile, he said popular networks such as Solana and Base would have been good for such a protocol, but most of their developers are not anonymous, which could put them at risk given the current legal situation. However, he believes that any developer willing to build Zethereum on any network and improve internet freedom can still give it a shot. Crypto community reacts to proposal Srinivasan’s proposal has sparked several reactions. While everyone agrees on the importance of on-chain privacy, most people believe that several projects are focused on this problem and that the solution is not as simple as the former Coinbase CTO presents it. Pseudonymous Basedcrypto noted on X that Aztec Network, Penumbra, and Rift are just a few of the protocols building this vision. Aztec Network, a privacy-focused L2 on Ethereum, stole the most spotlight, with many stakeholders noting that it has been working on this issue for years. Aztec Labs CEO Zac Williamson also responded, noting that he has been working on the idea for seven years now, and it will take at least 70 developers to make it work rather than just one. He said: “I’ve been working on this exact thing for seven years and now the KOLs are clout farming with their microbrain ‘hot takes’ because privacy is the new meme narrative.” He went further to explain that the tech involved in making this work is extremely complex, with years of collaborative painstaking research and thousands of technical deployments by several protocols. According to him, this is why it has taken seven years to build the Aztec Network, and the mainnet will soon launch. However, Williamson noted that it is not necessary for developers working on the Zethereum concept to be anonymous, and Aztec Network has focused on programmability. He said: “This work does not need to be done anon. Privacy is a force for good and is not fundamentally hostile to the concept of protecting users. On the contrary, our programmability enables specific dapp developers to program in whatever checks they need for the jurisdiction they are targeting.” In his response, Srinivasan called on Aztec to launch its mainnet, noting that the community is looking forward to trying it. However, he acknowledged the technical difficulties and noted that he has supported several projects within the sector. Meanwhile, some believe there is no need for Zethereum at all. Pseudonymous user Naval believes Zcash is sufficient as a privacy network and works well because it uses proof of work. He noted that a programmable chain has more vulnerabilities and that it is best to separate chains for store value, programmability, and privacy.

37090887,https://finbold.com/?p=216102,1733056377,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Small-cap crypto dominates payments in this AI pay-per-use hub,https://finbold.com/small-cap-crypto-dominates-payments-in-this-ai-pay-per-use-hub/,"NanoGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) hub that exclusively takes crypto for payments to pay-per-use dozens of premium AI models. Finbold covered NanoGPT’s launch and growth while also reporting on its competitors like PayPerQ, a Bitcoin ( BTC )-first platform. On December 1, NanoGPT published a data breakdown of all its crypto payments from November in the different accepted cryptocurrencies. The AI hub looked at the transaction count and volume of each coin, revealing its users’ preferences and customers’ behavior. As promised in October we're releasing the payment stats for the different coins used on our website! We hope this can help other merchants decide what to prioritise in integrating, and we were quite interested ourselves to see what the stats would show. 🧵 pic.twitter.com/4iXBNTqwZA — Nano-GPT (@NanoGPTcom) December 1, 2024 What is NanoGPT’s AI hub and pay-per-use model Essentially, people can top up their NanoGPT accounts with 15 cryptocurrencies to pay-per-use more than 30 AI models (chat and image). Each prompt or query generates a payment, which is deduced from the pre-funded wallet. Among the AI models, customers can query OpenAI ’s o1, ChatGPT -4o, and Dall-E 3, Antrhopic ’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet , Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, Meta’s Llama 3.1 Large, xAI’s Grok 2 , Flux Pro, and others. The accepted crypto and blockchains for payments are Nano ( XNO ), Monero ( XMR ), Base, Polygon ( POL ), Optimism ( OP ), Arbitrum (ARB), Litecoin ( LTC ), Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), Solana ( SOL ), Circle USD ( USDC ), Dash ( DASH ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Banano ( BAN ), Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Tether USD ( USDT ). NanoGPT’s AI crypto payments breakdown Notably, Nano leads with a 77.8% and 51.35% dominance for crypto payments count and volume, respectively. The “OG” cryptocurrency is the AI hub’s favorite and has a 5% discount if chosen as the deposit method. “With many other coins, there are always fees and often waiting times,” Milan de Reede, NanoGPT’s creator, exclusively told Finbold . “Whereas with Nano, it just feels really good to send it and see it instantly confirmed without paying any fees.” Monero comes as the second most used crypto for payments in the AI platform despite being the most-recent addition. XMR has seen remarkable growth, which NanoGPT believes is due to its privacy-experience, aligned with the platform’s values and mission. Then, BTC is the third by volume, while BCH has this position by payment count and the fourth by volume. Interestingly, this reflects a user’s behavior depending on the crypto used, favoring higher or lower value per each payment made. NanoGPT’s percentage (left) and volume (right) of total transactions. Source: NanoGPT / Finbold Why is Nano (XNO) leading AI pay-per-use crypto payments? It is notable that, despite having a far lower market capitalization and overall penetration than the other cryptocurrencies, XNO dominates the users’ spending preferences in the AI pay-per-use platform. Talking to Finbold, de Reede explained that, besides Nano’s efficiency for payments, the small-cap crypto also has other notable qualities. “It’s probably a combination of [XNO] being the first coin that we supported, so it having spread widely in the Nano community,” he added. “The reason we like Nano so much despite its low market cap is that it’s quite unrivaled as a medium of exchange with zero fees and instant confirmations, but also that we think it fundamentally might be the strongest possible store of value. That is not recognized in the market cap at all right now, but Nano is fixed supply and has a game theory that actively incentivizes decentralization. We feel more confident about it than any other crypto.” – Milan de Reede, to Finbold Right now, Nano trades at $1.45, up 33.5% year-to-date despite a local top of $1.85 in March. Moreover, XNO surged by 97% from a local bottom of $0.736 in August, still below a $200 million capitalization. Nano (XNO) year-to-date price chart.

Market correction As Bitcoin ( BTC ) slumped below the $98,000 mark days after breaching $99,000, altcoins collapsed. The global crypto market cap dropped 2.3%, with liquidations hitting $494 million as of Nov. 25. The following day, liquidations had surged to a 24-hour peak of $553 million, with long liquidations dominating amid a BTC drop to $92,000. On-chain data confirmed that the pullback was due to profit-taking trades. Bitcoin ETFs began the week with a net outflow of $435 million, breaking a five-day inflow streak. These funds saw an additional $122 million net outflow before recouping $103 million on Nov. 27 and $320 million on Nov. 28. WLFI taps Sun as advisor Last week, TRON founder Justin Sun pumped an investment of $30 million into U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s floundering crypto project, World Liberty Financial. Shortly after, the project announced that Sun had joined its ranks as an advisor. Trump and his sons had been promoting its cryptocurrency for weeks, saying it would “make finance great again,” but the industry “largely rejected it,” according to Bloomberg . Sales plummeted so badly that Trump couldn’t secure a payout. On Nov. 25, Sun’s investment pushed the project over the threshold, and the Trumps are expected to collect at least $15 million from the Tron entrepreneur’s coin purchase. XRP takes center stage Leading asset manager WisdomTree registered a trust in the state of Delaware, declaring its intentions to file for an XRP ( XRP ) ETF. Following the market-wide correction, XRP positioned itself as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ensuing recovery, spiking to a top of $1.95 on Nov. 30, as it retested the 2021 peak. Amid the run, XRP flipped Binance Coin ( BNB ) to become the fifth-largest crypto asset, hitting a $100 billion market cap for the first time since January 2018. XRP closed the week with a 33% gain. Traditional firms courting Bitcoin Traditional companies warmed up to Bitcoin last week. MicroStrategy built on its existing buying spree with a purchase of 55,000 more BTC for $5.4 billion. This brought total holdings to 386,700. On Nov. 25, Rumble, a video-sharing platform, confirmed plans to cop $20 million worth of Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining firm Marathon procured $67 million in BTC, bringing its holdings to 34,794 worth $3.3 billion. Reports confirmed that leading publicly traded company Metaplanet is looking to secure $62 million in funding to purchase Bitcoin. Global regulatory efforts Countries are pushing to regulate the crypto market. Last week, Bloomberg reported that the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority plans to complete crypto regulations by 2026. North African country Morocco is also looking to enact proper crypto regulations to bolster the growth of the local industry after banning the asset class seven years ago. While the U.S. debated the possibility of a national Bitcoin reserve, Brazilian lawmakers proposed the idea last week, suggesting the South American country allocate 5% of its treasury to procure BTC. Russia introduced a federal law that will impose taxes on cryptocurrencies in the country, essentially recognizing the asset class as taxable property. A U.S. court of appeals overturned the Treasury’s sanction of Tornado Cash, noting that it exceeded the department’s authority. Reports suggested former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins was the favorite to become the next SEC chair under Donald Trump. Pump.fun’s live stream dilemma Pump.fun’s live stream feature was abused by multiple token deployers, including threats of suicide and other heinous acts. The platform released a statement on the growing issue, noting efforts at regulating the live stream feature. Pump.fun eventually suspended live stream indefinitely to curb the issue. Despite the recent predicament, Pump.fun’s monthly revenue reached a new all-time peak of $82.7 million last month, representing a 207% rise from October’s figures.

The compromise between both parties was announced on Dec. 1, the result of hard bargaining between the KDP and the ruling People’s Power Party (PPP), which earlier pressed for a longer delay. Bipartisan Agreement Reached In a news conference, KDP floor leader Park Chan-dae confirmed the party’s agreement to the two-year postponement of the tax. The tax, due to start in January 2025, is now expected to be introduced in January 2027. The decision comes in tune with proposals by the government and the PPP for a grace period with the objective of ensuring market stability and protection for investors. The Case for Delaying the Tax The PPP has argued that imposing the tax prematurely could drive investors away from South Korea’s crypto market. Emphasizing the need for clarity and infrastructure, the party first proposed a three-year delay to 2028. Although the KDP initially opposed any delay, it eventually agreed to a two-year grace period as a middle ground. KDP’s Initial Opposition Before agreeing to the delay, the KDP had criticized the ruling PPP’s proposals, accusing the party of using the tax deferral as a political strategy . The Democratic Party felt the tax could have been applied in 2025 if combined with a higher threshold for taxation, proposing an increase from $1,800 to $36,000. This approach, they claimed, would target high-value traders without punishing smaller investors. A Long History of Postponements The crypto tax policy of South Korea has faced several delays since its announcement in 2021. It was first postponed from 2022 to 2023, then from 2025 to 2027. Each delay has been influenced by factors such as concerns about market readiness, regulatory clarity, and investor sentiment. What Does 2027 Hold? Once enforced, the crypto tax will charge 20% on annual gains over $2,300. Lawmakers say that this extra time will provide them with ample opportunity to implement a sound regulatory framework and enhance stability in the market. The latest delay demonstrates how South Korea is being cautious with regard to the regulation of its rapidly changing crypto sector while striking a balance between innovation and investor protection.",Blockchain|DeFi|Regulation|SouthKorea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-01 12:45:18

This groundbreaking platform is merging blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) in ways never seen before. With its native token, LCAI, making waves in its presale phase, the question on everyone’s mind is: Could LCAI spearhead the next major shift in decentralized AI? Join the presale today and secure your stake in this revolutionary project. The Rise of Lightchain Protocol AI Lightchain Protocol AI is more than just a blockchain project—it’s a bold attempt to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. By introducing the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain provides a seamless environment for executing AI-specific tasks like machine learning model training and inference. Central to this ecosystem is the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, a revolutionary approach that replaces traditional validation methods like Proof of Stake (PoS) with computational AI contributions. This allows participants to perform valuable AI tasks while securing the network, making every action a meaningful step forward for decentralized intelligence. Lightchain’s focus on transparency, scalability, and privacy makes it a game-changer for industries ranging from healthcare to logistics, where AI and blockchain can unlock unparalleled potential. Why Solana Whales Are Making the Shift Solana has long been a leader in the blockchain space, offering high-speed, low-cost transactions that attract major investors. However, Lightchain Protocol AI’s focus on decentralized AI opens up a completely new sector of innovation, one that promises long-term growth and utility. Here’s why Solana whales are making the shift: Cutting-Edge Technology: Lightchain’s AIVM and PoI consensus mechanism offer a highly efficient and scalable platform for decentralized AI applications. Deflationary Tokenomics: LCAI’s built-in scarcity model burns a portion of transaction fees, ensuring that the token’s value increases as the ecosystem grows. Real-World Utility: From decentralized AI-driven apps to privacy-focused computations, Lightchain Protocol AI is built for real-world use cases that appeal to enterprises and developers. Interoperability: Compatibility with major AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch makes it easy for developers to adopt and deploy AI solutions on the platform. For Solana whales, this isn’t just another investment—it’s a chance to be part of a transformative movement in blockchain and AI. LCAI: The Token Powering the Decentralized AI Revolution The LCAI token is the backbone of the Lightchain ecosystem. It powers governance, AI services, and staking, giving holders multiple ways to engage with and benefit from the platform. Its deflationary design, which reduces supply over time, ensures long-term value for early adopters. As Lightchain Protocol AI scales, demand for LCAI is expected to rise dramatically. Whether for accessing premium AI services, participating in decentralized governance, or developing AI-driven dApps, LCAI is integral to the platform’s success. How Lightchain Stands Out from Solana While Solana excels in speed and efficiency for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Lightchain Protocol AI is carving out its niche as the leader in decentralized intelligence. By focusing on the integration of AI and blockchain, Lightchain offers something entirely unique. Its AIVM and PoI systems are specifically designed for AI-heavy workloads, making it a more suitable platform for developers and enterprises working in AI-driven fields. Additionally, Lightchain’s focus on privacy, enabled by advanced cryptographic techniques like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), ensures that sensitive data is handled securely—an essential feature in today’s data-driven world. These differences make Lightchain a complementary force rather than a competitor to Solana, appealing to a new wave of investors seeking diversified exposure in the blockchain space. Could LCAI Be the Future of Decentralized AI? The growing interest from Solana whales is a clear signal that LCAI is on the radar of major players. With its presale already attracting significant attention, Lightchain Protocol AI is positioned to lead the decentralized AI revolution. As industries increasingly adopt AI solutions, the demand for platforms that combine blockchain’s transparency with AI’s computational power is set to soar. LCAI isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a token backed by cutting-edge technology and a clear vision for the future. By addressing critical issues like scalability, privacy, and transparency, Lightchain Protocol AI is poised to become a cornerstone of decentralized AI development.

Analysts are optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s outlook, mapping a bullish trajectory that could see XRP reaching $6.42. This optimism is driven by a combination of technical strength, regulatory shifts, and Ripple’s strategic moves to position itself at the forefront of the evolving crypto landscape. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Technical analysis: XRP charts a path toward $6 XRP’s price action reveals a well-defined bullish roadmap, with multiple technical indicators supporting its upward trajectory. Crypto analyst Dark Defender , in an X post on December 1, highlighted that XRP has recently shown significant strength, reinforcing its potential for continued gains. Having decisively broken the critical resistance at $1.88, which now acts as support , XRP is poised to test $2.13 in the short term. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Dark Defender Mid-term targets are identified at $4.11, a key level aligning with the 261.8% Fibonacci extension , and $5.85, paving the way for the ultimate target of $6.42, supported by the 361.8% Fibonacci extension. Trading well above the Ichimoku Cloud, XRP demonstrates strong momentum, with any pullbacks expected to find robust support within the cloud. Elliott Wave analysis further bolsters this outlook, suggesting the cryptocurrency is in the impulsive third wave of its bullish cycle, typically the most expansive phase. Derivatives data paints a bullish outlook Complementing this technical strength, derivatives data from CoinGlass reflects a bullish bias, with several indicators pointing to positive sentiment among traders. Open interest has increased by 4.26% to $3.35 billion, signaling heightened participation in XRP futures markets, while options volume and options open interest have grown by 17.41% and 16.20%, respectively, showing increased trader activity and positioning for potential price movements. XRP derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass Binance’s long/short ratio of 1.5126, along with a strong long bias among top traders, underscores the optimistic sentiment driving XRP toward its ambitious price targets. Although overall trading volume has decreased by 36.46%, indicating reduced activity or potential consolidation, this does not diminish the bullish momentum evident in other metrics. Furthermore, liquidation data reveals a slight edge in long liquidations, approximately $9.88 million, compared to shorts at $9.62 million. This suggests some volatility but no significant bearish pressure. Overall, the data continues to support a bullish outlook for XRP in the near term Regulatory developments and market sentiment boost XRP Speculation about a pro-crypto shift in SEC leadership under a potential Trump administration has significantly boosted XRP demand. Former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins has emerged as the leading contender for the SEC Chair position, with a 68% probability, according to betting platform Kalshi. Paul Atkins is now the frontrunner to become the next SEC chair, with his chances rising to 66%, up from 30% this morning pic.twitter.com/6yIJzz3i72 — Kalshi (@Kalshi) November 27, 2024 Brad Bondi, another pro-crypto candidate, holds a distant second position with a 20% probability of succeeding current Chair Gary Gensler . Both Atkins and Bondi are viewed as potential catalysts for ending the SEC’s appeal in the Ripple case, a development that could set a crucial legal precedent for the cryptocurrency industry. Ripple’s legal victories against the SEC remain a pivotal driver of XRP’s bullish momentum. The recent approval by the California District Court to amend the judgment and stay in the XRP lawsuit has brought the protracted legal battle closer to resolution. Adding to this optimism, the approval of XRP ETF filings by Canary Funds, Grayscale, and WisdomTree could attract substantial institutional investment, fueling XRP’s ongoing rally and reinforcing its market position. If approved, these ETFs could mirror Bitcoin’s success, which saw its price soar 129% after Bitcoin spot ETFs launched in January 2024. Furthermore, Ripple co-founder Brad Garlinghouse’s $25 million donation to Fairshake PAC is widely seen as the company’s proactive efforts to build stronger relationships with pro-crypto policymakers. This move has further energized the market, contributing to a bullish reversal. In summary, institutional interest and rising derivatives activity continue to signal strong confidence in XRP’s long-term growth. Coupled with increasing open interest in derivatives markets, these factors position XRP as a leading asset for sustained market gains. If current momentum persists, XRP’s roadmap to $6.42 becomes increasingly attainable.

Major firms like SOS Ltd, Rumble, and MicroStrategy made significant Bitcoin investments, signaling growing corporate adoption despite market volatility. In other updates, ZA Bank in Hong Kong launched crypto trading for retail users, the Supra mainnet went live, and DeFi and Web3 advancements continued to expand blockchain use cases. Let’s dig deeper. Bitcoin Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has announced plans to raise 9.5 billion yen (approximately $62 million) through a stock acquisition initiative to expand its Bitcoin holdings. With as much as $13 billion in options expired on Friday, the market is closely watching the movement of Bitcoin, which is expected to be highly volatile after the event. In a move that boosted its stock value significantly, Chinese financial services firm SOS Ltd will be investing $50 million in Bitcoin, aligning with a rising trend of corporate adoption driven by favorable regulatory developments. Video-sharing platform Rumble has announced plans to allocate up to $20 million of its cash reserves to Bitcoin, aligning with broader corporate and institutional adoption trends while reinforcing its ties to the crypto community. With an absolutely huge $5.4 billion purchase of $BTC announced on Monday, MicroStrategy stock would perhaps be expected to rise. However, $MSTR is down 25% from its $540 high, and as per pre-trading, a further fall to $376 could take place. Ethereum ZA Bank , the first and largest digital bank in Hong Kong, has become the first bank in Asia to offer trading services for crypto like Ethereum and Bitcoin directly to retail users. DeFi Velar is teaming up with StackingDAO to inject more liquidity into the market to support “ Stackers ” through the launch of a new stableswap trading pair for STX/stSTX tokens, which is available now on its decentralized exchange platform. Altcoins A Dogecoin millionaire has shifted a large chunk into the DTX Exchange at an average of $0.1. His projections calculate a 24,900% rise in DTX price in 2025 as it hits exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. In 2024, the Sui blockchain recorded huge milestones, helping boost its position in the decentralized finance space. Business Tron founder Justin Sun has announced a $30 million investment into President-elect Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial crypto project. Web3 The Supra mainnet was launched, which means it can finally mint its native SUPRA token, which is simultaneously listed on top-tier crypto exchanges like ByBit, Gate.Io, Kucoin, and MEXC. Artificial intelligence research lab YeagerAI launches Intelligent Oracle to provide real-time data access to decentralized applications (dApps). Regulation Donald Trump’s incoming administration is mulling handing over the regulation of crypto exchanges and spot markets for cryptocurrencies deemed commodities to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plans to implement comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations by 2026, focusing on transparency, market abuse, and decentralized data disclosure while fostering innovation in the growing digital asset sector. Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo has predicted that the SEC will drop the case against Ripple. Hong Kong is considering waiving tax on investment gains from cryptocurrencies for hedge funds, private equity funds, and family offices as it looks to enhance its appeal as a wealth management hub.

Cardano (ADA), with its focus on scalability and eco-friendliness, remains a major player in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Immutable X (IMX), on the other hand, is carving out its niche as the go-to platform for NFTs, offering a carbon-neutral, layer-2 solution for Ethereum. Both projects are shining examples of how blockchain technology is changing the way we interact with the digital world. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS), a revolutionary project that’s all about usability. With its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet , No KYC access, and integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay, Qubetics is making crypto transactions easier than ever. Currently priced at just $0.025 during its presale, $TICS offers an incredible ROI potential of 900%, making it one of the best cryptos to buy this month and a must-have for December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Crypto for Everyday Use Let’s face it: crypto can still be intimidating for a lot of people. Qubetics is here to fix that. With its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, this platform simplifies managing digital assets across multiple blockchains. Whether you’re paying for your coffee with Bitcoin or sending Ethereum to a friend, Qubetics lets you do it all seamlessly. The cherry on top? No KYC. You don’t have to deal with endless paperwork or long waiting times to access your funds. This is especially useful for freelancers and small businesses that want quick and private access to their earnings. Plus, the wallet’s smart contract conversion feature ensures that your crypto is automatically converted to fiat at the point of sale, protecting you from the rollercoaster of market volatility. Picture this: you’re a small business owner accepting payments in Cardano. Qubetics converts that ADA into dollars in real-time, so you’re never stuck wondering if your payment will lose value overnight. It’s practical, it’s simple, and it’s exactly what the crypto world needs. The numbers don’t lie—Qubetics has already raised over $3.8M, with 239M tokens sold to more than 5000 holders. At $0.025 per token, this presale phase is a steal, with a 10% price hike just around the corner. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy this week, Qubetics is an absolute no-brainer. Cardano (ADA): Scalability Meets Sustainability Cardano has always been about doing things differently. Instead of rushing into the market, it has taken a slow-and-steady approach, prioritizing scalability, sustainability, and security. Its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm is not only energy-efficient but also highly scalable, making it a favorite among developers and eco-conscious investors. Why is Cardano one of the best cryptos to buy this month? Its use cases are endless. From DeFi projects to identity management solutions, Cardano’s ecosystem is expanding rapidly. Its native token, ADA, powers these applications, ensuring seamless transactions within the network. For long-term investors, Cardano’s focus on peer-reviewed research and systematic upgrades makes it a reliable choice. Imagine pairing Cardano’s scalability with Qubetics’ usability. Spending ADA on everyday purchases could become as effortless as swiping a credit card. Cardano’s roadmap for the future includes scaling solutions like Hydra and further enhancements to its smart contract capabilities. As adoption grows, analysts predict that ADA’s value will continue to rise, making it a must-have for any diversified crypto portfolio. Immutable X (IMX): The Future of NFTs If you’re into NFTs, Immutable X is the platform you need to know about. Built as a layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Immutable X solves the two biggest problems in the NFT space: high gas fees and slow transaction times. By leveraging zero-knowledge rollups, it offers instant, gas-free transactions while maintaining Ethereum’s security and decentralization. Why is Immutable X one of the best cryptos to buy this month? Its focus on sustainability sets it apart. As a carbon-neutral platform, it’s attracting artists, gamers, and developers who want to mint and trade NFTs without leaving a massive carbon footprint. For gamers, Immutable X powers popular blockchain games like Gods Unchained and Illuvium, offering seamless NFT integration and trading. Imagine using Qubetics’ wallet to manage your IMX tokens and make quick, gas-free purchases within these games—it’s a match made in crypto heaven. With NFTs continuing to gain traction across industries, Immutable X is poised for significant growth. Its innovative approach and focus on user experience make IMX a smart investment for both NFT enthusiasts and long-term crypto holders. Three Coins, Endless Opportunities As December 2024 approaches, Qubetics, Cardano, and Immutable X emerge as top contenders for the best cryptos to buy this week and this month: Qubetics ($TICS): A usability-focused platform offering a potential 900% ROI, making crypto simple for everyday use. Cardano (ADA): A scalable, sustainable blockchain powering DeFi and beyond. Immutable X (IMX): The NFT powerhouse solving gas fees and transaction delays while staying carbon-neutral. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, whether it’s Qubetics’ practical tools, Cardano’s eco-friendly scalability, or Immutable X’s NFT innovation. Diversifying across these coins could be your ticket to high gains and long-term success. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Cardano (ADA), and Immutable X (IMX) as the best cryptos to buy this month for both short-term gains and long-term growth.

According to Kiyosaki, Bitcoin is primed for a crash. He made the prediction days after his initial AI-fuelled prediction of Bitcoin hitting $500,000 by 2025. He took to his handle on microblogging platform X to reveal to his 2.6 million followers the situation surrounding the leading digital asset. Kiyosaki, a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, has always called on American citizens, especially the ones active in the crypto market to purchase Bitcoin. There is a consensus that the crypto is now down from its Trump-fuelled surge since early November, and speculation has grown about what will happen next for the asset. Initially tied to the situation surrounding Trump’s win at the polls, analysts have said the asset could maintain its momentum till next year. Robert Kiyosaki makes sensational Bitcoin price prediction In his post on X, Kiyosaki highlighted Bitcoin’s situation, explaining why he predicted an implosion. Kiyosaki maintains that he is still an avid Bitcoin believer even though he expects the asset to go down. Kiyosaki said that since the asset has tried to breach the $100,000 mark without success, the next move is a downward spiral. He cited historical instances when bears overtook the Bitcoin market as he said BTC could drop to as low as $60,000. BITCOIN to CRASH Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. I predict Bitcoin will settle around $250 in 2025. At this stage of the BTC process… price is not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 1, 2024 However, he assured his users they should not be dismayed as he won’t sell even if it happens. He noted that instead, he will take advantage of the “Bitcoin sale” to purchase more units of the digital asset . Updating his prediction, Kiyosaki revealed the asset may do well and settle around $250,000 in 2025. He also said that users should stop dwelling on the asset’s price, urging them to keep stacking up as much as possible. “At this stage of the BTC process… price is not as important..as how many BTC you acquire. I want more BTC,” he said. Kiyosaki’s past bold BTC predictions and market reaction Robert Kiyosaki has built a reputation around his support for Bitcoin and assets like gold and silver. The famous author has always held his stance against traditional money, arguing the disadvantages of holding it. While his credibility has not been called into question, Kiyosaki has certainly made audacious Bitcoin predictions in his campaign for the leading digital asset. For instance, he predicted last year that Bitcoin would hit $350,000 by August, a prediction that did not happen. Again this year, Kiyosaki made a bold prediction noting that Bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2030. He revealed that the surge will be driven by artificial intelligence (AI), and it will be frightening. So far, his predictions have been wide of the mark, and his bullish stance has failed to align with reality. Meanwhile, some of his followers have voiced their opinion over his constant predictions. One said they no longer take Kiyosaki seriously due to his ever-changing predictions. “I just can’t take this guy seriously anymore. His constantly changing opinions on crypto, gold, silver, and all this back-and-forth—crash, no crash, bullish, not bullish—are exhausting,” the user said. They added that it’s just clickbait in a discussion with another user who said Kiyosaki is only two years old in the Bitcoin market.

In a post on X, Marcus described the project as a “political kill,” halted by behind-the-scenes pressure on banks and resistance from high-ranking officials. Political Pressures Undermined Regulatory Efforts Launched as Libra before its rebranding to Diem, Meta’s stablecoin project aimed to revolutionize global finance . However, despite years of intense modifications to meet regulatory demands, Marcus claims that the project was ultimately thwarted by political resistance. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen played a decisive role, warning Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell about the political fallout of allowing the project to proceed. Marcus pinpointed this as the moment the venture unraveled, stating, “Effectively, this was the moment Libra was killed.” Following Yellen’s intervention, the Federal Reserve reportedly pressured participating banks during private calls. Marcus shared that the Fed’s general counsel delivered a statement to banks, saying, “We can’t stop you from moving forward and launching, but we are not comfortable with you doing so.” This subtle but clear warning led to the project’s unraveling. In January 2022, Meta sold Diem to Silvergate Bank , which abandoned the initiative a year later, citing unsustainable prospects and writing off its investment entirely. Diem’s Legacy: New Horizons in Blockchain Although Diem failed to materialize, its influence persists through the blockchain talent it nurtured. Many former team members transitioned to Aptos and Sui, two innovative Layer 1 blockchain projects utilizing Move, a programming language originally developed for Diem. Meanwhile, Marcus has shifted his focus to Lightspark, a startup enhancing Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. The collapse of Diem underscores the tensions between private-sector innovation and public-sector control in the financial landscape. Regulators were especially concerned about the concentration of power. A 2021 report by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets warned that combining a stablecoin issuer and a corporate giant like Meta could result in an “excessive concentration of economic power.” The post David Marcus Explains How Politics Killed Meta’s Stablecoin Project Diem appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Finance and Business News|Diem|Meta Diem,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|APT,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2024-12-01 13:23:53

This includes money spent on mining hardware, data center upgrades, and other infrastructure needed to maintain and expand their operations. Record Spending Incoming A November 28 newsletter from TheMinerMag revealed that mining companies’ investments in PP&E between July and September 2024 were the highest since Q1 2022 when they forked out a record $1.246 billion. In Q3 2024, the firms paid out $1.226 billion, only $20 million less than the Q1 2022 numbers. CleanSpark has yet to release its financial report for that period, and analysts feel that adding the Nevada-based miner’s outlay could allow the industry to set a new record for net PP&E expenditure in a single quarter. The BTC miners have invested about $3.49 billion in equipment and upgrades this year, including $1.18 billion between January and March and $1.07 billion between April and June, in addition to the Q3 figure. This is already nearly $900 million more than the sector’s outlay in the entirety of 2022. Hardware Purchases Dominate Spending The uptick in investment following a subdued 2023, when the companies put about $1.3 billion into PP&E, coincides with the Bitcoin network’s hashrate going up to nearly 790 exahashes per second (EH/s). Furthermore, the cryptocurrency’s mining difficulty also hit a new all-time high of 101.6 T on November 5, with experts predicting it will probably go up by at least another 2% in the coming days. It means that mining operations will have to focus on efficiency and scale to stay competitive and profitable. As such, most of the PP&E money invested in the last year went towards upgrading and expanding mining hardware. Preorder data tracked by TheMinerMag between July 2023 and March 2024 shows the firms committed more than $2 billion to buying the latest BTC mining machines. Deliveries were expected to start streaming in by September 2024, with China-based Bitmain securing most of the deals. However, delays in shipping the company’s Antminer ASIC devices to U.S.-based BTC miners have sparked speculation about potential links to ongoing geopolitical issues. This includes a reported investigation into possible sanctions violations by Sophgo, a Chinese chip maker associated with Bitmain co-founder Micree Zhan. If a connection were established, it could have serious consequences for the multi-billion dollar BTC mining sector, especially at a time when the cryptocurrency is threatening to breach the $100,000 milestone.

This single-week performance represents a change in the fortunes of the “king of altcoins,” which somewhat slowed down after a great start to the month of November. While the current price layout for Ethereum suggests that there is still room for upward movement, certain on-chain signals indicate that the market might be on the cusp of a pullback. One of these signals is the ETH open interest , which recently hit a new all-time high. Is ETH Price At Risk With Surging Open Interest? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym ShayanBTC has revealed that while the Ethereum price trajectory looks bullish at the moment, investors need to tread with caution. This projection is based on the “alarming divergence” in the ETH futures market metrics. Specifically, the relevant futures market metric here is the open interest, which tracks the total amount of open futures or derivatives contracts of a particular cryptocurrency (ETH, in this case) in the market at a given time. It basically evaluates the amount of money being poured into Ethereum futures at every moment. According to data from CryptoQuant , the Ethereum open interest has reached a new all-time high value of $17 billion. Typically, surging open interest signals a shift in investor sentiment, with traders increasingly speculating and gearing for a potential market movement. ShayanBTC, however, noted that the notable spike in open interest was not accompanied by a new all-time high for the price of Ethereum. According to the Quicktake pundit, this divergence between the price and the open interest points to a potential increase in volatility and significant liquidation cascades. ShayanBTC added: If Ethereum’s price faces a sudden downturn or consolidation, the overleveraged positions from futures traders could trigger a wave of forced liquidations, leading to rapid price declines. As of this writing, the price of Ethereum sits just beneath $3,700, reflecting an over 3% increase in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin’s value is up by nearly 8% in the past seven days. Ethereum Whales Load Their Bags Fortuitously, another on-chain data has emerged to counter the bearish prognosis for the second-largest cryptocurrency. In a November 30 post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that a particular class of Ethereum large investors has been active in the market. Data from CryptoQuant shows that Ethereum whales holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 coins have purchased over 280,000 ETH in the past four days. This level of buying activity from such an influential class of investor could be considered bullish for the altcoin.",Ethereum|ethereum|Ethereum open interest|ethereum price|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-01 13:30:20

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 13:33:00

In a rare admission of fault, Charles acknowledged his contentious history with rival blockchain communities like Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP. Posting on X, he apologized for past remarks and pushed for collaboration ahead of what he sees as a critical moment for blockchain in 2025. “One suggestion that I have for all of us in the Cardano community is to let the comments and opinions of the past go and embrace a full reset of all ecosystems,” Charles wrote. He admitted to being “prickly” and said rival ecosystems have also criticized Cardano with “terrible and untrue things.” Now, however, he believes they are giving Cardano’s technology a second look. According to Charles, this is a once-in-a-lifetime window to take blockchain mainstream and grow the market into the trillions, touching every home and government. A career built on disputes? Charles is no stranger to conflict. His journey in blockchain started with Ethereum, where he was part of the founding team. But his stint was short-lived. Charles wanted Ethereum to adopt a for-profit structure, clashing with Vitalik Buterin, who insisted on a non-profit model. This disagreement got Charles booted from the project in 2014, an exit he has since described as politically motivated and unfair. After Ethereum, Charles built Cardano, which he promoted as a superior blockchain with decentralized governance. And naturally, he has been critical of Ethereum, calling its governance model a “dictatorship” controlled by Buterin. This narrative set the stage for years of tension between the two communities, with Charles often at the center of heated debates. But his ‘beefs’ extended beyond Ethereum. Bitcoin maximalists were next in line for his sharp commentary. Charles frequently positioned Cardano as Bitcoin’s true rival, emphasizing its proof-of-stake model and smart contracts. His claims didn’t sit well with Bitcoin supporters, who thought he was overstepping. XRP fans didn’t escape his wrath either. During the Ripple vs. SEC legal battles, he referred to the project’s community as “XRP trolls,” escalating the already tense relationship between Cardano and Ripple’s communities. Legal battles and industry tensions Charles’s combative approach hasn’t been limited to words. Last month, we reported that he threatened legal action against Wyoming’s Stable Token Commission. The issue? Cardano was excluded from a government-backed stablecoin project that included Ethereum and Solana. Charles accused the commission of bias and claimed its selection process violated legal standards. Meanwhile, Cardano has struggled with adoption rates compared to Ethereum and Solana. Adding to his list of controversies, former Ethereum colleagues have actually accused Charles of embellishing his credentials. Allegedly, he implied being Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s elusive creator—an accusation he vehemently denies. Still, these allegations linger, casting a shadow on his public persona. Now, Charles wants to turn the page. He told his people: “2025 is about unity and progress. We have a window to make crypto mainstream and grow our markets to the tens of trillions of dollars of value, thereby entering every home and government alike. We can not allow petty tribalism to squander this opportunity.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-01 13:52:43

With DOGE aiming to breach the $0.5 resistance level, the coin could get a boost from the fact that it has officially entered the bullish “Green Zone.” This phase has historically seen explosive growth for the meme coin, according to cryptocurrency trading expert Trader Tardigrade . In an X p o st on December 1, the analyst noted that the “green zone” is associated with vigorous and rapid price movements. Historically, Dogecoin’s trajectory within this zone has led to monumental price surges, and this cycle appears no different. “The green zone tends to narrow after each cycle, indicating that the $Doge pump will be more vigorous and rapid in this zone,” the expert noted. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: Trader Tardigrade To this end, the trading expert called on investors to hold their DOGE, anticipating a potential rally to double-digit prices. It’s worth noting, however, that even as DOGE emulates past movements, reaching double figures during this phase is not guaranteed, especially if the broader cryptocurrency market experiences significant declines. Meanwhile, as reported by Finbold, the analyst previously suggested that DOGE’s bull run had “just started,” based on signals from the Price Momentum Oscillator (PMO) indicator. Dogecoin’s price likely to outperform Bitcoin further On-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez also shared the bullish outlook. Martinez suggested that Dogecoin could skyrocket by 2,400% against Bitcoin. This analysis is based on a breakout from a two-year descending channel, signaling potential gains from 0.00000438 BTC to 0.00009375 BTC. Dogecoin/Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts Such a rally will continue Dogecoin’s impressive performance in 2024, during which the coin has gained nearly 360% year-to-date, compared to Bitcoin’s 119% return over the same period. Notably, Dogecoin’s rally has been fueled by bullish optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s election and the influence of Elon Musk , who is expected to play a significant role in the upcoming administration. DOGE’s possible ETF approval Further bullish sentiment arises from the potential entry of institutional investors into Dogecoin through an exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). In this regard, Alexander Blum, CEO of Two Prime Digital Assets, believes a DOGE ETF application is inevitable, driven by the success of Bitcoin ETFs . However, Blum noted that regulatory approval remains uncertain. If the product gains approval, attention will turn to whether Dogecoin can replicate Bitcoin’s gains and potentially reach the $1 mark. Nevertheless, the launch of a Dogecoin ETF might not be universally welcomed. Dogecoin’s volatility, limited utility, and whimsical origins could deter significant investment in such a product. Dogecoin price analysis At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.42, with daily gains of about 0.5%. On the weekly chart, the meme coin has risen by 3.6%. Dogecoin price analysis chart.

Interest in CBDC networks has dwindled, with only 13% of respondents considering them the most promising approach, down from 31% last year. Instead, Instant Payment Systems (IPS) are emerging as the preferred alternative. CBDCs Face Growing Skepticism One of the primary challenges central banks aim to tackle with CBDCs is the high cost of cross-border transactions. However, central banks appear increasingly divided on the effectiveness of CBDCs as a solution. The survey highlights governance and operational hurdles as persistent concerns, particularly for multi-currency CBDC platforms like Project mBridge . Launched as a collaborative effort to streamline cross-border payments, mBridge achieved a minimum viable product stage in mid-2024. Yet, liquidity management and governance remain barriers to adoption. Additionally, the platform’s reliance on Chinese-developed technology has raised concerns about centralization and potential misuse for evading sanctions. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) distanced itself from the project, with General Manager Agustín Carstens emphasizing that mBridge is not intended to serve the needs of BRICS nations or facilitate sanctions evasion. Still, skepticism remains. “Even the perception that mBridge could aid such ambitions is enough for Western stakeholders to withdraw support,” remarked Josh Lipsky of the Atlantic Council. Instant Payment Systems Gain Traction In contrast, IPS models are gaining momentum, supported by 47% of central banks surveyed. The scalability and proven effectiveness of IPS in domestic markets, especially in regions like Southeast Asia, make it an attractive option for cross-border integration. Notably, five Southeast Asian countries recently piloted Project Nexus, showcasing the potential of IPS to interconnect existing systems seamlessly. While IPS holds promise, challenges remain. The report identifies governance structures and regulatory frameworks as critical factors requiring attention. Despite these hurdles, IPS is being hailed as the more pragmatic and scalable choice for global payments infrastructure. As enthusiasm for multi-currency CBDCs wanes, the shift toward IPS underscores a growing consensus among central banks. The focus is increasingly on systems that can deliver immediate, cost-effective solutions without the complexities associated with CBDCs.

On November 30, IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson and MultiversX Foundation CEO Beniamin Mincu agreed upon a goodwill meeting this week. Everything started with a casual conversation between ADA and EGLD communities regarding the ongoing dominance of centralized dollar-based stablecoins like Circle’s USDC, Tether’s USDT, and Ripple Lab’s RLUSD, looking for sound alternatives . During the talk, Cüneyt Denizli, DBCrypto , and Angry Crypto Show discussed a Cardano-MultiversX ecosystem collaboration, referencing decentralized stablecoin alternatives. Denizli summoned Hoskinson for the talk, asking if IOHK is in contact with MultiverseX, which received a positive answer . I am in contact with them. My old friend and former colleague Adam Bates is their CMO — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 30, 2024 One hour later, Charles Hoskinson tagged Beniamin Mincu on X, suggesting they could “have a call sometime.” Mincu responded he will be in the United States “next week” and is “happy to meet and chat” with Hoskinson. Cardano (ADA) and MultiversX (EGLD) price analysis As of this writing, ADA is trading at $1.07 and EGLD at $44.53, up 199% and 86.7% in the last 30 days, respectively. This is a 23% surge since Finbold featured EGLD as an opportunity for investors who missed the XRP and ADA rally . At these prices, Cardano has a market cap 31 times higher than MultiversX.

Cardano could benefit from new functionalities and interoperability, while MultiversX could benefit from a boost in visibility and utility. Therefore, the AI predicts ADA could range between $2.55 and $3.38 by the end of 2025. In the meantime, EGLD is forecasted to trade at a minimum of $60 and a maximum of $72.71.

XRP has far surpassed expectations with a 270% increase over November, but it doesn’t appear over as bullish projections for XRP eye a target much higher running into 2025. However, cracks are starting to show today as XRP’s recent momentum dwindles somewhat, with a 38% lapse in trading volume, hitting $11.4 billion. XRP Price Analysis: Could A Correction Derail the Path to $5? Indeed, the concern that the recent rally may have been too much too quickly for the XRP price appears to be coming to a head as technical indicators raise alarms. As the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached deep overbought territory at 88, a correction seems like the natural and healthy next step for XRP to find stable footing for its next leg up. However, this would do little to derail XRP’s path to $5, according to a recent X post by popular pseudonymous analyst Egrag Crypto. XRP / USDT 1W chart, symmetrical triangle pattern. Source: Egrag Crypto / X The analyst likened the recent breakout of a symmetrical triangle pattern forming since mid-2017 to the breakout of a similar pattern in early 2017. Given the current rally mirrors the 2017 breakout, the analyst sets a $5.30 XRP price, a 180% advance from current prices. However, the projection comes with a caution. Just as the 2017 rally was followed by major corrections, a similar pattern could play out this time. Egrag expects a potential 63% retracement after XRP reaches its peak. This would bring the price back just below the $2 mark, aligning with XRP’s previous all-time high in 2021. The analyst also warned that the timeline of this rally may not match the last. Particularly as XRP seems to have far outpaced its fundamentals, given that the anticipated regulatory changes expected under the Trump administration have yet to get off the ground. This Fleeting Opportunity Could Bring Bigger Gains While a 2.8x for the XRP price is certainly appealing, emerging opportunities hold the potential for quicker and more substantial returns. After all, fortune favors the bold. As “meme coin supercycle” sentiment takes hold and coins like $Coolguy and $Pnut experience sudden rises to prominence, strategic investors are looking to newer low-cap meme coins with exponential growth potential . Among them, Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) stands out as a unique opportunity by pioneering the industry’s first meme coin staking platform.

Bitcoin ( BTC ), which attempted to reach $100,000 two weeks ago, was a key driver of last week’s market downturn. It retested the $90,000 support level before rebounding to over $97,200 at last check Sunday. Despite last week’s bearish trend, several altcoins demonstrated impressive performance. Here are our top picks of notable performers to keep an eye on in the week ahead: XRP retests 2021 peak XRP ( XRP ) was one of the biggest beneficiaries of last week’s market rebound. Despite dropping by more than 12% from Nov. 24 to 26, XRP eventually closed the week with an impressive 33% gain. XRP 1D chart | Source: crypto.news Particularly, after retesting $1.28 on Nov. 26, the altcoin saw a massive rebound the next day, spontaneously breaching the $1.63 resistance that capped its previous run and flipping Binance Coin ( BNB ) to secure fifth among the top assets. XRP sustained the rally until it clinched $1.81, soaring further to $1.9586, which marked a retest of the $1.96 peak of April 2021. Veteran trader Peter Brandt previously asserted that XRP could surge if the $1.96 resistance clears.

Its next Fibonacci level from here sits at $2.35 (Fib. 1.272), with further resistance at $2.56 (Fib. 1.414).

APE 1D chart | Source: crypto.news Trailing the broader market trend, APE began its recovery push on Nov. 27. Interestingly, as of Nov. 29, it had gained 11%, breaching the top trendline of a five-week symmetrical triangle as bullish momentum persisted. By the close of the week, APE retraced to retest the descending trendline, reaching support of $1.380. However, the bulls showed strength, reigniting a rally that allowed the asset to close the week at $1.5. APE has since dropped below $1.5, with its RSI at 69 still near overbought territories. This week, the bulls must defend the $1.3 region to hold above the symmetrical triangle. A breach back into the triangle could signal a shift in momentum to bearish. Yuga Labs, the team behind the BAYC and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFT collections, created APE. APE will reportedly unlock 15.6 million tokens on Dec. 17. ALGO spikes 51% Algorand ( ALGO ), the native token of the open-source smart contract layer-1 blockchain of the same name, was one of the largest gainers last week, spiking by a remarkable 51%. ALGO 1D chart | Source: crypto.news Most of ALGO’s gains occurred on Nov. 29, when the altcoin rallied by a massive 36.92%, its biggest intraday gain throughout this year. Before this rally, Algorand had observed the formation of a golden cross on Nov. 25, as its 50-day MA moved above the 200-day MA. The asset built on the ensuing bullish momentum to recover the $0.48 mark for the first time since the Terra collapse in May 2022. Analysts have projected lofty price targets, with some expecting a rally to $1.5. Interestingly, the last time ALGO saw a bullish cross was during the first phase of the bull run in the fourth quarter of 2023, leading to a 96% rally. This week, ALGO needs to breach its next major resistance at $0.4893 to sustain the upward push. Meanwhile, a drop below $0.40 could weaken the momentum.

Schwartz claimed that the government is “addicted to indirect regulation” and outlined four reasons why de-banking undermines the rule of law. He argued that cutting off banking access pushes entities to switch service providers or operate underground, making them harder to regulate and monitor. Schwartz also stated that de-banking erodes due process, freedom of speech, and protections against unlawful search and seizure. “Our government has become addicted to indirect regulation precisely because of these evils. It is cheaper and easier to pressure someone else to punish me than to charge me with a crime and give me due process, but the government ought not to punish people without giving them due process,” Schwartz wrote. He added, “It is easier to pressure banks to cut off disfavored businesses than to make that business illegal,” calling on the government to regulate transparently and lawfully. Industry Leaders Share Experiences Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen revealed that over 30 tech firms have been affected by Operation Chokepoint 2.0, with industry leaders recounting their experiences. Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian said JPMorgan Chase debanked him in December 2022. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to uncover details about the operation and is compiling records. In September 2024, Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter accused the Biden administration of deliberately shutting down Silvergate Bank to harm the crypto sector. “I believe Silvergate could have survived its drawdown — and was on a path to do so,” Carter said.

Recently, an experienced crypto veteran predicted Ethereum (ETH) at $5 and now has his sights set on Rexas Finance (RXS) as the next big thing. That’s because this altcoin is making waves, with bold claims that RXS could take off by a stunning 37,890% before the end of Q1 2025, attracting investors and market analysts alike. The RWA Revolution Rexas Finance is leading the way in the RWA movement, where real-world assets (RWA) are tokenized. The digital representation of physical assets such as real estate, commodities, and art on the blockchain is enabled by this innovative approach. With this, Rexas Finance hopes to unlock unprecedented liquidity and accessibility to investors. Rexas is strategically situated to take a large share of the $16 trillion RWA market, estimated to be worth around 2030. The crypto veteran’s prediction that RXS could reach an astronomical price point of $38 before the end of Q1 2025 follows an anticipated altcoin season. As Ethereum has been gaining momentum and has been reclaiming its all-time highs, RXS should follow this wave of momentum. It is projected that Rexas Finance will increase by 37,890%, making it one of the most promising investments in the crypto space today. It’s not pure speculation, this bullish sentiment is on the back of potential developments within the Rexas ecosystem. Stages 6 and 7 of the RXS presale have sold out even before reaching the end of sale on a record-breaking day for presale! RXS is currently priced at $0.100 in Stage 8 and has already raised over $16 million, with the expectation that it will continue to receive large levels of investment as it nears its goal of $20.75 million for this stage. Rexas Finance (RXS) achieves an impressive $16.9M🔥 in its ongoing presale. With the 8th stage price at just $0.1, this groundbreaking platform is reshaping the tokenization of real-world assets and attracting crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Backed by a Certik audit and gearing… pic.twitter.com/FmcFaOp9mH — Rexas Finance (@rexasfinance) November 27, 2024 Whale Interest and Community Support Rexas Finance has generated a lot of enthusiasm among large investors (sometimes called whales) and they are going all in on the presale. It shows significant confidence in RXS’s ability to have explosive growth. Community engagement also backs this trend, with more retail investors attracted to the platform’s pioneering approach to asset tokenization. CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm, has also rigorously audited Rexas Finance . This audit helps enhance investor faith in the project by making sure that the project complies with a standard level of security and transparency. Furthermore, it has been listed on major platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which have only solidified its credibility in the cryptocurrency community even more. The Technology Behind Rexas Rexas Finance is at its core built on blockchain technology to offer a hassle-free experience for users who wish to invest in real-world assets. The platform supports many features to make it easy to access and participate in asset tokenization. One of those features is the Tokenization tools, which make it easy for users to tokenize their assets. The process is one that allows people to take physical assets such as cars and turn them into digital tokens that can be traded or owned fractionally. Furthermore, the Decentralized Launchpad provides a secure place for token sale across various blockchain ecosystems with transparent and trusted transactions. Users can co-own properties and earn passive income through stablecoin distribution through Rexas Estate initiative. On top of that, with integrated AI AI-powered features, creators can create high-quality digital artworks and NFTs, opening doors for creators to new opportunities in the growing digital asset market. With the markets entering into a new phase of market dynamics with increased interest from altcoins, Rexas Finance is a great opportunity to invest in. RXS is in a good position as the combination of strong fundamentals, such as asset tokenization of real-world assets and favorable market conditions, means it’s in for big growth. These are valid projections, and it’s one of these that the crypto veteran’s endorsement offers some weight to. He was already a credible voice in the industry as a result of his previous success in predicting the rise of Ethereum. If the RXS forecast is true, early investors could see their investments multiplied exponentially as there is more and more demand for the tokenization of real-world assets. Finally, Rexas Finance (RXS) is a great opportunity for investors to cash in on the next big thing in cryptocurrency. RXS’s innovative solution for real-world asset tokenization combined with strong community support paves the way for huge growth in the next couple of years. With an altcoin season right around the corner thanks to Ethereum’s resurgence, now is perhaps the ideal time to evaluate adding RXS to your portfolio. As those who spoke to BitcoinTalk predicted that there might be a price surge by the end of Q1 2025, timing can definitely be a girl’s best friend if you want to profit from this investment.

The postponement comes after a proposed financial investment income tax was shelved last month for similar reasons. The tax plan, originally scheduled to go into effect next year, aimed to impose a 22% tax (including local taxes) on annual virtual asset income exceeding 2.5 million won ($1,790). The policy has been postponed twice before, with the DPK initially seeking to implement it with an increased tax exemption threshold of 50 million won ($35,780). However, growing discontent among cryptocurrency investors and opposition from the ruling People Power Party (PPP) led to further delays. DPK grassroots leader Representative Park Chan-dae made statements on the issue at a press briefing at the National Assembly: Related News: Watch Out: FED Chairman Jerome Powell to Speak This Week - Here are the Date, Time and Details “After extensive discussions, we concluded that additional institutional arrangements were necessary for the taxation of virtual assets. We agreed to postpone the taxation for two years.” He added that the decision was taken after “lengthy negotiations, discussions and political reasoning.” The ruling PPP, which has long advocated for the crypto tax law to be repealed, welcomed the move. PPP leader Han Dong-hoon called the delay a “good outcome for the youth,” saying it was important to support younger generations in building their wealth. “No policy can prevail against the will of the people,” Khan wrote in a Facebook post. The DPK’s step back is its second in recent times regarding financial taxation. Earlier this month, the party abandoned plans to introduce a financial investment income tax, citing a “difficult domestic stock market.” The postponement of the cryptocurrency tax will be made official with an amendment to the Income Tax Law, which is expected to be passed by the plenary session of the Parliament on Monday. *This is not investment advice.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 14:57:06

Similar trends have historically resulted in notable demonstrations; experts see DOGE's recent triple bottom pattern at $0.0916 as indicating the possibility for large gains followed by a 424.99% increase. Though DOGE’s chart hints at massive gains in the next bull run, for investors looking for life-changing rewards Rexas Finance (RXS) offers an even more interesting prospect as it’ll repeat DOGE’s 2021 success in the next 87 days. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Star Possessed with Great Potential Currently priced at $0.10 in its presale stage 8, Rexas Finance has already shown an amazing increase, exploding 240% from its starting presale price of $0.030. Early 2025 marks a targeted launch price of $0.20 on three out of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges, which prepares RXS to double before it ever finds public release. After its introduction, market analysts estimate RXS might climb by 17,500%, hitting a possible high of $17.50, creating billionaires in as little as 87 days. How Can RXS Outperform the Legendary Rally of DOGE? While RXS's real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing strategy prepares it for something similar to DOGE's 2021 rise of over 25,000%, RXS has caught worldwide notice. This is the justification: By tokenizing real-world assets including real estate ($379.7 trillion market), gold ($121.2 trillion), and art ($65 billion yearly volume), Rexas Finance seeks to combine traditional finance and blockchain technology. For people all around, this creates hitherto unheard-of investing possibilities that allow fractional ownership and liquidity in markets once reserved for the wealthy. To guarantee openness, security, and efficiency, the Rexas ecosystem combines blockchain, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence. By democratizing asset tokenization with tools like the token builder and launchpad, anyone may tokenize assets without knowledge of coding or capital raising for fresh ventures. Rexas Finance has developed a devoted community of individual investors, unlike many crypto initiatives supported by venture capital. This grassroots support not only promotes natural development but also conforms with the distributed attitude of blockchain. Certik Audit and Transparency: Rexas Finance's Certik audit underlines its dedication to safety since security and trust are top priorities in crypto. Being listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko improves visibility even more so that investors may reliably track real-time data and metrics. Out of its $20,750,000 aim for stage 8, Rexas Finance's presale has already raised $17,851,971 with over 261 million RXS tokens sold as of writing. With 20 lucky winners slated to get $50,000 worth of RXS each, the ongoing $1 million RXS giveaway has drawn 328,516 submissions. These figures show great investor belief in the future of the project. Early investors find the arithmetic appealing. If RXS targets $17.50, a startling 175x return, a $5,800 investment at the current presale price of $0.10 might become $1 million in the next 87 days. This reflects DOGE's explosive ascent but with the benefit of a proven use case in an industry valued at trillion dollars. The Road Ahead: Why Timing Counts The RXS presale is fast-moving, and the chance to buy at $0.10 is closing. Early investors will already be in profit whenever RXS starts on top-tier exchanges at $0.20. The actual benefits, meanwhile, come from staying through the expected bull run. Given a forecasted 17,500% rise, the possible upside in the current market is unmatched. The breakout signals of Dogecoin indicate the beginning of a fresh bull run; historical data indicates that early movers gain the most. Although DOGE is still a popular choice, Rexas Finance presents a special, high-potential substitute with its real-world asset tokenizing approach, excellent presale performance, and future listings on elite exchanges. Purchasing RXS now could be like purchasing DOGE before its pump for 2021. Though it is rare to find the chance to turn a small investment into life-changing riches, Rexas Finance has all the tools needed for success: creative technology, community-driven development, and a forward-looking road map. Act now before the presale ends to seize the opportunity to contribute to the next crypto success narrative!

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. November’s bull market surged after Trump’s win, boosting Shiba Inu 60% and gaming token Rollblock’s presale beyond predictions. Table of Contents Rollblock dominates the gaming token market Shiba Inu price rise ignites meme coin buzz Conclusion The bull market has been in full flow this November, all triggered after President-elect Donald Trump’s landslide win. Meme coins were some of the biggest beneficiaries as the Shiba Inu price rocketed 60% in a few days, before correcting. New gaming token Rollblock was another key recipient of the Trump factor as its presale has now exceeded all bullish predictions. It’s still ongoing, but its attraction isn’t actually the gaming aspect, but is something DeFi has long promised but always failed to deliver — until now. Rollblock dominates the gaming token market In a market where utility is now king, Rollblock is establishing itself as a leader among gaming tokens. By merging blockchain technology with the multi-billion-dollar online gambling industry, Rollblock is bringing real-world utility with the promise DeFi always failed to deliver on. Unlike speculative projects of past crypto cycles, Rollblock boasts a gaming token, which serves as the backbone of its entire ecosystem. An ecosystem that offers over 7000 gaming options and a sports betting book to keep its users entertained. However, it’s not gaming that’s attracting such big investment to Rollblock’s presale. The promise of passive income is key for many investors and this is how Rollblock stands out, not only from other DeFi platforms but its centralized competitors. Holders of RBLK benefit from profit-sharing opportunities and cashback rewards that are built into the Rollblock platform. All token holders are paid a share of the revenue generated by the casino. This is automatic and is sent to all token holders. But there’s an even more lucrative way to build on passive income through Rollblock’s staking mechanism, earning up to 30% APY. Rollblock also employs a Buyback and Burn mechanism, which is used to pay the staking rewards, but the rest are burned from existence. This will help create scarcity, ensuring consistent demand for RBLK and a likely token value appreciation. With its unique use of blockchain, Rollblock and its in-demand gaming token have attracted substantial investment during its presale . With over $6 million raised and the price up 350%, Rollblock’s position as a dominant player in the DeFi and gaming sectors looks cemented once it launches.

While it has since corrected, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is still up 30% even with the heavy pullback across the entire market. No doubt SHIB can and very well bounce back, especially with the imminent launch of its TREAT token. Designed as a reward token within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, TREAT will enhance utility across its platform and drive utility to Shiba Inu. This should further excel the Shiba Inu price upwards as the bull market picks up pace yet again. Conclusion Gaming token Rollblock has the market excited. Now in stage 8 of its presale and all price targets smashed, this is setting up to be a bull market to remember for Rollblock investors. As for SHIB, it’s undergone a steady correction after rocketing up. Another boost is due to Shiba Inu’s price, thanks to its burgeoning ecosystem.

The growth aligns with analysts’ expectations of an imminent altcoin season. Data from Cryptorank reveals an 85% surge in the market capitalization of Grayscale’s crypto portfolio over the past month. Stellar’s XLM Token Surges Around 500% The standout performers include Stellar’s XLM token, which climbed an extraordinary 469%, and XRP, which posted gains exceeding 262%. Decentraland’s MANA token also contributed to the rally, jumping more than 105% during the same period. Analysts predict that an altcoin season, fueled by increasing investor confidence, could extend into early 2025. Ether (ETH), for instance, is projected to surpass $4,000 before January 20, when President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. One key indicator of this shift is Bitcoin’s dominance, which fell below its two-year support line on November 30. Analysts view this as a signal of profit-taking from Bitcoin positions, with funds being reallocated into altcoins. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, forecasts XRP could rally to $2.57 by the end of December, citing historical growth patterns tied to Bitcoin halving events. “XRP could reach approximately $2.57 during December 2024,” Lee said. “Historically, XRP has shown significant growth around 228 days after a Bitcoin halving.” Potential progress on XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is another anticipated catalyst. Asset manager 21Shares recently filed for an XRP ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 1. Fundamental changes in regulatory leadership may also play a role. SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to step down on January 20, and Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner known for his pro-crypto stance, is the leading candidate to succeed him. Analysts believe this transition could pave the way for more crypto-friendly regulations and ETF approvals, further boosting altcoin markets. Grayscale to Launch Bitcoin ETF Options As reported, Grayscale Investments is set to introduce options trading on its spot Bitcoin ETFs this Wednesday. The move came amidst a surge in investor interest, as indicated by the record-breaking performance of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) on its first day of options trading. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded nearly $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded on its debut, including 354,000 contracts, with a striking 4.4:1 call-to-put ratio. As reported, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is reportedly poised to approve Ripple Labs’ RLUSD , an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Ripple is preparing for a potential launch as early as December 4. The anticipated approval positions Ripple to enter New York’s heavily regulated digital finance market, further solidifying its presence in the broader stablecoin ecosystem. Ripple’s flagship business revolves around RippleNet, a decentralized payments network offering a faster and cost-efficient alternative to traditional banking systems like SWIFT. The network relies on blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border transactions. While RippleNet’s operations are closely tied to its native cryptocurrency, XRP, the token faces legal scrutiny in the United States.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) keep making headlines, experienced traders are turning to the market seeking the best altcoins to buy. Among them is a new crypto, DTX Exchange (DTX), which stands out as a game-changer, advancing the DeFi sector with its groundbreaking features and massive growth potential. Apart from DTX, Sui (SUI) and Render (RNDR) are positioning themselves as great investments, powered by considerable milestones and increasing investor confidence. Despite the many coins rising, DTX stands as the best cryptocurrency investment that will deliver huge profits in this bull cycle. Here is why! Sui Network Achieves Key Milestones, Attracting XRP Investors The Sui Network recorded multiple milestones recently, helping boost its position among the best altcoins with the best ROI in this bull run. In that context, its token, SUI, gained almost 90% within a month to hit highs of $3.927. Moreover, SUI’s transaction volumes exceeded 1.67 billion, a significant boost from the previous $395 million monthly average. Elsewhere, the Router Chain platform announced the addition of the Sui network to its growing list of cross-chain ecosystems, allowing users to move tokens between EVM chains and Sui smoothly. This integration offers Sui users a decentralized cross-chain experience, enabling them to access Sui’s connectivity directly via the Router Chain without needing to switch networks. Moreover, SUI’s Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeded $1.5 billion, proving there is investor trust in its security and potential profits. Analysts believe it might surpass $4.225 to outshine Dogecoin and XRP in the next bull run. SUI traded at $3.562 on November 28, up 0.17% in the past week. Analysts believe SUI will rise to $3.855 in December. Despite this long-term bullish SUI movement, investors have turned to DTX, which is considered the best cryptocurrency investment due to its massive growth potential. DTX Exchange: The New Crypto Revolutionizing DeFi with 1000x Leverage The crypto market bull run is here and DTX Exchange is turning heads. Even as XRP, Sui, and Render are rising, investors are turning to DTX as it prepares for exponential growth. DTX Exchange’s accelerated adoption rate has sparked a lot of hype in the crypto sector, making it top the list of the best altcoins to buy. DTX’s impressive presale rally attracted many investors to the new crypto. Analysts say the token will perform well in this bull run since its features and fundamentals will enable it to redefine the DeFi sector. Recently, DTX Exchange made headlines after it was listed on CoinMarketCap . It integrated groundbreaking trading options in a hybrid platform to offer lucrative investment opportunities, significant benefits, and access to many premium features. Also, the platform offers investors over 120,000 digital assets to choose from and up to 1000x leverage. Long-term investors and retail traders are buying the new crypto, dominating the best altcoins space, due to its massive growth potential. Furthermore, its accelerated growth has defied all market sentiment and DTX will dominate the current bull run. Render Breaks Resistance with Bullish Momentum For the Bull Run After several months of consolidation at $6.09, Render broke out after recording an 18% price increase from October 2024 highs. RNDR has seen a lot of action after breaking above the $7.05 resistance. On that note, more investors entered Render’s market in the November bull run, helping support its position as one of the best altcoins to buy currently. Market experts say RNDR could be on its way to record a new ATH above $13.01. This move seems likely to happen because many industry leaders are turning to RNDR during the current market-wide rally. The increasing demand for AI-generated media visuals also supports RNDR’s upside momentum and trend reversal. On November 28, 2024, RNDR was valued at $8.21, up 15.66% in the past week. Market experts believe that since RNDR broke the $7.51-$7.72 resistance zone, it could target $10.25 in December due to increased adoption. However, investors are also buying DTX due to its massive growth potential during this bull run. Forget Dogecoin and XRP: DTX Emerges as One of the Best Altcoins to Buy As the crypto market records increased volatility, the focus has shifted away from Dogecoin and XRP towards the best altcoins to buy due to their unrivaled growth potential. While Sui (SUI) and Render (RNDR) perform strongly in the market, coupled with investor confidence, a new crypto, DTX Exchange (DTX), emerges as the best investment option in this bull run. Currently available in Stage 5 of its public presale, DTX is selling at $0.10, a 400% ROI for early investors who acquired the new crypto at $0.02. Furthermore, Stage 5 investors will enjoy a 100% profit after the token gets listed on mainstream exchanges at $0.20. For those seeking massive profits, DTX is one of the best altcoins to buy and the best cryptocurrency investment in the market!

Notably, the market bulls have shown some resilience in the past few days producing a market gain of 5.9% to move the digital asset back above $96,000. Interestingly, as December begins, popular market analyst Ali Martinez has backed BTC to resume its uptrend reaching a potential price target of $140,000. Prepare For Bullish December – Analyst In an X post on November 30 , Martinez predicted Bitcoin is likely to maintain a positive performance going into the last month of 2024. So far, the crypto market leader has captured significant investor interest in Q4 2024, gaining by 10.76% in October and 37.99% in November. The BTC market has been strongly bullish, driven by several factors including the recent Fed rate cut in November , Donald Trump’s electoral victory, and high market inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Moving forward, December historically presents itself as a two-phased month for Bitcoin proven by an average return of 5.45% and a median return of -3.59% over the past 11 years. However, Martinez explains that Bitcoin has traditionally surged in any December following the US Presidential elections, as evidenced by gains of 30.80% and 46.92% in 2016 and 2020, respectively. If the premier cryptocurrency mirrors this similar pattern from these previous bull cycles, the analyst predicts Bitcoin to trade between $125,000 – $140,000 before 2024 runs out. According to data from the BTC weekly chart, the asset’s 100-day simple moving average (SMA) remains far above its price signaling an uptrend continuation in agreement with Martinez’s projection. However, a relative strength index (RSI) of 75.56 indicates Bitcoin has been overbought and is vulnerable to sudden price falls. Investors Withdraw $5 Billion Bitcoin From Exchanges In more positive news for the Bitcoin community, over 55,000 Bitcoins, valued at $5.34 billion, have been moved from crypto exchanges over the last three days. This development is largely interpreted as bullish as it reduces available Bitcoin supply on exchanges, potentially decreasing selling pressure. Moreover, it signifies investors’ anticipation of immediate price gains by BTC. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $96,203 following a 0.43% loss in the past 24 hours. In any further ascent, Bitcoin will encounter minor resistance at $97,300, which should provide no major opposition as the premier cryptocurrency is largely tipped to break above $100,000 sooner or later. Meanwhile, BTC’s daily trading volume, valued at $31.98 billion, is down by 41.27% indicating a decline in traders’ participation and general market activity.",Bitcoin|ali matinez|bitcoin|btcusd|BTCUSDT|December,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-01 15:00:19

With a trading volume of $40.1 billion in the last 24 hours, the live Ethereum price as of writing is $3,563.52. Reflecting great hopeful momentum, the price has jumped by 42.01%. With a market value of more than $429 billion, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization; the count of ETH coins in circulation is around 120.4 million. Although Ethereum's development path seems bright, everyone's main concern is whether ETH will hit $10,000 in the current bull cycle. But while Ethereum is becoming more popular, another player with even more explosive development potential is on hand: Rexas Finance (RXS). With estimates estimating a likely price surge to $22, an eye-watering 21,900% gain from its current presale price of $0.10, this creative idea is transforming real-world asset tokenization and could see an exponential climb. The Future Big Thing in Cryptocurrency: Rexas Finance (RXS) While Ethereum is emphasizing the digital economy, Rexas Finance is bringing the conventional financial scene under the crypto umbrella. With just one click, its creative method of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) lets anyone buy, sell, and trade physical assets including real estate, commodities, and even artwork. Opening access to the biggest markets in the world, like the $379.7 trillion real estate sector, $121.2 trillion in commodities like gold, and $65 billion in art and collectibles, is a whole fresh path for crypto investors. Rexas Finance seeks to close the gap between blockchain technology and actual assets so that users may wholly or fractionally own physical objects, therefore making them available to everybody, wherever. This strategy not only improves liquidity in conventional markets but also makes more inclusive and democratized investment chances possible. Rexas Finance is on the presale stage 8 right now; the RXS token costs $0.10. From its $0.030 presale price at stage 1, the coin has already climbed 240%. Rexas Finance has shown itself to be a quite appealing investment possibility with over $16.5 million raised out of its $20.75 million target as of writing. Moreover, the token is scheduled for debut at $0.20 on three of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges worldwide in early 2025, thus now is the ideal moment to participate in the presale and profit on early development. Why Should You Right Now Invest in Rexas Finance? Rexas Finance is positioned to upend several sectors with its fast expansion and creative application of blockchain technologies. But there's more: a strong ecosystem supporting the platform consists in: Anyone can tokenize their actual assets with Rexas Token Builder, a user-friendly tool free of a single line of code coding.

Rexas Finance is poised to create waves in the crypto market with its strong community emphasis and a good range of products. While Rexas Finance presents investors with an even more appealing growth possibility, the present Ethereum price projection points toward a future whereby ETH surpasses $10,000.

With the explosive growth of projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, many are eager to find the next big opportunity. Right now, all eyes are on BTFD Coin , which has made a sensational start to its presale, raising over $200,000 in just the first 24 hours. BTFD Coin is at the forefront of this meme coin revolution, having raised an impressive $300,000 so far in its presale journey, with over 8.5 billion coins sold to more than 700 holders. Currently in its fourth stage, the presale will unlock its fifth stage once 10 billion BTFD coins are sold. With an enticing price of $0.00005 and predictions suggesting an increase to $0.0006, BTFD Coin presents a compelling case for anyone searching for the best meme coins to join for long term growth. In this article, we’ll delve deeper into what makes BTFD Coin such an exciting prospect, while also exploring the strengths of Goatseus Maximus and Turbo. Each of these projects has established its own unique space in the world of meme coins, appealing to investors looking for alternatives to traditional assets. Let’s kick things off with a closer look at BTFD Coin, the new darling of the meme coin market. BTFD Coin: The Next-Gen Meme Coin Supremo BTFD Coin has quickly distinguished itself in the meme coin landscape, showcasing an impressive presale performance that highlights its potential. Within just 24 hours, it raised over $200,000, and with more than 8.5 billion coins sold, the excitement surrounding this project is palpable. The presale is carefully structured to unlock the fifth stage once 10 billion BTFD coins have been sold, creating a sense of urgency that motivates prospective investors. What makes BTFD Coin particularly compelling is its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. This feature allows users to earn cryptocurrency by participating in gameplay, effectively merging fun with financial rewards. Imagine playing a game where your achievements translate into actual earnings—this blend of gaming and investing is where BTFD Coin shines. The P2E model is gaining traction, and BTFD Coin is poised to be at the forefront of this trend. Staking rewards add another layer of appeal to BTFD Coin . Investors can earn passive income simply by holding their tokens, which creates a long-term incentive to remain engaged with the project. For example, let’s say you invest $200,000 at the current price of $0.00005. If the price rises to $0.0006 as anticipated, that initial investment could balloon to an astonishing $3.1 million. This potential return on investment underscores why BTFD Coin is being touted as one of the best meme coins to join for long term growth. BTFD Coin’s utility extends beyond mere trading; it’s about fostering a community. With 18% of the maximum supply allocated for staking rewards and 17% for gaming incentives, BTFD Coin is committed to building a loyal investor base. The coin’s strategy includes community incentives, airdrops, and burn mechanisms to keep holders engaged and invested. In a market often dominated by speculation, BTFD Coin’s focus on real-world utility sets it apart. It’s not just about the money; it’s about creating an ecosystem where the community thrives. This commitment to engagement and innovation positions BTFD Coin as one of the best meme coins to join for long term success. Goatseus Maximus: A Community-Centric Approach Shifting gears, let’s explore Goatseus Maximus, a meme coin that has captured the hearts of investors with its fun branding and community-driven ethos. Unlike other meme coins that focus solely on potential profits, Goatseus Maximus has built a loyal following by engaging its users and fostering a sense of belonging. The project thrives on community involvement, making it a go-to option for those who value connection as much as investment. Goatseus Maximus has successfully established itself in the marketplace by promoting a strong community narrative. Its marketing strategies leverage social media to create buzz and encourage participation. This engagement is vital in the meme coin ecosystem, where a dedicated community can significantly influence a project’s success. Goatseus Maximus understands this dynamic and actively promotes events and challenges that keep its users engaged. In terms of market positioning, Goatseus Maximus has found its stride by appealing to younger investors looking for alternatives to traditional investment vehicles. The project resonates with millennials and Gen Z, who are increasingly disillusioned with conventional finance. By aligning itself with social causes and community initiatives, Goatseus Maximus attracts a diverse investor base that seeks both financial return and social impact. Among the crypto community, Goatseus Maximus is known for its commitment to charitable contributions. By partnering with non-profits and promoting social good, the coin has carved out a unique identity that differentiates it from other meme coins. This focus on social responsibility not only enhances its image but also builds a strong, loyal following—an essential element for anyone looking for the best meme coins to join for long term gains. While it may not have the explosive presale figures of BTFD Coin, Goatseus Maximus excels in creating a culture of engagement and social impact. For investors who appreciate a blend of community spirit and investment potential, Goatseus Maximus is a compelling choice in the ever-changing landscape of meme coins. Turbo: Speed and Community at the Forefront Lastly, let’s talk about Turbo, a meme coin that’s all about speed and innovation. Turbo has quickly made a name for itself in the cryptocurrency market, appealing to those who thrive on quick returns and fast-paced investment opportunities. Its branding centres on the idea of rapid transactions and quick rewards, making it a popular choice for those looking to capitalise on the meme coin frenzy. Turbo’s community-driven model fosters active participation from its users. One of the standout features of Turbo is its governance structure, which allows holders to vote on key decisions regarding the project’s future. This democratic approach resonates with younger investors who value transparency and inclusivity in their investments. Turbo’s focus on community engagement is crucial, as it helps maintain interest and excitement around the project. Market positioning for Turbo is all about speed. Investors looking for fast-paced opportunities find Turbo appealing, but potential buyers should remain aware of the volatility that often accompanies such rapid projects. Turbo’s regular events and contests keep users actively involved, creating a vibrant community atmosphere that enhances user loyalty. While Turbo may not boast the initial excitement of BTFD Coin’s presale, its commitment to community and innovation makes it a noteworthy contender among the best meme coins to join for long term investment. Investors seeking a dynamic experience might find Turbo’s approach refreshing and engaging, particularly in a market that rewards quick decision-making. Conclusion As we conclude this exploration of the best meme coins to join for long term growth, it’s clear that the landscape is filled with opportunities. BTFD Coin stands out with its impressive presale performance and innovative features, while Goatseus Maximus and Turbo offer unique value propositions catering to different investor interests. Each of these projects brings something distinctive to the table, whether it’s community engagement, social responsibility, or utility. If you’re looking to dive into the exciting world of meme coins, now is the perfect time to consider your options.

Each of these tokens could have massive returns through different advantages unique to them. Rexas Finance: How it will change the tokenization of real-world assets Rexas Finance has taken a leading position in incorporating blockchain technology, providing a unique platform that connects physical-world assets to the digital space. It has 1 billion total supply tokens, of which 42.5% is for presale, 22.5% for staking pools, 15% for liquidity, 10% for treasury, and lesser amounts for marketing, team, giveaways, and partnerships. This distribution promotes balanced growth, and early investors benefit from a strong basis for long-term success. The presale is currently at stage 8, where RXS’s token presale price stands at $0.10 per token. The entire sale of tokens across all presale stages has raised more than $17 million, with around 261 million tokens sold, showcasing great investor confidence. In line with its plans, RXS is slated to be listed in 2025 with projections of $0.20 per token. Another of the advantages this token has is that it is an ERC-20 asset and regarding interoperability, it has the benefit of operating within the rule of the Ethereum ecosystem. As stated in its CertiK-audited documentation, security is a priority for Rexas Finance. This extensive audit provides guarantees to investors about the reliability and transparency of the platform. To further increase its popularity, Rexas Finance has announced a $1 million giveaway where 20 participants will receive 50,000 RXS tokens each. This program not only rewards early adopters but also builds the project’s credibility. Purchasing RXS tokens is straightforward. First, download an ERC-20-compatible wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Then, purchase Ethereum (ETH) or USDT from a reliable exchange, as these are the only accepted payments. Link a wallet to the Rexas Finance platform, indicate the number of tokens to buy, and finalize the purchase. The tokens purchased will then move to the wallet and can be tracked by adding RXS as a custom token on the monitor.

The network’s TVL has been growing gradually, further proving its appeal to developers and end users. Considering its constant growth, the price of TRON has reached $0.2013, with the total market capitalization standing at $17.37 billion. The stability of TRX’s price is further enhanced by collaborations with international payment gateways as well as successful tangential mergers with industry leaders indicating good potential for sustained long-term growth.

With the increasing demand for virtualization, VPS providers must ensure user privacy and security—a task that’s only getting more complex, with data breaches and invasive third-party tracking becoming increasingly common. For the same reason, finding a provider that prioritizes user privacy has become a critical task for VPS users. Cloudzy , a global VPS provider, has made this its mission by offering secure, high-performance hosting, incorporating decentralized cryptocurrency payment options. This allows users to maintain control over their data and financial transactions in an ever-evolving digital world. The Role of VPS Hosting in Supporting Traders Freelance crypto traders who work from anywhere in the world need a reliable way to connect to cryptocurrency exchanges and keep their trades running smoothly, even when they're sleeping or on the go. This is where a VPS comes in handy. With a Virtual Private Server (VPS), traders can access their accounts from anywhere with an internet connection, serving as a dedicated server for their trading activities. One of the primary advantages of a VPS is that it ensures an uninterrupted connection to cryptocurrency exchanges, which is especially beneficial if their home internet is unstable or if they're traveling. This connectivity helps them avoid missing valuable trading opportunities. Additionally, VPS servers are typically located closer to exchange servers, resulting in faster trade execution—a critical factor in the fast-paced world of crypto trading, where even milliseconds matter. Traders can also set up automated trading bots on a VPS, allowing them to trade around the clock based on predefined strategies, even when they're not actively monitoring the market. The Importance of Privacy in VPS Hosting User privacy has become a non-negotiable aspect for anyone navigating the online world. Whether they're a startup, developer, or enterprise, ensuring that sensitive information is safeguarded is critical. The importance of privacy in VPS hosting extends beyond just protecting website data; it’s about ensuring the integrity of user transactions, communications, and intellectual property. Providers must take every precaution to ensure that their users’ data remains secure, particularly given the increasing threats of cyberattacks, ransomware, and data breaches. VPS hosting users rely on their provider to protect not only their business-critical data but also personal information such as customer details and payment information. As a digital service, users rely on online transactions to purchase VPS services. This means sharing their personal information and financial data online. A breach in this data can lead to devastating financial consequences and reputational damage. Hence, it’s vital for VPS providers to implement strong encryption, secure storage protocols, and other advanced security measures to give users confidence that their personal and payment information will remain confidential and protected from any unauthorized access. Decentralized Technologies and Crypto Payments Decentralized technologies are reshaping how financial transactions are conducted, offering enhanced security and privacy compared to traditional payment methods. When purchasing a VPS with cryptocurrencies, users benefit from the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, which eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors. This decentralization means there’s no central authority that can access or control transaction details, reducing the risk of financial information being exposed to third parties or compromised during the transaction process. Cloudzy is fully aligned with the decentralized movement, recognizing the benefits that decentralized technologies bring to user security. By decentralizing data and eliminating single points of failure, Cloudzy works to ensure that its clients’ information is less vulnerable to attacks or exploitation. To reinforce this commitment, Cloudzy integrates cryptocurrency payments, giving users more control over their financial transactions. Utilizing crypto payment gateways such as BTCpay and Cryptomus, Cloudzy supports popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing a layer of anonymity and convenience for those who value decentralized financial tools. Cloudzy's Vision for a Secure Digital Future Cloudzy remains steadfast in its mission to prioritize privacy and security across its services. Understanding that users' data protection needs are growing with the increasing threats of cyberattacks and surveillance, Cloudzy has placed privacy at the core of its offerings. By utilizing decentralized technologies and robust security measures, Cloudzy aims to create an environment where users have complete control over their data and online activities. The company’s focus extends beyond just businesses and developers; it also caters to privacy-conscious individuals who seek a VPS provider they could trust.

Its global network of data centers ensures low-latency, high-performance hosting, and by supporting a wide range of payment methods—including traditional and decentralized options—Cloudzy caters to privacy-conscious individuals and businesses.

With major coins experiencing strong rallies and modern projects gaining ground, it’s a thrilling time for those interested in crypto. Enthusiasts are identifying high-potential opportunities that could yield substantial gains in this expanding market. Leading the way are BlockDAG, Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP, each offering distinctive advantages, from scalability to network dominance. These assets are gaining recognition for their growth potential during the bull run. Let’s explore why these cryptocurrencies are noteworthy and their role in optimal strategies for the bull run. 1. BlockDAG: Dominating in 2024 BlockDAG distinguishes itself with its hybrid blockchain and DAG technology. By integrating the security features of a blockchain with the scalability of Directed Acyclic Graphs, it achieves up to 15,000 transactions per second. This capability sets BlockDAG (BDAG) as a prime candidate for managing real-world demands while preserving decentralization. Currently valued at $0.0234, BDAG has yielded a 2240% gain for early participants. Its ongoing presale has gathered over $152 million from both individuals and organizations. The BLACKFRIDAY150 promotion, which offers a 150% bonus on purchases, is concluding in 2 days, providing a brief opportunity for advantages. The BlockDAG ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with the X1 Miner App reaching over 200,000 users. This achievement highlights its community engagement and user-friendliness. Analysts predict BDAG will hit $1 soon, with future estimates suggesting a rise to $20 by 2027. These projections support its potential for a 30,000x ROI, presenting a compelling opportunity for substantial gains. 2. Bitcoin: Dominance in the Market Bitcoin (BTC) is currently valued at $96,879, peaking today at $97,858. It maintains its lead in the crypto market as the most established and extensively used digital currency. Recent enhancements, including the greenlighting of Bitcoin ETFs, have rekindled enthusiasm. For instance, BlackRock’s ETF witnessed $1.9 billion in options exchanged on its debut, propelling BTC’s progression. Post the U.S. elections, Bitcoin has climbed 40%, driven by anticipations of a more crypto-supportive regulatory framework. Market experts posit that BTC might soon break the $100,000 threshold, positioning it as a formidable participant for continuous advancement in this bull market. Though Bitcoin may not offer the scalability seen in newer systems like BlockDAG, its network safety and widespread acceptance are unparalleled. For those prioritizing enduring dependability, Bitcoin remains a fundamental element of optimal strategies during bull runs. 3. Cardano: Architect of the Future Cardano (ADA) lists at $0.786, indicating a significant uptick in momentum amid the current bull market, with a 120% increase in the last fortnight alone. ADA is now a focal point for both traders and developers, thanks to its emphasis on sustainability and its research-based approach to development, earning a solid reputation within the blockchain community. Key achievements include its recent listing on Robinhood, enhancing its visibility and accessibility to a broader audience. Predictions indicate that ADA might climb above $2 by the end of 2024, with expectations for continued expansion as its ecosystem matures. Cardano is viewed as a stable choice for those seeking sustained value and scalability, making it a solid contender in strategies for capitalizing on bull run dynamics. While it may not deliver rapid, short-term spikes, its consistent progress and commitment to innovation stand out. 4. XRP: Primed for Expansion XRP is currently priced at $1.11, showcasing an impressive 80% increase in recent weeks. This climb is fueled by a positive outlook on regulatory decisions and increasing interest from institutional entities. Even amid ongoing legal discussions with the SEC, XRP remains resilient. The recent proposal by Bitwise Asset Management to introduce an XRP ETF underscores the rising institutional demand. Forecasts suggest that XRP could hit between $8 and $30 in future years, contingent on regulatory developments and broader market dynamics. XRP differentiates itself with its scalable framework and emphasis on enhancing international payments, positioning it as a notable option in the crypto sector. For those exploring the most promising assets for bull run success, XRP stands out for its unique solutions and potential lucrative returns. Essential Takeaways The 2024 bull run unfolds significant possibilities for navigating the crypto terrain. Leading with its cutting-edge approach and potential for substantial growth, BlockDAG is highlighted as the best crypto presale , making it an attractive option for maximizing returns. Bitcoin continues to offer stability and reliability, while Cardano and XRP contribute their unique strengths in scalability and practical applications. These digital currencies each fulfill a unique niche in the evolving market, but BlockDAG's blend of high scalability, potential for return, and robust ecosystem distinguishes it as a top contender. As the market momentum builds, these assets are crucial to monitor in the upcoming months.

According to data from DefiLlama, the platform has seen its weekly revenue drop by 66% following the decision to disable its livestream features. The platform decided to disable the feature following reports of illegal and harmful content being broadcasted to users by some developers. The company’s revenue notched a weekly high of $33 million in November. The Solana launchpad started November on a bright note, seeing its revenue peak by the end of the fourth week. DefiLlama’s data detailed the platform’s activities from November 18 to 24, where it posted $33 million in revenue for the week. The rise was a surge of 60% from the previous week and a 400% jump compared to revenue from the start of the month. Pump.fun registers a drastic weekly revenue drop Following its massive weekly returns in November, the platform’s revenue fell drastically this week. DefiLlama shows that the drop occurred from November 25 to December 1. The platform registered a weekly inflow of $11 million, undoing the gains it registered in November. The figure represents a massive 66% drop from the previous week. Pump.fun weekly revenue. Source: DefiLlama The decrease ensued after the platform announced it would remove livestream capabilities from the website. Before this decision, there had been several calls from Pump.fun users detailing the illicit activities playing out on live streams. For instance, some users threatened to harm themselves if the market cap of their tokens failed to hit a threshold by a certain time, while others were using it to carry out rug pulls, floating tokens, and draining liquidity. Livestream backlash and the can of worms in the crypto industry Pump.fun and the whole crypto sector were alarmed on November 25, after the safety manager of Pudgy Penguins Beau reported the case of a developer threatening to commit suicide. The developer took to the livestream to threaten users that he was going to commit suicide if his coin failed to hit a specific market cap target. Although the Pump.fun said adequate help had been provided to the streamer, there were reports of similar events. There were various users making threats of bodily harm, with others threatening to cause harm to others. A peculiar case on X was when a man threatened to shoot a dog if he failed to hit his target, while another user threatened a school shooting. Responding to the increased violent conduct, Pump.fun announced that the livestream feature has been disabled. The platform mentioned that upon its checks, it realized disturbing content and activities were being perpetrated live. Although live stream has been disabled indefinitely, Pump.fun hints at a comeback for the feature, but only when it has figured out effective moderation. Discussing the unfortunate incidents on the livestream, partner at Digital and Analogue Partners Yuriy Borisov said it is a legitimate cause to involve the police. He also said that aside from notifying authorities, there should be civil lawsuits against the perpetrators. Meanwhile, Trading Strategy co-founder Mikko Ohtamaa highlighted that the activities put Pump.fun at the risk of being shut down till regulators are sure it can moderate things.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 517,400 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE looks bullish as it trades within an ascending triangle pattern. The technical structure is often viewed as a bullish continuation pattern, suggesting that the asset is consolidating prior to a new upside burst. Says Rekt, “If this indeed turns out to be an ascending triangle on Dogecoin, then memecoins could enjoy another round of money flow. Needs a daily close above the pattern top ($0.43) to confirm a breakout.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.432, slightly above the pattern’s horizontal resistance. Looking at the broader memecoin market, Rekt says that the popular crypto sector is starting to regain bullish momentum. “Recently, altcoins have been breaking old resistances and turning them into new support. But memecoins have recently been losing supports teasing turning them into resistances. But the way memecoins are rallying now, they may be reclaiming these supports.” Turning to the interoperability blockchain Polkadot ( DOT ), the trader highlights that it needs to flip a key resistance level into support to have a shot at witnessing more rallies. “Polkadot has performed a weekly close above the black $8.60 resistance. Now in the process of retesting this level into new support. In 2021, this retest led price to new all-time highs. But earlier this year, we saw a failed retest and saw price sink to 2023 lows. DOT needs this retest to be successful to rally higher and a monthly close above black would increase chances for further upside.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, DOT is trading for $8.85. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ( FET ). The analyst says FET also needs to convert a previous resistance level into support to sustain its rallies. “Price will need to turn the upcoming $1.77 resistance (red) into support, much like back in March 2024.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, FET is worth $1.88.

Record-Breaking Exchange Support Artemis (ARTMS) has achieved something remarkable in the crypto presale world by securing deals with seven major cryptocurrency exchanges before its ICO phase ends. Seven Major Exchange Partnerships The partnerships show a balanced mix of Tier 1 and Tier 2 exchanges that serve different markets worldwide: Exchange Tier Market Focus Latoken Tier 1 Global CoinW Tier 1 Asian Markets Biconomy Tier 2 International Weex Tier 2 Emerging Markets Deepcoin Tier 1 Global FameEx Tier 2 European Focus UZX Tier 1 Cross-Regional Price Performance During Presale The presale phase has shown impressive results with Artemis collecting $920,000 . Early investors have seen their investments grow by 180% , making ARTMS one of the year’s best presale opportunities. Market Impact and Trading Volume Projections The multi-exchange strategy brings several benefits to the market: Bigger liquidity pools spread across platforms Better market access through various trading pairs More stable prices through spread-out trading Easier entry points for new investors globally The platform will burn 14 billion tokens and cut supply by 30% within two weeks of launch. This combination of smart tokenomics and ready multi-exchange liquidity should lead to strong trading volumes after launch. Investment Analysis and ROI Potential The Artemis (ARTMS) presale shows impressive investment metrics that need immediate attention. Market confidence remains high as the project secured $920,000 in funding. This makes it one of the best crypto presales of 2024. Historical Presale Performance Metrics The project’s community has grown remarkably with 60,000 active members in platforms of all types. Such member involvement exceeds typical presale metrics and shows strong market interest. Key performance indicators reveal: Community growth rate: 37% month-over-month Average investor commitment: Substantially above industry standard Platform involvement: Top 10% among 2024 presales Early investor returns: 158% from the original price Post-Launch Price Predictions Multiple price forecasts and complete market research point to substantial growth potential through 2030: Year Conservative Average Optimistic 2024 $0.09 $0.14 $0.21 2025 $0.13 $0.18 $0.25 2030 $2.80 $3.33 $3.85 Artemis’s deflationary mechanism supports these projections. The mechanism will burn 14 billion tokens and reduce total supply by 30% within two weeks of launch. This critical factor could stimulate value appreciation, especially with the project’s multiple revenue streams and practical e-commerce utility. Technical Infrastructure Deep Dive A peek under Artemis’s technical hood shows why this presale crypto project has got so much attention. We analyzed the platform’s sophisticated blockchain architecture and security protocols to get a full picture. Security Measures and Audits Our security analysis shows multiple protection layers: Advanced Encryption : Implementation of AES-256 for stored data and TLS/SSL for transmission Smart Contract Verification : Professional audits by Infinity Blockchain Solutions with zero critical vulnerabilities Decentralized Storage : IPFS implementation ensuring data integrity and accessibility Multi-factor Authentication : Improved account protection protocols Artemis’s security infrastructure has earned a ‘secured’ rating, making it one of the most reliable crypto presale opportunities in 2024. Recent audit reports confirm zero critical vulnerabilities, showing its steadfast dedication to user asset protection. Strategic Token Economics Artemis (ARTMS) showcases a smart and practical approach to value creation and sustainability. Our analysis of the project’s tokenomics structure reveals a well-balanced distribution strategy that aims for long-term development. Distribution Framework and Allocations The token distribution analysis shows a strategic allocation of 100 billion ARTMS tokens: Purpose Allocation Amount Marketing Initiatives 25% 25B ARTMS Project Development 25% 25B ARTMS Presale Distribution 15% 15B ARTMS User Rewards 15% 15B ARTMS Liquidity Pool 10% 10B ARTMS Staking Rewards 10% 10B ARTMS Deflationary Mechanisms This crypto presale stands out with two powerful deflationary mechanisms. The project plans to burn 14 billion unsold tokens right after launch. A systematic reduction will then decrease the total supply by 30% within the first two weeks. These measures will create a lack of tokens that could drive up value for early investors. Staking Rewards and Benefits The staking system offers several advantages to long-term holders: Auto-compounded rewards through a sustainable yield generation system Boosted network security through participant incentives Lower price slippage through smart liquidity management Smart contract-verified rewards distribution Our audit review confirms that the staking smart contracts have achieved a ‘secured’ rating. This adds more confidence for investors in this best crypto presale of 2024. Conclusion ARTMS, a crypto presale project, has caught our attention with its detailed analysis. The project excels with exceptional exchange support, resilient infrastructure, and well-planned tokenomics. Market indicators point to growth opportunities ahead. Seven major exchanges have already partnered with the project, which raised $850,000 in its presale phase. ARTMS operates on six major networks with its multi-chain architecture. The project’s deflationary mechanisms look promising. A planned burn of 14 billion tokens and 30% supply reduction should create value for investors who get in early. The project’s staking infrastructure and security protocols show its steadfast dedication to sustainability. ARTMS deserves attention from investors looking to explore emerging crypto opportunities before launch. This comes from its clear distribution framework and professional audit outcomes.

According to Delphi Digital’s latest report shared with CryptoPotato , in 2024 alone, daily transactions on Base have soared by 1,600%, climbing from 372,000 at the start of January to over 6.63 million in October. This makes Base a standout performer across several key metrics, including total value locked (TVL), active users, and transaction activity, where it has grown faster than the overall on-chain economy. Surge in Base’s Adoption Base’s TVL rose from $439 million in January 2024 to $2.51 billion by October, reflecting a 470% increase. Its share of the global on-chain TVL also expanded significantly, from 1.07% to 3.59%. While Base’s on-chain activity has been fueled by a rise in active addresses and stablecoin usage, its relatively modest TVL compared to larger networks highlighted its unique focus on non-monetary applications. The network’s usage boost is notably linked to the popularity of Aerodrome, which currently accounts for more than 40% of the network’s total TVL. Base’s growth in active addresses has been extraordinary, with weekly active addresses rising from 300,000 in January to 6.61 million at the end of October, a surge of 2,100%. This increase has significantly boosted Base’s share of all on-chain weekly active addresses, jumping from 1.6% to 11%. The figures for the number of new daily active addresses on Base surged by 5,300%, rising from 8,320 in January to 450,000 by October. This has resulted in the Layer 2 network’s market share of new daily active addresses growing from 1.2% to 6.5%. From January to October, Base’s daily transactions have skyrocketed from 2.1 million to 42.34 million, an increase of more than 1,900%. This growth has expanded Base’s market share in daily transaction volume from 0.67% to 9%. Delphi Digital said that the uptick not only signals Base’s increasing adoption and affordability but also depicts its ability to thrive alongside the success of other networks, such as those in the Superchain framework. Base’s Stablecoin Adoption Base has also seen a rapid acceleration in stablecoin adoption . As of November 11, its cumulative weekly stablecoin volume had grown from $620 million in January to $55 billion, representing a staggering over 8,800% increase. This growth has propelled the Layer 2 network’s stablecoin market share from 0.7% at the beginning of the year to 18% by November. “This increase in Base stablecoin volume is representative of Base’s efforts to increase network capacity while driving down costs. As a result, Base is well positioned to process mass payments between consumers and merchants utilizing stablecoins as a universal medium of exchange.” The post Base’s Rapid Expansion: 1,600% Growth in Daily TX Defines Ethereum Layer 2’s Breakout Year appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Base|Coinbase|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-01 15:45:00

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson urged other leaders in the crypto industry to unite and push for legislation that will ban conducting such activities. Operation Chokepoint 2.0: A Global Crackdown Hoskinson described Operation Chokepoint 2.0 as a “systematic campaign” that seems to be targeted attacks on the cryptocurrency industry. “So many people put their head in the sand for political reasons, saying it’s not as bad as the industry was making it out to be,” Hoskinson said in an X post. He explained that contrary to what most people believe, its operation was not limited to the United States alone, adding that it also spilled over internationally. He said that it is worse than what people anticipated, and it is a coordinated global campaign aimed at targeting cryptocurrencies. The global fallout from Operation Chokepoint 2.0.

It has… https://t.co/kKu2qGp8Ae — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 30, 2024 The crypto founder warned about the fallout brought by Operation Chokepoint 2.0, saying that the campaign hurt the economy and devastated businesses after the anti-crypto operation “harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed” so many companies. He added that it will take years to “undo the economic and emotional harm” done by the global campaign. Laws To Protect Crypto Needed The Cardano founder called on cryptocurrency leaders to unite and push for laws protecting digital asset firms from any future anti-crypto operation, saying, “We have a small window of time to get a law passed.” Hoskinson urged key figures in the crypto industry to lobby for legislative measures to prevent such anti-crypto activity from happening in the future. Collaboration among prominent crypto figures could help pass legislation, especially with President-elect Donald Trump pledging to support the industry and reform regulations for its growth. Crypto Leaders Slam The Operation A cryptocurrency firm executive confirmed Operation Chokepoint tried to suppress the crypto industry, saying that he was debanked by a lender outside the United States after receiving a cryptocurrency deposit. Binance executive Gabriel Abed shared his experience of being debanked by First Citizens Caribbean Bank, saying that the non-US bank shut down his decade-old accounts because he got a Bitcoin-related deposit. Can confirm this is true. It was one of the most unethical and un-American things that happened in the Biden administration, and my guess is we’ll find Elizabeth Warren’s fingerprints all over it (Biden himself was probably unaware). We’re still collecting documents via FOIA… https://t.co/2Rda7VU9MT — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) November 27, 2024 Abed said that international banks cut their ties with crypto clients because they have to comply with the “standards” set by US banks. “This isn’t just an American issue. It’s global,” Abed stated, which further supports the claims of the Cardano founder. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong described the debanking of those in the crypto industry as one of the most unethical moves in US history. Armstong claimed that a deliberate attempt to kill the crypto industry has been orchestrated by Senator Elizabeth Warren and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler.

At $36 trillion, it’s the highest in history, with no signs of slowing down. In 16 years, the debt-to-GDP ratio has doubled, now sitting at 121%. Compare that to World War II, when it maxed out at 119%. Back then, the country was fighting global tyranny. Now? The debt is ballooning because of poor fiscal planning and relentless spending. Since 2008, the federal debt has skyrocketed by $26.6 trillion, nearly tripling, while the economy only grew by $14.6 trillion. That’s a $12 trillion shortfall. Economists predict even worse to come. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says the debt-to-GDP ratio could hit 131% by 2034, assuming the economy avoids a recession. Debt is eating America’s budget alive Debt servicing is bleeding America dry. Every single day, the government spends over $1 billion just on interest payments. This year, the cost is expected to top $1 trillion, more than what the nation spends on defense. Think about that. America is putting more money into its debt interest than into securing its borders or upgrading its military. The situation’s even worse thanks to high interest rates. Since the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has increased rates, making borrowing more expensive. This is pushing up costs everywhere, from mortgages to groceries. Right now, the debt-to-GDP ratio is at 125%. Experts think it could hit 200% in a few years. That would mean the debt is twice the size of the entire economy. When that happens, the government will spend more on interest payments than on things people actually need, like infrastructure and education. On average, every American owes $108,000. That’s money being sucked away from investments that could build a better future. Instead of funding new roads, schools, or tech, the cash is going to creditors. Trump’s second term faces a storm President Donald Trump is walking into his second term with an economic time bomb. His administration is scrambling to control spending. Enter the Department of Government Efficiency, a new initiative led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Elon says they can slash billions from the budget. Proposed cuts include slashing public broadcasting and pulling funding from advocacy groups tied to abortion rights. But here’s the issue: Trump still wants more tax cuts. His new plan includes slashing corporate taxes to 15%. Critics are already sharpening their knives. They say it’ll blow up the deficit even more. Jessica Fulton from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies says these cuts would favor the wealthy and leave the country in a deeper financial hole. Even some Republican lawmakers are uneasy, calling the plan reckless when the deficit has already tripled. High interest rates are also creating roadblocks. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes, a key benchmark for borrowing, has jumped from 0.6% in 2020 to 4.4% recently. This means the government’s borrowing costs are through the roof. The same applies to everyday Americans. The administration isn’t out of ideas, though. One controversial plan involves refusing to spend money already approved by Congress. Another proposal targets funding cuts for energy and environmental projects tied to the Inflation Reduction Act. Both ideas could face legal challenges, but desperate times do call for desperate measures. The debt spiral threatens long-term growth The pandemic made everything worse. America’s debt jumped by $16 trillion during COVID-19, a surge unlike anything seen before. Over the past year, the debt has grown by $6.3 billion a day. That’s over $262 million an hour. Let that sink in. The debt isn’t just a domestic issue. It’s affecting America’s role on the global stage. Investors are starting to worry about the dollar’s stability. If confidence in the U.S. economy weakens, it definitely will affect global markets, causing chaos everywhere. From equities to crypto, everything will shake. And the global economy itself might tumble.
