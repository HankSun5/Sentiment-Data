According to reports, the meeting finished without Trump specifically saying he would hand off every tariff move he intended to make after being sworn in as president next year. Donald Trump has been vocal about his intentions to levy tariffs on specific countries, especially those with trading agreements with the country. Although Trump views the meeting as ‘productive’, he remains unsold on the idea of abandoning his tariff plans. Canada, on the other hand, has been lumped into the same category as countries like Mexico due to the increased flow of migrants and drugs into the United States. Justin Trudeau and Trump confirms positive conversations After the meeting between both leaders, positive intonations were echoed from both parties. While Trudeau described their conversation as ‘excellent’, Donald Trump said in a lengthy post on Trust Social that they discussed several topics they need to cooperate to tackle. Trump mentioned that one of the issues that needs to be addressed is fentanyl and the drug cartel that had destroyed many lives after entering the country illegally. Trump also confirmed they discussed fair trade deals that will not harm the American working population and the United States trade deficit with its supporters in the North. Trump revealed that Trudeau showed his commitment to helping the United States end the fentanyl menace that had destroyed many families. He said the Prime Minister assured him that the country will end the movement of fentanyl through its border into America. Donald Trump had planned a 25% tax on products entering the country’s borders from Canada and Mexico, a law that will take effect when he assumes office. The fentanyl scourge, without a doubt, has been America’s bane, with the country’s agents seizing 43 pounds of the product at the Canadian border. In addition, it also seized 21,100 pounds of the banned product at Mexico’s border. Detailing immigration numbers, border patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October while 23,731 individuals were arrested at the Canadian border from October 2023 to September 2024. However, Canadian officials mentioned new investments in security at its border to prevent these issues from happening. Trudeau details the implications of Trump’s tariff posts According to an anonymous source with inside knowledge, Justin Trudeau initiated the meeting with Trump following the latter’s post concerning Tariffs on Monday. The source mentioned that officials in other countries are interested in how the meeting was arranged, asking for advice. During the dinner, which sources said lasted about three hours, the officials talked about different topics including energy, and trade. The statement from Trudeau’s office mentioned productive discussions. Although Trump had bad words for the Canadian Prime Minister during his first tenure, Trudeau was the first to congratulate him. Before the meeting, Trudeau noted that Trump did not talk about tariffs during his campaign but suddenly wants to add 25% to the costs of goods coming into the country. He said that he feels Trump is serious about the tariff, noting that if the American president-elect says he wants to do something, nothing is stopping him. However, he pointed out that the move could hurt Americans and Canadians. “Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,” he said. If Trump goes ahead with the Tariff move, it could prove costly, destroying the trade pact both countries signed during his first term in office. However, Trudeau mentioned that they were able to renegotiate a deal, saying it was a win for both countries. During his first spell as president, Trump imposed higher tariffs and other countries cranked up theirs too. Canada announced billions in new duties against America in response to taxes on steel and aluminum from the country. Canada is the top export destination for most of the US states, accounting for $2.7 billion worth of goods every day. Canada is trade-dependent, with 77% of its goods being moved into the United States.

Ondo Finance (ONDO) Ondo Finance is changing the game by combining the stability of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. It takes reliable, income-generating assets from the real world and turns them into tokens on the blockchain. This means more people can access high-quality financial products that were once only available to a few. By using blockchain, Ondo makes financial systems better and more accessible to everyone. It has two main parts: one creates tokenized financial products, and the other builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to make these products more functional and scalable. In a market that's often uncertain, Ondo stands out by focusing on trust and security. It works with well-known partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase to keep crypto assets safe. Ondo sets high standards for transparency and follows legal and regulatory rules closely. One of its key products, USDY, acts like a stablecoin but offers yields. It's backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits, giving it stability. For non-US investors, this means access to top-quality, regulated, and clear financial products. With the current interest in secure and transparent crypto options, Ondo's approach could appeal to many looking for reliable investments in the blockchain space. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, known by its token AVAX, is turning heads in the blockchain world. It's a Layer-1 platform that's eco-friendly, boasts low fees, and processes transactions at lightning speed—up to 4,500 per second. One standout feature is its ability for users to launch customizable Subnets, offering flexibility and scalability. Avalanche uses a unique consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto methods, ensuring transactions are finalized in less than two seconds. The platform operates with three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—which handle different tasks like transactions and smart contract execution. AVAX serves as the backbone of the Avalanche ecosystem. It's used for paying transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and powering multiple Subnets. This strong utility positions AVAX well in the current market. With the growing demand for fast and affordable blockchain solutions, Avalanche stands out among competitors. Its eco-friendly approach and rapid transaction times address key challenges in the industry. While markets are always shifting, Avalanche's technology and versatility make it a noteworthy player in today's crypto landscape. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects these digital agreements to real-world data. This means a smart contract can access information like weather reports or stock prices. Chainlink does this through a network of oracles, which are like messengers that bring data from outside sources to the blockchain. They use a reputation system to make sure the data is accurate and reliable. In the current market, Chainlink stands out because it solves a big problem: getting real-world data onto blockchains. This makes smart contracts more useful and opens up new possibilities. Unlike many other coins that focus on payments, Chainlink focuses on data and functionality. Its token, LINK, rewards those who provide data and helps secure the network. As more businesses look to use blockchain technology, the demand for Chainlink's services could grow. This unique approach makes LINK an interesting option to watch in today's market. Mantra (OM) MANTRA is a new blockchain platform that puts security first. It's designed to meet real-world regulatory requirements, making it a trustworthy choice for institutions and developers. With MANTRA, you get a blockchain that's open to everyone but can also support applications that need special permissions. This means businesses can build on MANTRA without worrying about breaking any rules. What makes MANTRA stand out is its strong technology foundation. It's built using the Cosmos SDK, which means it's compatible with other blockchains and supports smart contracts through CosmWasm. It can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, so it's ready for large-scale use. Plus, it offers tools to create and manage assets that comply with regulations. In today's market, where many are looking for secure and compliant blockchain solutions, OM, the coin of MANTRA, looks promising. It could be a strong competitor to other coins that don't focus on regulatory compliance, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion While ONDO, AVAX, LINK, and OM are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as a groundbreaking memecoin poised for exceptional growth in the 2024 bull run.

Helium (HNT) Price Prediction, Eyes on 18% Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News HNT, the native token of Helium, a blockchain-based network and leading DePIN token is poised for a notable upside rally as it has formed a bullish price action pattern. Helium (HNT) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, HNT has broken out of a consolidation zone that it formed after breaking out of a falling channel price action pattern. This consolidation breakout has shifted the overall sentiment for HNT toward the bullish side. Source: Trading View Based on historical price momentum, the recent price action which began with a breakout followed by consolidation, is considered one of the more successful patterns. Following this development, there is a strong possibility that HNT could soar by 18% to reach the $8.10 level in the coming days. On the positive side, HNT’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a potential upside rally in the coming days, as its current value stands at 60, below the overbought mark of 70. Bullish on-Chain Metrics However, HNT’s bullish price action appears to have attracted significant trader interest over the past 24 hours, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Rising Open interest Recent data shows that HNT’s open interest (OI) has surged by 31% in the last 24 hours and 9.2% in the past four hours. This growing OI reflects traders’ strong confidence and interest in the top DePIN token amid a bullish price action pattern. HNT Spot Inflow/OUt flow In addition to traders, whales and long-term holders are providing further support for this altcoin, as revealed by the Coinglass data center. According to HNT spot inflow/outflow data from exchanges since the beginning of November 2024, there has been a significant outflow from exchanges. Source: Coinglass The data also shows that, out of the past 30 days, exchanges experienced inflows on only 7 days, with the remaining 23 days marked by continuous outflows. This trend suggests that whales have significantly accumulated HNT tokens over the past month, during which the HNT price has remained stable. Current Price Momentum At press time, HNT is trading near $7.20 and has experienced a price surge of over 10.5% in the past 24 hours.

According to on-chain data, the breakout occurred as derivatives trading volume surged by over 420% to $983.06M, reflecting renewed interest from market participants. Additionally, open interest in THETA derivatives rose by 75.35% to $108.91 million, indicating that more traders are taking positions in the asset. This spike in activity coincided with THETA’s price moving past critical resistance levels at $2.40 and $2.50, confirming the start of a strong uptrend. Analysts Predict Further 348% Upside Concurrently, technical analysts are optimistic about the potential for further gains in THETA’s price. The chart provided by “World of Charts” indicates that the breakout from the descending triangle could lead to a rally targeting $9.00, a projected 348% surge from current levels. The measured move from the triangle’s base supports this bullish outlook. Javon Marks, a market analyst, pointed out that THETA’s ability to break its long-term trendline suggests a reversal of bearish momentum. Marks noted, “The steep upward trajectory and higher highs confirm that the bulls are in control, and the rally could extend to $8.00 in the near term.” He also highlighted that the price has yet to encounter significant resistance, which could enable continued growth in the short term. THETA Price Technical Analysis THETA’s technical indicators further support the bullish outlook. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is significantly above its signal line, confirming strong upward momentum. The widening gap between the MACD and the signal line suggests that the uptrend remains intact. Additionally, the Money Flow Index (MFI) is at 93.69, which places THETA in the overbought zone. While this indicates strong buying pressure, analysts caution that a minor pullback or consolidation could occur before the next leg up. THETA/USD (source: TradingView) Concurrently, the 50-day moving average is also approaching a bullish crossover with the 200-day moving average, signalling the potential for a “golden cross.” This technical pattern is often a precursor to sustained price increases hence backing the potential THETA price breakout.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. It started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, with half sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB's profile. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for NFT platforms and decentralized governance. These features contribute to its potential appeal in the current market cycle. Stellar (XLM): A Decentralized Network for Global Fund Transfers Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized blockchain network enabling quick, low-cost global fund transfers. It supports any currency, including national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Since 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major companies. Unlike cryptocurrencies that aim to replace financial systems, Stellar connects them, offering a unified network for collaboration. Individuals can transfer funds worldwide using Stellar apps. Businesses can develop blockchain applications or use the network for payments and currency conversion. The Stellar Development Foundation promotes network use, including NFT creation and smart contracts. With its focus on enhancing existing systems, Stellar's technology shows potential in the current market cycle. Terra Classic (LUNC): A Blockchain for Stable Global Payments Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain protocol that employs fiat-pegged stablecoins to enable price-stable global payment systems. Launched in April 2019, it merges the price stability of traditional currencies with the censorship resistance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Terra Classic offers fast and affordable settlements using stablecoins pegged to various currencies, including the U.S. dollar and South Korean won. In May 2022, the original Terra chain was rebranded to Terra Classic after launching a new chain named Terra (LUNA). The platform's technology aims to enhance financial accessibility by providing a decentralized system for global payments, leveraging blockchain to facilitate efficient and stable transactions worldwide. PEPE Memecoin: Embracing the Pepe the Frog Phenomenon on Ethereum PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Launched without transaction taxes and embracing a lack of utility, PEPE maintains a pure memecoin identity. In mid-2023, it achieved a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, igniting a memecoin frenzy and building a vibrant community. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. Unique features like a burning mechanism enhance scarcity, while a redistribution system rewards long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake security. Its presence on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin makes it accessible to many. In the current market cycle, PEPE continues to engage crypto enthusiasts. Conclusion Although SHIB, XLM, LUNC, and PEPE may become well-known by 2025, their short-term potential seems limited. In contrast, DOGEN is crafted for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and potential for massive returns, it builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

Initially designed as a three-year initiative, the company could achieve this goal in four months, thanks to its aggressive purchasing pace. This bold move is set to transform MicroStrategy’s financial future, with the company betting big on assets’ long-term value . Michael Saylor’s Strategy: A Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin journey began in August 2020, and the company has consistently made headlines with its purchases. This month alone, the firm spent $12 billion on BTC, including its most recent purchase. On Nov. 11, the company purchased 27,200 BTC for $2 billion, followed by another $4.6 billion worth of BTC on Nov.18 . Five days ago, the firm acquired another 55,500 BTC for $5.4 billion. These purchases are part of a strategy to consolidate its position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy follows a plan to acquire more Bitcoin, reflecting the vision of its executive chairman, Michael Saylor. With its latest acquisition, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 386,700 BTC, valued at nearly $22 billion at the current market price. MicroStrategy is willing to invest its financial resources in the acquisition of BTC. The company funded one of its latest Bitcoin purchases by leveraging its at-the-market share issuance program. To raise the required capital, MicroStrategy sold about 13.6 million shares. MicroStrategy Bet Big on Bitcoin, the Future of Digital Gold MicroStrategy’s approach also underscores its firm belief that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset. The firm believes BTC is a transformative financial instrument with the potential to reshape global finance. By accumulating over 380,000 BTC, the company has positioned Bitcoin as a cornerstone of its treasury reserve strategy . It is treating it as “digital gold,” a store of value that can withstand inflation and economic uncertainty. With Bitcoin trading near $100,000, MicroStrategy’s investment has more than doubled in value, turning its holdings into a formidable financial asset. However, this strategy has significant risks. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, with price swings that can lead to substantial losses as quickly as gains. Despite the risks, MicroStrategy’s bold moves have captivated attention. Crypto enthusiasts see the company as a pioneer and a symbol of Bitcoin’s growing mainstream adoption.

37065229,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655900,1733005852,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Breaks Multi-Year Resistance – Main Target Remains $2,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/xrp-breaks-multi-year-resistance-main-target-remains-2/,"XRP has broken through a key resistance level, reaching price points not seen since its multi-year highs set in 2021. The cryptocurrency has been on an aggressive upward trajectory for over three weeks, signaling strong bullish momentum in the market. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring XRP’s price action, as it shows no signs of slowing down. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a compelling technical analysis, suggesting that XRP is poised to reach the $2 mark in the near future. His analysis highlights XRP’s robust breakout above critical resistance levels, supported by strong trading volume and positive market sentiment. Martinez believes this momentum could propel the token to achieve its next significant milestone much faster than anticipated. As the altcoin market continues to flourish, XRP stands out as one of the top-performing assets , drawing increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether XRP can sustain its bullish pace and surpass further resistance levels. With technical indicators aligning with optimistic projections, XRP appears ready to continue its ascent, cementing its place as a leading cryptocurrency in this market cycle. XRP Testing Past Cycle’s Top XRP has reached an impressive $1.93, testing critical supply levels that marked the top of its last cycle. In 2021, Ripple was entangled in legal challenges with the SEC, creating uncertainty for the cryptocurrency. However, the landscape has shifted significantly since then, with Ripple gaining favorable momentum in the lawsuit and renewed investor confidence, propelling XRP to new heights. Martinez has provided an optimistic outlook, sharing a technical analysis on X that suggests XRP will likely surpass the $2 milestone soon. Martinez identifies this level as a key target as the cryptocurrency’s momentum builds. The price of XRP has surged by over 280% in less than a month, reflecting the strength of its current uptrend. Analysts are closely monitoring whether XRP can break above the psychological $2 mark, a level that would signal a continuation of its rally toward multi-year highs. The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP is further supported by increasing trading volume and strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. As the token approaches multi-year highs, the focus shifts to whether it can sustain this rally and break through the crucial resistance zone. For now, XRP continues to show remarkable resilience and upward potential, positioning itself as a standout performer in the crypto market. Technical Details XRP is trading at $1.93, following a remarkable 16% surge yesterday and an additional 7% rise today. The cryptocurrency continues its aggressive push toward the critical $2 level, capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. This sustained rally reflects growing confidence in XRP’s potential as it tests supply zones that once marked last cycle’s peak. Despite the bullish momentum, there’s a strong possibility that XRP may consolidate below the $2 mark for a few days. Such a pause could set the stage for a more explosive move as the broader crypto market gears up for a potential breakout. Historically, consolidations at key resistance levels often precede significant price rallies, and the current setup aligns with this pattern. XRP’s aggressive break above the $1.62 level was a pivotal moment, reinforcing bullish sentiment across the market. Many investors now expect XRP to challenge and surpass its previous cycle’s all-time high (ATH), setting the stage for a new price discovery phase. With momentum on its side and increasing interest from both retail and institutional players, XRP’s path forward could redefine its position in the market, marking a significant milestone in its price journey.

It is designed to be fast, low-cost, open, and borderless. Operating on a decentralized system without a central authority, XRP makes transactions irreversible and secure. It does not require a bank account for settlements, allowing for seamless transfers across different currencies. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled supply release. The name XRP, derived from ""ripple credits,"" reflects its aim to facilitate smooth payment transfers worldwide. Exploring ADA: Cardano's Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts. It helps developers make decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. ADA is its native cryptocurrency. Like Ethereum's ETH, ADA lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. This is different from energy-heavy proof-of-work models. The blockchain has two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This setup can boost transaction processing up to 1,000,000 transactions per second. Cardano's native tokens allow secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. Conclusion While XRP and ADA have been influential in the crypto arena, their short-term growth potential appears limited. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a technologically advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities. By utilizing AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO maximizes earnings. Its features include attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. Users enjoy a superior experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO stands out as a promising project.

In his latest comments, Anthony Pompliano explained the math behind the strategy and the potential risks associated with it. Pompliano acknowledged that the strategy could be lucrative but warned that there are risks investors must consider before fully embracing it. Anthony Pompliano Discusses the Risks Behind MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy In a recent interview , Anthony Pompliano analyzed MicroStrategy’s approach of using convertible debt to purchase Bitcoin. The company has been selling future equity at a 55% premium to fund Bitcoin acquisitions, an attractive proposition from a financial standpoint. By selling shares at higher prices than its current stock value, MicroStrategy is able to generate significant capital to buy Bitcoin. Anthony Pompliano emphasized that this method makes sense mathematically but warned investors about the risks that are often overlooked. He pointed out there are many unknowns that could impact the outcome of the Bitcoin Strategy. The key concern raised by Pompliano is that many investors blindly believe that nothing can go wrong with this strategy. He warned against this, stating, “Now, the counterweight to that is there’s a hell of a lot of people I see saying nothing can go wrong. I’m not in that camp. I couldn’t sit here and tell you what can go wrong, but what I can tell you is that an alarm goes off in my head when I start seeing everyone saying nothing can go wrong.” Despite these speculations, recently, the Bitcoin advocate revealed that Donald Trump holds Bitcoin and is a strong supporter of the cryptocurrency. According to Anthony Pompliano, Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance could reshape U.S. economic policies and lead to the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. Extreme Risks Associated With The Bitcoin Strategy One of the extreme risks Anthony Pompliano highlighted is the possibility of Bitcoin being banned in the United States. While he noted that this is unlikely to happen, he mentioned that such an event would damage MicroStrategy’s stock price. In a recent report, IntoTheBlock highlighted four major risks that MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy poses to the crypto market. Despite these being low-probability risks, Pompliano stressed that it’s essential for investors to consider the most extreme scenarios. Additionally, Pompliano suggested that the risks associated with this strategy are amplified by the crypto market volatility. While it is difficult to predict all risks, BTC volatility and the regulatory uncertainty must be taken into account. Amid the discussion, the Capital Management founder and CEO recently proposed that the United States should consider creating a Bitcoin reserve. He called for the U.S. government to allocate $250 billion to purchase Bitcoin as an hedge against dollar devaluation.

CYBRO is set to challenge the dominance of established platforms like Polkadot and Polygon. With such impressive early support, could CYBRO redefine the future of blockchain technology? The crypto community is watching closely to see if this newcomer will deliver on its promise. CYBRO Presale Climbs Past $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million DeFi Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This cutting-edge multichain DeFi platform offers investors unparalleled opportunities to maximize their earnings across various blockchains in any market condition.

It enables secure communication between different blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. This means value and data can be shared across chains. Polkadot uses parachains to boost speed and scalability, handling more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within the network. Holders can participate in developing the protocol and verifying transactions. Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, developed Polkadot. The Web3 Foundation maintains it. Polkadot aims to create more connected and efficient blockchains, improving how they work together. Exploring Polygon's Utility Token: Staking, Governance, and Exclusive Access The Polygon Ecosystem Token is a digital asset used within the Polygon network. It plays a key role in various operations across the ecosystem. Holders can use it for staking, locking up their tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards based on the amount staked. The token also allows holders to participate in governance, voting on proposals that shape the network's development. Additionally, it provides access to exclusive services and features within the ecosystem. As the network grows and adds more applications, the token's demand may increase due to its multiple uses within the ecosystem. Conclusion In the current bullish market of 2024, projects like CYBRO are capturing attention for their advanced features and strong potential. While coins like DOT and POL may offer less short-term growth, CYBRO distinguishes itself as a cutting-edge DeFi platform. By leveraging AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, it provides investors with unparalleled opportunities to maximize earnings. Its user-friendly experience includes seamless deposits and withdrawals, lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. With a strong emphasis on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO is attracting significant interest from crypto whales and influencers.

Heavyweights like $FIL (+19.67%) and $WLD (+26.08%) are dominating the spotlight, but the AI crypto sector, once dormant, has now awakened with a vengeance. Yesterday, we delved into Fetch.ai ($FET – link here ), showcasing its potential to redefine the AI blockchain sector. Today, the spotlight shifts to Render Network ( $RNDR )—the "" Nvidia of blockchain computing."" With Ethereum ($ETH ) approaching 0.040 BTC , signaling a potential altseason breakout, Render is gearing up to test its $10 psychological barrier, a critical level for reclaiming its March 2024 highs. Let’s dissect the setup for this fascinating AI infrastructure project and its roadmap toward a potential breakout. Render Network’s Core Value Proposition Render Network decentralizes GPU rendering by connecting creators and GPU node operators, leveraging blockchain technology to monetize idle computing power. It’s tailor-made for the growing AI-driven content creation sector. Key Metrics: Circulating Supply: 517.69M Market Cap: $4.69B Max Supply: 644.17M Render boasts strong tokenomics with minimal inflation risks. Coupled with its real-world utility in GPU rendering and AI applications, $RNDR is uniquely positioned to ride the next wave of AI and crypto adoption. Technical Breakdown: Where Are We Now? 1W Chart: The Battle for $10 The weekly chart shows a methodical recovery from its August 2024 lows at $3.40, a spring point in a textbook Wyckoff Accumulation schematic. Key Support Levels: The $6.90-$7.15 zone aligns with the 50W MA ($6.95) and previous resistance turned support, forming a strong base for accumulation. Critical Resistance Zones: $8.30-$9.90: Render is currently battling within this range, a pivotal zone left by March’s explosive “God Candle.” $10: The psychological threshold where confidence will either surge or falter. $13.85: The all-time high, a likely target for bulls once $10 is conquered. RSI: Slightly above 60, indicating momentum without overextension. Volume & Momentum: Weekly volumes are picking up post-U.S. election but remain below November 2023 levels, leaving room for explosive moves. As the 50W MA rises, dynamic support strengthens, increasing the probability of long-term upside. 1D Chart: The Anatomy of a Breakout Render’s daily chart highlights precise technical developments: Golden Cross Incoming: The 50D MA ($6.06) is set to cross above the 200D MA ($6.63), signaling the return of a long-term bullish trend. Dynamic Supports: The $6.90-$7.15 zone continues to align with horizontal support, bolstered by diminishing pullback volumes and volume spikes on breakouts. Battle for $10: Price is testing this psychological level, with RSI confirming strength. A breakout above $10 could trigger Price Discovery Mode. Explosive Rhetoric Alert: A clean break above $10 may lead to quick leg-ups toward $12 and $13.85, but volatility remains a factor—so patience is key. Render vs. Bitcoin (RNDR/BTC): Relative Strength Render’s BTC pairing highlights its relative outperformance: Support Flip: Render flipped 322 SATs (50W MA) into support, with minimal resistance toward 380 SATs. Volume Profile: Minimal resistance above current levels signals potential for accelerated price movement relative to Bitcoin. 3 Key Takeaways from Both Charts Consolidation Zones Building Momentum: Both charts highlight Render consolidating within major resistance zones ($8.30-$9.90), setting the stage for an explosive move. Golden Cross & Wyckoff Spring: The upcoming Golden Cross and Wyckoff Accumulation spring ($3.40 lows) are powerful confluences, signaling a strong bullish setup. Dynamic Supports Rising: Fast-rising moving averages bolster $6.90-$7.15 as a high-probability entry point for disciplined traders. 3 Entry Strategies for $RNDR 1. Closing Above $10 Rating: 8/10 – ""Parabolic Potential."" Rationale: A confirmed close above $10 signals strength and Price Discovery Mode, targeting $12 and $13.85. Stop Loss: $9.50 – Manage volatility. Advice: Wait for volume confirmation. Without it, false breakouts can be devastating. Take Profit Levels: $12.00-$12.50 – Immediate resistance zone. $13.85 – March ATH. $15-$16 – Short-term overshoot. 2. $6.90-$7.15 Zone (Dynamic + Horizontal Support) Rating: 9/10 – ""Solid Foundation."" Rationale: A confluence of horizontal support and the fast-rising 50W MA ($6.95). Stop Loss: $5.80 – Wide enough to avoid noise. Advice: Use laddered entries and monitor price action. Institutions are likely accumulating here. Take Profit Levels: $10-$11.95 – Psychological & technical resistance. $13.85 – March ATH. $20+ – If the trend accelerates. 3. $5.90-$5.00 (Stink Order Zone) Rating: 7/10 – ""Patience Pays Dividends."" Rationale: Flash crash levels aligned with historical pivot points and rising dynamic support. Stop Loss: $4.50 or monitor live. Advice: These levels are rare opportunities but require patience. Take Profit Levels: $8-$9.90 – Quick recovery zone. $11.95-$12 – Pre-ATH levels. $13.85+ – Aiming for the moon. Optimistic 2025 Targets Triple Market Cap Target: $27-$30 – A realistic target if Render triples its market cap. Parabolic Blow-Off Top: $50-$60 – The speculative climax of a 2025 bull run, driven by AI hype. Summary: The Battle for $10 Render’s battle for $10 is more than psychological—it’s the gateway to reclaiming its ATH and entering Price Discovery Mode. A clean break, supported by volume, could trigger the next leg up in its bullish cycle. Key Takeaways: Accumulate Smart: Focus on strong support zones like $6.90-$7.15. Don’t Chase Pumps: Wait for confirmations. Execute Strategically: Stick to your plan—volatile markets reward discipline. As November’s ""Moonvember"" comes to a close, here’s to another spectacular month ahead. Stay disciplined, and get ready for the next AI coin spotlight: Opulous ( $OPUL )—a project with even bigger potential than Render.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 23:07:03

The class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Friday evening and names OpenAI, its CEO Sam Altman, President Greg Brockman, Microsoft, and several others associated with the companies. Tesla CEO’s lawyers say that OpenAI has changed its focus from a non-profit organization and is using tactics that are damaging to the competition in the AI sector. Elon Musk Files Lawsuit Against OpenAI and Microsoft According to Elon Musk’s lawyers, OpenAI and Microsoft are engaging in market manipulation to deter investments into competing AI ventures, including Musk’s xAI. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI coerced investors into not supporting rivals such as xAI that has recently secured funding. Musk’s attorneys refer to the fact that OpenAI compelled investors in its last funding round not to invest in competing AI ventures, which presents a challenge to organizations like xAI. Additionally, the injunction aims at stopping OpenAI and Microsoft from taking other actions that may be detrimental to the market such as sharing of property information and invention. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI has changed the governance of the platform to that of a for-profit business model which is the opposite of what was promised initially. Musk’s legal team claims that this shift violates the initial mission of OpenAI to contribute its AI technologies to the public for the common good. Microsoft’s Role and Financial Interests Another key factor of Musk’s case is the vast financial support that Microsoft has provided to OpenAI. Since 2019, Microsoft has pumped in more than $13 billion into OpenAI and in the process has booked itself a large share of the company’s revenue. The complaint states that Microsoft has been using this partnership to acquire information and assets from OpenAI, including the AI models, hosted on Microsoft’s cloud services. The filing also reveals possible concerns over conflicts of interest. For example, it discusses how Sam Altman, the chairman of OpenAI, has a financial interest in Stripe, the company that OpenAI used for payments. Musk’s team claims that Altman’s relationship with Stripe will create a conflict that can influence OpenAI in a wrong way and hinder competition within the market. These allegations suggest a wider scheme of self-enrichment that Musk’s lawyers state is damaging the AI environment. xAI’s Growth and Investor Backlash Although xAI has struggled with fundraising, the company has recently announced that it has closed a $5 billion funding round, with investment from firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Fidelity. Despite Musk’s allegations that OpenAI’s actions have made some investors refrain from investing in xAI, the recent funding received by the company indicates that it has not faced challenges in raising capital. The lawsuit also mention that Musk’s xAI, which was founded last year, has created its own generative AI named Grok. This model supports several features on Musk’s social network X (previously Twitter). Although xAI is already a financially backed company in the AI field, Musk’s team claims that the current OpenAI’s practices may be detrimental to the company’s future. Despite these claims, Sam Altman’s OpenAI recently announced a $1.5 billion investment facilitated through a tender offer. The move allowed employees to sell shares to SoftBank, which now holds a significant stake in the company. This transaction adds another layer of complexity to Musk’s claims, as his legal team contends that OpenAI is further distancing itself from its original nonprofit mission in favor of financial gain.

But with so many coins out there, it’s easy to wonder: which ones are worth it? Two cryptos are making waves for their unique functionalities and solid potential among the sea of digital assets. Toncoin has emerged as a leader in blockchain-based communications, offering seamless integrations for messaging platforms. Stellar, meanwhile, continues to innovate in cross-border transactions, providing fast and affordable financial solutions. But let’s talk about Qubetics ($TICS)—the rising star that’s redefining the Web3 space. With an ecosystem that boasts groundbreaking tech like a decentralised VPN (dVPN) and an electrifying presale that’s got analysts predicting jaw-dropping returns, this one’s making serious excitement. This article will dive into Qubetics, Toncoin, and Stellar to help you discover your next top crypto to invest in. Qubetics: The Future of Web3 Privacy and Security Qubetics is setting a new standard in Web3 infrastructure with its revolutionary decentralised VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralised systems that can log user data, censor access, or even suffer from single points of failure, Qubetics flips the script. Its dVPN runs on a peer-to-peer, blockchain-powered network where no central authority has control. What does that mean for you? Total freedom and privacy online. Your data is encrypted end-to-end, ensuring anonymity while bypassing censorship. Multi-hop routing shields your internet traffic through multiple nodes, making it nearly impossible for anyone to trace. Even better, Qubetics incentivises users to share the bandwidth by rewarding them with $TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining marketplace where security meets economic opportunity. In short, it’s not just a VPN; it’s a game-changer for online privacy. Toncoin: Redefining Blockchain-Based Communications Toncoin, the brainchild of the Telegram Open Network, is making strides in integrating blockchain and communication technologies. Built to complement messaging platforms, it enables seamless payments, smart contracts, and decentralised applications within the ecosystem. Its focus on scalability and ease of use has positioned it as a leader in the evolving crypto landscape. For those interested in projects that combine practicality with innovation, Toncoin is worth keeping an eye on. Stellar: The Powerhouse of Cross-Border Transactions Stellar continues to prove its value in the world of decentralised finance, specifically for cross-border payments. By offering a blockchain-based solution that’s fast, affordable, and inclusive, Stellar has created a platform that connects financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. Whether you’re sending remittances or managing business transactions, Stellar’s network ensures low fees and reliable speeds. It’s a solid contender for anyone seeking the top cryptos. Early Bird Wins! Qubetics Presale Offers Massive Growth Potential If you’ve ever dreamed of catching the next big crypto before it takes off, here’s your chance. Right now, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.025 during the presale. Imagine this: $1,000 today gets you a whopping 40,000 $TICS tokens. Now, let’s talk numbers—because they’re wild. Analysts are predicting that $TICS could skyrocket to $10 in the near future. That means your $1,000 investment could balloon to $400,000—an astonishing ROI of 39,900%. And if it climbs even higher to $15? You’re looking at $600,000, with an ROI of 59,900%. These aren’t just numbers; they’re life-changing possibilities. But here’s the kicker—presales like this don’t last forever. The early bird gets the worm, and in this case, the worm might just be a golden ticket to your financial freedom. If you’re hunting for the top crypto to invest in , Qubetics should be on your radar. Conclusion: Which Crypto Will Shape Your Future? The right investment today could transform your tomorrow. Toncoin is innovating communication, Stellar is revolutionising cross-border finance, and Qubetics is pioneering Web3 privacy and security. Each has its strengths and potential to deliver significant returns. But if you’re looking for excitement, unparalleled potential, and a chance to be part of something transformative, Qubetics stands out. Its dVPN is set to reshape how we think about online privacy, and its presale is the kind of opportunity that investors dream about.

However, a joint report by Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets research suggests significant growth potential, with experts projecting expansion to 10% of the US money supply (M2) and foreign exchange (FX) transactions. Regulation Could Unlock Stablecoins’ Full Potential According to the report titled ‘Stablecoins: The First Killer App,’ the utility of stablecoins has evolved well beyond their original role in cryptocurrency trading. Initially used as a bridge asset for trading, stablecoins are increasingly employed in cross-border payments, payroll, trade settlements, and remittances. These applications demonstrate their ability to address inefficiencies in existing financial systems, such as high costs, delayed transaction times, and limited accessibility in underserved regions. By providing faster and cheaper transactions, stablecoins offer a compelling solution for international remittances and business operations, positioning themselves as a pivotal tool in modern finance. The analysis also highlighted the implications of stablecoin adoption for the broader financial ecosystem. At present, stablecoins’ total market capitalization is dwarfed by the $21 trillion US M2 and $2.1 trillion in daily FX spot transactions. However, achieving a 10% share could transform them into a dominant force in global finance, thereby reshaping the landscape of digital payments and settlements. Regulation is seen as the key to this transition. While previous US administrations have made little progress in establishing stablecoin-specific policies, the report suggests that a Trump-led government in 2025 might prioritize these efforts. In fact, this regulatory clarity is expected to unlock stablecoins’ full potential, enabling them to scale and diversify their use cases further. Stablecoin Adoption Soars in Emerging Markets Geographically, USD-backed stablecoins dominate the market, comprising 99.3% of current stablecoin market capitalization. Tether (USDT) leads with a 73% market share, followed by Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) at 21%. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered’s Thursday report cited a YouGov survey that found compelling use cases. Across five emerging markets – Brazil, Turkey, Nigeria, India, and Indonesia – it was observed that 69% of respondents use stablecoins for currency substitution, while 39% employ them for cross-border payments and goods and services transactions.

American author Robert Kiyosaki made a controversial stand after commenting that the psychological phenomenon of the fear of missing out (FOMO) can be a positive driving force that will push investors to buy the top crypto before it reaches the $100,000 level. Bitcoin: The Challenge To Invest Kiyosaki warned that once Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 level, it would be challenging for the middle class to invest significant amounts in the firstborn crypto, urging them to invest now that the digital currency is still below the said level. “Once Bitcoin passes $100,000 it will be almost impossible for the poor and middle class to catch up,” Kiyosaki said. The American author explained that once Bitcoin becomes more accessible only to the ultra-wealthy, holders of traditional fiat currencies such as the dollar, euro, and yen will lose out. Kiyosaki, who is an advocate of alternatives to fiat currencies such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin, argued that if BTC breaks the $100,000 level, “only the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence.” THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WiLL BE RICHER?A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WhO WILL BE POORER?A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad“Savers are losers…because… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 29, 2024 Embracing FOMO Ever since Kiyosaki has been promoting investment in Bitcoin, he believed that the crypto offers an opportunity to better protect wealth than the traditional currencies. Now that BTC is nearing a new all-time high, Kiyosaki urged people like those in the middle class to invest in Bitcoin, saying that if they are hesitant, they can embrace the FOMO mentality. “FOMO is good. Don’t be left behind!” he added. He explained that the fear of missing out on the Bitcoin opportunity could pull people to invest in the crypto so they could benefit when the coin reaches new heights. Fiat Savings Not Good The author dispelled people from saving, saying that ‘savers are losers” because, in his opinion, “cash is trash.” Kiyosaki explained that holding Bitcoin is better than saving in cash because traditional fiat currencies have to contend with inflation which reduces its value over time. In an X post, he urged people to diversify their assets and invest in alternatives such as Bitcoin, claiming that government monetary policies and inflation will continue to “erode the purchasing power of traditional currencies.” He pointed out that today is the right time to invest in BTC because once the coin breaches the $100,000 milestone, it will be nearly impossible for most people to get hold of it. As of press time, BTC is being traded at $96,722 per coin, with a total market capitalization of $1.9 trillion.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB.

Charles took to X (formerly Twitter) to sound the alarm on the aftermath of Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which he claims has devastated businesses, hurt economies, and crushed innovation worldwide. “So many people put their head in the sand for political reasons, saying it’s not as bad as the industry made it out to be,” Charles wrote. “It is worse and global. So many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed.” He warned that the fallout from this crackdown will take years to heal and urged the crypto community to unite, adding, “We have a small window of time to get a law passed.” Charles’s comments were prompted by Binance chairman Gabriel Abed, who revealed his own experience of being debanked outside the United States. Abed recounted how First Citizens Caribbean Bank shut down his accounts—accounts he’d held for over a decade—because he received a bitcoin-related deposit. The bank’s CEO explained that working with crypto companies posed too high a risk to their American correspondent banking relationships. Abed’s experience, he said, is not unique. International banks were severing ties with crypto clients to comply with “standards” set by their U.S. counterparts. “This isn’t just an American issue,” Abed said. “It’s global.” Crypto industry blames Biden administration for financial suppression The crypto community believes it knows who’s behind this assault: the Biden administration. Industry leaders accuse the government of reviving the controversial Obama-era Operation Chokepoint under a new guise. The original program, launched in 2013, pressured banks to cut ties with industries considered “high risk,” such as payday lenders and firearms dealers. Critics argued that legitimate businesses were being unfairly targeted. Operation Chokepoint officially ended in 2017, but crypto insiders say it made a comeback in 2021, this time with blockchain firms in its crosshairs. Elon Musk reignited the discussion with a single question: “Did you know that 30 tech founders were secretly debanked?” Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, jumped in immediately. “Yes,” he responded. “I was debanked because I’m in crypto, as was Gemini. The number is probably much larger than 30. That’s just in the a16z portfolio alone.” Tyler accused the Biden administration of “assassinating” banks that dared to serve the crypto industry. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, backed Tyler with his own allegations. “Can confirm this is true,” Brian said, calling the debanking of crypto companies one of the most unethical moves in American history. He pointed fingers at Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler, claiming they orchestrated a deliberate attempt to “kill” the industry. “My guess? We’ll find Warren’s fingerprints all over it. Biden himself was probably unaware,” Brian speculated. He revealed that Coinbase is using Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover who exactly was involved. https://twitter.com/brian_Brian/status/1861890800268775923 “This was a major factor in the Democrats losing the election,” Brian continued. “The party should realize Warren is a liability and distance themselves if they want any hope of rebuilding.” Marc Andreessen, the highly-respected venture capitalist, appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast to call out what he sees as blatant financial censorship. “This is about control, not compliance,” Marc said, describing how at least 30 tech founders, himself included, were targeted and debanked for political reasons. He pointed to the broader implications: “This goes beyond crypto. This is about freedom.” The global fallout of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Andrew Torba, founder of Gab, shared his story of relentless account closures. “Without a bank account, you can’t store cash, run payroll, or pay bills,” he said. “That’s the point—choke businesses until they die.” Andrew said he opened accounts with major banks, credit unions, and even Christian financial institutions, only to be repeatedly shut out. “The reason was always the same: ‘Our terms say we can do this anytime, for any reason, or no reason at all.’” According to him, banks have admitted off the record that they were being pressured by the government with threats of audits and regulatory scrutiny. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, has also been vocal about her experience. Long confirmed that her company has been debanked multiple times and is now suing the Federal Reserve. Her case is scheduled for oral arguments on January 21, just one day after Inauguration Day. John Deaton, a well-known crypto lawyer and former US Senate candidate, called Caitlin’s lawsuit “arguably the most important fight against unelected bureaucrats and the deep state protecting the banking system’s status quo.” Payment processing veteran Brian Roemmele shares these concerns. He described how Operation Chokepoint 2.0 has destroyed trust in the financial system. Roemmele has worked in merchant processing since the 1980s and said the Biden-era version of the program is even more destructive than the original. “This time, it’s vengeful,” Roemmele said, adding that thousands of businesses have been wiped out overnight. He claimed the crackdown has made doing business ten times more expensive and accused the government of using banks as tools of state corruption. Gabriel Abed’s story offers a glimpse into how this suppression plays out on the ground. After receiving a bitcoin-related deposit flagged as high risk, his decade-old accounts were shut down. He called the debanking crisis a “clear example of how far-reaching the consequences of U.S. banking policies are,” adding that local banks are often caught in the crossfire. “Barbadian banks face immense pressure to comply with U.S. standards or risk losing their correspondent relationships.” Charles, for his part, is urging the crypto industry to unite. He believes the community has a small window of time to push for legislative reforms to ensure such a campaign is never repeated. “We have to come together to prevent this horror from ever happening again,” he said.

However, the L2 network stated it would focus on dApp building and developer empowerment moving forward. It even asked for input on how best to improve its services. Base’s focus is on dApp development and encouraging developers Jesse Pollak, founder of Base and Head of Protocols at Coinbase, revealed in a post on X that they had no intention of launching a native token; instead, the platform will prioritize dApp building. He said : And finally, there are no plans for a Base network token. We are focused on building, and we want to solve real problems that let you build better. I want your feedback on what we can be doing better. ~ Jesse Pollak In another post, Pollak tagged the platform’s “greatest strengths” as its open source, open standards, and open markets, which, according to him, breed faster innovation and more fun. He gave the example of Clanker on the platform. He’s even encouraged developers to build on the platform, saying, “Build, and we will be rewarded.” Base’s VIRTUAL is in surprisingly high demand, with its market cap growing by over 60% Although the L2 network does not intend to release a native token on its network anytime soon, some of the products on its blockchain are doing exceedingly well, including the VIRTUAL Token and aixbt. According to Coingecko , by November 29, Virtual Protocols Ecosystem on Base’s platform’s market cap had soared by over 50.4%, reaching $1.78 billion. Currently, it is close to surpassing $2.4 billion, rising by 61%. The token VIRTUAL‘s 24-hour trading volume is at $498,352,940. It is currently trading at $1,79, a 35% rise in the last 24 hours and up by 206% in the last seven days. Aixbt’s price has also risen by over 323% in the last week, trading at $0.201. Pollak even commented on Aixbt’s rise, saying the AI agent ranks first in on-chain mindshare. Analysts have attributed the growing interest in the Virtual Products Ecosystem to the escalated demand for AI agents and AI-based programs, which are efficient and fast at completing tasks. Greg Isenberg, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, projects even more revenue growth for AI agents like Aixbt. He believes the market for AI agents could easily grow to a trillion-dollar market, saying the world will soon replace human workflows with AI agents.

Crypto analysts like Dark Defender have provided insights into what could come next for XRP. XRP Price Could Rally To $5 Next In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender suggested that the XRP price could rally as high as $5 on its next leg to the upside. This came as he noted that the first target of $1.8 for XRP in this bull run has happened, which led to the crypto hitting the $100 billion market cap mark. With the first target out of the way, XRP could reach $5.8, which Dark Defender’s accompanying chart highlights as one of the median targets. Interestingly, the chart also highlights $18 as a median target, indicating that the crypto could reach this level at some point. Dark Defender also recently used his Elliot Wave theory analysis to show how XRP could hit $18 in this market cycle. The chart showed this parabolic rally would occur on the Wave 5 impulsive move to the upside. Meanwhile, in another X post , the crypto analyst warned about how critical the Fibonacci level at $1.8815 is in the short term. He noted that the XRP price touched $1.9508 and then bounced back to this Fib level. In line with this, he stated that the crypto must stay above $1.8815 for at least three candles. According to Dark Defender, the first step is to stay 12 hours above this level, followed by a 3-day close above this level. A sustained close above this Fib level could confirm that as a significant support level and propel XRP to new highs. Amid the recent XRP rally, it is worth mentioning that the crypto has flipped BNB to become the fifth-largest crypto by market cap. Dark Defender believes XRP could flip Solana next to become the fourth-largest crypto by market cap. The analyst had before now also boldly predicted that the crypto would flip Ethereum at some point. Double Digits Price Target On The Horizon Crypto analysts like Egrag Crypto and Mikybull Crypto have also suggested that a double-digit price target for the XRP price is on the horizon. In his analysis, Egrag Crypto stated that FOMO will ignite if XRP closes above the $2 level. He added that if history repeats itself, XRP will likely trade in double digits between $20 and $27. From the accompanying chart, the analyst looks to be referring to the 2017 bull run, in which XRP recorded massive gains on its way to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.8. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also stated in an X post that the XRP price is giving off 2017 rally vibes. Based on this, the analyst predicts that XRP will hit $2 and then experience a pullback before it continues its “vertical hated rallies” to a new cycle top of probably $10. In another X post, he told market participants to watch what will follow after XRP breaks a new ATH. The crypto analyst added that the 2017 kind of massive rallies are about to be unveiled before everyone’s eyes. With XRP flying high at the moment, a recent CoinGape market analysis also raised the possibility of the crypto’s ATH being imminent .

This key level, acting as a significant hurdle, is widely seen as the launchpad for a potential parabolic rally. If DOGE manages to break above this barrier, it could enter uncharted territory and achieve new all-time highs. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a detailed technical and macro analysis on X, highlighting Dogecoin’s strong potential for continuing its bullish momentum. According to Martinez, DOGE is positioned for a parabolic rally, driven by growing interest and increasing adoption in the market. His analysis underlines the importance of the $0.43 resistance level, suggesting that a decisive breakout could trigger substantial upward price action. The meme coin, known for its vibrant community and unpredictable price moves, has gained traction as broader market sentiment turns bullish. With consolidating price action and strengthening technical indicators, Dogecoin appears ready to embark on its next major leg up . The coming days will be critical for determining whether DOGE can overcome this resistance and fulfill the expectations of a parabolic rally. Dogecoin About To Enter Bullish Phase Again Dogecoin’s history of explosive rallies has made it one of the most closely watched cryptocurrencies. The last time DOGE began a significant rally, it surged over 215%, delivering substantial gains and fueling widespread speculation about its price potential. Now, as the meme coin consolidates, investors and analysts are eyeing the next big move. Martinez has provided valuable insights into DOGE’s current price action . He notes that Dogecoin is firmly in a consolidation phase, testing investors’ patience during this parabolic run. Drawing comparisons to similar market conditions in 2017 and 2020, Martinez highlights a critical pattern: the appearance of a TD Sequential sell signal, often signaling a brief correction before the rally resumes. This historical perspective suggests that DOGE’s temporary pause may set the stage for an even more aggressive surge. As the broader market continues to rise, expectations for Dogecoin remain high. Many investors are optimistic that DOGE will soon replicate its past performance and embark on a massive upward trajectory. Martinez predicts that such a surge will likely align with Bitcoin breaking its all-time highs and crossing the $100,000 threshold, a milestone anticipated as early as next week. If Bitcoin delivers, Dogecoin could follow suit with a breakout to new highs. DOGE Testing Supply Level Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.426, just below the critical resistance level at $0.43. This resistance has so far prevented a bullish continuation, making it a pivotal point for DOGE’s next price action. If the price manages to break above $0.43 and sustain this level for a few days, it could pave the way for a strong breakout and further upside momentum. Investors and traders are closely monitoring this area as a decisive move could trigger a significant rally. However, the $0.43 mark also represents a potential barrier. A failed breakout at this level would likely lead to a correction, pulling the price back to retest lower support zones. In such a scenario, DOGE could drop to around $0.35, depending on broader market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price action. The next few days are crucial as Dogecoin approaches this resistance with heightened market anticipation. Bulls aim for a breakout to sustain the parabolic run, while bears may seize the opportunity to push prices lower if momentum falters. For now, the $0.43 level remains the key to determining DOGE’s immediate direction and whether it will embark on a bullish continuation or face a pullback.

In a market full of innovation, three projects stand out for their potential to shape the future. While each brings something unique, one newcomer is stealing the spotlight. Ethereum has long been a pioneer in decentralised applications, while Kaspa focuses on speed and scalability. But then there’s Qubetics ($TICS)—a revolutionary blockchain platform redefining interoperability. The presale creates waves, offering massive ROI potential and a chance to get in early. This article will explore Qubetics, Ethereum, and Kaspa and explain why they are the best cryptos to buy now. Let’s start with the rising star: Qubetics. The Web3 Aggregator That’s Redefining Crypto: Qubetics Is Here The current blockchain ecosystem is like a bustling city with no bridges. Each network operates in isolation, limiting the potential for seamless transactions and data sharing. This siloed approach creates headaches for developers and hinders mass adoption of blockchain technology. Enter Qubetics, a Web3-aggregated chain that’s tearing down these barriers. Qubetics unifies multiple networks into a single, interconnected framework. This groundbreaking approach enables smooth asset transfers, efficient data sharing, and true cross-chain functionality. For developers, enterprises, and users, Qubetics means fewer limitations and more opportunities. Imagine an app that easily communicates with other networks or seamless asset swaps without complex workarounds. Qubetics is setting the stage for decentralised technologies to work together like never before, unlocking blockchain’s full potential. Ethereum: The OG Smart Contract Platform Ethereum needs no introduction. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, it paved the way for decentralised applications (dApps). Its ecosystem is home to thousands of projects, from DeFi to NFTs, making it a cornerstone of the crypto world. Despite its success, Ethereum faces challenges like high fees and slower transaction speeds, which newer competitors are eager to address. However, with Ethereum 2.0 upgrades rolling out, including proof-of-stake consensus, the network is evolving to stay competitive. For those looking for a solid long-term bet, Ethereum remains one of the best cryptos. Kaspa: Speed Meets Scalability Kaspa is all about speed. Designed as a proof-of-work blockchain, Kaspa delivers ultra-fast transaction confirmations without sacrificing decentralisation. Its innovative design ensures scalability, making it a great option for real-time applications and high-demand networks. Kaspa’s focus on speed and simplicity sets it apart in a complex market. While it’s still growing, its unique architecture and developer-friendly ecosystem make it a standout for those seeking efficiency. For many, it’s emerging as one of the best cryptos. Why $TICS is the Best Crypto to Buy Now? Qubetics’ presale is where the excitement hits a fever pitch. Currently, in Phase 10, this presale is structured to reward early adopters. Every week, token prices climb by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike at the final stage. Right now, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.025, and the numbers are jaw-dropping: $3.8 million raised 5000+ holders 239 million tokens sold If you’re looking to maximise returns, this phase is your golden ticket. Analysts predict a post-presale value of $0.25 per token, translating to a staggering 900% ROI for those who get in now. But that’s just the start. Let’s talk numbers. A $100 investment at $0.025 would secure 4,000 $TICS tokens. If the token price hits $10, that $100 turns into $40,000. At $15, you’re looking at $60,000—a mind-blowing ROI of 59,900%. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about timing. The best crypto to buy now is the one with massive growth potential, and $TICS checks every box. Conclusion: The Best Crypto to Buy Now with Massive Growth Potential As the crypto market evolves, three projects stand out: Ethereum, Kaspa, and Qubetics. Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralised innovation, while Kaspa offers unmatched speed. But Qubetics ? It’s the game-changer. Analysts are excited about the insane ROI potential of Qubetics’ presale. With its vision of unified blockchain interoperability and a token price poised to skyrocket, $TICS offers something no other crypto does right now. The presale is your chance to be part of the next big thing. If you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy now, don’t let Qubetics’ presale pass you by. It’s not just an investment—it’s a leap into the future of blockchain. Get in now and secure your place before the price takes off.

Here’s Your Chance to Redeem Yourself,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-bitcoins-rise-heres-your-chance-to-redeem-yourself/,"Remember when Bitcoin was just a few dollars per coin? If only you had invested back then, your portfolio might look completely different today. Missing out on Bitcoin’s early days still stings for many investors. But what if we told you there’s a new project creating just as much buzz? Enter Qubetics , a blockchain marvel poised to transform the crypto space. With features like a decentralised VPN (dVPN), it tackles real-world issues such as privacy risks, data control, and online security. Analysts predict Qubetics could hit $10–$15 after its mainnet launch, making it the best crypto to invest in now. This might just be the second chance you’ve been waiting for. Bitcoin Was Just the Beginning, but Qubetics Is the Future When Bitcoin first launched, it promised a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial system. And while it changed the world, it’s not without its flaws. Bitcoin lacks many modern functionalities, leaving gaps in privacy, scalability, and accessibility. This has left the door wide open for innovative projects like Qubetics to step in. Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s a game-changer. With its decentralised VPN, it addresses issues Bitcoin never could, like securing user privacy in a highly surveilled online world. If you missed the Bitcoin revolution, don’t let Qubetics slip by. It’s shaping up to be the best crypto to invest in now , combining innovation with unmatched potential. How Qubetics Solves Privacy Problems In today’s digital age, privacy is increasingly rare. Traditional VPNs claim to secure your data but often fall short, storing logs that can be accessed or hacked. Centralized solutions also leave users vulnerable to government interference and corporate misuse of personal data. Qubetics revolutionizes this space with its decentralised VPN, which removes central control entirely. Users retain full ownership of their data while benefiting from enhanced security and anonymity. This makes Qubetics more than just a blockchain—it’s a solution for an era where privacy is under siege. Its presale offers an incredible opportunity to get involved in the best crypto to invest in now. Tackling Security Risks with a dVPN Cybersecurity threats have skyrocketed, with hackers targeting everything from financial institutions to individual users. Centralized VPNs, while helpful, are often the weakest link, becoming single points of failure in an increasingly hostile digital landscape. Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these vulnerabilities. By decentralizing the network, Qubetics ensures there’s no single point of attack. This provides unparalleled security, making it an essential tool for anyone concerned about their online safety. With its presale already creating waves, Qubetics is undeniably the best crypto to invest in now for those who value both security and innovation. Restrictive Data Practices Are No Match for Qubetics Many VPNs and online tools restrict how users can access and share data. These limitations stifle creativity and freedom, forcing people to operate within narrow parameters set by centralized systems. Qubetics challenges this status quo with its decentralized approach. With Qubetics, users regain control over their data and online activities. There are no middlemen imposing restrictions or profiting from your information. This makes Qubetics a leader in the fight for online freedom and positions it as the best crypto to invest in now . Presale Momentum—Why Qubetics Is Your Next Smart Move The Qubetics presale is more than just an investment opportunity; it’s a chance to be part of a revolutionary project from the ground up. Tokens are currently priced at just $0.025, and with predictions of hitting $10–$15 post-mainnet launch, the potential returns are staggering. Missing Bitcoin was painful, but you don’t have to make the same mistake twice. Qubetics offers innovation, security, and privacy, all while being accessible to early investors. It’s more than a blockchain—it’s the best crypto to invest in now , and the time to act is now. Conclusion Missing Bitcoin’s early days taught us all an invaluable lesson: opportunities in crypto don’t wait. Qubetics represents the next frontier, tackling issues like privacy, security, and data restrictions with its innovative dVPN technology. The presale is already underway, and the clock is ticking. Don’t let Qubetics become another “what if” moment. With its potential to reshape the blockchain landscape and deliver massive returns, it’s the best crypto to invest in now . Seize the moment before it’s too late. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics The post Regret Missing Bitcoin’s Rise?

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Altcoins have consistently provided unique value propositions, from blockchain interoperability to decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions. In 2024, three standout projects—Qubetics (TICS), Cosmos (ATOM), and Polkadot (DOT)—have solidified their positions as some of the best altcoins to buy this weekend. Whether you’re looking for a revolutionary project with high potential returns, or a proven crypto mainstay offering stability, there’s plenty to explore. Polkadot and Cosmos, each with their strong foothold in the market, represent resilience and continued innovation. But a rising star, Qubetics , is turning heads with its record-breaking presale and ambitious goals. If you’ve been searching for a game-changer, now’s your chance to learn more. Let’s tune into what makes these altcoins exceptional choices, starting with Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator that’s setting a high bar for innovation and investor excitement. Qubetics: Revolutionising Web3 with $TICS and the QubeQode IDE Qubetics isn’t just an altcoin; it’s a movement. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics has captured the attention of investors and developers alike with its seamless integration of blockchain technologies and real-world applications. Currently in the 10th stage of its presale, Qubetics has already raised an impressive $3.8 million, selling over 239 million tokens to more than 5000 holders. Priced at just $0.0257 per token, $TICS offers an unmatched opportunity for early investors to capitalise on a projected ROI of up to 58,213% after its mainnet launch. What truly sets Qubetics apart is the QubeQode IDE, a cutting-edge integrated development environment designed to streamline Web3 project creation. Imagine this: a business professional managing supply chain logistics could leverage QubeQode’s intuitive interface to integrate blockchain-based data storage. Instead of juggling traditional, siloed systems, they gain secure, decentralised data access at their fingertips. For artists, the IDE could offer a transformative way to mint NFTs, track ownership rights, and even monetise their digital works in real time—all with zero coding experience required. Now consider the financial implications. An artist investing $10,000 in $TICS at $0.0257 could see jaw-dropping returns of $378,700 if $TICS hits $1 post-presale. If the token reaches $5, that same investment could balloon to $1.93 million. With the presale price set to increase by 10% in the 11th stage, waiting even a day could mean missing out on what analysts call a once-in-a-generation opportunity. The buzz around Qubetics isn’t just hype; it’s backed by a bold vision, tangible innovation, and the kind of investor enthusiasm that rarely goes unnoticed. Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Cosmos, often referred to as the Internet of Blockchains, is one of the most established names in the cryptocurrency world. Since its inception, Cosmos has positioned itself as a leader in blockchain interoperability, allowing disparate networks to communicate and share data seamlessly. For investors seeking reliability, Cosmos delivers a well-rounded proposition: robust technology, active developer communities, and a proven track record of adoption. But what makes Cosmos one of the best altcoins to buy this weekend? It’s all about its adaptability. While many blockchain projects struggle to remain relevant, Cosmos thrives by solving real-world problems. Consider this: you’re a tech entrepreneur running a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform. With Cosmos, you can connect your platform to other blockchains effortlessly, enabling faster transactions, lower fees, and access to a broader user base. That’s the power of the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos has also earned a reputation for serving as an alternative investment instrument. It caters to those disillusioned with traditional finance by offering exposure to cutting-edge technology. Whether you’re a long-term holder or a swing trader, Cosmos provides the kind of stability and innovation that keeps portfolios balanced, even during turbulent market conditions. Polkadot: A Pioneer in Blockchain Innovation Polkadot, the brainchild of Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood, stands tall as a pioneer in blockchain innovation. Known for its groundbreaking parachain technology, Polkadot enables multiple blockchains to operate within a single network, making it a go-to choice for developers and enterprises. In the crypto community, Polkadot has earned a loyal following for its scalability, security, and forward-thinking approach to decentralisation. For investors, Polkadot represents an opportunity to be part of a project that consistently pushes boundaries. It’s not just about owning a token; it’s about being part of a movement that aims to redefine how blockchain technology interacts with the world. Think of Polkadot as the engine that powers next-generation decentralised applications (dApps), from supply chain management to digital identity verification. Polkadot’s appeal also lies in its ability to weather market fluctuations. While newer projects often experience volatile price swings, Polkadot remains a symbol of resilience, proving that established altcoins can still deliver impressive returns. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned trader, Polkadot offers a solid foundation for diversifying your investments. The Best Altcoins to Buy This Weekend As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, Qubetics, Cosmos, and Polkadot stand out as compelling choices for investors. Qubetics dazzles with its record-breaking presale, revolutionary QubeQode IDE, and unparalleled growth potential. Meanwhile, Cosmos and Polkadot continue to serve as stalwarts in the market, offering reliability, innovation, and long-term value. Don’t wait too long. With the $TICS price set to increase soon, now’s the time to act. Visit Qubetics’ presale page, explore Cosmos’ groundbreaking solutions, or dive into Polkadot’s unparalleled ecosystem.

37074982,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51091,1733023617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto Founder Predicts Cardano (ADA) Rally to $5 or $10. Here’s when,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-founder-predicts-cardano-ada-rally-to-5-or-10-heres-when/,"Cardano (ADA) has recently captured significant attention after regaining the $1 price level—a milestone many investors and analysts believed might not be reached again. This development has reinvigorated confidence in the cryptocurrency and sparked discussions about its future trajectory. Dan Gambardello, a renowned analyst suggests that Cardano’s current consolidation phase is setting the stage for even greater price milestones, with targets ranging from $5 to $10. $1 Milestone: A Symbol of Resilience for Cardano Cardano’s recapture of the $1 price level is a significant event in the cryptocurrency market. After years of struggling to overcome this psychological barrier, the token’s achievement highlights its strength and resilience. For long-term investors, this marks a moment of validation after enduring multiple market corrections and bearish trends. Ranked as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Cardano (ADA) has demonstrated solid growth. Over the past week, its value increased by 27.53%. As of report time, the token is trading at $1.05, indicating strong support around this crucial price level. Gateway to $5–$10 The market’s response to ADA’s rally has been mixed. While many in the crypto community celebrated the achievement, others have used this milestone as an exit point, taking profits after enduring prolonged underperformance. Analyst Dan Gambardello has a different perspective. He sees the ongoing consolidation around the $1 mark as a positive sign. According to him, this phase allows for redistribution among investors, setting the stage for a more significant upward movement. Once the consolidation phase is complete, Gambardello predicts that ADA could break through to new highs, with $5 and $10 becoming realistic targets soon. Other analysts have shared even more ambitious projections for Cardano. They believe the ADA could hit $10–$12 within the next 6 to 12 months, aligning with bullish forecasts for the broader cryptocurrency market. Predictions for Bitcoin (BTC) to reach $250,000 and Ethereum (ETH) to climb to $7,000 lend credibility to these expectations. As one of the leading altcoins, Cardano is likely to benefit from the overall bullish sentiment toward large-cap cryptocurrencies. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence Adding to the bullish outlook, Cardano whales have been increasing their holdings. Recent reports indicate that after ADA surpassed the $1 mark, whales purchased over 130 million tokens, bringing their total holdings to 3.2 billion ADA as of November 27. This accumulation trend suggests that large investors position themselves for a potential bull run. Despite profit-taking, the market has shown remarkable resilience, with ADA maintaining a steady upward trajectory over the last three weeks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Factors Driving Cardano’s Momentum Several factors, including technological advancements, contribute to ADA’s renewed momentum. Cardano’s focus on scalability, interoperability, and energy efficiency continues to differentiate it from competitors. The ongoing development of its ecosystem reinforces investor confidence. In addition, broader market sentiment contributes to ADA’s momentum, a bullish outlook for major cryptocurrencies often spills over to altcoins like ADA. As Bitcoin and Ethereum rally, Cardano is expected to follow suit. Also, growing institutional interest in Cardano’s blockchain technology and real-world applications has fueled demand for ADA tokens. The Road Ahead for Cardano Cardano’s ability to maintain its position above the $1 mark will likely determine its future success. Analysts like Gambardello believe this consolidation phase is a necessary step before ADA can target higher price levels. With the support of long-term holders, increasing whale activity, and optimistic market sentiment, Cardano appears well-positioned to achieve its ambitious targets. While risks remain, the outlook for ADA is undeniably promising as it sets its sights on $5, $10, or even higher price levels. Cardano’s resurgence to the $1 mark represents a critical juncture in its journey. The consolidation phase is not a sign of stagnation but a precursor to potential exponential growth. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, ADA is emerging as a contender to watch, backed by technological advancements, investor confidence, and the vision of a decentralized future.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB.

These comparisons have sparked speculation that the current market could precede a significant bull cycle akin to 2021. Market Overview The recent rally across cryptocurrency markets, initiated following the U.S. election, has resulted in substantial price increases for several major assets. Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $99,655 on November 22, while Solana (SOL) peaked at $263 shortly afterward. Despite these developments, some altcoins, including Shiba Inu (SHIB), have not yet achieved new ATHs during this bullish momentum. Shiba Inu’s price increased notably to $0.00003031 on November 12, climbing from a monthly low of $0.00001626. However, this price remains 69.8% below its ATH of $0.00008616, recorded on October 28, 2021. The disparity has raised concerns among investors about whether Shiba Inu has been sidelined in the ongoing market rally. Historical Context and Lucie’s Insights Lucie, a prominent figure within the Shiba Inu team, addressed these concerns by drawing parallels to the token’s historical performance. She noted that the current trend resembles the market behavior of 2020, just before the explosive gains witnessed in 2021. Shiba Inu launched in August 2020 with a price carrying ten zeros after the decimal point. By November 28, 2020, the token had dropped to its all-time low (ATL) of $0.000000000056. At that time, the asset showed little price movement, leaving many investors doubtful about its future. However, the scenario shifted dramatically in 2021 when increased demand, notable exchange listings, and the token’s largest burn event drove significant interest in SHIB. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 One pivotal moment occurred in May 2021, when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sent over 410 trillion SHIB tokens to a dead wallet, effectively removing them from circulation. This event, alongside widespread market adoption, propelled Shiba Inu to its ATH later that year. Lucie believes the current cycle mirrors the period leading up to SHIB’s breakout in 2021. She has identified 2025 as a potential turning point, calling it the “year of the super cycle,” which could lead to an even larger bull run. She has encouraged investors to remain patient and consider assets with a high tendency for growth. Predictions for Shiba Inu’s Future Price Despite trading below its ATH, many analysts foresee significant price growth for Shiba Inu during the 2024/2025 bull cycle. SHIB is valued at $0.00002598 at the time of writing, reflecting a 3.54% increase in the past 24 hours. Projections for Shiba Inu’s future price vary. Bitcoin investor Dona has predicted that SHIB could reach $0.000114, while cryptocurrency analyst Javon Marks suggests an even higher target of $0.0001553 . Both forecasts indicate confidence in the token’s potential to exceed the $0.0001 threshold during the ongoing market cycle. Whether Shiba Inu will achieve these ambitious price targets before the bull cycle concludes remains uncertain. However, historical trends and current market activity suggest that the token may yet experience a substantial upward trajectory.

As the token powers up, its next target could be the $16.9 mark, a critical level that could set the stage for even greater gains. With momentum building, the question is whether UNI can break through this resistance and push toward new heights . The aim of this article is to analyze Uniswap’s recent surge, focusing on its potential to break through the key $16.9 resistance level. This analysis will determine if UNI is poised for further gains or challenges in breaking through this critical price point by examining the factors driving UNI’s rally, including technical indicators and market sentiment. Examining UNI’s Recent Momentum Surge On the 4-hour chart, UNI is showing strong bullish strength, attempting to break out of its consolidation zone. Trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), the token is targeting the key $16.9 resistance level, signaling the potential for additional upward movement if it maintains its position above the SMA. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the RSI has climbed back above the 61% threshold after experiencing a decline to 56% signaling a resurgence in buying pressure, reflecting renewed bullish movement in the market. A persistent climb would indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting robust demand and the possibility of more price growth. Also, the daily chart showcases UNI’s robust upward momentum , highlighted by the formation of a positive candlestick pattern as the price rebounds, indicating the potential for further gains. Its position above the SMA solidifies the positive trend, signaling consistent strength. As UNI continues its ascent, it inspires growing market confidence and paves the way for an extended increase. Lastly, the daily chart’s RSI recently hit 70%, suggesting that Uniswap has entered overbought territory, reflecting strong bullish sentiment . While this suggests an extended upside, it also raises the risk of a pullback if buying pressure becomes excessive. Will Uniswap Reach New Heights? Tracking The Path Toward $16.9 Uniswap is exhibiting strong upbeat strength, with $16.9 acting as a key resistance level to watch out for. If the token maintains its upward trajectory, it could soon test this level. A successful breakout above $16.9 could open the door to new highs, setting the stage for gains and a possible rally to even higher price targets. However, if UNI fails to maintain its momentum, a pullback or consolidation may follow, potentially driving the price toward the $11.8 support level. A decisive break below this level might lead to more declines, with the next support zone at $10.3 and below.",UNI|Consolidation Zone|Relative Strength Index|RSI|Simple Moving Average|SMA|Uniswap|uniusd|UNIUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-01 04:30:26

As a result, some countries have leaned towards over-regulation, stifling development (the EU), while others, like the US, have adopted a more hands-off approach to the industry. As of December 2024, various countries have legally besieged AI startups like OpenAI on claims of breaches in data privacy policies and regulations. Most recently, Canadian media houses, including the Toronto Star, Metroland Media, Postmedia, The Globe and Mail, The Canadian Press, and CBC, joined a lawsuit , reportedly the first of its kind in the country. They all sued OpenAI for allegedly ignoring safeguards like paywalls or copyright disclaimers meant to prevent the unauthorized copying of content. “Journalism is in the public interest. OpenAI using other companies’ journalism for their own commercial gain is not. It’s illegal,” the media organizations claimed in a joint statement. The group, which includes the publishers of Canada’s top newspapers, demands damages of C$20,000 per article ($14,300, £11,000) that OpenAI allegedly used to illegally train ChatGPT. The total could amount to billions of dollars in compensation. The news organizations also want an order that would force the company to share profits made from using their articles, as well as an injunction prohibiting OpenAI from using them in the future. Meanwhile, OpenAI says its models are “trained on publicly available data” and that the software is “grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation.” “We collaborate closely with news publishers, including in the display, attribution and links to their content in ChatGPT search, and offer them easy ways to opt out should they so desire,” the company has said. The New York Times and other publishers filed a similar lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft in the US last year. OpenAI faces different regulatory standards around the world China was one of the first countries to set up a regulatory framework for generative AI technology as it issued the final version of its Generative AI Measures on 10 July 2023. Seven Chinese central government agencies jointly adopted the Generative AI Measures, which took effect on 15 August 2023. Compared to the first draft of the Generative AI Measures released for public consultation in April 2023, the new Generative AI Measures encouraged the development of and investment in generative AI technology and services. However, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and similar services are banned due to censorship laws and fears of misinformation. This pushed Chinese developers, many of whom used OpenAI’s API in their products, to scramble for domestic AI alternatives. The government has also supported these alternatives as they align with its regulations. On the other hand, Russia has taken a more reserved stance regarding artificial intelligence. The country now has restrictions in place to counter what it perceives as risks of US influence through AI. It also cites cybersecurity concerns. In the months leading up to the US election, there were several reports claiming Russia was using AI to influence perspective although many brushed it off as propaganda. In North Korea, the government treats AI with suspicion and great caution, as it does many external innovations. The government has banned ChatGPT and similar technologies in a bid to maintain strict control over information and prevent potential misuse. The EU is behind in the AI race Many experts have accused Europe of stifling AI innovation through its EU AI Act. The EU AI Act is the regulation created to harmonize the legal framework for AI systems across the EU. According to the Act, AI applications fall into three risk levels: unacceptable risk (banned), high-risk (subject to strict requirements), and low-risk (largely unregulated). The Act prohibits AI practices that are manipulative or deceptive, but there are exceptions for certain law enforcement uses. Flouting the Act can result in fines of up to EUR 35 million or 7% of global turnover. Europe’s cautious approach to AI was on full display as Italy’s data privacy regulator clashed with OpenAI over access to one of its media houses’ content. The core purpose of the partnership was to use Italian language content from GEDI’s news portfolio to train and improve OpenAI’s products, a step to train ChatGPT models on Italian content. In response, GEDI stated, “The project has not been launched yet therefore no editorial content has been made available to OpenAI at the moment and will not be until the reviews under way are completed.” The clash comes almost a year after another Italian authority, known as Garante, one of the European Union’s most proactive in assessing AI platform compliance with the bloc’s data privacy regime, banned ChatGPT. It alleged breaches of the European Union (EU) privacy rules, but the service was reactivated after OpenAI addressed issues such as users’ right to decline to consent to the use of personal data to train algorithms. In an e-mail statement, OpenAI said it believes its practices are aligned with the EU’s privacy laws. “We actively work to reduce personal data in training our systems like ChatGPT,” it said, adding it “plans to continue to work constructively with the Garante.” Europe is behind in the AI race while places like America continue to leap forward. Currently, American companies, including OpenAI’s parent company, Microsoft, dominate the ranks of the largest AI firms by market valuation. The nation’s measured response has no doubt paid off for its AI businesses, at least in the short term. Very recently, Kanye West, a Grammy-winning American rapper, became the latest to embrace the technology as he debuted a music video created using generative AI for his single titled, BOMB. While many places cite concerns about the ethics of AI usage as the rationale for their tight restrictions, they also appear to be because of political tensions and efforts to protect national interests. If nothing changes, the world may be far ahead by the time Europe finally catches the AI bug.

Taking to X, he claimed , “99.999% of people have no idea what $XRP is about to do.” While Farina is well-known for his optimism regarding XRP, his tweet sparked a spirited discussion among community members with varying opinions. XRP Community Reacts A notable response came from X user Pablo Fernandez, who criticized the lack of reasoning behind such claims. Fernandez argued , “This hype is not helpful, saying that something is going to happen and not explaining your logic is like Disneyland for kids, just empty illusion. We all want something big to happen.” He further contended that statements without supporting evidence could lead to emotionally driven investment decisions, stating, “Pushing hype like this makes people FOMO without any base of logic. All emotional, after a month of this, I’m getting tired of it.” Fernandez also highlighted the practical challenges of XRP reaching significant price levels, asserting that for XRP to exceed $10, widespread adoption by banks and the injection of billions to trillions of dollars into the asset would be necessary. His comment encapsulates a growing frustration among some investors who are wary of speculative hype without substantial evidence. Another user, InvestorSauce, took a more neutral stance, acknowledging the unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. “100% don’t know. It’s a market with unlimited possibilities where no one can predict certainly,” they remarked. This perspective emphasizes the inherent volatility and uncertainty of digital assets, even those with strong utility narratives like XRP. Balancing Optimism with Realism Farina’s statement underscores the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding XRP, especially given its use case in cross-border payments and its potential for institutional adoption. However, critics like Fernandez raise valid concerns about the implications of unsubstantiated claims in a market where emotional decision-making can lead to financial risks. The cryptocurrency market has seen substantial price movements driven by speculation and hype. While XRP’s potential utility in the financial sector is widely recognized, achieving large-scale adoption by banks globally and integrating trillions of dollars in liquidity remains a complex and gradual process. Such developments depend on regulatory clarity, technological integration, and institutional support. Ultimately, whether XRP will deliver on its potential remains to be seen. As with any investment, individuals must base their decisions on sound research and realistic expectations, rather than succumbing to speculation.

This week’s reports of hacks show that many platforms have security weaknesses. These problems also raise concerns about rules and safety in the industry. Dexx Hack Affects More Than 8,620 Solana Wallets The DEXX trading platform, aimed at trading in meme coins, was hacked on November 16th. The attack emerged due to a private key leak to steal more than 8,620 Solana wallets and siphon $30m. In the same case, at least 900 users were affected out of which one person lost more than one million dollars. However, the platform has engaged in mitigation measures like; tracking the hacker’s wallets and negotiating for the funds’ return, yet the outcome is often unpredictable. Pump Science Wallet Hack: Developer Negligence Sparks Token Fraud Pump Science, a Solana-based decentralised science (DeSci) platform, shared news about the breach, which resulted from the recklessness of one of its developers. The attacker used a leaked private key to mint fake URO and RIF tokens into the system voluntarily. The fake tokens circulated into the market erasing the reputation and trust of the project. Pump Science has since explained that any tokens produced by the said wallet since its compromise are fake. The team has also warned users to stay away from fake accounts while trying to contain the losses made so far. MrBeast Gets Accused of Crypto Manipulation and Insider Trading A popular YouTuber MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson) misused his 31.2M subscribers by using forums to promote pump-and-dump schemes. Researchers claim that he manipulated token prices using his status to gain control over them to pump the prices and dump them for a $23 million profit. Key projects tied to these allegations include: $SUPER: $11.45M, $ERN: $4.65M, $PMON: $1.72M, $STAK: $1.31M and $AIOZ: $1M This has again caused many people to ponder on the kind of ethical practices there are in crypto marketing. Crypto Losses in November: A $71M Blow to Defi Analyzed by ImmuneFi , 26 hacking and fraud cases in November led to $71 million in losses. This has reduced by 79% from that recorded in November 2023 when $343 million was drained from the accounts. However, challenges persist, particularly for DeFi platforms, which accounted for: 100% of incidents and losses, $70.99M from 24 hacks and $25,300 from 2 rug pulls Major incidents included: Thala Labs: $25.5M and DEXX: $21M The BNB Chain was the most attacked blockchain with 14 attacks and a total loss worth 46.7%; Ethereum received a 30% loss. Conclusion: Creating a Safer Crypto Space This week’s events show that there’s a need to attend to security loopholes and other malpractices taking place in the crypto industry. Although the total amount of losses has gone down compared to last year, cases such as DEXX and Pump Science clearly indicate the importance of hard technical security measures. In the same way, MrBeast’s case suggests that the FCA should pay more attention to the financial promotions of influencers. Looking ahead to the last quarter of 2024, the key to change and growth of the crypto community is trust, transparency and security to make the ecosystem stronger in 2025.",News|Hack,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|AIOZ,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-01 05:13:21

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 05:22:46

The announcement by Cointelegraph on X highlights a critical milestone for Ripple on RLUSD as the stablecoin approaches regulatory clearance to operate within New York’s highly regulated digital finance ecosystem. JUST IN: Ripple’s stablecoin nears NY approval, clearing the path for RLUSD to operate within New York’s regulated digital finance market. pic.twitter.com/1Liepk3Iac — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) November 29, 2024 What Is RLUSD? RLUSD is Ripple’s proposed stablecoin designed to provide a digital asset pegged to the US dollar, ensuring price stability. Stablecoins like RLUSD are often seen as tools for reducing volatility in cryptocurrency transactions and facilitating seamless financial operations. This stablecoin aligns with Ripple’s broader vision of promoting faster, more cost-efficient payments globally, particularly for businesses and institutions seeking a reliable, stable medium of exchange. Community Insights: RLUSD’s Impact on XRP The introduction of RLUSD has raised certain questions and discussions among cryptocurrency enthusiasts regarding its implications for XRP. One X user expressed concern, asking, “I don’t understand how the stable coin will impact XRP cause wouldn’t the money go into the stable coin?” Hassan, another user, provided a detailed response, stating that XRP’s utility remains intact. RLUSD, being a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is primarily designed for domestic use and dollar-based transactions. In contrast, XRP remains the core tool for bridging various currencies and ensuring liquidity across diverse financial corridors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further into his tweet response, Hassan noted that RLUSD’s introduction could attract a broader range of businesses and institutions to Ripple’s ecosystem. While some may primarily use RLUSD, others might leverage XRP for international payment solutions, increasing the overall utility of Ripple’s technology stack. Strategic Advantages for Ripple Securing approval in New York is a significant achievement for Ripple considering the state’s stringent regulatory standards. This license would position RLUSD as a trustworthy and compliant stablecoin, potentially bolstering Ripple’s reputation among financial institutions wary of regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, RLUSD could open doors for Ripple to expand its product offerings, catering to clients seeking solutions that combine the stability of a pegged asset with the efficiency of blockchain technology. This dual approach—providing stablecoin solutions and XRP-powered cross-border payments —may enhance Ripple’s competitiveness in the global digital finance space.

BTFD Coin Could Be Your Next Shot at Greatness!,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-neiros-boom-btfd-coin-could-be-your-next-shot-at-greatness/,"If you were one of the unlucky few who missed out on Neiro’s explosive ICO and the incredible profits that followed, you might be feeling a bit like you’ve missed your chance at meme coin glory. But don’t fret—there’s another opportunity on the horizon that could be your ticket to the next big thing in crypto. Enter BTFD Coin, the meme coin that’s been making waves with its presale success and strong community backing. Neiro may have had its moment, but the hype around BTFD Coin is just getting started, and the numbers speak for themselves. With over $295,000 raised in its presale and 10 billion coins already sold, BTFD Coin is setting up to be the next meme coin legend. If you missed Neiro’s launch, this might be your second shot at riding the meme coin wave to serious gains. Let’s take a closer look at why BTFD Coin could be the best opportunity to jump into right now. Neiro: The Meme Coin That Left Investors Speechless Often seen as the little sister to Dogecoin, Neiro carries the same meme magic but with a story all its own. Adopted by the same person who once owned Kabosu—the iconic dog behind Doge—Neiro takes the mantle of meme coin royalty and runs with it. Neiro made a serious splash during its ICO, deploying first on the Ethereum network and drawing the eyes of none other than Vitalik Buterin himself. In a surprise twist, Vitalik publicly backed Neiro on August 4th, 2024, during a rare moment of the New Moon. Shortly after, the Ethereum founder made waves again by donating over $500k to an animal welfare fund, marking a key turning point in Neiro’s journey. This was only the second time Vitalik interacted with a meme coin, the first being with the SHIB token in 2021. Talk about a major endorsement! But Neiro’s story isn’t just about big names and crypto stardom. It’s about redemption. After being abandoned by its original dev and sent to a shelter, Neiro has risen from the ashes—just like any true meme coin. Today, the project is 100% community-owned, with an enthusiastic group of supporters driving its growth. With a charitable mission at its core, the coin has already made donations to the shelter that took in Neiro, and more initiatives are in the works. This commitment to giving back is what makes Neiro stand out in the crowded world of meme coins. BTFD Coin: Your Second Shot at Meme Coin Glory For everyone kicking themselves over Neiro, BTFD Coin is ready to deliver redemption. This meme coin is making waves with its revolutionary approach to community-driven growth, gamification, and high APY staking rewards. Oh, and let’s not forget its wildly successful presale performance. In less than 24 hours, BTFD Coin raised over $150,000 during its presale, and it hasn’t slowed down since. To date, it’s surpassed $295,000 in funding, with over 10 billion coins already sold. The current price sits at $0.00005—meaning early investors still have time to secure their slice of the pie before the price increases again. Why is everyone so hyped about BTFD Coin? Let’s break it down: High Staking APY: Offering an average annual percentage yield of 90%, BTFD Coin makes your investment work overtime, ensuring rewards stack up fast. Play-to-Earn Game: With a four-level gamified ecosystem, users can convert in-game rewards into real tokens, adding serious value for crypto gamers. Bulls Squad Characters: This isn’t just another meme coin. BTFD Coin has built an engaging narrative around its quirky mascot team—Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull—capturing the hearts of investors and creating a sense of belonging. Investment Potential: Turning $1,000 Into a Dream Let’s say you decide to jump into BTFD Coin right now. With an investment of $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.00005, you’d snag a whopping 20 million BTFD Coins. Now, here’s where it gets exciting: If BTFD Coin achieves a price of $0.0006—an entirely realistic target based on its trajectory—you could see your $1,000 investment skyrocket to $12,000. That’s a 12x return, folks. And remember, this doesn’t even factor in additional gains from staking rewards or P2E game earnings. Why Choose BTFD Coin Over Neiro Now? While Neiro made its mark and created millionaires, its initial boom has passed, and the hype has started to plateau. BTFD Coin , on the other hand, is still in its growth phase, making it a prime opportunity for savvy investors looking for the next breakout star. Don’t let history repeat itself—secure your BTFD Coins during the presale and position yourself for what could be one of the most profitable moves in your crypto journey. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin The crypto world rarely gives second chances, but BTFD Coin is the exception. With its explosive presale, game-changing features, and a community that’s growing by the day, it’s shaping up to be the redemption story you’ve been waiting for. Jump into the presale today and grab your share of this rising star before prices climb even higher. It’s your time to turn missed opportunities into massive wins.

Lunex Network’s non-custodial exchange and cross-chain interoperability have established new standards in crypto trading. With access to over 50,000 cryptocurrencies and staking rewards, Lunex Network is changing how traders utilize DeFi. With rising demand and whale investments, this platform is emerging as a vital player bringing fundamental changes to the DeFi sector. BNB’s (BNB) Price Expected To Fall BNB is the native token of the Binance ecosystem and remains amongst the biggest altcoins in terms of market value. However, contrary to other highly ranked altcoins, BNB didn’t experience an impressive price boost after Donald Trump’s election victory. Although BNB has stayed over $600, BNB hasn’t beaten $700 or even close to its all-time high price. For most of the entire year, BNB has traded between $450 and $600. This stagnation has disappointed many BNB holders but what do analysts predict about its future? The consensus is that BNB is facing low volatility and declining interest. If buying pressure increases, BNB might experience a rise. However, based on its recent trends, it is more likely to fall. XRP (XRP) See Over 100% Price Increase In A Month Ripple lost out to Dogecoin in Elon Musk’s X stakes, but the Ripple ecosystem has several bullish factors stacked in its favor. The prospects for Ripple ETF becoming approved in the U.S. have improved lately with the announcement that SEC chair Gary Gensler is leaving in January. Some XRP analysts think the lawsuit against Ripple Labs will be resolved in a short while and the legal fights will end. Additionally, XRP has gained over 176% in a month. While XRP’s all-time high of $2.44 may not hold much longer, this surge could continue as clarity about the SEC leadership unfolds. XRP’s exchange-traded product, now renamed the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP, has also sparked renewed investor interest. Ripple has invested heavily in this renamed ETP, contributing to the growing interest in XRP. Multi-Chain Support: Lunex Network’s Competitive Edge in DeFi Lunex Network (LNEX) is changing decentralized trading by combining off-chain efficiency with on-chain security through a hybrid architecture. This approach creates an ideal trading environment for over 50,000 multi-chain currency pairs across more than 40 blockchains. Lunex Network addresses key issues like high slippage and rejected transactions, making trading smoother for users. In addition to redefining crypto trading, Lunex Network rewards its users. Lunex Network offers staking rewards of up to 18% APYs through a unique revenue-sharing model. Traders who add $LNEX tokens to their staking pools can begin receiving rewards in as little as 30 days. Since presale investors get their tokens immediately, many are already taking advantage of this opportunity to earn returns before $LNEX officially launches on the open market. During its presale session, Lunex Network, valued at $0.0033, has already attracted over $3.7million in investments. Lunex Network’s unique features and market potential have made it a hot topic in the decentralized exchange space. The growing fear of missing out (FOMO) is drawing more investors, with experts predicting a potential 1,800% return after its exchange listing debut. As 2025 approaches, many crypto investors are looking for tokens that could bring significant returns. Lunex Network stands out as one with high ROI potential, surpassing other favorites like XRP and BNB, which focus on business adoption and sharding techniques. Now is the perfect time to join the Lunex Network’s presale and enjoy the unique benefits of this rapidly growing crypto.

33767162,[object Object],1733031048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Price To $3 And XRP Price To $5? Analyst Says It’s ‘A Matter Of Time’,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-to-3-and-xrp-price-to-5-analyst-says-its-a-matter-of-time/,"The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to bullish predictions, particularly given the current positive market sentiment. According to a crypto market participant who goes by the name Scofield (@Crypto_Scofield) on social media platform X, there are a few altcoins with bullish potential in the coming weeks and month. In his recent post, Scofield shared a list of price targets for various cryptocurrencies, including well-known tokens such as Dogecoin and XRP. Among the notable predictions, he suggested that Dogecoin could reach $3, while XRP could hit $5, describing these price levels as “a matter of time.” Price Predictions To Stir Crypto Investors Although the post in which this analyst highlighted these bullish price targets did not come with a technical analysis and potential timelines, it nonetheless plays into the current bullish sentiment surrounding these cryptocurrencies. XRP, for instance, has been undergoing ultra-bullish inflows and buying pressure from crypto traders, which has caused its price to be trading at its highest point in over three years. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.93, which is its highest level since 2018. This impressive rally has reignited interest in the token and its only a matter of time before the XRP price surpasses the critical $2 threshold. The XRP price is already up by 270% in the past 30 days, and reaching the predicted $5 mark would translate to a further 160% increase at this point. Scofield’s assertion that the XRP price could surge to $5 aligns with the bullish sentiment that has surrounded the token since the US presidential elections. Additionally, the expected change in SEC leadership has also sent the XRP price surging more than many would’ve expected. However, reaching $5 would require the XRP price to overcome its current all-time high of $3.40 and maintain consistent trading volume. Another interesting aspect of Scofield’s predictions is the projection of Dogecoin reaching $3 . This prediction resonates with the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the token, which has seen renewed attention from both retail and institutional investors. Dogecoin, like XRP, is trading at multi-year highs, recently climbing to $0.4759. Notably, this marks the highest level the Dogecoin price has achieved in three years. For Dogecoin, reaching the predicted $3 mark would translate to a 530% increase from $0.4759. Other Predictions: A Broader Bullish Sentiment Scofield’s list extended beyond Dogecoin and XRP, as it covers several altcoins with equally ambitious targets. Notably, he envisions Fetch.ai (FET) climbing to $10, Fantom (FTM) hitting $5, and Injective Protocol (INJ) surging to $150. Additionally, he predicted VeChain (VET) will reach $0.25, Coti (COTI) will hit $1, and Oasis (ROSE), $0.80.

Ripple’s XRP sustained a price rally, nearing $2 against the backdrop of legal maneuvers in favor of the American blockchain payments company. Simultaneously, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw bullish dynamics fueling market optimism surrounding the meme coin. On the other hand, Bitcoin (BTC) continued to consolidate near its ATH this week, sparking market discussions. Here’s a brief report on some of the most buzz-worthy cryptocurrency market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Ripple’s Crypto Sustains Rally Amid Legal Developments Notably, the Ripple-backed crypto saw a highly bullish week, extending weekly gains to 30% and resting near $1.90. This rising trajectory has sparked noteworthy optimism, which is in line with recent legal developments regarding the blockchain payments company. Primarily, the lawsuit against the U.S. SEC could end under the “new SEC,” CoinGape Media reported. This optimistic anticipation comes against the backdrop of SEC Chair Gary Gensler announcing his exit and pro-crypto Donald Trump securing a win in the U.S. elections. Moreover, pro-XRP attorneys Bill Morgan, Fred Rispoli, and Jeremy Hogan also revealed that the appeals are likely to get dismissed, hinting that the lawsuit against the U.S. SEC could drop soon. Overall, as the much-awaited conclusion for the lawsuit comes, market sentiments surrounding the Ripple-backed asset have turned highly bullish. Intriguingly, amid these optimistic events, the coin also overtook BNB in terms of market cap , marking a monumental stride. Simultaneously, the asset’s futures OI topped $2.5 billion this week, echoing investor optimism. Further, with Ripple eyeing RLUSD stablecoin launch ahead with indications that New York’s top financial regulator, the Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), is poised to approve the product, market sentiments remain bullish on future movements. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Steals Spotlight Simultaneously, Shiba Inu has gained significant traction this week, witnessing remarkable burns and ecosystem developments. CoinGape Media reported the SHIB burn rate to have soared remarkably over the past seven days, sparking optimism surrounding the coin’s future price movements. Simultaneously, even the coin’s layer 2 network, Shibarium, saw a maintenance upgrade, enhancing functionality. While these events significantly bolstered prices, it’s also noteworthy that Shiba Inu whale holdings were reported to be on the rise. This stat has underscored heightened market interest in the asset amid a bullish Q4. In turn, crypto market enthusiasts are extensively eyeing the token for further gains in light of the abovementioned optimistic stats. BTC Consolidates Near ATH Meanwhile, the flagship crypto has faced some market turbulence near its ATH, resting above the $95K level as the week closes. Notably, Robert Kiyosaki warns amid this turbulent movement that Bitcoin could surpass $100K soon, making it harder for the middle class to invest, urging FOMO for early investors. This statement sparked noteworthy optimism for the cryptocurrency, while other bullish events also unfolded across the broader market. Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim proposed Bitcoin as a reserve asset this week, underscoring the asset’s market potential. Additionally, a stockpile of bullish on-chain metrics weighing in has added to intrigue on the asset’s future movements.

With its playful mascot and a community of fervent supporters, Dogecoin has evolved from a meme into a formidable altcoin, sparking discussions about its potential for massive gains. As analysts scrutinize the charts and market behaviors, one altcoin rival, RCO Finance (RCOF), is emerging as a contender that could deliver astonishing returns, projected at an eye-popping 9,505%. Dogecoin Price Déjà Vu: Echoes of 2021’s Meteoric Rise Dogecoin’s journey from a meme-inspired altcoin to a significant player in the market is nothing short of extraordinary. In 2021, the Dogecoin price experienced an unprecedented surge, skyrocketing over 800% daily, largely fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Fast forward to November 2024, and the Dogecoin price is at approximately $0.418, reflecting a 5.67% increase from the previous close. Analysts note that its current price patterns resemble those preceding the 2021 surge. Technical analysis indicates a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart, a bullish indicator that historically signaled significant upward movements for the Dogecoin price. This pattern, combined with increased market interest and favorable regulatory developments, suggests that the Dogecoin price might be poised for another substantial rally. However, the altcoin market’s inherent volatility necessitates cautious optimism. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Dogecoin Rival on the Rise Amidst the renewed interest in the Dogecoin price movements, RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a formidable rival in the altcoin space. RCOF is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that leverages crypto AI to optimize investment strategies, offering users access to various financial instruments.

This level of transparency builds trust among users, who can invest confidently, knowing their assets are protected against potential vulnerabilities. RCOF Altcoin Presale Surpasses the $7 Million Milestone As the Dogecoin price continues to gain momentum, RCO Finance is positioning itself to replicate similar growth, offering investors substantial returns on investment (ROI). With a rapidly growing investor base, its presale has already surpassed the $7 million mark and is closing in on the $10 million milestone. The ongoing presale of RCOF presents an extraordinary opportunity for investors eager to capitalize on this promising project.

Following its surge to $98,000, a crypto analyst has asserted that the BTC price has officially entered the parabolic phase of this four-year market cycle . Bitcoin Price Enters Parabolic Phase Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital has declared to his 517,800 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has officially and completely transitioned into its “ Parabolic Upside phase ” this bull cycle. The analyst shared a chart illustrating the coin’s price action during the 2021 bull run and the current bull cycle. After its halving event in 2022, the Bitcoin price experienced a massive rally that pushed it to its 2021 all-time high of over $64,000. At the time, Bitcoin had experienced a significant correction before fully entering its bullish upside phase. Interestingly, a similar trend can also be seen in this bull cycle, signaling a possibility of more price rallies. In the last few months, the BTC price entered a re-accumulation phase characterised by slight declines and consolidation before recording a subsequent rally above $99,000 . Rekt Capital disclosed that after BTC hit $98,000, the pioneer cryptocurrency had successfully entered its parabolic upside phase. This phase suggests that Bitcoin could rise even higher, matching analysts’ expectations in this bull market. On November 27, Rekt Capital also shared a post illustrating the crypto asset’s steady progression into the parabolic phase. He pointed out that the cryptocurrency was on the verge of exiting a reaccumulation phase and transitioning into the parabolic upside, as indicated by the green zone on the price chart. Bitcoin Price: $100,000 ATH – Now Or Never The crypto community is on an intense bullish ride, as analysts and investors widely anticipate the Bitcoin price surge to $100,000. The leading cryptocurrency has been trading just shy of the $100,000 mark , experiencing a price increase above $98,000 at some point in the past week. A crypto analyst identified as Trader of Crypto on X is tapping into this strong bullish trend, announcing that “the clock is ticking” for Bitcoin to reach $100,000. His statement underscores how close Bitcoin is to reaching the milestone during this cycle. Trader of Crypto has also stated that it is only a matter of time before Bitcoin breaks past the anticipated $100,000 all time high. While the analyst has maintained a bullish outlook on Bitcoin , he has also presented a price chart that suggests that the cryptocurrency could experience a crash towards $46,757 if bears take over. The Bitcoin price is currently trading at $96,965, marking a 1% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

Davis foresees Cardano (ADA), currently ranked as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reaching $10 this bull cycle. This target is approximately an 817% increase from its current value. BREAKING: Lark Davis says "" #Cardano 's getting the attention and the hype, we could see $10.00 $ADA ."" pic.twitter.com/oOpCx0DuI6 — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) November 29, 2024 Cardano’s Recent Surge and Ecosystem Growth Cardano has recently emerged as one of the strongest-performing cryptocurrencies in the market, recording a monthly gain of over 210%. The asset’s market cap is closing in on that of USD Coin (USDC), currently the eighth-largest cryptocurrency. This performance underscores the growing interest in Cardano, which Davis attributes to substantial hype around the ecosystem. Davis emphasized that this attention creates a favorable macroeconomic environment for the asset, stating that Cardano could experience significant momentum in the ongoing bull market. Lark Davis’ Price Targets for Cardano Davis’ bullish outlook on Cardano suggests the asset will first aim for its previous all-time high of $3.16, achieved during the last cycle. From there, he anticipates further increases, projecting a rise to the 1.618 Fibonacci level of $4.80, representing a 332% gain from its all-time high. Beyond this, Davis predicts ADA will target the 2.618 Fibonacci level at $7.70 before reaching his ultimate goal of $10 at the 3.618 Fibonacci level. He said it is achievable given the current market dynamics and Cardano’s growing adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Dominance and Price Correlation To substantiate his prediction, Davis referenced Cardano’s market dominance during the previous cycle, which peaked at around 4%. If Cardano achieves a similar level of dominance in the current market, its market cap would need to increase tenfold to approximately $370 billion. According to Davis, this rise in market valuation aligns with his Fibonacci-based price projection of $10. Other analysts share similarly optimistic views about Cardano’s future. For example, Dan Gambardello has predicted ADA could rise to between $5 and $10 after stabilizing above the $1 mark. On-Chain Indicators Support Continued Growth On-chain data and trading activity indicate Cardano may be gearing up for further gains. Recent statistics from CoinMarketCap reveal that Cardano’s 24-hour trading volume has surpassed that of Binance Coin (BNB), suggesting a growing interest from market participants. Additionally, analyst Jake Wujastyk has identified strong technical signals for Cardano’s next move. He highlighted the “volume shelf” indicator in his analysis, which suggests that ADA could see another significant upward trajectory. Current Market Performance As of now, Cardano is trading at $1.09, representing a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours. This price movement reflects sustained momentum and investor confidence, aligning with analysts’ expectations of further gains in the ongoing bull cycle. With substantial market activity, technical indicators, and optimistic predictions from industry experts, Cardano appears to be positioned for further growth. If Davis’ $10 target materializes, it would mark a historic achievement for the asset, cementing its status as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in the market.

Each offers unique value propositions, making them prime contenders for anyone looking to diversify their digital portfolio. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just testing the waters, understanding the nuances of these projects could unlock massive potential gains. Among them, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged as a dark horse, sparking excitement in the crypto space with its revolutionary Web3 aggregator platform and impressive presale performance. While Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) are already well-established names known for their reliability and innovation, Qubetics is quickly positioning itself as a disruptor with unparalleled utility and growth prospects. If you’re wondering where to put your money this week, it’s worth diving deep into what makes each of these projects unique. This exploration might just give you the edge you need to make a strategic and profitable decision. Qubetics: A Revolutionary Force in the Web3 Space Qubetics ($TICS) is the talk of the town, and for good reason. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it’s not just offering a token; it’s redefining how businesses and developers interact with blockchain technology. At the heart of its innovation lies the QubeQode IDE , a groundbreaking tool that simplifies blockchain development for professionals without technical expertise. Imagine you’re a freelancer, wanting to leverage blockchain without spending months—or a fortune—learning complex coding languages. QubeQode steps in with drag-and-drop functionalities that make creating smart contracts and decentralised applications as simple as building a presentation. The presale numbers further underscore Qubetics’ momentum. Currently in its 10th stage, Qubetics has already sold over 239 million tokens to more than 5000 holders, raising a staggering $3.8 million. At just $0.0257 per token, this is a window of opportunity that savvy investors won’t want to miss. Analysts predict that $TICS could soar to $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering a jaw-dropping 871% ROI. But that’s not all. With projections of $1 post-presale and a staggering $15 after the mainnet launch, early investors could be looking at returns exceeding 58,000%. Consider this scenario: A freelancer investing $1,000 at the current price of $0.0257 would secure approximately 38,910 tokens. By the time $TICS hits $1, that $1,000 grows to $38,910. And if the ambitious $15 projection holds true? A life-changing $583,650. Litecoin: The Veteran Altcoin That Still Delivers Litecoin (LTC) is the wise elder in the cryptocurrency world, and its staying power is nothing short of remarkable. Often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin was designed to offer faster and cheaper transactions, and it’s delivered on that promise for over a decade. While newer projects grab headlines with flashy innovations, Litecoin quietly continues to serve as a reliable workhorse in the crypto ecosystem. First, its robust technology and extensive adoption. Litecoin is widely regarded as one of the most secure blockchains, making it a trusted choice for peer-to-peer transactions and as a payment method for merchants worldwide. Moreover, its finite supply ensures scarcity, which often translates to long-term value retention. Litecoin’s ongoing commitment to innovation also keeps it relevant. The recent MimbleWimble upgrade, enhancing privacy and scalability, has solidified its position as a go-to for investors seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. While its price movements may not match the volatility of meme coins or newer tokens, Litecoin’s strength lies in its stability and reliability—making it an excellent hedge against riskier bets. Cardano: The Smart Contract Powerhouse Cardano (ADA) has long been celebrated for its visionary approach to blockchain technology, earning a reputation as one of the most academically rigorous projects in the space. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano was built with a mission: to solve the scalability, sustainability, and interoperability issues that plague first-generation blockchains. Over the years, it has firmly established itself as one of the best altcoins to buy this week, offering a potent mix of innovation and real-world utility. The recent surge in Cardano’s price reflects growing investor confidence in its ecosystem. With its proof-of-stake mechanism leading the charge for energy-efficient blockchains, Cardano has become a favourite among eco-conscious investors. Its smart contract capabilities, enabled by the Alonzo upgrade, have opened the floodgates for decentralised applications and DeFi projects. Developers can now create everything from NFT marketplaces to decentralised finance protocols, making Cardano a playground for innovation. Community trust is another hallmark of Cardano’s success. Its transparent development process and rigorous peer-reviewed approach foster confidence among both retail and institutional investors. As decentralised finance continues to grow, Cardano is well-positioned to play a pivotal role, with its ADA token serving as a cornerstone of its thriving ecosystem. Don’t Miss Out on These Altcoin Opportunities When it comes to the best altcoins to buy this week, Qubetics, Litecoin, and Cardano each offer compelling reasons to take a closer look. For those seeking a cutting-edge opportunity with unparalleled growth potential, Qubetics’ ongoing presale presents a rare chance to get in before a likely price explosion. Meanwhile, Litecoin and Cardano remain stalwarts in the crypto space, offering stability, innovation, and long-term promise. But the clock is ticking. With $TICS poised for a 10% price increase as it moves to the next presale stage, the time to act is now. Securing your stake in Qubetics today could be the move that transforms your financial future.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 06:40:00

Armstrong, a prominent crypto commentator, made the remarks following XRP’s recent significant milestone, where it surpassed Binance Coin (BNB) to claim the fifth spot among cryptocurrencies by market cap. $XRP has flipped $BNB , and it's just a quick, easy pump away from flipping $SOL . $ETH you can run, but you can't hide! — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) November 29, 2024 XRP Outpaces BNB, Climbs to Three-Year High On Friday, XRP overtook BNB after reaching $1.70, propelling its market capitalization to $97 billion. This marked a significant achievement for XRP, which has since gained momentum. As of the latest data, XRP is trading at $1.86, reflecting a slight pullback from its recent peak of $1.94—the highest price recorded in three years. The asset currently holds a $107 billion market capitalization, solidifying its position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies. This development has widened the gap between XRP and BNB, solidifying XRP’s fifth-place position. The new valuation brings XRP within striking distance of Solana (SOL), the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Solana holds a market capitalization of $117 billion, maintaining a $10 billion lead over XRP. Analysts suggest XRP could surpass Solana if its price reaches $2.10, assuming Solana’s price does not see a proportional increase. Achieving this milestone would position XRP directly behind Ethereum , which leads the altcoin market. Ethereum Under Pressure from XRP’s Surge Amid XRP’s recent progress, Armstrong has emphasized his long-standing prediction that XRP will surpass Ethereum. In a tweet, Armstrong stated, “ETH, you can run, but you can’t hide (from XRP),” signaling his confidence in XRP’s upward trajectory. Ethereum currently trades at $3,705, with a market capitalization of approximately $446.27 billion. By comparison, XRP’s market cap of $107 billion highlights a significant gap between the two. For XRP to match Ethereum’s valuation, its price would need to quadruple, reaching roughly $8. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although such a scenario may seem ambitious, XRP’s recent performance suggests it is not impossible. Since November 4, XRP has surged from $0.4968 to $1.94, representing a remarkable 291% increase. In contrast, Ethereum’s price has grown by just 40% over the same period. If XRP’s growth continues at this pace and Ethereum’s rise remains modest, the possibility of XRP closing the gap becomes more plausible. Can XRP Reach Ethereum’s Market Cap? Reaching Ethereum’s market valuation would require XRP to sustain its bullish momentum. Should XRP achieve a market cap of $445 billion, the asset’s price would align with the projected $8. However, some critics view this target as overly optimistic, citing the likelihood of resistance between the $3 and $5 price levels. Despite these concerns, many XRP proponents remain confident that the cryptocurrency could reach double-digit prices during this cycle, potentially leading to the much-anticipated “flip” of Ethereum. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether XRP can maintain its upward trajectory and challenge Ethereum’s dominance. Armstrong and other bullish commentators remain steadfast in their belief, but market dynamics will ultimately dictate the outcome.

This increase has propelled XRP to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, now exceeding $107 billion. As of the latest trading data, XRP is priced at $1.87, reflecting a remarkable 99% increase over the past two weeks. This performance has allowed XRP to surpass Binance Coin (BNB) in market capitalization , signaling a resurgence of investor interest. XRP Breaks Free From Three-Year Stagnation The recent rally marks a significant turnaround for XRP, which had been consolidating between $0.30 and $0.60 for nearly three years. This period of stagnation was largely attributed to the end of the 2021 bull run and the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC’s classification of XRP as an “unregistered security” has created substantial uncertainty for investors, particularly in the US, which has impacted the token’s market performance. However, recent political developments in the United States have contributed to a renewed sense of confidence among crypto investors. Following Donald Trump’s victory on November 5, where he defeated current Vice President Kamala Harris, the cryptocurrency market saw a significant recovery. Bitcoin, in particular, reached a new all-time high of $99,540, leading this resurgence. Trump’s election promises to overhaul regulatory frameworks, including the dismissal of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office, have further fueled optimism. Gensler has announced his departure from the agency effective January 20, coinciding with the presidential inauguration, raising hopes that the protracted legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC may soon be resolved. This potential resolution could pave the way for increased investment in XRP and the introduction of new investment products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on the token, with several asset managers having already filed applications. New Price Targets And Support Levels In terms of technical analysis, crypto analyst DarkDefender has noted that XRP has successfully broken through a critical resistance level at $1.44. With the recent uptrend recorded for the fifth largest token on the market, DarkDefender outlined new targets for XRP, including $3.4176 and $11.3233, while also revisiting historical targets of $5.85 and $18.22. Furthermore, the analyst highlighted new support levels at $1.44, $1.28, $1.14, and $1.03. The 4-hour chart indicates a new market structure for XRP, with expectations of touching $2.13 before any potential corrections. New resistance levels are identified at $4.11 and $6.42 within this timeframe, aligning with the main target of $5.85 following the anticipated move above $1.88.

As the crypto markets enter the final month of 2024, ETH is looking to end the year on a high and extend its rally beyond $4,000. Ethereum (ETH) Sees Surge In Investor Interest Ethereum (ETH) is trading just below the $3,700 level and could rally to test the resistance at $4,000. Trading data shows that ETH has established a foothold above the crucial $3,500 level, indicating growing investor confidence in the asset. Its recent price action also points to strengthening market dynamics as ETH looks to maintain its upward trajectory. ETH’s price chart shows a consistent recovery phase, with prices remaining above crucial support zones. Data from Kraken reveals buyers consistently stepping in above $3,500, suggesting the formation of a strong foundation and support zone at this level, providing a base for future price discovery. Trading volumes have also jumped, indicating active participation across derivatives and spot markets and broad-based interest at current prices. This level of market activity indicates strong market engagement rather than short-term speculation. Ethereum CME futures open interest (OI) has been significantly higher since the US elections and has consistently risen with the price of ETH. The Ethereum CME open interest gives an idea of US investor interest in ETH derivatives. The ETH CME open interest crossed $2.8 billion for the first time last week, indicating surging interest among US traders in the altcoin. The bullish sentiment also sent ETH’s CME futures surging. Spot Ethereum ETFs have also seen consistent inflows, outpacing spot Bitcoin ETFs, and have recorded $225 million in inflows over the past four days. Ethereum Sets Sights On $4,000 Ethereum (ETH) has been steadily climbing over crucial levels as it looks to end the year on a high. Following the US election, ETH surged past the 200-day SMA and $3,000, levels it has struggled to cross. It faced a decline after reaching this level as sellers attempted to drive the price below $3,000. However, ETH found strong support at around $3,100, preventing a further decline. After trading between $3,100 and $3,200 for a few sessions, ETH rallied on Thursday (November 21) to go above $3,000 and settle at $3,360. The price faced considerable selling pressure on Friday, falling back in the red, dropping by 0.96% to $3,328. Source: TradingView The weekend began with ETH surging towards $3,500. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching $3,502, and ETH fell to settle at $3,396, an increase of just over 2%. Sellers returned to the market on Sunday as ETH faced significant volatility, dropping by 1.01% to $3,362. ETH recovered on Monday, rising by 1.60% to hit an intraday high of $3,547 before dropping and settling at $3,415. It fell back in the red again on Tuesday, registering a drop of almost 3% and settling at $3,325. Despite Tuesday’s bearish session, ETH rallied on Wednesday, surging nearly 10% to go above $3,500 and settle at $3,657. However, it could not go above the resistance at $3,700 and fell back on Thursday, dropping over 2% to $3,580. Buyers attempted a recovery on Friday but could only manage a marginal increase and move the price to $3,694. However, ETH has seen momentum build during the ongoing session as it went past $3,700 to $3,733 before declining to its current level of $3,665, up 2%. Where Next For Ethereum (ETH)? Ethereum faces resistance at $3,700. If ETH can rally and move above this level, it could move to $4,000. A break above $4,000 could see the altcoin hit a new yearly high above $4,522. The RSI indicates bullish sentiment, hinting we could see a rally towards the $4,000 mark. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Top Cryptos to Watch Now,https://timestabloid.com/btc-whales-are-loading-up-massive-rally-predicted-top-cryptos/,"The crypto market is on the cusp of another rally, and investors are getting set to take full advantage of it. This is due to Bitcoin’s boom, a development that has sent BTC whales buying copious amounts of Bitcoin . But Bitcoin is not the only coin investors are keeping an eye on– Rollblock is also heating up, and Binance Coin BNB is on the minds of many as well. Veteran investors believe these are the crypto to watch during this period. This article explains why you should pay attention to them. A surging revolution in the GambleFi market Unknown to most people, the GambleFi market is worth an astonishing $500 billion. In fact, this market is on course to hit $1 trillion in a few years, and Rollblock is well-positioned to dominate the space. This is because the online crypto casino integrates blockchain technology into its processes to provide a provably fair gaming experience for gamblers. Rollblock users play without anxiety and worry because the platform is committed to trust and transparency. Every betting odd, stake, transaction, and other important metrics are recorded on the blockchain, which makes them immutable and makes Rollblock incapable of sharp practices. Since this feature is very rare in the GambleFi space, Rollblock effectively qualifies as a crypto to watch out for. Its presale is tearing things up, having raised $6 million for investors alone. And it should, since it’s got an attractive entry price of $0.0037, with the potential for a significant price appreciation in the upcoming crypto surge. BTC price prediction sends the crypto market on a bullish run Ever since Bitcoin hit a new all-time high close to $100k, BTC price predictions have gone through the roof. Several people believe a rally to $150K is imminent, while others expect a correction. However, one thing is clear: the crypto market is set to embark on a massive price rally! This is due to the massive influence Bitcoin has on prices. With Microstrategy’s Michael Saylor about to pour billions into BTC , things could get crazy any time soon. Will BNB ride the upcoming crypto boom? Binance Coin BNB appreciated handsomely over the last year. It rode a bull wave to hit an ATH of $700, but that was its highlight for the year. BNB only appreciated modestly during the last post-US election boom, and this leaves much room for doubts. After appreciating to an impressive $600 last March, BNB has traded mostly in a straight line. It dropped below $500 but struggled to break a resistance level of $600. After Donald Trump’s victory, most coins shot through the roof, but BNB barely crossed $700. This doesn’t inspire confidence in its ability to ride the upcoming crypto bull run. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rally is surely going to set the crypto market on an extremely bullish momentum and Rollblock tops the coins to watch out for during this period. Unlike Bitcoin and BNB , it has an affordable entry price of $0.037. Also, going by their recent price history Rollblock is more likely to ride the upcoming wave than BNB . This makes it the ideal crypto investment for ambitious investors. If you missed out on Bitcoin , Ethereum, and Solana when they were worth less than a dollar, Rollblock has provided a brand new opportunity to join a revolutionary movement that is heading to the top. Don’t miss out on it. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

In a Fox Business interview on Wednesday, Giancarlo suggested that the SEC might abandon its appeal against Ripple after a series of courtroom losses. Crypto Dad Claims SEC Will Drop The XRP Case On being asked whether the SEC would drop the XRP case, the ‘Crypto Dad’ responded saying “I think they should, I bet they would. I would recommend, it’s time for regulatory agencies to drop a lot of these cases which they have lost at the trial court,” he noted. Giancarlo’s remarks come amidst waves of optimism in the crypto industry following a Trump victory, in expectations of more crypto-friendly regulations. Particularly in the backdrop of Gensler’s exit and Trump taking office the same day, this matter has gained widespread traction as there is renewed confidence in the community after years of backlash against the “regulation by enforcement” approach backed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ‘The Crypto Czar’ Notably, Trump’s team has revealed plans to decentralize crypto oversight, potentially shifting some responsibilities to the CFTC and appointing a dedicated ‘Crypto Czar’. Trump’s former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo is a lead contender for the role of White Crypto Czar. This new position could usher in a new era of pro-crypto policy in Washington, noted Fox Business. Previously, the former CFTC Chair had shared that he does not wish to clean up the mess that former SEC Chair Gary Gensler created when there were rumors that he was being considered for the position. On asking his views on who will be the next SEC Chair, Giancarlo hopes that it is someone who has both the institutional knowledge of the building and a deep commitment to innovation and crypto agenda. He suggested that Paul Atkins, who is among the top names in consideration, could be the next SEC Chair. Atkins is widely respected for his deep understanding of cryptocurrencies and the SEC’s operations, making him a likely ally for the crypto industry. Will Trump Accomplish His Promises? On asking if Trump will deliver his promises of making the US the crypto capital of the world and creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Giancarlo emphasized that this is the reason why he believes a Crypto Czar is critically important to materialize all the promises. He believes that Trump is committed to all this and aims to create ‘the second industrial revolution in America’. “If we can go from where we’ve been in the last few years, which was resistance to innovation, to really furthering innovation, we might be able to get to that 4.5% growth rate and get us out of our debt problems,” underscored the former CFTC Chair. With the incoming Trump administration that prioritizes innovation and clarity, the crypto industry may see a significant turnaround in its U.S. prospects, paving the way for growth and investment.",News|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-01 07:35:49

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/legal-expert-is-certain-ripple-sec-case-appeal-will-be-dropped-heres-why/,"Bill Morgan, a prominent lawyer in the cryptocurrency sector, recently responded to a tweet by Charles Gasparino, Senior Correspondent at Fox Business, regarding the potential implications of Donald Trump’s re-election for the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. The comment has sparked significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community. Gasparino’s original tweet highlighted the possibility that a new SEC administration under Trump could drop the appeal concerning the portion of the case Ripple won. The appeal will be dropped because there was no error made in the part of the case the SEC lost and the political motive for continuing a near hopeless appeal will largely disappear when its main internal SEC enabler Gary Gensler resigns on 20 January 25. https://t.co/HfaepDv95c — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) November 28, 2024 Gasparino quoted Christopher Giancarlo, the former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who expressed a similar belief during a Fox Business segment. Gasparino described this scenario as plausible, noting that the political landscape under Trump could significantly influence the SEC’s litigation strategy. In response, Bill Morgan asserted that the appeal would likely be dropped regardless of political dynamics. Morgan stated that the SEC’s appeal of the summary judgment , which ruled that certain XRP sales did not constitute securities transactions, is “near hopeless” due to the absence of any judicial error in the decision. He further emphasized that the political motivations driving the appeal would diminish once Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, steps down, which he projected to occur on January 20, 2025, coinciding with the presidential inauguration. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal and Political Implications Morgan’s response underscores a key legal consideration in the SEC’s case against Ripple. The court’s ruling in July 2023 differentiated between institutional sales of XRP, deemed securities, and programmatic sales to retail investors, which were not. This split decision was a partial victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Morgan’s assertion that “there was no error” in the court’s ruling aligns with many legal experts who view the SEC’s prospects on appeal as weak. The case has drawn significant attention due to its implications for crypto regulation in the United States. The SEC leadership under Gensler has been criticized for its aggressive enforcement actions against cryptocurrency firms. A change in the SEC’s administration following the 2024 presidential election could impact its regulatory approach, particularly if Trump appoints officials with a more favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies.

In a new discussion on the Wealthion podcast with SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, the Fundstrat head of research says the current technical trajectory of BTC and the incoming pro-crypto presidential administration are putting Bitcoin in a position to achieve his massive price target. “Over the next twelve months, I think something over $250,000 is possible, but maybe highly probable based on just following this price cycle. The second reason I think Bitcoin has maybe more upside than that is because the new administration has run on a pro-Bitcoin platform, and I think the possibility of the US not only legitimizing Bitcoin but making it a strategic reserve asset, I think raises what would be the possible price scenarios for Bitcoin because if the US government, as the intend, ultimately gets to a million Bitcoin it will be the largest Bitcoin holder in the world and they exert an enormous positive influence on legitimizing Bitcoin. I would add to that… It’s almost like taking a playbook from MicroStrategy because MicroStrategy has proven that using Bitcoin as a balance sheet asset has really created a lot of value for MicroStrategy shareholders.” In a recent interview with Natalie Brunell, Lee said that Bitcoin’s market cap could soar about 750% from its current value to hit $16 trillion. Lee believes investors will increasingly flock to Bitcoin as a more useful store of value than gold. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,943.

Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no supply limit, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute, making it highly abundant. Once regarded as a “memecoin,” Dogecoin skyrocketed in 2021, reaching a market capitalization of over $50 billion and securing its place among the top cryptocurrencies. This rise was fueled by social media buzz and high-profile endorsements, including Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s journey highlights the power of community and social influence in shaping the cryptocurrency market. Despite ongoing debates about its future, its widespread recognition and utility sustain investor interest. Shiba Inu: A meme-inspired token with expanding utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by the pseudonymous developer Ryoshi. Initially minted with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, SHIB gained attention when half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, significantly boosting SHIB’s profile. Running on Ethereum, SHIB benefits from ecosystem compatibility, enabling projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future plans for NFTs and decentralized governance. These developments position SHIB as a notable player in the current market cycle, blending meme appeal with functional innovation. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of its presale, DOGEN follows in the footsteps of tokens like BONK and Popcat. Building a community of leaders, it offers real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters, aiming for unmatched success this altcoin season.
