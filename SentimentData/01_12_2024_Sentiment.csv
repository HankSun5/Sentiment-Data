According to reports, the meeting finished without Trump specifically saying he would hand off every tariff move he intended to make after being sworn in as president next year. Donald Trump has been vocal about his intentions to levy tariffs on specific countries, especially those with trading agreements with the country. Although Trump views the meeting as ‘productive’, he remains unsold on the idea of abandoning his tariff plans. Canada, on the other hand, has been lumped into the same category as countries like Mexico due to the increased flow of migrants and drugs into the United States. Justin Trudeau and Trump confirms positive conversations After the meeting between both leaders, positive intonations were echoed from both parties. While Trudeau described their conversation as ‘excellent’, Donald Trump said in a lengthy post on Trust Social that they discussed several topics they need to cooperate to tackle. Trump mentioned that one of the issues that needs to be addressed is fentanyl and the drug cartel that had destroyed many lives after entering the country illegally. Trump also confirmed they discussed fair trade deals that will not harm the American working population and the United States trade deficit with its supporters in the North. Trump revealed that Trudeau showed his commitment to helping the United States end the fentanyl menace that had destroyed many families. He said the Prime Minister assured him that the country will end the movement of fentanyl through its border into America. Donald Trump had planned a 25% tax on products entering the country’s borders from Canada and Mexico, a law that will take effect when he assumes office. The fentanyl scourge, without a doubt, has been America’s bane, with the country’s agents seizing 43 pounds of the product at the Canadian border. In addition, it also seized 21,100 pounds of the banned product at Mexico’s border. Detailing immigration numbers, border patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October while 23,731 individuals were arrested at the Canadian border from October 2023 to September 2024. However, Canadian officials mentioned new investments in security at its border to prevent these issues from happening. Trudeau details the implications of Trump’s tariff posts According to an anonymous source with inside knowledge, Justin Trudeau initiated the meeting with Trump following the latter’s post concerning Tariffs on Monday. The source mentioned that officials in other countries are interested in how the meeting was arranged, asking for advice. During the dinner, which sources said lasted about three hours, the officials talked about different topics including energy, and trade. The statement from Trudeau’s office mentioned productive discussions. Although Trump had bad words for the Canadian Prime Minister during his first tenure, Trudeau was the first to congratulate him. Before the meeting, Trudeau noted that Trump did not talk about tariffs during his campaign but suddenly wants to add 25% to the costs of goods coming into the country. He said that he feels Trump is serious about the tariff, noting that if the American president-elect says he wants to do something, nothing is stopping him. However, he pointed out that the move could hurt Americans and Canadians. “Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,” he said. If Trump goes ahead with the Tariff move, it could prove costly, destroying the trade pact both countries signed during his first term in office. However, Trudeau mentioned that they were able to renegotiate a deal, saying it was a win for both countries. During his first spell as president, Trump imposed higher tariffs and other countries cranked up theirs too. Canada announced billions in new duties against America in response to taxes on steel and aluminum from the country. Canada is the top export destination for most of the US states, accounting for $2.7 billion worth of goods every day. Canada is trade-dependent, with 77% of its goods being moved into the United States.

Ondo Finance (ONDO) Ondo Finance is changing the game by combining the stability of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. It takes reliable, income-generating assets from the real world and turns them into tokens on the blockchain. This means more people can access high-quality financial products that were once only available to a few. By using blockchain, Ondo makes financial systems better and more accessible to everyone. It has two main parts: one creates tokenized financial products, and the other builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to make these products more functional and scalable. In a market that's often uncertain, Ondo stands out by focusing on trust and security. It works with well-known partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase to keep crypto assets safe. Ondo sets high standards for transparency and follows legal and regulatory rules closely. One of its key products, USDY, acts like a stablecoin but offers yields. It's backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits, giving it stability. For non-US investors, this means access to top-quality, regulated, and clear financial products. With the current interest in secure and transparent crypto options, Ondo's approach could appeal to many looking for reliable investments in the blockchain space. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, known by its token AVAX, is turning heads in the blockchain world. It's a Layer-1 platform that's eco-friendly, boasts low fees, and processes transactions at lightning speed—up to 4,500 per second. One standout feature is its ability for users to launch customizable Subnets, offering flexibility and scalability. Avalanche uses a unique consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto methods, ensuring transactions are finalized in less than two seconds. The platform operates with three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—which handle different tasks like transactions and smart contract execution. AVAX serves as the backbone of the Avalanche ecosystem. It's used for paying transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and powering multiple Subnets. This strong utility positions AVAX well in the current market. With the growing demand for fast and affordable blockchain solutions, Avalanche stands out among competitors. Its eco-friendly approach and rapid transaction times address key challenges in the industry. While markets are always shifting, Avalanche's technology and versatility make it a noteworthy player in today's crypto landscape. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects these digital agreements to real-world data. This means a smart contract can access information like weather reports or stock prices. Chainlink does this through a network of oracles, which are like messengers that bring data from outside sources to the blockchain. They use a reputation system to make sure the data is accurate and reliable. In the current market, Chainlink stands out because it solves a big problem: getting real-world data onto blockchains. This makes smart contracts more useful and opens up new possibilities. Unlike many other coins that focus on payments, Chainlink focuses on data and functionality. Its token, LINK, rewards those who provide data and helps secure the network. As more businesses look to use blockchain technology, the demand for Chainlink's services could grow. This unique approach makes LINK an interesting option to watch in today's market. Mantra (OM) MANTRA is a new blockchain platform that puts security first. It's designed to meet real-world regulatory requirements, making it a trustworthy choice for institutions and developers. With MANTRA, you get a blockchain that's open to everyone but can also support applications that need special permissions. This means businesses can build on MANTRA without worrying about breaking any rules. What makes MANTRA stand out is its strong technology foundation. It's built using the Cosmos SDK, which means it's compatible with other blockchains and supports smart contracts through CosmWasm. It can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, so it's ready for large-scale use. Plus, it offers tools to create and manage assets that comply with regulations. In today's market, where many are looking for secure and compliant blockchain solutions, OM, the coin of MANTRA, looks promising. It could be a strong competitor to other coins that don't focus on regulatory compliance, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion While ONDO, AVAX, LINK, and OM are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as a groundbreaking memecoin poised for exceptional growth in the 2024 bull run.

Helium (HNT) Price Prediction, Eyes on 18% Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News HNT, the native token of Helium, a blockchain-based network and leading DePIN token is poised for a notable upside rally as it has formed a bullish price action pattern. Helium (HNT) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, HNT has broken out of a consolidation zone that it formed after breaking out of a falling channel price action pattern. This consolidation breakout has shifted the overall sentiment for HNT toward the bullish side. Source: Trading View Based on historical price momentum, the recent price action which began with a breakout followed by consolidation, is considered one of the more successful patterns. Following this development, there is a strong possibility that HNT could soar by 18% to reach the $8.10 level in the coming days. On the positive side, HNT’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a potential upside rally in the coming days, as its current value stands at 60, below the overbought mark of 70. Bullish on-Chain Metrics However, HNT’s bullish price action appears to have attracted significant trader interest over the past 24 hours, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Rising Open interest Recent data shows that HNT’s open interest (OI) has surged by 31% in the last 24 hours and 9.2% in the past four hours. This growing OI reflects traders’ strong confidence and interest in the top DePIN token amid a bullish price action pattern. HNT Spot Inflow/OUt flow In addition to traders, whales and long-term holders are providing further support for this altcoin, as revealed by the Coinglass data center. According to HNT spot inflow/outflow data from exchanges since the beginning of November 2024, there has been a significant outflow from exchanges. Source: Coinglass The data also shows that, out of the past 30 days, exchanges experienced inflows on only 7 days, with the remaining 23 days marked by continuous outflows. This trend suggests that whales have significantly accumulated HNT tokens over the past month, during which the HNT price has remained stable. Current Price Momentum At press time, HNT is trading near $7.20 and has experienced a price surge of over 10.5% in the past 24 hours.

According to on-chain data, the breakout occurred as derivatives trading volume surged by over 420% to $983.06M, reflecting renewed interest from market participants. Additionally, open interest in THETA derivatives rose by 75.35% to $108.91 million, indicating that more traders are taking positions in the asset. This spike in activity coincided with THETA’s price moving past critical resistance levels at $2.40 and $2.50, confirming the start of a strong uptrend. Analysts Predict Further 348% Upside Concurrently, technical analysts are optimistic about the potential for further gains in THETA’s price. The chart provided by “World of Charts” indicates that the breakout from the descending triangle could lead to a rally targeting $9.00, a projected 348% surge from current levels. The measured move from the triangle’s base supports this bullish outlook. Javon Marks, a market analyst, pointed out that THETA’s ability to break its long-term trendline suggests a reversal of bearish momentum. Marks noted, “The steep upward trajectory and higher highs confirm that the bulls are in control, and the rally could extend to $8.00 in the near term.” He also highlighted that the price has yet to encounter significant resistance, which could enable continued growth in the short term. THETA Price Technical Analysis THETA’s technical indicators further support the bullish outlook. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is significantly above its signal line, confirming strong upward momentum. The widening gap between the MACD and the signal line suggests that the uptrend remains intact. Additionally, the Money Flow Index (MFI) is at 93.69, which places THETA in the overbought zone. While this indicates strong buying pressure, analysts caution that a minor pullback or consolidation could occur before the next leg up. THETA/USD (source: TradingView) Concurrently, the 50-day moving average is also approaching a bullish crossover with the 200-day moving average, signalling the potential for a “golden cross.” This technical pattern is often a precursor to sustained price increases hence backing the potential THETA price breakout.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. It started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, with half sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB's profile. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for NFT platforms and decentralized governance. These features contribute to its potential appeal in the current market cycle. Stellar (XLM): A Decentralized Network for Global Fund Transfers Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized blockchain network enabling quick, low-cost global fund transfers. It supports any currency, including national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Since 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major companies. Unlike cryptocurrencies that aim to replace financial systems, Stellar connects them, offering a unified network for collaboration. Individuals can transfer funds worldwide using Stellar apps. Businesses can develop blockchain applications or use the network for payments and currency conversion. The Stellar Development Foundation promotes network use, including NFT creation and smart contracts. With its focus on enhancing existing systems, Stellar's technology shows potential in the current market cycle. Terra Classic (LUNC): A Blockchain for Stable Global Payments Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain protocol that employs fiat-pegged stablecoins to enable price-stable global payment systems. Launched in April 2019, it merges the price stability of traditional currencies with the censorship resistance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Terra Classic offers fast and affordable settlements using stablecoins pegged to various currencies, including the U.S. dollar and South Korean won. In May 2022, the original Terra chain was rebranded to Terra Classic after launching a new chain named Terra (LUNA). The platform's technology aims to enhance financial accessibility by providing a decentralized system for global payments, leveraging blockchain to facilitate efficient and stable transactions worldwide. PEPE Memecoin: Embracing the Pepe the Frog Phenomenon on Ethereum PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Launched without transaction taxes and embracing a lack of utility, PEPE maintains a pure memecoin identity. In mid-2023, it achieved a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, igniting a memecoin frenzy and building a vibrant community. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. Unique features like a burning mechanism enhance scarcity, while a redistribution system rewards long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake security. Its presence on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin makes it accessible to many. In the current market cycle, PEPE continues to engage crypto enthusiasts. Conclusion Although SHIB, XLM, LUNC, and PEPE may become well-known by 2025, their short-term potential seems limited. In contrast, DOGEN is crafted for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and potential for massive returns, it builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

Initially designed as a three-year initiative, the company could achieve this goal in four months, thanks to its aggressive purchasing pace. This bold move is set to transform MicroStrategy’s financial future, with the company betting big on assets’ long-term value . Michael Saylor’s Strategy: A Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin journey began in August 2020, and the company has consistently made headlines with its purchases. This month alone, the firm spent $12 billion on BTC, including its most recent purchase. On Nov. 11, the company purchased 27,200 BTC for $2 billion, followed by another $4.6 billion worth of BTC on Nov.18 . Five days ago, the firm acquired another 55,500 BTC for $5.4 billion. These purchases are part of a strategy to consolidate its position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy follows a plan to acquire more Bitcoin, reflecting the vision of its executive chairman, Michael Saylor. With its latest acquisition, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 386,700 BTC, valued at nearly $22 billion at the current market price. MicroStrategy is willing to invest its financial resources in the acquisition of BTC. The company funded one of its latest Bitcoin purchases by leveraging its at-the-market share issuance program. To raise the required capital, MicroStrategy sold about 13.6 million shares. MicroStrategy Bet Big on Bitcoin, the Future of Digital Gold MicroStrategy’s approach also underscores its firm belief that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset. The firm believes BTC is a transformative financial instrument with the potential to reshape global finance. By accumulating over 380,000 BTC, the company has positioned Bitcoin as a cornerstone of its treasury reserve strategy . It is treating it as “digital gold,” a store of value that can withstand inflation and economic uncertainty. With Bitcoin trading near $100,000, MicroStrategy’s investment has more than doubled in value, turning its holdings into a formidable financial asset. However, this strategy has significant risks. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, with price swings that can lead to substantial losses as quickly as gains. Despite the risks, MicroStrategy’s bold moves have captivated attention. Crypto enthusiasts see the company as a pioneer and a symbol of Bitcoin’s growing mainstream adoption.

37065229,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655900,1733005852,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Breaks Multi-Year Resistance – Main Target Remains $2,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/xrp-breaks-multi-year-resistance-main-target-remains-2/,"XRP has broken through a key resistance level, reaching price points not seen since its multi-year highs set in 2021. The cryptocurrency has been on an aggressive upward trajectory for over three weeks, signaling strong bullish momentum in the market. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring XRP’s price action, as it shows no signs of slowing down. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a compelling technical analysis, suggesting that XRP is poised to reach the $2 mark in the near future. His analysis highlights XRP’s robust breakout above critical resistance levels, supported by strong trading volume and positive market sentiment. Martinez believes this momentum could propel the token to achieve its next significant milestone much faster than anticipated. As the altcoin market continues to flourish, XRP stands out as one of the top-performing assets , drawing increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether XRP can sustain its bullish pace and surpass further resistance levels. With technical indicators aligning with optimistic projections, XRP appears ready to continue its ascent, cementing its place as a leading cryptocurrency in this market cycle. XRP Testing Past Cycle’s Top XRP has reached an impressive $1.93, testing critical supply levels that marked the top of its last cycle. In 2021, Ripple was entangled in legal challenges with the SEC, creating uncertainty for the cryptocurrency. However, the landscape has shifted significantly since then, with Ripple gaining favorable momentum in the lawsuit and renewed investor confidence, propelling XRP to new heights. Martinez has provided an optimistic outlook, sharing a technical analysis on X that suggests XRP will likely surpass the $2 milestone soon. Martinez identifies this level as a key target as the cryptocurrency’s momentum builds. The price of XRP has surged by over 280% in less than a month, reflecting the strength of its current uptrend. Analysts are closely monitoring whether XRP can break above the psychological $2 mark, a level that would signal a continuation of its rally toward multi-year highs. The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP is further supported by increasing trading volume and strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. As the token approaches multi-year highs, the focus shifts to whether it can sustain this rally and break through the crucial resistance zone. For now, XRP continues to show remarkable resilience and upward potential, positioning itself as a standout performer in the crypto market. Technical Details XRP is trading at $1.93, following a remarkable 16% surge yesterday and an additional 7% rise today. The cryptocurrency continues its aggressive push toward the critical $2 level, capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. This sustained rally reflects growing confidence in XRP’s potential as it tests supply zones that once marked last cycle’s peak. Despite the bullish momentum, there’s a strong possibility that XRP may consolidate below the $2 mark for a few days. Such a pause could set the stage for a more explosive move as the broader crypto market gears up for a potential breakout. Historically, consolidations at key resistance levels often precede significant price rallies, and the current setup aligns with this pattern. XRP’s aggressive break above the $1.62 level was a pivotal moment, reinforcing bullish sentiment across the market. Many investors now expect XRP to challenge and surpass its previous cycle’s all-time high (ATH), setting the stage for a new price discovery phase. With momentum on its side and increasing interest from both retail and institutional players, XRP’s path forward could redefine its position in the market, marking a significant milestone in its price journey.

It is designed to be fast, low-cost, open, and borderless. Operating on a decentralized system without a central authority, XRP makes transactions irreversible and secure. It does not require a bank account for settlements, allowing for seamless transfers across different currencies. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled supply release. The name XRP, derived from ""ripple credits,"" reflects its aim to facilitate smooth payment transfers worldwide. Exploring ADA: Cardano's Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts. It helps developers make decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. ADA is its native cryptocurrency. Like Ethereum's ETH, ADA lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. This is different from energy-heavy proof-of-work models. The blockchain has two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This setup can boost transaction processing up to 1,000,000 transactions per second. Cardano's native tokens allow secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. Conclusion While XRP and ADA have been influential in the crypto arena, their short-term growth potential appears limited. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a technologically advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities. By utilizing AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO maximizes earnings. Its features include attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. Users enjoy a superior experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO stands out as a promising project.

In his latest comments, Anthony Pompliano explained the math behind the strategy and the potential risks associated with it. Pompliano acknowledged that the strategy could be lucrative but warned that there are risks investors must consider before fully embracing it. Anthony Pompliano Discusses the Risks Behind MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy In a recent interview , Anthony Pompliano analyzed MicroStrategy’s approach of using convertible debt to purchase Bitcoin. The company has been selling future equity at a 55% premium to fund Bitcoin acquisitions, an attractive proposition from a financial standpoint. By selling shares at higher prices than its current stock value, MicroStrategy is able to generate significant capital to buy Bitcoin. Anthony Pompliano emphasized that this method makes sense mathematically but warned investors about the risks that are often overlooked. He pointed out there are many unknowns that could impact the outcome of the Bitcoin Strategy. The key concern raised by Pompliano is that many investors blindly believe that nothing can go wrong with this strategy. He warned against this, stating, “Now, the counterweight to that is there’s a hell of a lot of people I see saying nothing can go wrong. I’m not in that camp. I couldn’t sit here and tell you what can go wrong, but what I can tell you is that an alarm goes off in my head when I start seeing everyone saying nothing can go wrong.” Despite these speculations, recently, the Bitcoin advocate revealed that Donald Trump holds Bitcoin and is a strong supporter of the cryptocurrency. According to Anthony Pompliano, Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance could reshape U.S. economic policies and lead to the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. Extreme Risks Associated With The Bitcoin Strategy One of the extreme risks Anthony Pompliano highlighted is the possibility of Bitcoin being banned in the United States. While he noted that this is unlikely to happen, he mentioned that such an event would damage MicroStrategy’s stock price. In a recent report, IntoTheBlock highlighted four major risks that MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy poses to the crypto market. Despite these being low-probability risks, Pompliano stressed that it’s essential for investors to consider the most extreme scenarios. Additionally, Pompliano suggested that the risks associated with this strategy are amplified by the crypto market volatility. While it is difficult to predict all risks, BTC volatility and the regulatory uncertainty must be taken into account. Amid the discussion, the Capital Management founder and CEO recently proposed that the United States should consider creating a Bitcoin reserve. He called for the U.S. government to allocate $250 billion to purchase Bitcoin as an hedge against dollar devaluation.

CYBRO is set to challenge the dominance of established platforms like Polkadot and Polygon. With such impressive early support, could CYBRO redefine the future of blockchain technology? The crypto community is watching closely to see if this newcomer will deliver on its promise. CYBRO Presale Climbs Past $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million DeFi Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This cutting-edge multichain DeFi platform offers investors unparalleled opportunities to maximize their earnings across various blockchains in any market condition.

It enables secure communication between different blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. This means value and data can be shared across chains. Polkadot uses parachains to boost speed and scalability, handling more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within the network. Holders can participate in developing the protocol and verifying transactions. Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, developed Polkadot. The Web3 Foundation maintains it. Polkadot aims to create more connected and efficient blockchains, improving how they work together. Exploring Polygon's Utility Token: Staking, Governance, and Exclusive Access The Polygon Ecosystem Token is a digital asset used within the Polygon network. It plays a key role in various operations across the ecosystem. Holders can use it for staking, locking up their tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards based on the amount staked. The token also allows holders to participate in governance, voting on proposals that shape the network's development. Additionally, it provides access to exclusive services and features within the ecosystem. As the network grows and adds more applications, the token's demand may increase due to its multiple uses within the ecosystem. Conclusion In the current bullish market of 2024, projects like CYBRO are capturing attention for their advanced features and strong potential. While coins like DOT and POL may offer less short-term growth, CYBRO distinguishes itself as a cutting-edge DeFi platform. By leveraging AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, it provides investors with unparalleled opportunities to maximize earnings. Its user-friendly experience includes seamless deposits and withdrawals, lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. With a strong emphasis on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO is attracting significant interest from crypto whales and influencers.

Heavyweights like $FIL (+19.67%) and $WLD (+26.08%) are dominating the spotlight, but the AI crypto sector, once dormant, has now awakened with a vengeance. Yesterday, we delved into Fetch.ai ($FET – link here ), showcasing its potential to redefine the AI blockchain sector. Today, the spotlight shifts to Render Network ( $RNDR )—the "" Nvidia of blockchain computing."" With Ethereum ($ETH ) approaching 0.040 BTC , signaling a potential altseason breakout, Render is gearing up to test its $10 psychological barrier, a critical level for reclaiming its March 2024 highs. Let’s dissect the setup for this fascinating AI infrastructure project and its roadmap toward a potential breakout. Render Network’s Core Value Proposition Render Network decentralizes GPU rendering by connecting creators and GPU node operators, leveraging blockchain technology to monetize idle computing power. It’s tailor-made for the growing AI-driven content creation sector. Key Metrics: Circulating Supply: 517.69M Market Cap: $4.69B Max Supply: 644.17M Render boasts strong tokenomics with minimal inflation risks. Coupled with its real-world utility in GPU rendering and AI applications, $RNDR is uniquely positioned to ride the next wave of AI and crypto adoption. Technical Breakdown: Where Are We Now? 1W Chart: The Battle for $10 The weekly chart shows a methodical recovery from its August 2024 lows at $3.40, a spring point in a textbook Wyckoff Accumulation schematic. Key Support Levels: The $6.90-$7.15 zone aligns with the 50W MA ($6.95) and previous resistance turned support, forming a strong base for accumulation. Critical Resistance Zones: $8.30-$9.90: Render is currently battling within this range, a pivotal zone left by March’s explosive “God Candle.” $10: The psychological threshold where confidence will either surge or falter. $13.85: The all-time high, a likely target for bulls once $10 is conquered. RSI: Slightly above 60, indicating momentum without overextension. Volume & Momentum: Weekly volumes are picking up post-U.S. election but remain below November 2023 levels, leaving room for explosive moves. As the 50W MA rises, dynamic support strengthens, increasing the probability of long-term upside. 1D Chart: The Anatomy of a Breakout Render’s daily chart highlights precise technical developments: Golden Cross Incoming: The 50D MA ($6.06) is set to cross above the 200D MA ($6.63), signaling the return of a long-term bullish trend. Dynamic Supports: The $6.90-$7.15 zone continues to align with horizontal support, bolstered by diminishing pullback volumes and volume spikes on breakouts. Battle for $10: Price is testing this psychological level, with RSI confirming strength. A breakout above $10 could trigger Price Discovery Mode. Explosive Rhetoric Alert: A clean break above $10 may lead to quick leg-ups toward $12 and $13.85, but volatility remains a factor—so patience is key. Render vs. Bitcoin (RNDR/BTC): Relative Strength Render’s BTC pairing highlights its relative outperformance: Support Flip: Render flipped 322 SATs (50W MA) into support, with minimal resistance toward 380 SATs. Volume Profile: Minimal resistance above current levels signals potential for accelerated price movement relative to Bitcoin. 3 Key Takeaways from Both Charts Consolidation Zones Building Momentum: Both charts highlight Render consolidating within major resistance zones ($8.30-$9.90), setting the stage for an explosive move. Golden Cross & Wyckoff Spring: The upcoming Golden Cross and Wyckoff Accumulation spring ($3.40 lows) are powerful confluences, signaling a strong bullish setup. Dynamic Supports Rising: Fast-rising moving averages bolster $6.90-$7.15 as a high-probability entry point for disciplined traders. 3 Entry Strategies for $RNDR 1. Closing Above $10 Rating: 8/10 – ""Parabolic Potential."" Rationale: A confirmed close above $10 signals strength and Price Discovery Mode, targeting $12 and $13.85. Stop Loss: $9.50 – Manage volatility. Advice: Wait for volume confirmation. Without it, false breakouts can be devastating. Take Profit Levels: $12.00-$12.50 – Immediate resistance zone. $13.85 – March ATH. $15-$16 – Short-term overshoot. 2. $6.90-$7.15 Zone (Dynamic + Horizontal Support) Rating: 9/10 – ""Solid Foundation."" Rationale: A confluence of horizontal support and the fast-rising 50W MA ($6.95). Stop Loss: $5.80 – Wide enough to avoid noise. Advice: Use laddered entries and monitor price action. Institutions are likely accumulating here. Take Profit Levels: $10-$11.95 – Psychological & technical resistance. $13.85 – March ATH. $20+ – If the trend accelerates. 3. $5.90-$5.00 (Stink Order Zone) Rating: 7/10 – ""Patience Pays Dividends."" Rationale: Flash crash levels aligned with historical pivot points and rising dynamic support. Stop Loss: $4.50 or monitor live. Advice: These levels are rare opportunities but require patience. Take Profit Levels: $8-$9.90 – Quick recovery zone. $11.95-$12 – Pre-ATH levels. $13.85+ – Aiming for the moon. Optimistic 2025 Targets Triple Market Cap Target: $27-$30 – A realistic target if Render triples its market cap. Parabolic Blow-Off Top: $50-$60 – The speculative climax of a 2025 bull run, driven by AI hype. Summary: The Battle for $10 Render’s battle for $10 is more than psychological—it’s the gateway to reclaiming its ATH and entering Price Discovery Mode. A clean break, supported by volume, could trigger the next leg up in its bullish cycle. Key Takeaways: Accumulate Smart: Focus on strong support zones like $6.90-$7.15. Don’t Chase Pumps: Wait for confirmations. Execute Strategically: Stick to your plan—volatile markets reward discipline. As November’s ""Moonvember"" comes to a close, here’s to another spectacular month ahead. Stay disciplined, and get ready for the next AI coin spotlight: Opulous ( $OPUL )—a project with even bigger potential than Render.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 23:07:03

The class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Friday evening and names OpenAI, its CEO Sam Altman, President Greg Brockman, Microsoft, and several others associated with the companies. Tesla CEO’s lawyers say that OpenAI has changed its focus from a non-profit organization and is using tactics that are damaging to the competition in the AI sector. Elon Musk Files Lawsuit Against OpenAI and Microsoft According to Elon Musk’s lawyers, OpenAI and Microsoft are engaging in market manipulation to deter investments into competing AI ventures, including Musk’s xAI. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI coerced investors into not supporting rivals such as xAI that has recently secured funding. Musk’s attorneys refer to the fact that OpenAI compelled investors in its last funding round not to invest in competing AI ventures, which presents a challenge to organizations like xAI. Additionally, the injunction aims at stopping OpenAI and Microsoft from taking other actions that may be detrimental to the market such as sharing of property information and invention. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI has changed the governance of the platform to that of a for-profit business model which is the opposite of what was promised initially. Musk’s legal team claims that this shift violates the initial mission of OpenAI to contribute its AI technologies to the public for the common good. Microsoft’s Role and Financial Interests Another key factor of Musk’s case is the vast financial support that Microsoft has provided to OpenAI. Since 2019, Microsoft has pumped in more than $13 billion into OpenAI and in the process has booked itself a large share of the company’s revenue. The complaint states that Microsoft has been using this partnership to acquire information and assets from OpenAI, including the AI models, hosted on Microsoft’s cloud services. The filing also reveals possible concerns over conflicts of interest. For example, it discusses how Sam Altman, the chairman of OpenAI, has a financial interest in Stripe, the company that OpenAI used for payments. Musk’s team claims that Altman’s relationship with Stripe will create a conflict that can influence OpenAI in a wrong way and hinder competition within the market. These allegations suggest a wider scheme of self-enrichment that Musk’s lawyers state is damaging the AI environment. xAI’s Growth and Investor Backlash Although xAI has struggled with fundraising, the company has recently announced that it has closed a $5 billion funding round, with investment from firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Fidelity. Despite Musk’s allegations that OpenAI’s actions have made some investors refrain from investing in xAI, the recent funding received by the company indicates that it has not faced challenges in raising capital. The lawsuit also mention that Musk’s xAI, which was founded last year, has created its own generative AI named Grok. This model supports several features on Musk’s social network X (previously Twitter). Although xAI is already a financially backed company in the AI field, Musk’s team claims that the current OpenAI’s practices may be detrimental to the company’s future. Despite these claims, Sam Altman’s OpenAI recently announced a $1.5 billion investment facilitated through a tender offer. The move allowed employees to sell shares to SoftBank, which now holds a significant stake in the company. This transaction adds another layer of complexity to Musk’s claims, as his legal team contends that OpenAI is further distancing itself from its original nonprofit mission in favor of financial gain.

But with so many coins out there, it’s easy to wonder: which ones are worth it? Two cryptos are making waves for their unique functionalities and solid potential among the sea of digital assets. Toncoin has emerged as a leader in blockchain-based communications, offering seamless integrations for messaging platforms. Stellar, meanwhile, continues to innovate in cross-border transactions, providing fast and affordable financial solutions. But let’s talk about Qubetics ($TICS)—the rising star that’s redefining the Web3 space. With an ecosystem that boasts groundbreaking tech like a decentralised VPN (dVPN) and an electrifying presale that’s got analysts predicting jaw-dropping returns, this one’s making serious excitement. This article will dive into Qubetics, Toncoin, and Stellar to help you discover your next top crypto to invest in. Qubetics: The Future of Web3 Privacy and Security Qubetics is setting a new standard in Web3 infrastructure with its revolutionary decentralised VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralised systems that can log user data, censor access, or even suffer from single points of failure, Qubetics flips the script. Its dVPN runs on a peer-to-peer, blockchain-powered network where no central authority has control. What does that mean for you? Total freedom and privacy online. Your data is encrypted end-to-end, ensuring anonymity while bypassing censorship. Multi-hop routing shields your internet traffic through multiple nodes, making it nearly impossible for anyone to trace. Even better, Qubetics incentivises users to share the bandwidth by rewarding them with $TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining marketplace where security meets economic opportunity. In short, it’s not just a VPN; it’s a game-changer for online privacy. Toncoin: Redefining Blockchain-Based Communications Toncoin, the brainchild of the Telegram Open Network, is making strides in integrating blockchain and communication technologies. Built to complement messaging platforms, it enables seamless payments, smart contracts, and decentralised applications within the ecosystem. Its focus on scalability and ease of use has positioned it as a leader in the evolving crypto landscape. For those interested in projects that combine practicality with innovation, Toncoin is worth keeping an eye on. Stellar: The Powerhouse of Cross-Border Transactions Stellar continues to prove its value in the world of decentralised finance, specifically for cross-border payments. By offering a blockchain-based solution that’s fast, affordable, and inclusive, Stellar has created a platform that connects financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. Whether you’re sending remittances or managing business transactions, Stellar’s network ensures low fees and reliable speeds. It’s a solid contender for anyone seeking the top cryptos. Early Bird Wins! Qubetics Presale Offers Massive Growth Potential If you’ve ever dreamed of catching the next big crypto before it takes off, here’s your chance. Right now, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.025 during the presale. Imagine this: $1,000 today gets you a whopping 40,000 $TICS tokens. Now, let’s talk numbers—because they’re wild. Analysts are predicting that $TICS could skyrocket to $10 in the near future. That means your $1,000 investment could balloon to $400,000—an astonishing ROI of 39,900%. And if it climbs even higher to $15? You’re looking at $600,000, with an ROI of 59,900%. These aren’t just numbers; they’re life-changing possibilities. But here’s the kicker—presales like this don’t last forever. The early bird gets the worm, and in this case, the worm might just be a golden ticket to your financial freedom. If you’re hunting for the top crypto to invest in , Qubetics should be on your radar. Conclusion: Which Crypto Will Shape Your Future? The right investment today could transform your tomorrow. Toncoin is innovating communication, Stellar is revolutionising cross-border finance, and Qubetics is pioneering Web3 privacy and security. Each has its strengths and potential to deliver significant returns. But if you’re looking for excitement, unparalleled potential, and a chance to be part of something transformative, Qubetics stands out.

33767162,[object Object],1733009446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP Surges To $1.84 – What Next To Expect?,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-surges-to-1-84-what-next-to-expect/,"Following a week-long period of sideways movement, XRP has resumed its bullish trajectory gaining by 19.81% on Friday to reach a local peak of $1.84. During this price rally, market shares of the prominent altcoin rose to $104.96 billion, as it became the fifth-largest cryptocurrency brushing past Binance Coin (BNB). Related Reading: Ripple CEO Reacts To Trump’s Billionaire Treasury Secretary Nominee XRP Set To Reach $5, But Major Correction Awaits – Analyst Amidst the high bullish sentiments in the XRP community, renowned analyst EGRAG Crypto has painted a potential price trajectory for the altcoin. According to EGRAG Crypto, if XRP’s current price gain is to mirror a previous pattern from 2017 where it experienced a major increase of over 1273%, the crypto asset is likely to trade as high as $5.2 – $5.3. This prediction rallies with previous forecasts by analysts where the altcoin is tipped to reproduce its first major price explosion recorded in early 2017, following a 200% price surge in the last month. However, EGRAG’s version of this bullish prediction warns that XRP is likely to experience a 63% price decline following an ascent to above $5. Albeit, the analyst highlights that this potential price fall to around $1.94-$1.96, a price range that is higher than the coin’s all-time high recorded in 2021 suggesting much possibility of a massive price rally in the coming bull run. Nevertheless, EGRAG also warns that while XRP’s current price action is similar to 2017-2018, the timeline of the anticipated price surge will likely change. The analyst explains in a “SPACETIME thesis” that the digital coin may experience a similar level of percentage price gain but not within the same time frame as previously seen. XRP Price Overview At the time of writing, XRP trades at $1.84 reflecting a 19.81% gain as earlier stated. The token’s daily trading volume is also up by 143.48% indicating a high level of market interest. In regards to short-term price movements, XRP has recently surpassed a major resistance zone at $1.76 setting the stage for a potential rally to the token’s current all-time high of $3.84. This price trajectory seems quite plausible considering the consistently heightened bullish sentiments around the fifth-largest crypto asset following recent developments. For example, former chairman of the US Commodities Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) Chris Giancarlo has recently suggested the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to drop its lawsuit against Ripple in line with the pro-crypto policy of US President-elect Donald Trump. Developments such as this in addition to a potential spot ETF are likely to boost the demand for XRP as the crypto bull run prepares to take off.",XRP|Egrag Crypto|ripple|SEC|XRP price prediction|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-11-30 23:30:46

However, a joint report by Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets research suggests significant growth potential, with experts projecting expansion to 10% of the US money supply (M2) and foreign exchange (FX) transactions. Regulation Could Unlock Stablecoins’ Full Potential According to the report titled ‘Stablecoins: The First Killer App,’ the utility of stablecoins has evolved well beyond their original role in cryptocurrency trading. Initially used as a bridge asset for trading, stablecoins are increasingly employed in cross-border payments, payroll, trade settlements, and remittances. These applications demonstrate their ability to address inefficiencies in existing financial systems, such as high costs, delayed transaction times, and limited accessibility in underserved regions. By providing faster and cheaper transactions, stablecoins offer a compelling solution for international remittances and business operations, positioning themselves as a pivotal tool in modern finance. The analysis also highlighted the implications of stablecoin adoption for the broader financial ecosystem. At present, stablecoins’ total market capitalization is dwarfed by the $21 trillion US M2 and $2.1 trillion in daily FX spot transactions. However, achieving a 10% share could transform them into a dominant force in global finance, thereby reshaping the landscape of digital payments and settlements. Regulation is seen as the key to this transition. While previous US administrations have made little progress in establishing stablecoin-specific policies, the report suggests that a Trump-led government in 2025 might prioritize these efforts. In fact, this regulatory clarity is expected to unlock stablecoins’ full potential, enabling them to scale and diversify their use cases further. Stablecoin Adoption Soars in Emerging Markets Geographically, USD-backed stablecoins dominate the market, comprising 99.3% of current stablecoin market capitalization. Tether (USDT) leads with a 73% market share, followed by Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) at 21%. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered’s Thursday report cited a YouGov survey that found compelling use cases. Across five emerging markets – Brazil, Turkey, Nigeria, India, and Indonesia – it was observed that 69% of respondents use stablecoins for currency substitution, while 39% employ them for cross-border payments and goods and services transactions.

American author Robert Kiyosaki made a controversial stand after commenting that the psychological phenomenon of the fear of missing out (FOMO) can be a positive driving force that will push investors to buy the top crypto before it reaches the $100,000 level. Bitcoin: The Challenge To Invest Kiyosaki warned that once Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 level, it would be challenging for the middle class to invest significant amounts in the firstborn crypto, urging them to invest now that the digital currency is still below the said level. “Once Bitcoin passes $100,000 it will be almost impossible for the poor and middle class to catch up,” Kiyosaki said. The American author explained that once Bitcoin becomes more accessible only to the ultra-wealthy, holders of traditional fiat currencies such as the dollar, euro, and yen will lose out. Kiyosaki, who is an advocate of alternatives to fiat currencies such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin, argued that if BTC breaks the $100,000 level, “only the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence.” THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WiLL BE RICHER?A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WhO WILL BE POORER?A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad“Savers are losers…because… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 29, 2024 Embracing FOMO Ever since Kiyosaki has been promoting investment in Bitcoin, he believed that the crypto offers an opportunity to better protect wealth than the traditional currencies. Now that BTC is nearing a new all-time high, Kiyosaki urged people like those in the middle class to invest in Bitcoin, saying that if they are hesitant, they can embrace the FOMO mentality. “FOMO is good. Don’t be left behind!” he added. He explained that the fear of missing out on the Bitcoin opportunity could pull people to invest in the crypto so they could benefit when the coin reaches new heights. Fiat Savings Not Good The author dispelled people from saving, saying that ‘savers are losers” because, in his opinion, “cash is trash.” Kiyosaki explained that holding Bitcoin is better than saving in cash because traditional fiat currencies have to contend with inflation which reduces its value over time. In an X post, he urged people to diversify their assets and invest in alternatives such as Bitcoin, claiming that government monetary policies and inflation will continue to “erode the purchasing power of traditional currencies.” He pointed out that today is the right time to invest in BTC because once the coin breaches the $100,000 milestone, it will be nearly impossible for most people to get hold of it. As of press time, BTC is being traded at $96,722 per coin, with a total market capitalization of $1.9 trillion.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Charles took to X (formerly Twitter) to sound the alarm on the aftermath of Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which he claims has devastated businesses, hurt economies, and crushed innovation worldwide. “So many people put their head in the sand for political reasons, saying it’s not as bad as the industry made it out to be,” Charles wrote. “It is worse and global. So many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed.” He warned that the fallout from this crackdown will take years to heal and urged the crypto community to unite, adding, “We have a small window of time to get a law passed.” Charles’s comments were prompted by Binance chairman Gabriel Abed, who revealed his own experience of being debanked outside the United States. Abed recounted how First Citizens Caribbean Bank shut down his accounts—accounts he’d held for over a decade—because he received a bitcoin-related deposit. The bank’s CEO explained that working with crypto companies posed too high a risk to their American correspondent banking relationships. Abed’s experience, he said, is not unique. International banks were severing ties with crypto clients to comply with “standards” set by their U.S. counterparts. “This isn’t just an American issue,” Abed said. “It’s global.” Crypto industry blames Biden administration for financial suppression The crypto community believes it knows who’s behind this assault: the Biden administration. Industry leaders accuse the government of reviving the controversial Obama-era Operation Chokepoint under a new guise. The original program, launched in 2013, pressured banks to cut ties with industries considered “high risk,” such as payday lenders and firearms dealers. Critics argued that legitimate businesses were being unfairly targeted. Operation Chokepoint officially ended in 2017, but crypto insiders say it made a comeback in 2021, this time with blockchain firms in its crosshairs. Elon Musk reignited the discussion with a single question: “Did you know that 30 tech founders were secretly debanked?” Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, jumped in immediately. “Yes,” he responded. “I was debanked because I’m in crypto, as was Gemini. The number is probably much larger than 30. That’s just in the a16z portfolio alone.” Tyler accused the Biden administration of “assassinating” banks that dared to serve the crypto industry. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, backed Tyler with his own allegations. “Can confirm this is true,” Brian said, calling the debanking of crypto companies one of the most unethical moves in American history. He pointed fingers at Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler, claiming they orchestrated a deliberate attempt to “kill” the industry. “My guess? We’ll find Warren’s fingerprints all over it. Biden himself was probably unaware,” Brian speculated. He revealed that Coinbase is using Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover who exactly was involved. https://twitter.com/brian_Brian/status/1861890800268775923 “This was a major factor in the Democrats losing the election,” Brian continued. “The party should realize Warren is a liability and distance themselves if they want any hope of rebuilding.” Marc Andreessen, the highly-respected venture capitalist, appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast to call out what he sees as blatant financial censorship. “This is about control, not compliance,” Marc said, describing how at least 30 tech founders, himself included, were targeted and debanked for political reasons. He pointed to the broader implications: “This goes beyond crypto. This is about freedom.” The global fallout of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Andrew Torba, founder of Gab, shared his story of relentless account closures. “Without a bank account, you can’t store cash, run payroll, or pay bills,” he said. “That’s the point—choke businesses until they die.” Andrew said he opened accounts with major banks, credit unions, and even Christian financial institutions, only to be repeatedly shut out. “The reason was always the same: ‘Our terms say we can do this anytime, for any reason, or no reason at all.’” According to him, banks have admitted off the record that they were being pressured by the government with threats of audits and regulatory scrutiny. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, has also been vocal about her experience. Long confirmed that her company has been debanked multiple times and is now suing the Federal Reserve. Her case is scheduled for oral arguments on January 21, just one day after Inauguration Day. John Deaton, a well-known crypto lawyer and former US Senate candidate, called Caitlin’s lawsuit “arguably the most important fight against unelected bureaucrats and the deep state protecting the banking system’s status quo.” Payment processing veteran Brian Roemmele shares these concerns. He described how Operation Chokepoint 2.0 has destroyed trust in the financial system. Roemmele has worked in merchant processing since the 1980s and said the Biden-era version of the program is even more destructive than the original. “This time, it’s vengeful,” Roemmele said, adding that thousands of businesses have been wiped out overnight. He claimed the crackdown has made doing business ten times more expensive and accused the government of using banks as tools of state corruption. Gabriel Abed’s story offers a glimpse into how this suppression plays out on the ground. After receiving a bitcoin-related deposit flagged as high risk, his decade-old accounts were shut down. He called the debanking crisis a “clear example of how far-reaching the consequences of U.S. banking policies are,” adding that local banks are often caught in the crossfire. “Barbadian banks face immense pressure to comply with U.S. standards or risk losing their correspondent relationships.” Charles, for his part, is urging the crypto industry to unite. He believes the community has a small window of time to push for legislative reforms to ensure such a campaign is never repeated. “We have to come together to prevent this horror from ever happening again,” he said.

However, the L2 network stated it would focus on dApp building and developer empowerment moving forward. It even asked for input on how best to improve its services. Base’s focus is on dApp development and encouraging developers Jesse Pollak, founder of Base and Head of Protocols at Coinbase, revealed in a post on X that they had no intention of launching a native token; instead, the platform will prioritize dApp building. He said : And finally, there are no plans for a Base network token. We are focused on building, and we want to solve real problems that let you build better. I want your feedback on what we can be doing better. ~ Jesse Pollak In another post, Pollak tagged the platform’s “greatest strengths” as its open source, open standards, and open markets, which, according to him, breed faster innovation and more fun. He gave the example of Clanker on the platform. He’s even encouraged developers to build on the platform, saying, “Build, and we will be rewarded.” Base’s VIRTUAL is in surprisingly high demand, with its market cap growing by over 60% Although the L2 network does not intend to release a native token on its network anytime soon, some of the products on its blockchain are doing exceedingly well, including the VIRTUAL Token and aixbt. According to Coingecko , by November 29, Virtual Protocols Ecosystem on Base’s platform’s market cap had soared by over 50.4%, reaching $1.78 billion. Currently, it is close to surpassing $2.4 billion, rising by 61%. The token VIRTUAL‘s 24-hour trading volume is at $498,352,940. It is currently trading at $1,79, a 35% rise in the last 24 hours and up by 206% in the last seven days. Aixbt’s price has also risen by over 323% in the last week, trading at $0.201. Pollak even commented on Aixbt’s rise, saying the AI agent ranks first in on-chain mindshare. Analysts have attributed the growing interest in the Virtual Products Ecosystem to the escalated demand for AI agents and AI-based programs, which are efficient and fast at completing tasks. Greg Isenberg, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, projects even more revenue growth for AI agents like Aixbt. He believes the market for AI agents could easily grow to a trillion-dollar market, saying the world will soon replace human workflows with AI agents.

Crypto analysts like Dark Defender have provided insights into what could come next for XRP. XRP Price Could Rally To $5 Next In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender suggested that the XRP price could rally as high as $5 on its next leg to the upside. This came as he noted that the first target of $1.8 for XRP in this bull run has happened, which led to the crypto hitting the $100 billion market cap mark. With the first target out of the way, XRP could reach $5.8, which Dark Defender’s accompanying chart highlights as one of the median targets. Interestingly, the chart also highlights $18 as a median target, indicating that the crypto could reach this level at some point. Dark Defender also recently used his Elliot Wave theory analysis to show how XRP could hit $18 in this market cycle. The chart showed this parabolic rally would occur on the Wave 5 impulsive move to the upside. Meanwhile, in another X post , the crypto analyst warned about how critical the Fibonacci level at $1.8815 is in the short term. He noted that the XRP price touched $1.9508 and then bounced back to this Fib level. In line with this, he stated that the crypto must stay above $1.8815 for at least three candles. According to Dark Defender, the first step is to stay 12 hours above this level, followed by a 3-day close above this level. A sustained close above this Fib level could confirm that as a significant support level and propel XRP to new highs. Amid the recent XRP rally, it is worth mentioning that the crypto has flipped BNB to become the fifth-largest crypto by market cap. Dark Defender believes XRP could flip Solana next to become the fourth-largest crypto by market cap. The analyst had before now also boldly predicted that the crypto would flip Ethereum at some point. Double Digits Price Target On The Horizon Crypto analysts like Egrag Crypto and Mikybull Crypto have also suggested that a double-digit price target for the XRP price is on the horizon. In his analysis, Egrag Crypto stated that FOMO will ignite if XRP closes above the $2 level. He added that if history repeats itself, XRP will likely trade in double digits between $20 and $27. From the accompanying chart, the analyst looks to be referring to the 2017 bull run, in which XRP recorded massive gains on its way to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.8. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also stated in an X post that the XRP price is giving off 2017 rally vibes. Based on this, the analyst predicts that XRP will hit $2 and then experience a pullback before it continues its “vertical hated rallies” to a new cycle top of probably $10. In another X post, he told market participants to watch what will follow after XRP breaks a new ATH. The crypto analyst added that the 2017 kind of massive rallies are about to be unveiled before everyone’s eyes. With XRP flying high at the moment, a recent CoinGape market analysis also raised the possibility of the crypto’s ATH being imminent .

This key level, acting as a significant hurdle, is widely seen as the launchpad for a potential parabolic rally. If DOGE manages to break above this barrier, it could enter uncharted territory and achieve new all-time highs. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a detailed technical and macro analysis on X, highlighting Dogecoin’s strong potential for continuing its bullish momentum. According to Martinez, DOGE is positioned for a parabolic rally, driven by growing interest and increasing adoption in the market. His analysis underlines the importance of the $0.43 resistance level, suggesting that a decisive breakout could trigger substantial upward price action. The meme coin, known for its vibrant community and unpredictable price moves, has gained traction as broader market sentiment turns bullish. With consolidating price action and strengthening technical indicators, Dogecoin appears ready to embark on its next major leg up . The coming days will be critical for determining whether DOGE can overcome this resistance and fulfill the expectations of a parabolic rally. Dogecoin About To Enter Bullish Phase Again Dogecoin’s history of explosive rallies has made it one of the most closely watched cryptocurrencies. The last time DOGE began a significant rally, it surged over 215%, delivering substantial gains and fueling widespread speculation about its price potential. Now, as the meme coin consolidates, investors and analysts are eyeing the next big move. Martinez has provided valuable insights into DOGE’s current price action . He notes that Dogecoin is firmly in a consolidation phase, testing investors’ patience during this parabolic run. Drawing comparisons to similar market conditions in 2017 and 2020, Martinez highlights a critical pattern: the appearance of a TD Sequential sell signal, often signaling a brief correction before the rally resumes. This historical perspective suggests that DOGE’s temporary pause may set the stage for an even more aggressive surge. As the broader market continues to rise, expectations for Dogecoin remain high. Many investors are optimistic that DOGE will soon replicate its past performance and embark on a massive upward trajectory. Martinez predicts that such a surge will likely align with Bitcoin breaking its all-time highs and crossing the $100,000 threshold, a milestone anticipated as early as next week. If Bitcoin delivers, Dogecoin could follow suit with a breakout to new highs. DOGE Testing Supply Level Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.426, just below the critical resistance level at $0.43. This resistance has so far prevented a bullish continuation, making it a pivotal point for DOGE’s next price action. If the price manages to break above $0.43 and sustain this level for a few days, it could pave the way for a strong breakout and further upside momentum. Investors and traders are closely monitoring this area as a decisive move could trigger a significant rally. However, the $0.43 mark also represents a potential barrier. A failed breakout at this level would likely lead to a correction, pulling the price back to retest lower support zones. In such a scenario, DOGE could drop to around $0.35, depending on broader market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price action. The next few days are crucial as Dogecoin approaches this resistance with heightened market anticipation. Bulls aim for a breakout to sustain the parabolic run, while bears may seize the opportunity to push prices lower if momentum falters. For now, the $0.43 level remains the key to determining DOGE’s immediate direction and whether it will embark on a bullish continuation or face a pullback.

In a market full of innovation, three projects stand out for their potential to shape the future. While each brings something unique, one newcomer is stealing the spotlight. Ethereum has long been a pioneer in decentralised applications, while Kaspa focuses on speed and scalability. But then there’s Qubetics ($TICS)—a revolutionary blockchain platform redefining interoperability. The presale creates waves, offering massive ROI potential and a chance to get in early. This article will explore Qubetics, Ethereum, and Kaspa and explain why they are the best cryptos to buy now. Let’s start with the rising star: Qubetics. The Web3 Aggregator That’s Redefining Crypto: Qubetics Is Here The current blockchain ecosystem is like a bustling city with no bridges. Each network operates in isolation, limiting the potential for seamless transactions and data sharing. This siloed approach creates headaches for developers and hinders mass adoption of blockchain technology. Enter Qubetics, a Web3-aggregated chain that’s tearing down these barriers. Qubetics unifies multiple networks into a single, interconnected framework. This groundbreaking approach enables smooth asset transfers, efficient data sharing, and true cross-chain functionality. For developers, enterprises, and users, Qubetics means fewer limitations and more opportunities. Imagine an app that easily communicates with other networks or seamless asset swaps without complex workarounds. Qubetics is setting the stage for decentralised technologies to work together like never before, unlocking blockchain’s full potential. Ethereum: The OG Smart Contract Platform Ethereum needs no introduction. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, it paved the way for decentralised applications (dApps). Its ecosystem is home to thousands of projects, from DeFi to NFTs, making it a cornerstone of the crypto world. Despite its success, Ethereum faces challenges like high fees and slower transaction speeds, which newer competitors are eager to address. However, with Ethereum 2.0 upgrades rolling out, including proof-of-stake consensus, the network is evolving to stay competitive. For those looking for a solid long-term bet, Ethereum remains one of the best cryptos. Kaspa: Speed Meets Scalability Kaspa is all about speed. Designed as a proof-of-work blockchain, Kaspa delivers ultra-fast transaction confirmations without sacrificing decentralisation. Its innovative design ensures scalability, making it a great option for real-time applications and high-demand networks. Kaspa’s focus on speed and simplicity sets it apart in a complex market. While it’s still growing, its unique architecture and developer-friendly ecosystem make it a standout for those seeking efficiency. For many, it’s emerging as one of the best cryptos. Why $TICS is the Best Crypto to Buy Now? Qubetics’ presale is where the excitement hits a fever pitch. Currently, in Phase 10, this presale is structured to reward early adopters. Every week, token prices climb by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike at the final stage. Right now, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.025, and the numbers are jaw-dropping: $3.8 million raised 5000+ holders 239 million tokens sold If you’re looking to maximise returns, this phase is your golden ticket. Analysts predict a post-presale value of $0.25 per token, translating to a staggering 900% ROI for those who get in now. But that’s just the start. Let’s talk numbers. A $100 investment at $0.025 would secure 4,000 $TICS tokens. If the token price hits $10, that $100 turns into $40,000. At $15, you’re looking at $60,000—a mind-blowing ROI of 59,900%. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about timing. The best crypto to buy now is the one with massive growth potential, and $TICS checks every box. Conclusion: The Best Crypto to Buy Now with Massive Growth Potential As the crypto market evolves, three projects stand out: Ethereum, Kaspa, and Qubetics. Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralised innovation, while Kaspa offers unmatched speed. But Qubetics ? It’s the game-changer. Analysts are excited about the insane ROI potential of Qubetics’ presale. With its vision of unified blockchain interoperability and a token price poised to skyrocket, $TICS offers something no other crypto does right now. The presale is your chance to be part of the next big thing. If you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy now, don’t let Qubetics’ presale pass you by.

Here’s Your Chance to Redeem Yourself,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-bitcoins-rise-heres-your-chance-to-redeem-yourself/,"Remember when Bitcoin was just a few dollars per coin? If only you had invested back then, your portfolio might look completely different today. Missing out on Bitcoin’s early days still stings for many investors. But what if we told you there’s a new project creating just as much buzz? Enter Qubetics , a blockchain marvel poised to transform the crypto space. With features like a decentralised VPN (dVPN), it tackles real-world issues such as privacy risks, data control, and online security. Analysts predict Qubetics could hit $10–$15 after its mainnet launch, making it the best crypto to invest in now. This might just be the second chance you’ve been waiting for. Bitcoin Was Just the Beginning, but Qubetics Is the Future When Bitcoin first launched, it promised a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial system. And while it changed the world, it’s not without its flaws. Bitcoin lacks many modern functionalities, leaving gaps in privacy, scalability, and accessibility. This has left the door wide open for innovative projects like Qubetics to step in. Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s a game-changer. With its decentralised VPN, it addresses issues Bitcoin never could, like securing user privacy in a highly surveilled online world. If you missed the Bitcoin revolution, don’t let Qubetics slip by. It’s shaping up to be the best crypto to invest in now , combining innovation with unmatched potential. How Qubetics Solves Privacy Problems In today’s digital age, privacy is increasingly rare. Traditional VPNs claim to secure your data but often fall short, storing logs that can be accessed or hacked. Centralized solutions also leave users vulnerable to government interference and corporate misuse of personal data. Qubetics revolutionizes this space with its decentralised VPN, which removes central control entirely. Users retain full ownership of their data while benefiting from enhanced security and anonymity. This makes Qubetics more than just a blockchain—it’s a solution for an era where privacy is under siege. Its presale offers an incredible opportunity to get involved in the best crypto to invest in now. Tackling Security Risks with a dVPN Cybersecurity threats have skyrocketed, with hackers targeting everything from financial institutions to individual users. Centralized VPNs, while helpful, are often the weakest link, becoming single points of failure in an increasingly hostile digital landscape. Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these vulnerabilities. By decentralizing the network, Qubetics ensures there’s no single point of attack. This provides unparalleled security, making it an essential tool for anyone concerned about their online safety. With its presale already creating waves, Qubetics is undeniably the best crypto to invest in now for those who value both security and innovation. Restrictive Data Practices Are No Match for Qubetics Many VPNs and online tools restrict how users can access and share data. These limitations stifle creativity and freedom, forcing people to operate within narrow parameters set by centralized systems. Qubetics challenges this status quo with its decentralized approach. With Qubetics, users regain control over their data and online activities. There are no middlemen imposing restrictions or profiting from your information. This makes Qubetics a leader in the fight for online freedom and positions it as the best crypto to invest in now . Presale Momentum—Why Qubetics Is Your Next Smart Move The Qubetics presale is more than just an investment opportunity; it’s a chance to be part of a revolutionary project from the ground up. Tokens are currently priced at just $0.025, and with predictions of hitting $10–$15 post-mainnet launch, the potential returns are staggering. Missing Bitcoin was painful, but you don’t have to make the same mistake twice. Qubetics offers innovation, security, and privacy, all while being accessible to early investors. It’s more than a blockchain—it’s the best crypto to invest in now , and the time to act is now. Conclusion Missing Bitcoin’s early days taught us all an invaluable lesson: opportunities in crypto don’t wait. Qubetics represents the next frontier, tackling issues like privacy, security, and data restrictions with its innovative dVPN technology. The presale is already underway, and the clock is ticking. Don’t let Qubetics become another “what if” moment. With its potential to reshape the blockchain landscape and deliver massive returns, it’s the best crypto to invest in now . Seize the moment before it’s too late. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics The post Regret Missing Bitcoin’s Rise?

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 02:23:00
