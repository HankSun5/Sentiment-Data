Bitcoin has led the way with solid gains, and now attention is shifting to altcoins that may follow. As price movements become more active, some coins are starting to stand out. Web3 ai, XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana are among the projects drawing serious attention. Their rising activity suggests now could be a key moment to explore options. Finding the top crypto right now is not only about what’s trending. It is also about timing and seeing what’s next before momentum peaks. These four picks are beginning to look interesting to those who follow market signals. Web3 ai: AI-Driven Features Catch Early Interest Web3 ai is becoming a widely discussed project in today’s market. It is designed to offer smart crypto tools for better insights and actions. Rather than focusing on hype, the project is building features that aim to solve common challenges faced by users. Key tools include AI-supported risk detection, real-time portfolio monitoring, and systems that help spot scam activity. These options can assist users who want to make clearer decisions without heavy research. The platform is designed for use across experience levels. Right now, Web3 ai is in Stage 9 of its presale, with $WAI priced at $0.000443. So far, it has raised over $8.3 million. With its listing set at $0.005242, early supporters could see gains reaching 1747%. For those exploring early-stage options, this phase could offer one. XRP: Climb Supported by Regulation and Market Strength XRP is climbing again as it trades near $2.20, with a market cap of $130 billion. Ripple’s recent regulatory clarity has boosted trust in the coin, especially since it moved beyond the $0.50 resistance. This progress has sparked renewed interest from institutions closely tracking Ripple’s developments. XRP is gaining steady traction, supported by public endorsements. If it clears the $2.50 resistance level, the next target could be $3. That’s why some view it as the top crypto right now for those seeking a mix of stability and upside potential. DOGE: Chart Signals and Community Buzz Keep It Active Dogecoin is priced around $0.20, holding a $30 billion market cap. Its weekly chart reveals a bullish engulfing pattern, suggesting possible short-term movement. Though it started as a meme coin, DOGE remains relevant thanks to its liquidity and strong user support. Fueled by community engagement and regular attention online, DOGE remains in the spotlight. For those looking at the top crypto right now with fast-moving potential, Dogecoin continues to offer a familiar and reactive option. SOL: Builds Strength Through Ecosystem Expansion Solana trades near $160 and carries a market cap of around $83.49 billion. Its weekly chart features a bullish reversal pattern, hinting at a buyer-driven recovery. The Solana ecosystem of dApps and NFTs is steadily growing, adding strength to its position. Its scalable infrastructure helps it maintain momentum in the smart contract field. If SOL breaks its former resistance near $294, strong gains could follow. As interest grows in efficient platforms, many consider Solana a top crypto right now for its network growth and utility. Presale Contender: Exploring What’s Driving Attention in Crypto Let’s recap and examine which option holds the most potential in today’s dynamic market. XRP draws continued interest due to market backing and regulatory progress. Dogecoin benefits from strong community energy and technical signs of movement. Solana remains active, supported by its fast network and expanding ecosystem. Still, Web3 ai is catching attention in a different way. It is currently in its presale phase, offering an AI-focused platform with practical applications. With $WAI priced at $0.000443 and more than $8.3 million raised, it has strong early traction. A projected ROI of 1747% adds to its appeal. For those exploring the top crypto right now , Web3 ai may stand out as the option with the most long-term upside when entered early.

46569814,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72206,1750626045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Dogecoin’s (DOGE) $1 Dream Faces a New Challenger, Can Ruvi AI’s Audited Token Reach It First?",https://timestabloid.com/dogecoins-doge-1-dream-faces-a-new-challenger-can-ruvi/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the people’s cryptocurrency, entertaining dreams of a $1 valuation driven by its dedicated fanbase and strong community. However, a new challenger has entered the fray, and analysts believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) might outpace Dogecoin in the race to $1. With a structured growth plan, cutting-edge technology, and an impressive presale performance, Ruvi AI has fast become the focus of investors looking for major returns. Why Ruvi AI Might Win the $1 Race Dogecoin has leaned on its meme-inspired origins and celebrity support, while Ruvi AI sets itself apart with real-world utility . By integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI solves industry problems in marketing , entertainment , and finance , ensuring demand beyond speculation. This practical approach creates long-term value that Dogecoin, lacking utility, may struggle to match. Ruvi AI also offers a structured growth model that eliminates guesswork. During Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are available for just $0.015 each , allowing early investors to enter at a low price. Once the presale concludes, the token’s value is guaranteed to reach $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts predict RUVI could hit $1 once listed , representing a 66x ROI for those who buy in now. These figures mark Ruvi AI as a serious contender in the crypto space. Presale Performance Reflects Strong Investor Support Ruvi AI’s presale has been nothing short of exceptional, with numbers that underscore its potential. Here are the key achievements so far: $1.9 million raised , underscoring strong investor interest. Over 160 million tokens sold , demonstrating healthy demand. A community of more than 1,600 holders , showcasing a growing investor base dedicated to Ruvi AI. One major factor drawing investors is the guaranteed $0.07 valuation after the presale , which contrasts with Dogecoin’s highly volatile price movements. This clarity reduces uncertainty and makes Ruvi AI a safer, more predictable investment. Amplify Returns with Ruvi AI VIP Tiers Investors aiming to maximize their gains are flocking to Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers , which offer impressive bonuses at different contribution levels. Here’s how each tier stacks up: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers allow early backers to secure significant advantages, showcasing the scalability of Ruvi AI’s returns. Transparency and Security Reinforce Ruvi AI’s Strengths Ruvi AI is not just about growth; it prioritizes investor confidence. The project recently underwent a third-party audit by CyberScope , ensuring that its platform is technologically secure and reliable. Combined with its partnership with WEEX Exchange , which guarantees post-presale liquidity , RUVI tokens will be immediately tradable upon listing, unlike many new projects that leave investors waiting. Real-World Applications Ensure Longevity While Dogecoin depends on hype and social validation, Ruvi AI’s broad utility creates sustainable value over the long term. Its real-world applications include: Marketing: AI-powered tools that improve advertising ROI by optimizing ad targeting and execution. Entertainment: Blockchain-backed payments and AI-driven personalization, boosting creators’ revenues and engagement. Finance: Fraud detection solutions, scalable systems, and enhanced transparency to modernize financial operations. These innovations not only differentiate Ruvi AI but also ensure relevance across diverse markets, making RUVI a valuable token regardless of crypto market trends. Why Ruvi AI Could Beat Dogecoin to $1 Dogecoin’s path to $1 relies heavily on market sentiment and social media buzz, while Ruvi AI’s structured growth, utility, and scalability make it a more reliable bet . Starting at just $0.015 , with a guaranteed $0.07 valuation post-presale and a forecasted $1 price , Ruvi AI offers a clear and enticing roadmap for investors. With over $1.9 million raised , 160 million tokens sold , and its partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI has already taken significant steps toward becoming a leader in the crypto space.

Chainlink (LINK) is holding steady at the $13.40 mark, supported by rising whale activity. Traders are eyeing a possible 15% rebound from this level. NEAR Protocol is making waves with its plan to reach an incredible 1 million transactions per second (TPS) this year. Its tech upgrades, including adaptive resharding and advanced zero-knowledge proofs, are driving excitement. Meanwhile, Unstaked (UNSD) is capturing massive interest in its presale. The project has now raised over $10.4 million, with more than 1.1 billion tokens sold. With its AI-first approach, Proof of Intelligence (PoI) system, and a $1 million giveaway boosting visibility, Unstaked is fast becoming one of the most talked-about new projects for 2025. For buyers seeking promising altcoins in today’s crowded market, these three stand out for their potential and unique strengths. Chainlink Defends Key $13.40 Level Chainlink (LINK) is holding firm at the $13.40 support level, catching attention after four consecutive days of decline. Large holders appear to be accumulating, with 1.78 million LINK (valued at $25.53 million) moved from BitGet to a private wallet and another $4.49 million withdrawn from exchanges, signaling long-term confidence. Despite a 6% price dip in 24 hours, trading volume rose 7%, showing strong market interest. Holding $13.40 could trigger a rally to $15.40 (a 15% gain), while a breakdown risks an 18% fall to $10.40. Thanks to its essential role in delivering data to smart contracts, LINK remains a top contender among altcoins for 2025. NEAR Targets 1 Million TPS Milestone NEAR Protocol is setting its sights on an ambitious goal, achieving 1 million transactions per second (TPS) by the end of 2025. According to R&D lead Bowen Wang, this will be powered by adaptive resharding, which allows the network to dynamically scale as user demand increases. Its current Nightshade 2.0 already handles large volumes, but adaptive resharding will enable shards to split or merge based on traffic, improving speed and efficiency. The shift to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will further enhance security. With growing institutional support, including a key partnership with DWF Labs, and strong AI capabilities, NEAR remains one of the most promising altcoins heading into 2025. Unstaked Presale Raises $10.4M With AI-Powered Innovation Leading Growth Unstaked is quickly making its mark with one of the hottest presales of the year. It has already raised more than $10.4 million and sold over 1.1 billion tokens. The project is now in Stage 21, with the coin priced at $0.011739. What makes Unstaked different is its foundation in artificial intelligence. The project runs on a new system called Proof of Intelligence (PoI), which values knowledge and contributions rather than expensive hardware. This is catching on with buyers looking for projects that offer real purpose and not just copycat technology. A $1 million giveaway is also driving huge engagement, helping Unstaked reach more potential buyers ahead of exchange listings. Community members can win prizes and help promote the project across social media. Current presale buyers have already seen steady growth from lower stages, and many expect the price to hit $0.1819 or higher after launch, offering a possible 27x gain. Importantly, Unstaked has no private allocation, meaning everyone can participate equally. The project also has a strong governance model. Coin holders can vote on key decisions, receive performance-based rewards, and use AI tools to help guide development. Unstaked supports cross-chain interactions and will launch its AI-powered agents after the presale ends and the project officially goes live. With this clear vision and growing support, Unstaked is quickly becoming one of the top presales to watch in 2025. Final Verdict As traders move funds in anticipation of a possible summer rally, Chainlink’s strong technical support, NEAR Protocol’s scaling innovations, and Unstaked’s unique AI-first model all shine as great opportunities. LINK and NEAR are established projects adapting to new demands, while Unstaked brings a fresh approach with real utility. For those looking for altcoins with real growth potential in 2025, these three projects offer the key ingredients: useful technology, active communities, and clear paths to creating long-term value.

46570025,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72232,1750626282,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu Loses Steam Near $0.000010 While Analysts Project $MERK Could 50x Before Its First CEX Listing,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-loses-steam-near-0-000010-while-analysts-project-merk/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is holding just above $0.000010 , but despite its massive community and multi-billion dollar market cap, its momentum is weakening . After peaking in late 2024, SHIB has entered a prolonged consolidation phase. Daily volumes remain steady , but without new catalysts, investor attention is drifting, not away from memecoins, but toward newer formats with built-in utility and real-time engagement. Enter Meerkat ($MERK) , a memecoin born on Ethereum, but engineered for Telegram , the platform where crypto-native culture now thrives. With staking, missions, and a gamified miniapp already live during presale, $MERK is shaping up as the first memecoin that actually rewards user action before it even lists. While Shiba Inu holds the past, analysts are watching $MERK as a high-upside contender , projecting 25x–50x potential based on working mechanics, community traction, and transparent tokenomics. Market Snapshot: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Loses Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001050 , marking a decline of over 50% compared to the previous year. Despite maintaining a substantial market cap of $7.53 billion and a loyal base of 1.5 million holders, price action remains flat and lacks clear direction. Daily trading volume hovers around $142 million , indicating that SHIB continues to attract attention from traders, but without meaningful upward movement, that interest hasn’t translated into new momentum. After a short-lived rally in Q4 2024 , SHIB has been consolidating near key psychological levels, with no major catalysts in sight. Even with the launch of Shibarium, adoption has been slower than expected, and user incentives remain weak across the ecosystem. The takeaway: SHIB still holds powerful brand recognition in the memecoin space, but it lacks the mechanisms to activate or retain users in a dynamic way. Investors looking for more than passive holding are beginning to explore alternatives that offer real-time interaction and tangible rewards. A Changing Meta: From Holding to Playing The memecoin era is undergoing a fundamental shift. While early adopters were satisfied with holding tokens in hopes of long-term appreciation, today’s crypto users are demanding more, faster. What’s emerging is a new meta: less speculation, more interaction. Less waiting, more doing. From Passive to Participatory Holding used to be enough. But now, investors want to participate actively in the ecosystem, not just watch from the sidelines. They’re looking for: ● Staking opportunities that reward time and loyalty ● Daily missions and quests that provide utility beyond charts ● Leaderboards and gamified incentives that make engagement visible and valuable In short, they want skin in the game, not just exposure. Communities Want Function, Not Just Culture Memecoins like SHIB built massive communities based on culture and identity. But today, community by itself is not enough. Modern users expect: ● Rewards for activity, not just for holding ● User-centered mechanics that evolve and scale ● Frictionless platforms that don’t require deep technical knowledge This demand is pushing attention toward platforms that blur the lines between social, DeFi, and gaming. Telegram as the New Frontier With its 800M+ monthly users and built-in support for bots and miniapps, Telegram is becoming a natural home for this new wave of crypto engagement. Projects that launch directly inside Telegram, like $MERK, are meeting users where they already are, lowering the barrier to entry and increasing retention through seamless, chat-based experiences. Conclusion: The memecoin game is evolving. And tokens that reward interaction, not just attention, are taking the lead. Telegram Becomes the New Launchpad With over 800 million monthly active users, Telegram has rapidly evolved from a messaging platform into a full-fledged crypto ecosystem. What began with simple bots has grown into a space where miniapps, tokenized experiences, and DeFi tools operate natively inside chat. The key difference lies in the frictionless onboarding. Unlike browser-based dApps that require extensions, wallets, and multi-step setups, Telegram-native tools allow users to engage with tokens, stake assets, and complete tasks with just a few taps. No dashboards, no downloads, no learning curve. This simplicity is driving a new category of adoption, one based on interaction over speculation. Bots and memecoins like $MERK are leading this shift, transforming Telegram chats into action-based economies where every click, mission, or stake creates a loop of engagement and reward. As more users prioritize ease of access and tangible activity over passive holding, utility within messaging apps is quickly becoming the new benchmark for early-stage traction in crypto. Meerkat ($MERK): From Meme to Mechanism Meerkat ($MERK) is a memecoin built on Ethereum, but its real innovation lies in how users interact with it: directly through Telegram. Unlike typical ERC-20 tokens that remain idle in wallets, $MERK is designed for immediate use. From the presale stage, users can already access a fully functional miniapp with live staking, daily missions, XP systems and real-time leaderboards, all without leaving the chat interface. Behind its playful image, Meerkat is built on solid ground. All contracts have been audited by Cyberscope, ensuring transparency and security. Fifty percent of the total supply is permanently locked via UNCX, and the remaining is structured for community access. There are no allocations for VCs or insiders, reflecting a design philosophy focused entirely on fairness and decentralization. The token launched its presale at approximately $0.00018, with confirmed exchange listings on P2B and AscendEX, providing immediate post-launch liquidity. In a space crowded with promises and roadmaps, $MERK stands out for being operational before trading begins. It’s not just a concept, it’s a product. And it’s already rewarding users for showing up. SHIB built a legacy, but $MERK is building loops that actually pay users to participate. If you’re ready to move from passive to active, start today: Check out the live missions at meerkat.wtf or join the Telegram app directly at t.me/meerkatwtf. $MERK Launches Its Own zk-Rollup Layer 2 and AI-Driven Meme Engine $MERK isn’t just building utility inside Telegram, it’s launching an entirely new blockchain layer to support it. The project has announced the deployment of its own zk-rollup Layer 2 on Ethereum, specifically designed to scale meme trading and the tokenization of digital culture. Fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), this new network enables ultra-low fees, fast confirmations, and provides a tailor-made infrastructure for the creation and exchange of viral tokens. But the Layer 2 does more than boost performance, it becomes the core engine powering Meerkat’s ecosystem. It will host both the project’s native AI module and the official Telegram miniapp, enabling users to interact directly with smart contracts and token mechanics without ever leaving the chat. While other projects focus on tokenizing traditional finance, Meerkat presents an alternative vision: a decentralized environment where value is generated through creativity, digital identity, and community energy. With the infrastructure already deployed and aligned with Web3’s cultural evolution, $MERK is positioning itself as the new cultural epicenter of the crypto space. The Burrow: On-Chain Meme Creation at Scale Alongside the launch of its Layer 2, $MERK has activated The Burrow—a fully operational creative environment where users can mint tokenized memes using generative AI and a modular SDK. The Burrow supports: ● ERC-20 and SPL collections ● Automated image and narrative generation ● Integrated minting and publishing flows ● Composability-first design for cultural scaling In short, The Burrow turns meme creation into an on-chain pipeline, seamlessly blending AI, cultural expression, and token issuance into a platform that’s ready to scale with demand. Analyst View: 25x–50x Projections if Momentum Holds With a live product, transparent tokenomics, and measurable daily activity, $MERK is attracting the attention of early-stage analysts tracking utility-based memecoins. The project’s ability to combine Ethereum’s credibility with Telegram’s accessibility is positioning it as more than a trend, it’s becoming a use case. Why Analysts Are Paying Attention Unlike most memecoins that launch with vague roadmaps and speculative hype, $MERK enters the market with working mechanics already in place. Users are actively staking, completing missions, earning XP, and climbing leaderboards, all within Telegram’s native environment. This kind of real usage is rare at this stage. Combined with a presale entry point of approximately $0.00018, a fair launch structure, and listings already confirmed, analysts are forecasting 25x to 50x potential upside, especially if user momentum continues post-TGE. Telegram-native tokens with real-time engagement loops represent an asymmetric opportunity, and in this evolving memecoin cycle, $MERK is rewarding action now, not waiting for hype to do the work. Final Thought: SHIB Is a Legacy Meme, $MERK Is the Next Format Shiba Inu walked so Meerkat ($MERK) could run. SHIB helped define what memecoins could be, community-driven, culture-rich, and impossible to ignore. But the market has evolved, and so han sus expectativas. Today, engagement equals value. Investors and users alike are no longer content with holding for hope. They want to interact, earn, compete, and grow inside the ecosystem they support. While SHIB holds its status as a meme OG, $MERK is actively shaping the next generation of crypto-native attention economies. Built on Ethereum, operational within Telegram, and fully functional from the presale stage, $MERK is not just a token, it’s a living platform. With no VCs, no insider wallets, and contracts fully audited by Cyberscope, it’s also a model of transparency.

46571024,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753472,1750627008,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46571024.jpeg,Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates due to rising oil prices and inflation risks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/federal-reserve-will-hike-rates-not-cut/,"The Federal Reserve is now heading toward rate hikes as inflation threatens to rise again. The pressure is coming from rising oil prices, triggered by military conflict in the Middle East. The US bombed three nuclear sites in Iran last Saturday night after Iran responded to earlier Israeli airstrikes. Now Iran is has shut down the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical oil route in the world. According to JP Morgan, if that happens, oil could surge to $130 per barrel, pushing US inflation to 5%. That’s the same level inflation hit in March 2023, when the Fed was hiking rates back-to-back. According to research reviewed by the Fed in 2010, a persistent oil shock leads to weaker consumption and investment, along with a hit to the dollar. In that study, they showed that countries importing oil, like the United States, get poorer as oil prices go up. The loss in national wealth leads to less spending, a weaker exchange rate, and a change in trade balances. People and businesses will try to cut down oil use, but it won’t be enough to avoid damage. The result is a worse oil trade balance and less import of other goods. The non-oil part of the trade balance improves, but only because the economy slows down. Iran warns of retaliation as US and Israel bomb nuclear sites Ten days ago, Israel carried out unprovoked airstrikes on Iranian territory. Tehran hit back. Then, over the weekend, the US joined the fight and dropped bombs on three nuclear facilities in Iran. In response, Iran’s foreign minister said the country “reserves all options to defend its sovereignty.” But since 2000, Iran has threatened over ten times to close off the Strait of Hormuz. If they actually go through with it this time, energy prices will definitely explode. The Strait is only 21 miles wide but carries one-fifth of the world’s oil every day. It also sees more traffic than both the Panama and Suez Canals. About 35% of all seaborne LNG also passes through it. The US Navy has kept forces in the area for decades because of how strategic it is. A map showing Iran, UAE, Oman, circling the Strait of Hormuz Hormuz is the only way out of the Persian Gulf by sea. If Iran closes it, the world loses access to a massive portion of oil supply overnight. That would almost guarantee a military response from Washington, Tel Aviv, or most likely both. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News on Sunday that China should intervene and talk Iran down. “I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil.” China is Iran’s biggest oil customer and maintains friendly diplomatic ties with Tehran, publicly condemning Israel’s actions. Trump demands rate cuts while Powell stays silent While global tension rises, President Donald Trump continues to push for interest rate cuts. Even before his reelection in 2024, Trump had been attacking Jerome Powell and demanding cheaper borrowing costs. Since returning to the White House, he’s kept up the heat. Trump has criticized the Fed Chair publicly nearly every week, insulting Powell both at press conferences and online. Powell, for his part, hasn’t said anything. He avoids reacting, never comments on the insults, and refuses to take the bait. But rate cuts right now are not realistic. With oil possibly hitting $130 and inflation climbing back toward 5%, cutting rates could add fuel to the fire. Instead, the Federal Reserve will likely raise them again, just like they did in 2023. The link between oil and inflation is well known. The Fed’s own modeling from the research we mentioned earlier shows how damaging oil shocks are, especially when financial markets can’t absorb the risk. The worse the shock, the harder it is to fight the resulting high inflation. With Trump pushing for cuts and Powell boxed in by rising costs, the Federal Reserve is once again facing political and economic pressure at the same time.

With this move, Texas has become the third state in the US to create an official Bitcoin reserve. According to the Bitcoin Laws platform, which tracks digital asset laws, 47 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced in 26 states so far, with 13 bills under active consideration at the federal level. This growing interest in digital asset reserves across the country parallels the policies of Donald Trump, who was re-elected in November 2024. Trump, who took office in January, has taken extensive steps to transform the U.S. into a more crypto-friendly environment, including reversing anti-crypto banking practices (debanking), appointing pro-crypto figures to key regulatory positions, and establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

The company believes crypto can help solve key problems in today’s financial system, such as rising debt, inflation, and growing distrust in banks. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are not just new forms of money. They are tools that can help build a stronger, fairer economy. Global Debt and Inflation Are Rising In a post on X, the Coinbase CEO highlighted serious problems in the global economy. Government debt is rising quickly, especially in the U.S., where the national debt has now reached over $36 trillion. At the same time, inflation makes money worth less and everyday costs higher. This makes it harder for people to save, invest, or plan. Armstrong said these issues are reducing economic freedom and trust in banks. Bitcoin and Digital Currencies Offer a New Option In response to these problems, more people are turning to digital assets like Bitcoin. Coinbase CEO says the rising price of the flagship crypto shows that people are looking for safer alternatives. These assets are becoming a place to protect wealth from inflation and government overspending. Unlike traditional money, crypto can be sent quickly and cheaply across borders. It does not rely on central banks or large financial firms. This gives people more control over their money, especially in places with weak banking systems or unstable currencies. Many crypto leaders have also suggested using Bitcoin to reduce the U.S. national debt. In February, a new report from VanEck, an investment management firm, shed light on whether this plan is feasible . Crypto Is Not Just About Investment The Coinbase leader explained that crypto is more than a way to make money. It is a technology that can improve the financial system. It can speed up payments, lower fees, and support new business ways. Artists and creators can earn income directly from their audience without giving a significant share to middlemen. Armstrong said Coinbase is building new tools to make this possible. These include simple business payment systems and a crypto card that rewards users in Bitcoin . Coinbase aims to make crypto valuable in everyday life, not just as an investment but as a practical solution for modern finance. Coinbase is Building A New Foundation for the Financial System According to Coinbase, the world needs to rebuild its financial system from the ground up. The company believes crypto can be the foundation for this change. Under the leadership of its CEO, Coinbase is expanding its role from a trading platform to a complete financial services provider. It now supports various digital tools and wants to help build the next generation of internet-based financial systems.

The launch is Tesla’s first real-world test of its plan to deploy fully autonomous vehicles that rely entirely on cameras and AI, not the sensors and LiDAR systems used by rivals like Waymo. Leading up to the launch, Elon had teased the rollout for months on X, and on Sunday, that promise turned real. Social media posts and videos from the area showed Tesla-branded Model Y robotaxis cruising through the city, officially marking the start of the new service. Tesla had earlier sent early access invites to a limited number of users, giving them the ability to download the Robotaxi app and hail rides starting that same day. Many of the first users posting online were already well-known Tesla supporters on X. Tesla begins with 10 vehicles and safety monitors in South Austin The service is starting out small. According to Tesla’s new Robotaxi info page, which went live on June 22, just 10 Model Y SUVs are being used within a small, specific part of South Austin. Rides are available daily from 6:00 a.m. to midnight, but may stop during bad weather. Every ride includes a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat, listed as a “safety monitor.” Tesla has not explained if this employee has control over the vehicle or access to a kill switch. Notably, these are not the futuristic Cybercabs that Elon unveiled in October 2024. Tesla instead chose to use updated 2025 versions of its Model Y, equipped with a new version of its Full Self-Driving software—what Elon describes as “unsupervised” autonomy. These vehicles are fully driverless but still include the safety monitor up front, breaking from what companies like Waymo and the now-paused Cruise used to do with human backup drivers. Ed Niedermeyer, author of Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors , confirmed the location of a Robotaxi depot near Oltorf Street. He reportedly observed branded robotaxis entering and exiting the parking lot in the days leading up to the launch. On Sunday morning, he spotted a Model Y robotaxi brake suddenly twice, once while crossing an intersection. In both cases, it was passing parked police cars. There were no riders inside during these events. Tesla restricts press access and blocks transparency efforts Most details about the Robotaxi rollout have come from Elon’s own posts or from early users sharing footage. Tesla hasn’t released key data and has actively tried to keep information from being made public. It allegedly blocked TechCrunch’s public records request with the Texas Department of Transportation, and also tried to stop the City of Austin from giving documents to Reuters. In April, Taylor White, Tesla’s senior counsel for infrastructure, wrote a letter to the Texas Attorney General’s office claiming that some of the requested documents included confidential information, trade secrets, or business data shared with TxDOT. On the safety side, in-cabin cameras won’t be on during rides by default. Tesla says the camera will only activate if there’s an emergency or if support is requested. It may also turn on after a trip ends to verify the car’s readiness for its next ride. Tesla’s new info page also lists several rider rules. Riders are banned from smoking, vaping, drinking, doing drugs, or using the vehicle for any criminal activity. The company says anyone who records and shares content that violates these rules can have their access suspended or terminated. After the launch, Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla’s head of Autopilot and self-driving, posted a photo from a Robotaxi launch party. Elon followed up on X, posting: “Super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!!

That token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a new DeFi project trading for mere cents yet gaining serious traction on social media and investor forums. The project is in phase 5 of its presale which has already sold out over 40%. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $10.9 million and attracted over 12,300 holders. For those wondering what to buy this summer this could be the next big cryptocurrency to generate generational wealth for those who move before the crowd catches on. Mutuum Finance Presale Enters Phase 5 As Investor Interest Skyrockets Mutuum Finance is gaining strong momentum in Phase 5 of its presale. Growing into a contender in DeFi the project stands out from its competitors by offering a scalable inflation-proof system of finance with real-world practical application. Investor interest is picking up speed with the project already having garnered more than $10.9 million and counting more than 12,300 token holders. Since the official listing price is $0.06 the existing investors are going to get a chance to 2x their investment once the token goes live. Not only is there a cool short-term return on investment but there is also long-term value potential. A New DeFi Lending Model with Full Asset Ownership Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol with users retaining their full ownership of assets while they participate in decentralized lending. The project uses a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending for enhanced flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system makes use of smart contracts to offer automated lending without any human intervention and in its place the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Through this auto mechanism, lenders’ and borrowers’ world becomes stabilized and predictable. Peer-to-Peer model on the other hand employs no intermediaries and thus offers a direct link among lenders and borrowers. This method is very dear to participants in dealing with volatile assets, where personalized conditions and flexibility are required. Such lending protocols provide start-to-end seamless DeFi experience that is perfectly tailored to the needs of the user and which is safer, transparent, and more customizable than other centralized lending products. Fully Collateralized Stablecoin and CertiK-Verified Security In addition to its lending innovation, Mutuum Finance is also developing the fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin has a competitive advantage over the algorithmic peers in that it is less prone to depegging. Mutuum Finance is based on trust and security. The project smart contracts are rigorously audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security companies. In addition to ensuring the integrity and transparency of the code base this audit also proves that the team is dedicated to building a secure DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance is quickly making waves in the crypto market with over $10.9 million raised and more than 12,300 early investors already on board. Still priced at just $0.03 in its current presale phase buyers stand to double their money at launch. Mutuum Finance is primed for a 21000% rally after launch which means early investors will turn $500 into $105,500 before the year ends. For anyone who feels they missed the boat on the last big DeFi breakout this could be the second chance you’ve been waiting for.

This record reflects increasing network activity and points to the continued maturity of the XRP ecosystem. Built-In Burn Mechanism Continues to Shrink Supply Unlike other cryptocurrencies that rely on halving events or fixed supply caps, XRP features a built-in burn mechanism that destroys a small amount of XRP with every transaction. This design helps prevent spam and slowly reduces the total supply over time. According to the latest figures from XRPScan, 14,003,265 XRP have been burned to date. This not only marks a new all-time high but also reinforces the growing utility of the network. On-Chain Growth Accelerates Recent data from Santiment shows a significant surge in activity across the XRP Ledger. The number of daily active addresses has jumped to over 295,000 —up sharply from the 35,000 to 40,000 daily average seen over the last three months. This increase signals a rising demand for the ledger’s features, including fast settlement, low fees, and native tokenization support. In addition, the number of whale and shark wallets holding at least 1 million XRP has now exceeded 2,700, a historic high for the nearly 12-year-old asset. This trend reflects growing interest from high-value investors and long-term holders. Price Holds Steady Amid Profit-Taking Despite strong fundamentals, XRP’s price has yet to fully reflect the on-chain momentum. As of report time, XRP is trading at $1.97, according to CoinMarketCap. This marks a major increase from its pre-rally level before November 2024, giving early investors sizable gains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, data from Glassnode shows a wave of profit realization, with early holders cashing out at a rate of $68.8 million per day. This selling pressure could weigh on XRP in the short term. If the $2 support level fails to hold, a nalysts warn the price could retreat toward $1.61. Outlook Hinges on Key Technical Levels On the flip side, if buyers return and manage to push the price above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2.27, XRP could continue trading within its current range. A decisive break above $2.65 would likely confirm renewed bullish momentum and potentially trigger a fresh rally. While the current price action reflects mixed sentiment, XRP’s underlying metrics—rising network usage, deflationary tokenomics, and increased whale accumulation—paint a picture of long-term strength.

Solana (SOL) is heading toward a $258 target, showing signs of strong momentum. Ethereum Classic (ETC) also appears to be gaining traction, with charts pointing to a move toward $50. At the same time, BlockDAG is making quiet progress that’s getting noticed. With mining units being shipped, a US sponsorship secured, and exchange listings in the pipeline, BlockDAG’s presale has already hit $317 million on its way to a $600 million goal. Its steady rise is catching attention. Whether you’re following SOL, ETC, or BlockDAG (BDAG) , all three are making a case to be the best new crypto to buy right now. Solana Eyes Key Levels as $258 Target Comes Into View Solana (SOL) is now trading around $149.30, sitting inside the golden Fibonacci zone. This range is known for trend changes. A falling wedge pattern has formed, which often leads to a bullish breakout. If this happens, the next Solana (SOL) price target could hit $204.31, $229.01, and possibly $258.45. That would mean gains of 60% to 100%. Support levels between $128 and $140 add strength to the case for a breakout. Although the market remains unpredictable, current signs favor a move upward. For those tracking Solana (SOL), this setup is one to watch. ETC Builds Strength as Price Charts Signal a Breakout Ethereum Classic (ETC) is starting to draw interest from traders. Priced around $16.78, the ETC chart shows a symmetrical triangle and a recent breakout from a falling wedge. Both patterns are seen as positive signals. If this momentum stays, ETC could climb toward the $21 to $50 range. Key levels are important now. ETC needs to hold above $17.50 to stay on track. If it falls under $16.80, selling pressure may return. With high trading volume, active users, and a solid network, the Ethereum Classic (ETC) price chart could be setting up for a bigger move. BlockDAG Raises the Bar With Steady Progress and Delivery In a market full of hype and promises, BlockDAG is standing out by focusing on results. Instead of talking about what might happen, the project is already making moves, building out features, and growing a real community. Recently, BlockDAG shared shipping dates for its miners, something many projects do not deliver on. The X30 and X100 miners are set to ship starting July 7, and the X10 will follow in August. Over 2 million users are now using the X1 mobile miner, showing that BlockDAG’s tools are ready and working from day one. The pace continues to pick up. On June 20, BlockDAG plans to reveal a US-based sponsorship deal that could help bring it more attention before it begins trading. In the background, the launch looks well prepared. Exchange listings are already confirmed on 20 centralized platforms including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, and LBank. Wallet support is also ready, and the X1 Miner app is live, showing that BlockDAG’s features match what users want. So far, the project has raised $317 million and delivered a 2,660% return since its first batch. The current price of $0.0020 is still active for a short time. BlockDAG is showing that results count. For those looking at the best new crypto to buy for 2025, this one is getting serious attention. Final Thoughts on Where Things Stand Now To wrap things up, the Solana (SOL) price target remains solid, backed by strong momentum that keeps it on many watchlists. Ethereum Classic (ETC) also shows promise with bullish signs on its chart. But BlockDAG is standing out in a unique way. With miner shipments confirmed, a US sponsorship reveal coming soon, and exchange listings already set, the project is showing steady results rather than just plans. The presale has reached nearly $317 million as more interest grows. For those tracking the best new crypto to buy , BlockDAG is now leading the conversation.

But today, analysts are turning their gaze toward Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a rising crypto powered by blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) . With a structured growth model and a fast-growing community, Ruvi AI is inching closer to becoming the next $1 project. Could it replicate Bitcoin’s meteoric rise? Why Ruvi AI Is Emerging as a $1 Contender While Bitcoin built its empire on its scarcity and decentralized technology, Ruvi AI offers pragmatic utility by solving pressing challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance. Combining AI and blockchain, Ruvi AI delivers real-world value rather than relying solely on market sentiment or speculative demand. Ruvi AI’s structured growth roadmap provides investors with clarity and confidence. Currently priced at just $0.015 in Phase 2 of its presale , Ruvi AI offers an accessible entry point. Once the presale ends, the token’s price will increase to $0.07 , representing an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts project that RUVI could go further, reaching $1 post-listing , a 66x ROI for those who invest early. This calculated growth puts Ruvi AI ahead of its competitors in terms of predictability and potential returns. A Presale That Signals Strong Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale performance has demonstrated remarkable momentum, confirming its appeal to investors. Key measurable highlights include: Over $1.9 million raised so far More than 160 million tokens sold , showing strong demand Over 1,600 token holders , underscoring a solid and growing community Importantly, the post-presale valuation of $0.07 is not speculative hype but rather a part of Ruvi AI’s structured pricing strategy. This planned progression provides transparency, differentiating Ruvi AI from many speculative and volatile crypto projects. Earn Bigger Returns with Ruvi AI VIP Tiers Investors looking to amplify their returns can benefit from Ruvi AI’s highly rewarding VIP investment tiers .

46574695,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753414,1750631160,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46574695.jpeg,"After $68M Win With Shiba Inu, This Crypto Investor is Bagging SHIB’s Newest Rival Priced lower Than $0.01",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/after-68m-win-with-shiba-inu-this-crypto-investor-is-bagging-shibs-newest-rival-priced-lower-than-0-01/,"One such tale that’s become legendary within crypto circles is that of an early Shiba Inu (SHIB) investor who turned a modest investment into a staggering $68 million. Now, with SHIB showing signs of maturing and fewer parabolic moves on the horizon, that same investor has set their sights on a new meme coin— Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . It’s a bold pivot, but not without reason. LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin hoping to replicate the viral success of Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Dogecoin. It’s been quietly building what many are calling the next big thing in meme coin evolution—combining culture, innovation, and infrastructure. And judging by the early numbers and community sentiment, it may be the only meme coin in 2025 worth watching this closely. Shiba Inu’s Rise and Plateau The story of Shiba Inu is legendary. SHIB defied expectations and delivered one of the most jaw-dropping ROI stories in crypto history. One investor reportedly turned just $8,000 into nearly $70 million in under two years. That kind of gain is rare—some would even say once-in-a-generation. But even fairytales have ceilings. After reaching its peak, SHIB has struggled to recapture that magic. While still boasting a passionate community and solid developments, such as its Layer 2 network, SHIB’s growth has become incremental. The low-cap volatility and overnight 100x possibilities that drew early investors are no longer present. That’s precisely why the investor who made millions from SHIB is shifting focus. The next opportunity, in their view, lies in something much earlier in its life cycle. Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—a token that combines meme energy with serious architecture. LILPEPE’s Presale Momentum Signals Something Big Still in its third presale stage, LILPEPE is priced at just $0.0012—a fraction of a cent. Despite being early in its rollout, the project has already raised over $1.3 million, surpassing early targets and selling out previous presale stages in a remarkably short time. Unlike most meme coins that launch and rely solely on virality, LILPEPE is building an ecosystem from the ground up. The token plans to evolve into a Layer 2 blockchain dedicated entirely to meme coins, offering fast and cheap transactions, and, more importantly, built-in resistance to sniper bots. This makes it one of the few meme projects that not only appeals to traders and degens but also to developers and serious builders. The platform will also feature a meme-focused launchpad, enabling new meme projects to launch within the LILPEPE ecosystem. It’s a meme coin with utility, infrastructure, and a vision that stretches beyond hype. Listings, Community, and a Massive Giveaway LILPEPE isn’t relying on just plans and promises—it’s actively expanding its visibility and reach. The project has confirmed two top-tier centralized exchange listings upon launch and has shared that plans are in place to debut on the world’s biggest crypto exchange. For a token in presale, these moves are exceptionally bullish and speak to the legitimacy of what’s being built. What’s more, the team has launched an ambitious $777,000 giveaway , with 10 lucky winners each set to receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. This is rapidly expanding the project’s footprint and increasing awareness. Backed by Anonymous Experts Who Know Meme Coins There’s also buzz about the team behind the project. While they’ve chosen to remain anonymous, insiders suggest that the project is being backed by individuals who have previously played pivotal roles in some of the most successful meme coins in history. Their strategic fingerprints—tight presale mechanics, community-first rollouts, sniper bot protections—are all over LILPEPE. This blend of stealth experience and public-facing energy is part of what’s drawn in larger investors, including the former SHIB whale. If these seasoned builders execute their roadmap, LILPEPE won’t just compete with SHIB—it could surpass it in both cultural and financial impact. Is History About to Repeat? Investors who missed out on SHIB in 2020 often ask, “When will the next opportunity like that come?” For those watching the meme coin space closely, that moment may be arriving again. And LILPEPE is shaping up to be the token that leads the charge. It has a low price, ambitious infrastructure, exchange plans, and viral momentum to transition from a microcap to a market giant. And if someone who turned $8k into $68 million with SHIB is now watching LILPEPE this closely, the rest of us should be too. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a chance for lightning to strike twice.

46574251,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/will-pepe-get-the-doge-treatment-elon-musk-shows-love-on-twitter,1750631290,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/46574251.jpeg,Will PEPE Get the Doge Treatment? Elon Musk Shows Love on Twitter,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/will-pepe-get-the-doge-treatment-elon-musk-shows-love-on-twitter,"Meme coins have consistently stirred up excitement in the crypto market. With Elon Musk once again giving attention to Pepe (PEPE) on Twitter, speculators are wondering if it could mirror Dogecoin’s historic surge. Musk’s influence on meme-based assets is well-documented, having previously propelled Dogecoin to record highs through a series of supportive tweets. In December 2024, AI-generated images featuring Pepe the Frog began appearing on his X (formerly Twitter) feed, sparking a new wave of speculation. Though no direct endorsement has been made, the association alone has historically been enough to trigger major price moves. Investors are now closely watching whether this renewed spotlight could inject fresh momentum into PEPE’s trajectory, despite its recent downturn. Meanwhile, a new contender, #Pepeto has emerged with a clear mission to address the core issues that held PEPE back. Unlike most meme coins fueled by internet virality, #Pepeto is presenting a structured and utility-driven roadmap that blends community culture with real technological infrastructure. How Pepeto Stacks Up Against Classic Meme Tokens Compared to established tokens like Dogecoin and PEPE, Pepeto enters with notable upgrades. Dogecoin rose on community strength and celebrity tweets, but lacked technological substance. PEPE, while gaining traction in early 2024, is currently showing signs of instability. Its price now hovers around $0.000009187 , a significant dip over the past week. In contrast, #Pepeto’s architecture centers on sustainability and optimization. It includes unique elements like token staking, a proprietary memecoin exchange, and a cross-chain bridge. These features add utility far beyond mere speculation. Hence, while Dogecoin and PEPE surfed waves of hype, Pepeto aims to establish long-term relevance. Pepeto’s Momentum: Presale, Price, and Potential As of press time, the price of $Pepeto is at $0.000000136 , and much of the presale has already been sold. The presale has generated $5,459,786.70 out of a target of $5.7 million, which indicates good early interest from investors. The staking model used in Pepeto is turning out to be a significant attraction in addition to the low entry barrier to buyers. It has an estimated yearly return rate of 276%, which makes it appealing to long-term investors. The project has already gained real traction with more than 30 trillion tokens staked. In addition, the ecosystem will introduce an exchange targeting meme tokens in particular. This addresses one of the gaps in the memecoin market by providing liquidity, security, and accessibility at the same time. Such usefulness, complemented by smooth interoperability via the bridge provided by Pepeto, will build a sound ecosystem in which meme assets could prosper. - Updates on $PEPETO exchange soon; once done, the day of judgement (Date of listing) would be days after - $PEPETO , The God of Frogs. pic.twitter.com/Aay4Tv5HCb — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 1, 2025 Why Pepeto Could Redefine the Meme Coin Landscape The pathway in the Pepeto roadmap does not dwell only on marketing but also draws stages on security, society, and technological rollout. The smart contracts have already been audited, and a staking platform has already been launched. Participation by the community via AMAs and strategic exchange listing presents credibility in the rollout. In Phase 3, the real-use applications come into operation with the launch of the bridge test and exchange test, and the completion of a full-scale marketing campaign in Phase 4. This plan guarantees that Pepeto is more than a meme; it is a movement founded on innovation. Moreover, it has sustainable tokenomics : 30% presale, 30% staking, 20% marketplace, 7.5% development, and 12.5% liquidity. These distributions guarantee environmental well-being and avoid abrupt discharges. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful, utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

Leading this charge are three altcoins with an unmistakable edge: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and the rising star FloppyPepe (FPPE) . As the first half of the year ends, investors are eyeing high-potential altcoins that could 100x by July, and these three are positioned to dominate. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI-Powered Meme Coin with Explosive Upside While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have long been staples in the world of altcoins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as the game-changer. This altcoin newcomer redefines the meme coin sector. It's secret? A shrinking supply model combined with zero transaction taxes makes it the ideal investment for those seeking maximum returns. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is far more than a traditional meme token. It blends artificial intelligence with decentralized finance, making it a powerhouse altcoin. Its AI agents, like the Meme‑o‑Matic and FloppyX Video AI, assist creators and influencers in generating compelling memes and captivating video content from text prompts. FloppyAI, a conversational AI bot trained to provide precise crypto insights based on user prompts. Start prompt here . This AI-based utility positions FloppyPepe (FPPE) at the center of a growing trend that will dominate the altcoin space in 2025. 100x - 550x For Early Investors With 80% Bonus With the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale in Stage 2, tokens are available at $0.00000035, and early adopters are offered an 80% bonus with code ""FLOPPY80."" Experts project this meme coin can rise 550x by July, making early entry a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Here’s how a modest investment could grow: Initial Investment Potential ROI at 550x Growth $1,000 $550,000 $5,000 $2,750,000 $10,000 $5,500,000 Unlike Ethereum (ETH), which carries high gas fees, this meme coin boasts no transaction taxes. Its deflationary mechanism burns 1% of every transaction, reducing supply and rewarding holders. Another 1% goes directly to holders, making the token an ideal long-term hold. With the presale in its second phase and liquidity pouring in, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining unstoppable momentum with increasing whale activity. Those joining now can secure life-changing returns. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart Contract King Ethereum (ETH) has long been the bedrock of decentralized finance and NFT ecosystems. The shift to proof-of-stake and scalability improvements solidifies Ethereum’s (ETH) role in the next wave of altcoins. Yet despite its dominance, Ethereum (ETH) is still weighed down by rising gas fees and network congestion. While Ethereum (ETH) may struggle to deliver the same level of returns as smaller, more agile projects. “Titan Of Crypto,” an analyst on X, is optimistic about a breakout that can fuel a potential Ethereum (ETH) 100x rally, which could spark a revival for other altcoins, making now the best time to accumulate. Solana (SOL): The High‑Speed Challenger Solana (SOL) shines with its blazing transaction speeds and low costs, making it one of the best-performing altcoins of the last cycle. Solana’s (SOL) strong developer base and expanding ecosystem continue to draw attention. Solana (SOL) has seen a decline in price lately, currently trading at $145, but its 1H chart is promising, and SOSA, a trader on X, confirms a push towards $154. However, unlike FloppyPepe’s curated burns, Solana’s (SOL) highly circulated supply and institutional focus limit its potential, making it ideal for more conservative allocations rather than breakout plays. The New Leader of the Altcoins Movement While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain cornerstones of the altcoin market , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to dominate as the breakout star of 2025. Its AI-driven meme generation, zero transaction tax, and deflationary supply model set it apart from traditional offerings. The ongoing presale, currently in its second stage, presents the chance to secure a stake in a project designed to deliver a 550x ROI. Act now and join the wave of early adopters who recognize FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) unique potential.

BNB & XLM Show Rally",https://thecoinrise.com/with-a-us-based-sponsorship-incoming-blockdags-presale-hits-317m-bnb-xlm-show-rally/,"The Binance Coin (BNB) price chart is climbing steadily with rising trading volume, suggesting that strong accumulation may be underway. At the same time, the Stellar (XLM) price surge has moved above resistance levels, signaling renewed focus on its role in cross-border payments. With both coins showing strength, attention is building, but where is the real potential? That brings us to BlockDAG (BDAG) , currently gaining serious attention as one of the top new cryptos before it officially lists. With over $317 million already secured, a completed audit, and 2 million users mining through its mobile X1 app, it’s working through a detailed six-week rollout strategy. As momentum continues through its US-based sponsorship and focused release roadmap, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a serious contender, potentially outshining some of the largest names in crypto. This presale period is becoming an important point to watch closely. Structured Launch Plan Shows BlockDAG’s Preparation BlockDAG isn’t just collecting funds, it’s putting them to work. The GO LIVE schedule outlines a clear six-week framework leading up to the exchange debut, with each week bringing key releases: presale wrap-up, mainnet setup, airdrops, DeFi tools, and launch of community apps. This structured planning shows BlockDAG as a rare project progressing on execution rather than speculation. Now halfway through its $600 million presale, BlockDAG has already deployed mainnet nodes, completed security checks via CertiK and Halborn, and activated its app with 2 million mobile users. With Batch 29 underway, those getting in now are still ahead of the launch. Early backers have already seen a 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. As the vesting contract prepares to release 40% of tokens, utility is coming online fast, even before trading begins. Plans for listing include appearances on over 20 exchanges, the launch of a DEX, lending system, launchpad, OTC desk, and cross-chain bridge. None of this is last-minute; it’s a calculated strategy for bringing usage and access from day one. The presale, currently offering a special limited-time price of $0.0020 (in Batch 29 priced at $0.0276), is drawing attention from new retail buyers daily. It will rise to $0.0030 in just 3 days. BlockDAG’s crypto presale now exceeds $317 million, showing strong momentum ahead of launch. BNB Price Chart Reflects Market Confidence The Binance Coin (BNB) price chart recently pushed beyond $700, peaking at $715 during the week before settling above $680. That level is holding strong, indicating support strength. Market watchers are tracking the $720 resistance mark, which could lead to another upward swing if buying interest continues. BNB’s chart behavior continues to respect critical technical levels during pullbacks. This has drawn consistent attention from retail and larger market participants alike. With its involvement in DeFi, staking, and launchpads, BNB serves as a central utility in the Binance network. Continued price strength could drive it past $720 and toward $750, putting it among the stronger large-cap options currently on the table. XLM Continues Rally After Breaking Resistance Stellar (XLM) has climbed back above $0.15, reaching its highest level in weeks. The bounce from just below $0.14 was met with strong buying, reinforcing that support zone. The upward trend has resumed with higher lows forming on the chart, suggesting a possible move toward the $0.17 mark. What’s fueling this rise? Interest in XLM’s use as a bridge between fiat and crypto has grown, especially around international payments. With real use cases gaining ground, the Stellar (XLM) price surge is more than a technical move; it reflects growing adoption. If adoption continues and new partnerships emerge, this strength could carry forward. XLM’s mix of short-term strength and practical use makes it worth watching. In a Nutshell! BNB has maintained a steady climb, holding support near $600 and possibly preparing for another push higher if key averages stay intact. Meanwhile, Stellar is pushing upward with confirmation above $0.15 and building momentum toward $0.17. For those following new projects closely, BNB and XLM stand out for both their chart patterns and practical roles in the crypto space. But BlockDAG deserves equal focus. Backed by $317 million in funding, a six-week GO LIVE strategy, and a limited-time $0.0020 offer, it’s already showing results long before listing. With 2 million users, early growth of 2,660% since Batch 1, and 20 exchange listings already revealed, BlockDAG is quickly turning early support into visible progress.

However, a new challenger has emerged, and analysts are starting to wonder if Ruvi AI (RUVI) could step up to the throne. Combining artificial intelligence and blockchain , Ruvi AI has captured attention with its structured growth strategy, real-world utility , and predictions of a 66x ROI . Thanks to a successful third-party audit and a presale that has raised significant funds, some believe Ruvi AI is a stronger bet than Avalanche for those seeking oversized gains. Why Analysts Say Ruvi AI Could Challenge Avalanche Avalanche established itself by solving blockchain scalability issues, drawing developers to its robust network. However, Ruvi AI builds on this scalability by integrating AI-powered applications that solve real-world problems across marketing , entertainment , and finance . While Avalanche focuses on its infrastructure, Ruvi AI’s versatility appeals to a broader user base, ensuring steady token demand. Ruvi AI also appeals to investors with its well-defined growth roadmap. During Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are priced at just $0.015 each , making early entry highly accessible. When the presale concludes, Ruvi AI will lock in a $0.07 price , providing early backers with an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts are already forecasting the token price to rise to $1 after listing , translating to an incredible 66x ROI for presale participants. Strong Presale Metrics Signal Investor Confidence Ruvi AI’s performance in the presale phase is paving the way for its future success. Here’s a snapshot of its achievements so far: $1.9 million raised , underscoring strong demand and market interest. Over 160 million tokens sold , proving that early adopters recognize its potential. More than 1,600 holders , forming a loyal and growing investor base. What sets Ruvi AI apart during its presale is the guaranteed post-presale valuation of $0.07 , offering a level of transparency uncommon in the volatile crypto market. This approach reduces the uncertainty often encountered in similar projects and makes Ruvi AI a safer bet. Enhance Returns with Ruvi AI’s VIP Levels Investors looking to maximize profits can take advantage of Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers , offering substantial bonuses depending on contribution levels. Here’s how they stack up: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for exponential growth, making Ruvi AI’s presale an attractive entry point for investors. Transparency and Security Solidify Ruvi AI’s Appeal Ruvi AI has already demonstrated its commitment to security and transparency, gaining investor trust through its successful third-party audit by CyberScope . This audit ensures that the platform is technologically sound and secure, alleviating concerns for potential backers. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity. Investors will be able to trade RUVI tokens as soon as they are listed on major exchanges, offering a seamless transition from presale involvement to open-market trading. Practical Applications Drive Demand for RUVI Tokens Unlike Avalanche, Ruvi AI doesn’t rely solely on its technical prowess. It actively solves problems across industries, ensuring long-term value for its users and token holders. Some standout applications include: Marketing: Businesses use Ruvi AI’s intelligent advertising solutions to optimize targeting, maximize ROI, and streamline campaign spend. Entertainment: Content creators enjoy blockchain-secured payments and AI-driven insights that enhance audience engagement and revenue. Finance: Institutions leverage Ruvi AI’s fraud detection capabilities, along with its scalable solutions for global financial systems, to boost transparency and efficiency. This diverse utility secures Ruvi AI’s relevance in multiple markets, making it a robust competitor to both Avalanche and other crypto giants. Is Ruvi AI Ready to Replace Avalanche? What makes Ruvi AI such a standout in the crypto world is its balanced focus on growth, innovation, and real-world problem-solving. From its $0.015 entry price to its forecasted $1 valuation , the token offers impressive returns while mitigating risk with a structured plan and transparent operations. Avalanche may have achieved great milestones, but Ruvi AI’s versatile approach and high ROI potential make it a game-changing contender. With $1.9 million raised , 160 million tokens sold , and partnerships with leaders like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is ready to leave a lasting mark on the cryptocurrency industry.

The duo used the USD-pegged stablecoin to smuggle funds raised from voice phishing scams overseas. USDT Money Laundering Ring: Defendants Jailed for Two Years The South Korean media outlet Financial News reported that the Criminal Division of the Seoul Eastern District Court’s Presiding Judge Lee Jeong-hyeong sentenced the duo to two years in prison each on June 22. The Seoul Eastern District Court, in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Pectus Solentis [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The defendants were identified as a college student surnamed Duong (23) and an unemployed individual surnamed Pham (also 23). The court found both individuals guilty of violating the Special Act on Prevention of Telecommunications and Financial Fraud and Refund of Damages. Prosecutors explained that Duong and Pham first made contact with the voice phishing scam ring in October last year. The ring recruited both via a Telegram open chat room. The ring’s organizers told Duong and Pham that they were to receive the proceeds of voice phishing scams in Korean won. The duo was then instructed to use this money to buy USDT, which they then sent to a crypto wallet held by a member of a voice phishing gang who was residing in Vietnam. The ring paid both Duong and Pham commission fees of 50,000 won ($36.44) to 100,000 won ($72.88) per 10 million won ($7,288) worth of USDT they sent. In a bold play to secure Korea’s position among the global AI elite, President Lee Jae Myung kicked off his term with a visit to the launch site of a mega-scale AI data center. #AIdatacenter https://t.co/gGHvfjNBvw — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) June 22, 2025 ‘Hash Sentence Inevitable,’ Judge Explains The court heard that the voice phishing ring succeeded in duping South Korea-based victims out of thousands of dollars’ worth of cash transfers. The ring’s employees called people pretending to be credit card delivery workers, insurance company employees, National Tax Service staffers, and even public prosecutors. They usually told potential victims that they were calling to check the safety of their bank accounts. The ring used a range of money laundering techniques, using other accomplices from Uzbekistan and Vietnam. The judge said that the court had not handed out a harsher sentence because neither of the defendants had criminal records in South Korea. But Lee added: “Even if the defendants did not orchestrate the crime, they must be severely punished. They played an essential role in the crime, acting as intermediaries. They have also not made any special efforts to help compensate the victims for the damages incurred.” USDT-related crime is on the rise in South Korea, as the coin’s popularity in the nation continues to grow. This year has seen a sharp rise in bogus USDT-themed over-the-counter deals and related thefts .

Now, a new contender, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is generating similar excitement among analysts and investors. Harnessing blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi AI aims to solve real-world problems while offering massive financial returns. Analysts forecast a potential 103x ROI in 2025 , positioning Ruvi AI as a possible successor to Binance Coin’s phenomenal rise. Why Ruvi AI Has the Potential to Rival Binance Coin Binance Coin achieved its meteoric rise through practical utility within the Binance ecosystem, driving consistent demand for the token. Ruvi AI takes a broader approach, creating AI-powered tools with applications in industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance. This focus on solving real-world challenges ensures long-term value and widespread adoption. Another standout factor is Ruvi AI’s structured growth plan. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are available for just $0.015 per token. Investors benefit from entering at this low price, with a guaranteed $0.07 valuation post-presale. This locks in an almost 5x ROI before the token is even listed on public exchanges. Analysts predict that RUVI could climb to $1 per token post-listing, delivering an impressive 103x ROI for early investors. Strong Presale Performance Sparks Enthusiasm Ruvi AI’s presale success highlights its growing traction among crypto investors. Here are some key milestones: Over $1.9 million raised , showcasing strong financial backing. More than 160 million tokens sold , reflecting robust investor demand. A growing community of 1,600+ holders , building a loyal base of early adopters. Ruvi AI’s commitment to transparency further sets it apart. Unlike speculative tokens, the presale guarantees a $0.07 valuation , offering clarity and reducing risk for early participants. Multiply Gains Through Ruvi AI’s VIP Investment Tiers Investors can further enhance their returns by leveraging Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers , which offer generous bonuses based on contribution levels. Take a look at the potential gains: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These opportunities underscore Ruvi AI’s long-term value, making investment at the presale stage highly lucrative. Security and Partnership Add Credibility Ruvi AI has gone to great lengths to ensure investor confidence. Its platform underwent a third-party audit by CyberScope, a trusted blockchain security firm. This confirmation of Ruvi AI’s secure infrastructure reassures investors of its reliability. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures post-presale liquidity. This means RUVI tokens will be immediately tradable upon listing, offering early investors easy access to their holdings and potential gains. Real-World Utility Drives Long-Term Success Unlike Binance Coin, which excels in its specific ecosystem, Ruvi AI delivers solutions across multiple industries. This scalability transforms RUVI from a niche token into a versatile one with real-world value. Key applications include: Marketing: Businesses use Ruvi AI’s tools to optimize campaign strategies, reduce costs, and maximize ROI with AI-driven insights. Entertainment: Content creators tap into blockchain-backed payments and AI personalization, fostering better audience engagement and increased revenue streams. Finance: Financial institutions rely on Ruvi AI for advanced fraud detection, streamlining operations, and modernizing their systems. This diverse applicability strengthens Ruvi AI’s long-term demand and positions it as a high-value asset in the crypto market. Why Ruvi AI Is Ready for a Binance Coin–Style Success Ruvi AI is proving itself to be more than just another token. With its low $0.015 presale price , locked-in $0.07 valuation , and market projections of $1 post-listing , the project offers a rare blend of affordability, transparency, and growth potential. With over $1.9 million raised , 160+ million tokens sold, and strategic partnerships with groups like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange, Ruvi AI has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike.

UNI is circling the $8 mark after a steady climb, and ETH is stuck below $2,750, waiting on momentum to break through. While these two settle into their ranges, a rising contender is pressing forward at full speed. BlockDAG isn’t in a test phase; it’s actively progressing. With over $317 million already secured, the limited-time offer is fueling daily presale demand. A 6-week launch plan is underway, with major events scheduled: a US-based sponsorship kicks off on June 20, X30/X100 miners begin shipping on July 7, and X10 shipments follow on August 15. Unlike many other projects, this rollout is fully structured, and all listings will happen only after the final presale batch is sold. BlockDAG (BDAG) is now ranked among the top crypto coins to grab before the window narrows. BlockDAG Locks $317M+ As Countdown and Deliverables Begin Rather than promising plans, BlockDAG has entered execution mode. A major rollout is happening, with miner deliveries confirmed and a high-visibility US-based sponsorship locked for June 20. Shipping of X30 and X100 units starts on July 7, while X10 units go out by August 15. What’s already driving attention is the $317 million raised so far, and the presale is now in its 29th batch. Currently priced at $0.0276, Batch 29 still offers a limited-time offer ahead of the $0.05 listing rate. Over 23.1 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, and early backers have seen their funds grow by 2,660% since batch 1. The roadmap confirms that only after all 45 batches are sold will the 20 exchange listings be triggered, including five Tier-1 platforms already secured. With this structure, demand builds naturally as urgency grows. This makes BlockDAG one of the strongest crypto coins to buy now, with real progress before listing. The smart vesting contract is active, 40% of presale coins unlock pre-launch, and with 2 million users mining via the X1 app, traction is solid. If you’ve waited for a project executing on every front, BlockDAG is matching that demand with delivery. This isn’t just another coin; it’s a full system moving toward its goals. Uniswap (UNI) Price Outlook: Can It Break $8? Uniswap (UNI) continues to draw attention, trading close to $7.15 with gains over the past week. Forecasts are now eyeing a move between $7.21 and $7.52, with many tracking the $7.52 resistance closely. Should that level be breached, UNI could see a rise toward $8.15, depending on how trading volume supports the push. Looking further ahead, July forecasts pin the average Uniswap (UNI) price target at around $8.93, with some models predicting $10.83 if strong sentiment holds. Projections into 2025 stretch as high as $11–$12. While Uniswap stays active in DeFi, focus is shifting as newer coins gain steam. For UNI to remain at the top of traders’ charts, it must break the range it’s been in and drive momentum. It’s currently seen as a cautious play with upside if momentum and volume align. Ethereum (ETH) Holds Support as Resistance Nears $2,750 ETH is staying within a narrow range between $2,490 and $2,550, showing some resilience as it defends this zone. Analysts continue to watch $2,750 as a key level; if cleared, it could point to a climb beyond $3,000. The current technical setup shows signs of a potential cup-and-handle formation, often associated with upward price action. Momentum tools like RSI show ETH has room to run, and long-term confidence is still growing. Big names like BlackRock and Fidelity are utilizing Ethereum for asset tokenization, and the DeFi sector remains active. The upcoming Pectra upgrade is set to reduce gas costs and increase speed, improving ETH’s position in the developer space. While not rallying yet, ETH appears poised for a potential upward breakout as it nears its next resistance test. Key Takeaways! UNI is sitting above $7, with near-term resistance at $7.52 and a potential July average price near $8.93. ETH is holding between $2,490 and $2,550, with a bullish breakout possible if $2,750 is surpassed. Meanwhile, BlockDAG has raised over $317M, is in Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, and has confirmed a June 20 US-based sponsorship plus July 7 miner shipments. Listings will begin only after the 45th batch is sold, and the project has already delivered 2,660% growth since batch 1.

In a post on the social media platform X, Aptos says that the state is looking to use either chain with Layer Zero infrastructure to deploy a potential stablecoin. “The Wyoming Stable Token Commission has placed Aptos as the highest-scoring blockchain candidate for WYST – the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US State – tying for 1st place with Solana. WYST will be deployed using Layer Zero… Aptos is making borderless, always-on finance a reality today with three native USD stablecoins & $30 billion+ in monthly stablecoin volume, supported by sub-second finality and near-zero transaction fees at [around] $0.00055. Following the recent passing of the GENIUS Act to establish the first regulatory framework for stablecoins and Aptos pushing further as the chain for stablecoins, the future of finance is here on Aptos.” Last year, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon said he would push for the adoption of a “transparent” stablecoin fully backed by the state’s short-term Treasury holdings. “One of the big things for me is to be able to bring back onshore a lot of our debt because if it’s bought by treasuries and supported by Treasurys, it will help to stabilize that market to a degree… [What] is clear to me is that digital assets are going to have a future. The United States has to address this issue. Washington’s being a little bit stodgy, which is why Wyoming, being a nimble and entrepreneurial state, can make a difference.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to reporting from Politico, both countries have been launching targeted cyberattacks in parallel with military action, and American officials are warning this digital warfare could soon hit the United States directly. The US military’s overnight airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites raised the risk of direct cyber retaliation against American infrastructure. Military and intelligence analysts say Iran’s next move could involve hacking into US electricity grids, water systems, or other critical networks. Alex Vatanka, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said bluntly that “cyber is one of the tools of Iran’s asymmetric warfare.” The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a public alert on Sunday warning that Iranian-affiliated hackers could target “poorly secured US networks and Internet-connected devices.” US officials say low-level pro-Iranian hacktivist attacks are likely, and more serious government-linked intrusions are possible. US defense and private sector on high alert for Iran-backed attacks General Dan Caine, who chairs the Joint Chiefs, confirmed to reporters on Sunday that US Cyber Command had supported the military strikes, though he didn’t provide further details. The Pentagon’s cyber branch gave no public comment, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also declined to respond when asked about its defensive posture. Behind the scenes, though, critical infrastructure groups last week warned American companies to get their defenses up fast. Jen Easterly, the former CISA Director, took to LinkedIn and posted that US infrastructure players should keep their “shields up” and expect “malicious cyber activity.” Jen reminded readers that Iran has a long history of cyber strikes on civilian targets, including water plants, financial systems, pipelines, and government websites. She didn’t confirm whether Israel’s recent airstrikes affected Iran’s cyber capacity, but she did say the threat remains serious. In 2023, an Iranian gang breached an Israeli hospital and leaked patient data. Not long after, an Israeli hacking group shut down large parts of Iran’s gas station network. Vatanka told reporters that Israel still holds the upper hand, saying , “The Iranians… are good, they are emerging, but I don’t think they’re at the level of the Israelis or Americans.” The Israeli-aligned hacking group Predatory Sparrow claimed responsibility for shutting down Iran’s Bank Sepah, which caused widespread customer problems. They later said they had drained $90 million from Nobitex, the country’s biggest crypto exchange. The group also dumped pieces of Nobitex’s source code on X, formerly Twitter. Iran responds with shutdowns, surveillance, and renewed espionage As cyberattacks hammered Iran’s digital infrastructure, its state broadcasters were also hijacked. Multiple videos showed anti-government messages popping up on Iranian state TV last week. That triggered a government-ordered internet blackout still in effect as of Sunday, aimed at blocking public access to the attacks. Vatanka said this showed Iran’s regime was trying to “gain control of the flow of information” and possibly prevent public unrest. Security officials inside Iran have started locking down their own tech use. Last week, senior Iranian personnel were told to ditch any internet-connected devices, especially phones, to limit exposure to more Israeli cyber disruptions. This came after reports that Israeli intelligence may have tracked down Hezbollah units in Lebanon using wireless signals from pager devices. Thousands of those pagers reportedly exploded, leaving many injured. One reason Israel’s cyberattacks worked so well is timing. Israeli forces launched the first blows—both in the air and online, giving them extra room to prep their defensive and offensive systems while Iran scrambled to catch up. Still, Iranian-backed groups aren’t done. Over the weekend, Israel’s National Cyber Directorate warned its citizens abroad not to fill out digital forms or click links on suspicious sites that may be harvesting personal data for intelligence. Gil Messing, chief of staff at Check Point Software, told reporters Saturday that cyber campaigns targeting Israel had recently “escalated a bit.” He didn’t mention any new damage but said there was a surge of disinformation on social media, including false texts about gas shortages and fake instructions telling people to avoid shelters. The Israeli civilian cyber defense agency also said Iran was trying again to break into internet-connected cameras for surveillance. That tactic is cheap, fast, and dangerous—and it’s hard to trace. Inside the US, the alarm bells are ringing again. John Hultquist, chief analyst for Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, posted on X that Iran’s cyber units often focus on “psychological purposes.” He added that his biggest fear right now is cyber espionage targeting US leaders. “I’m most concerned about cyber espionage against our leaders and surveillance aided by compromises in travel, hospitality, telecommunications, and other sectors where data could be used to identify and physically track persons of interest,” John wrote.

In a research note released Wednesday, FX strategists Oliver Levingston, Adarsh Sinha, and Janice Xue highlighted Australia’s fixed-income market as a likely hotspot for capital inflows amid ongoing global de-dollarization. “De-dollarization was a major theme on our trip to the United States and Canada, and we continue to highlight the significant impact small shifts in global fund managers’ asset allocations could have on the demand profile for AUD fixed income.” The note makes the case that Australia’s relatively small bond market could experience dramatic price swings if global investors keep fleeing U.S. dollar-denominated assets. Investors have been looking for more sound and undervalued alternatives as the greenback has lost its previously unassailable haven status, particularly after almost a year of political and economic tumult under President Donald Trump. Investors dump dollar amid Trump-era volatility The report directly attributes the trend to increasing global discomfort with U.S. financial stewardship. The re-emergence of Donald Trump on the political scene, along with a fresh wave of belligerent trade policies and what the bank calls “economic nationalism,” has only hastened investor diversification . Trump’s declaration of sweeping tariffs earlier this year, which markets dubbed “Liberation Day,” set off a global market selloff. Investors stampeded to pull out of U.S. markets, anxious about protracted uncertainty and trade isolationism. This “Sell America” movement was marked by heavy selling of Wall Street stocks, U.S. Treasurys, and even the dollar itself. The U.S. dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of leading currencies, has slid by about 9% year-to-date in 2025, its most significant decline in over 10 years. Investor conviction in the dollar is non-existent; as Bank of America’s June Global Fund Managers Survey showed, 86% of respondents believe the dollar will devalue in the coming 12 months , a new record low. The report found fund managers with less of a long-dollar bias than at any time in the past 20 years. Almost 20 percent of the 222 managers polled with $587 billion under management said that betting against the dollar was the most “crowded trade” globally. This loss of confidence has paved the way for other currencies, particularly those linked to stable economies rich in raw materials like Australia, to gain the favor of global reserve managers and institutional investors. Central banks boost demand for AUD bonds Now, Australia is feeling the consequences of that change in sentiment. Its 10-year government bond yield is about 4.24%, which is not that different from the U.S. equivalent of 4.43%. But Bank of America sees this gap widening in the years ahead. By late 2026, the bank predicts that Australian bonds will have a 75 basis point spread, which would entail stronger demand and higher prices. The note said that the demand outlook for AUD fixed-income assets appeared strong with support from Australia’s growing superannuation funds and the possibility of bank deregulation. One big reason is the rising demand for “peripheral dollar bloc assets,” consistently stable currencies in faraway lands from American politics, supported by strong local fundamentals. The proportion of official reserves in Australian dollars has doubled in the past ten years. The strategists estimate that a 1-percentage-point lift in global reserve demand would absorb 185% of the net supply of Australian sovereign bonds for the current fiscal year. Australia’s large pension funds have also been moving into the local bond market with increasing vigor. These superannuation funds are internationalizing their balance sheets, and the demand for AUD-denominated assets flows. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

As part of an industrial strategy for the decade 2025-2035, this move could benefit more than 7,000 businesses, according to the government. Britain will seek to slash the electricity bills of thousands of companies under a new industrial strategy to be published on Monday, June 23. This was after hearing calls from businesses to reduce high energy costs, which they argue hurt competitiveness and hinder growth. Britain’s new industrial strategy pledges massive development to the country’s economy Ramping up Britain’s sluggish growth has been a top priority for the government. However, lawmakers and business leaders had flagged the sky-high energy costs many companies already endure as a barrier to that ambition, with industry body Make UK urging the government to abandon climate levies placed on companies. To address this, Britain has been encouraged to do more to help its important industrial sectors. This will go a long way in improving its competitive edge as the United States and the European Union are also moving in that direction, in a trading world that the US President Donald Trump’s tariffs shook in recent months. Meanwhile, five sectoral strategies will be released alongside the plan, including advanced manufacturing, creative industries, and clean energy. The industrial strategy highlights eight key sectors where Britain excels, including defense and financial services. The government added that it would spare energy-intensive manufacturers from levies such as the renewables obligation to strengthen their international competitiveness . It also said that the energy measures would be paid for by transforming the energy system, not by ramping up household bills or taxes. Once they consult with stakeholders, they will fine-tune the details and eligibility of the program. Jonathan Reynolds, the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, commented on the topic of discussion. Reynolds highlighted that addressing energy costs and improving skills have been the top requests from businesses and their biggest challenge. Therefore, according to him, this government has taken note. Furthermore, Make UK described the industrial strategy as a “huge and necessary step forward,” addressing the skills gap in Britain’s workforce and access to funding. The Confederation of British Industry called it a “clear, positive message” that would lay a strong foundation for growth. This industrial strategy, Britain’s first in eight years, aims to increase the British Business Bank’s ability to invest in smaller companies and provide an additional 1.2 billion pounds, worth $1.61 billion annually, for skills development by 2028-2029. PM Sir Keir Starmer calls the new industrial strategy a “turning point” for the nation’s economy Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the industrial strategy is a “turning point” for Britain’s economy by backing key industries capable of growth. However, the Conservatives’ acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie, has criticized the strategy. According to Bowie, the UK needed a serious approach to energy policy that tackles the root cause of our high energy prices. He stated that it was amazing that “Labour” is finally recognizing that net-zero costs are so high that they need to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to help businesses pay their energy bills and prevent them from going bankrupt. Notably, UK manufacturers now face some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme would reduce costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027. In addition, around 500 energy-intensive companies, such as those in the steel industry, chemicals, and glassmaking, will see their network charges reduced. Interestingly, these companies are already receiving a 60% discount under the British Industry Supercharger scheme, which is set to rise to 90% after 2026. Monday’s announcement will also include moves to accelerate how long it can take to connect new factories and projects to the energy grid. The prime minister stated that the industrial strategy provides companies with the long-term certainty and direction they require to invest, innovate, and create good jobs that help people earn more money. It also seeks to help create over one million new well-paid jobs in the next ten years.

In a sea of sideways trading and bearish corrections, Mutuum Finance’s explosive presale momentum has placed it on the radar of crypto investors hunting for the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance, which cost only $0.03 in its presale, has already risen 200%, making it one of the hottest new crypto tokens this quarter. The project has already acquired over 12,300 investors who have chipped in $10.9 million while the presale is ongoing. Investors participating in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will enjoy a 100% return on investment when it goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance Changing the DeFi Lending Game Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing a new generation lending platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes lending simpler and trustless as borrowers can get lending through leveraging overcollateralized funds and lenders are rewarded through smart contracts. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools whose interest rates are floating. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. In the meantime, there are also the like of the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the user to agree on terms among themselves. That sort of setup of direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as those of meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Phase 5 of the Mutuum Finance Presale Is Underway, $10.9M+ Raised Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale became a record by raising over $10.9 million, attracting over 12,300 token holders. It is currently on Phase 5 investor confidence continues to grow as the platform distinguishes itself from short-term meme coins. Mutuum Finance Stablecoin and CertiK Audit In yet another step to further build its ecosystem Mutuum Finance is soon to launch a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins which have been challenged by price stability problems Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin is to be backed by real assets. The platform has also undergone a security audit by CertiK one of the most known names in blockchain security. Early Investors Benefit The project is also conducting a $100,000 giveaway where 10 people will be awarded a sum of $10,000 MUTM tokens. It is a huge incentive not only to the overall crypto community but also to the people who will be supporting the project in early phases. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) trends down toward $0.000010, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing major investor attention with a parabolic rise. Priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, MUTM has surged 200% since launch, raising over $10.9 million from more than 12,300 investors.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins the trading week, BTC is trading above $100,500 as the initial volatility from news over the weekend that the U.S. struck some of Iran's nuclear facilities begins to subside. While prices briefly dipped below six figures on Sunday in a risk-off reaction , markets have since stabilized. Equity futures are flat, and gold is up only marginally, suggesting that traders are not yet pricing in a broader escalation. The lack of follow-through in traditional markets may reflect expectations that Iran’s response will be contained or delayed, rather than immediate and destabilizing. Crude oil is holding its gains near $76 per barrel after spiking nearly 4% Sunday evening on fears that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a key chokepoint for global oil shipments. Still, commentary from U.S. officials and muted early-week trading suggest that investors remain in a wait-and-see mode. In crypto markets, altcoins that had mirrored BTC’s weekend drop, like ETH, XRP, and SOL, are also clawing back losses. For now, the market appears to be treating the U.S.-Iran clash as a geopolitical flashpoint, not a structural break. OKX Considering U.S. IPO: Report Crypto exchange OKX is considering a public listing in the U.S., according to a report from The Information . Earlier this year, the exchange announced a U.S. expansion after settling with the Department of Justice over accusations that it operated in the country without a money transmitter license. Among other crypto-linked companies, Bullish, a competitor to OKX and the parent company of CoinDesk, is also said to be considering an IPO given investors' appetite for companies with exposure to digital assets. OKX told CoinDesk it had no comment on the matter. Polymarket Bettors Less Certain About Second U.S. Strike on Iran Polymarket bettors are cooling to the idea that the U.S will hit Iran a second time before the end of the month. The 'yes' side of a contract asking if the U.S. will conduct another military action on Iran by June 30 is now trading at 54%, from 74% in the hours after the initial strike on Iranian nuclear sites. There appears to be a growing market belief that deconfliction – on both sides – is on the agenda, as evidenced by another contract asking bettors about the likelihood of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, which is currently trading at 49% down from 52% . Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin rebounded to $101,419 after a volatile 4.5% intraday swing, finding strong support at $99,000 amid geopolitical tensions and surging institutional buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. ETH: Ethereum fell 2.3% to $2,237 amid U.S.-Iran tensions, breaking a six-week consolidation pattern despite over $500 million in institutional accumulation. Gold: Bank of America analysts predict gold could hit $4,000 an ounce within a year, an 18% jump, driven less by geopolitical tensions and more by mounting U.S. fiscal debt and a global shift by central banks away from the dollar toward gold. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets fell Monday as the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites fueled oil price spikes and fears of broader Middle East escalation, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.56%.

Market conditions are moving quickly, but several projects are beginning to stand out. One is still in presale yet has over 2 million active users already. Others are gaining traction through protocol upgrades, market shifts, and new exchange activity. If you’re searching for the next highest-potential crypto, this guide highlights the top projects currently showing real progress. Each of these names has either recovered in price, revealed new features, or is preparing for a major update. These are not just temporary names getting attention, but projects backed by real use cases, growing adoption, or strong upcoming developments that could lift them in the near future. 1. BlockDAG: Rapid Presale Growth & Live User Activity BlockDAG is gaining momentum even before it launches on exchanges. The presale is now in Batch 29, priced at $0.0020 until June 24, with the next increase set at $0.0030. More than 23 billion BDAG coins have been sold so far, generating around $318 million. Early buyers have already seen returns of up to 2,670%, and the goal is a listing price of $0.05, offering close to a 25x rise. That has driven strong interest. A key differentiator for BlockDAG is the active user base, with over 2 million people already mining BDAG using the X1 mobile app. Physical mining devices are also in the rollout plan. The X30 and X100 units will be shipped in July, followed by the X10 in August. Listings are confirmed on major exchanges such as MEXC and BitMart once the presale ends. Halborn has completed its security audit, with CertiK still conducting reviews. Market-making and liquidity strategies are confirmed, meaning BDAG will enter with support in place. With the $600 million cap still open and a price jump locked in for June 24, BlockDAG clearly stands out as the next highest-potential crypto for those focused on real deployment and growth. 2. Cosmos: Ripple Collaboration and Steady Technical Support Cosmos (ATOM) has been under pressure this June, fluctuating between $3.74 and $4.00, facing resistance around $4.05. Despite market uncertainty, the project recently hosted its Sovereign EVM Day featuring Ripple, a move that may extend ATOM’s reach in DeFi. This opens the door to more users across different networks. On June 20, ATOM broke past $4.00 briefly before dipping, though it held above that mark. The platform completed a major software update earlier this month, which boosted its network reliability and improved cross-zone communication. Analysts now see the $4 area as an important support zone. If Cosmos climbs past $4.08, it may trigger further upside. Even though its recent movements are limited, ongoing improvements across the Cosmos ecosystem keep it listed among the next highest-potential crypto. 3. Render: Price Swings Create Breakout Setup Render (RNDR) experienced notable swings in June. After climbing to $8.45 on June 18 during a wave of interest in AI-linked projects, it dropped almost 14% shortly after. As of June 22, RNDR trades around $2.93. Though volatile, this range presents potential. Analysts are eyeing the $3.45–$3.65 region. A breakout from that area could lead to price targets at $4.19 and $5.70. Render is closely tied to AI stocks like Nvidia, which often drives parallel moves. On June 21, RNDR surged 8.3% to $10.25 in sync with a NASDAQ uptrend. However, on June 26, Coinbase will remove the Ethereum-based RNDR and switch to its Solana version. While this could reduce ETH-pair trading temporarily, it won’t affect the underlying project. If support levels hold after this transition, Render could be in a strong position to recover, making it a contender for the next highest-potential crypto. 4. Cronos: Recent Pullback and July Speed Upgrade Cronos (CRO) declined nearly 5% this past week, moving from $0.088 to about $0.0839 by June 22. However, this dip followed a breakout on June 18, when CRO briefly reached $0.0912. Experts see $0.084 as a key price level. If that area holds, another push toward the $0.094–$0.096 resistance band could follow. Cronos is preparing for a major update in July that will introduce sub-second transactions compatible with Ethereum. This would allow faster, cheaper dApp activity, which is attractive for developers. With expanding use in DeFi and GameFi and strong support from Crypto.com, Cronos may have more potential than is currently priced in. If the ongoing symmetrical triangle setup plays out, the price could revisit $0.13 or even rise to $0.26 in the months ahead. This retracement could turn out to be a smart entry point for those watching for the next highest-potential crypto. Choosing the Next Big Crypto Coin The crypto space is shifting again, but this time, attention is turning toward projects that are rolling out features, building communities, and planning real launches. BlockDAG leads this list with an active user base, audited security, and physical hardware already in motion. Cosmos and Cronos are showing signs of growth through integration and network upgrades, while Render offers recovery potential after its upcoming platform transition. These projects aren’t trending without cause. Each one is driven by important updates and real-world use cases. If you’re scanning the market for the next highest-potential crypto , these are the names that are not just showing movement but also setting up for the next major breakout.

That has triggered violent selloffs across every major market, from stocks to Bitcoin, from oil to the dollar and the euro. The world’s financial system is now reacting like it just got sucker punched. Its unlike anything we have ever seen. Oil was first to go wild. In the first trading session after the futures market opened, US crude rose $1.76, or 2.38%, to $75.60 per barrel. Brent crude climbed $1.80, or 2.34%, landing at $78.81. Brent even briefly touched $81, which was a 5.7% spike, before it slipped back. By press time, the price gains were gone. Oil was down 0.5%, which made no sense to anyone watching. Traders are now locked on Tehran, waiting to see what it does next. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, said Sunday that Iran reserves “ all options ” to defend its sovereignty. S&P Global Platts noted the price surge could reverse entirely if Iran chooses not to respond. Bitcoin dives, rebounds, then tanks again as ETF flows collapse The crypto market didn’t waste a second. Bitcoin had dropped to $98,000 on Sunday. That was its lowest point in over a month. Less than an hour later, it swung back above $102,000, before slipping again. At the time of writing, it sat at $100,879. The market was a disaster. More than $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in just 24 hours, and over 95% were long bets. Source: TradingView Things got uglier when inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs dried up. Between Monday and Wednesday, $1.04 billion had gone in, based on CoinGlass data. But by Thursday, that number was flat. On Friday, just $6.4 million came in. That was the same day President Donald Trump left the G7 early and announced a two-week review of US options on Iran. The assumption that Bitcoin would act like a safe haven collapsed. It started trading like a risky tech stock instead. Kaiko, a crypto data provider, said Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq had surged quite fast in recent weeks. Stock indexes bleed across Asia, Europe, and US futures Futures tied to US stocks also started dropping. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4%. Asian markets opened deep in the red too. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 0.56%, and the Topix fell 0.49%. The worst-hit companies were all in tech: Screen Holdings crashed 4.78%, Lasertec Corp sank 4.31%, and Disco Corp went down 3.38%. Big names like Advantest and Softbank didn’t escape either, falling 1.66% and 0.76%. It was the same story in South Korea. The Kospi index lost 1.05%. The Kosdaq, which includes smaller-cap companies, got hit even harder, down 1.78%. The country’s top automakers took the brunt. Hyundai Motor shares dropped 4.05%, and Kia Corp fell 4.15%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also took a dive, down 0.76%. In Hong Kong, futures for the Hang Seng Index pointed to more losses. They stood at 23,396, well below the index’s last close of 23,530.48, suggesting more downside ahead. Japanese carmakers had no luck either. As of press time, Nissan Motor dropped 2.22%, and Mazda Motor was down 2.17%. Mitsubishi Motors lost 1.87%, Honda Motor slid 1.55%, and Toyota dropped 1.36%. Over in Europe, markets weren’t much better. The IBEX 35 rose 0.77%, closing at 13,850.3, and Germany’s DAX jumped 1.27% to 23,350.55. But the FTSE in London dropped 0.2% to 8,774.65, and France’s CAC 40 was completely flat at 7,589.66. The STOXX600, a broader European index, barely moved, up just 0.13% to 536.53. And the euro was trading at $1.15 against the dollar after going as high as $1.8 just an hour ago.

It all started when a user named Altcoin Bale posted on X (formerly Twitter), claiming: “BREAKING: SEC v XRP final decision could be delayed until late 2026” The post quickly grabbed attention, but many XRP supporters in the comment section disagreed, calling it misleading. So, what’s the truth? Here’s what’s actually happening: As part of the ongoing case, both Ripple and the U.S. SEC recently requested the court to keep the appeals process on hold for now. The SEC has been asked to submit a status update by August 15, 2025 — but that doesn’t mean the final decision will take until 2026. Ripple also filed a supplemental letter supporting a legal request called a Motion for an Indicative Ruling . However, legal expert Marc Fagel commented that this latest letter doesn’t really add anything new. He said it seems like Ripple just wanted to reassure its supporters after some people on Crypto Twitter expressed doubts. Fagel added that predicting the judge’s next move is difficult, as this situation is quite unique. If the judge rejects the motion, Ripple will have to decide whether it wants to continue its appeal or settle. Legal expert Bill Morgan also weighed in and called it an ‘improbable outcome.’ He said, “This is not on the cards unless Judge Torres rules against the latest joint motion and rather that make the common sense decision to live with the summary judgement decision and the current penalty and permanent injunction, the settlement process breaks down completely and both parties run their appeals.” Conclusion: There’s no official information suggesting that the Ripple vs. SEC case will be delayed till 2026.

In a televised address , Sánchez argued that such a spending level would be “unnecessary and disproportionate.” Earlier on Sunday, diplomats said NATO’s 32 member states had agreed on a summit statement setting a 5% of GDP target for annual defense and security spending by 2035, despite Spain’s objections. Sanchez had informed NATO chief Mark Rutte of his country’s desire to opt out of a new 5% spending target in a letter sent Thursday, June 19. The letter expressed worries that Spain might disrupt the entire summit. According to Sanchez, they completely understand that other countries want to boost their defense spending, but they will not do that. This statement was made after he noted that Spain can fulfill all its NATO commitments for personnel or equipment by only spending 2.1% of its GDP. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Spain spent about 1.28% of its GDP on defense last year, which was the lowest amount in the alliance, according to NATO estimates. In April, Sanchez agreed to speed up efforts to reach NATO’s goal of 2% this year. NATO has not yet made the compromise summit text public. It will only be official once the leaders of NATO’s 32 member countries approve it at the summit. However, diplomats mentioned that changing the wording from “we commit” to “allies commit” helped Spain argue that the promise does not apply to every member. President Trump increases defense spending to 5% for NATO members US President Donald Trump demanded a big increase in NATO’s defense spending target of 5% of gross domestic product. This was after NATO chief Mark Rutte suggested the target be reached by increasing NATO’s key target for defense spending from 2% to 3.5% of GDP, while spending an additional 1.5% on related areas such as cyber security and modifying roads and bridges for military vehicles. NATO officials argue that substantial hikes in defense spending are needed to meet the increasing threat from Russia and permit Europe to assume more responsibility for its security, as the United States shifts its strategic focus to China. Sanchez maintains his decision despite Trump’s threats When Sanchez announced that Spain would not comply with the new defense spending target, he risked provoking Trump. Earlier, the president repeatedly emphasized that European countries fall short of their defense budget target. Trump said he would not defend them if they failed to reach this target. In addition, Trump warned Spain on Friday, June 20, that they must meet their target, pointing out that Madrid is notorious for its low defense spending. However, according to him, this would not apply to the US because it had paid a large amount of money over a long period. In 2024, NATO says that Washington devoted approximately 3.19% of its GDP to defense. Still, Sanchez said Spain did not have to achieve the new target and that trying to do so would result in drastic cuts in spending on social services such as state pensions or tax rises.

This decline, which saw the Bitcoin price drop approximately 4% to around $99,300, coincided with a broader market sell-off, with Ethereum (ETH) experiencing an even sharper decline of nearly 10%. Overall, the total cryptocurrency market took a significant hit, falling about 7% in just 24 hours. Geopolitical Unrest And Tariff Troubles The timing of this downturn was particularly notable, occurring just hours after the US targeted three key nuclear sites in Iran. Tensions had escalated following a United Nations report that indicated Iran was not adhering to international prohibitions against developing a military nuclear program. In response to these revelations, Israel conducted strikes against Iran, leading to further retaliation from the Islamic Republic. On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared on social media: This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU! Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure – Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 This recent plummet below the psychologically significant $100,000 threshold follows a year of substantial gains for Bitcoin. After Trump took office in January, Bitcoin reached all-time highs above $100,000 in February, buoyed by executive orders aimed at supporting the cryptocurrency sector. However, the cryptocurrency’s price soon mirrored the broader declines in financial markets, particularly after Trump announced severe tariffs in April, which saw Bitcoin fall to nearly $75,000, its lowest point in 2025. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin had seen a resurgence, particularly in May when it reached new highs as Wall Street investors returned to the cryptocurrency through US exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, by late Sunday, there were signs of recovery, with Bitcoin trading approximately at $101,300, down only 1% over the previous day, while ETH managed to pare its losses to around $2,200. Forced Liquidations Exacerbate Bitcoin Sell-Off According to CNBC, Iran has also threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping route responsible for approximately 20% of the global oil supply, further adding to the broader financial uncertainty. JPMorgan warned that such a blockade could drive oil prices up to $130 per barrel, which would have significant implications for US inflation, potentially pushing it back toward 5%—a level not seen since March 2023. While Bitcoin has often been promoted as an inflation hedge, its recent behavior aligns more closely with that of high-beta tech stocks. Data from crypto provider Kaiko indicates that Bitcoin’s correlation with the tech-heavy Nasdaq has increased sharply in recent weeks, particularly following the surge in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: $312M ETH Transfer Triggers Sell-Off Fears As Ethereum Price Crashes Below Support Institutional investment patterns have also shifted. More than $1.04 billion flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs from Monday to Wednesday last week, but this momentum dissipated as the weekend approached, with minimal net movement on Thursday and only $6.4 million on Friday. The technical aspects of the market further exacerbated the sell-off. Research from CoinGlass revealed that Bitcoin’s drop below $99,000 triggered forced liquidations across offshore derivatives platforms, including Binance and Bybit. During this period, over $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated within 24 hours, with more than 95% of these coming from long positions, highlighting the market’s overexposure.

The plans to go public come months after the firm reentered the US marketplace in April, underscoring a renewed dedication to global expansion and regulatory compliance. Crypto journalist Yueqi Yang revealed the news, which matches the broader trend of cryptocurrency companies indirectly venturing into traditional finance (TradiFi) – through stocks – as investor interest in digital current exposure increases. Yueqi Yang @Yueqi_Yang · Follow OKX, one of the top three global crypto exchanges, will consider an IPO in the U.S., after relaunching in the U.S. in April. From IPOs to crypto treasury stocks, crypto is booming right now, but the rally is playing out in the stock market, at valuations that even surprised 1:25 AM · Jun 23, 2025 77 Reply Copy link Read 12 replies OKX’s strategic reentry to the US The exchange had previously scaled back its operations in America due to regulatory hurdles. However, OKX relaunched in the US in April 2025 after key restructuring and alignment with compliance policies, which included paying $500 million in fines. The strategic return opens the gates to one of the largest cryptocurrency user bases globally. Moreover, a public listing positions OKX as a top competitor for institutional trust in the digital assets industry. The enhanced regulatory clarity under the Trump administration sets a lucrative environment for OKX’s public debut. The IPO speculation comes as crypto-related equities flourish. BlackRock has become one of the top Bitcoin holders, now owning over 3% of all BTC in circulation through ETFs. Also, public firms like Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Coinbase are experiencing tremendous crypto-linked growths. Stablecoin issuer Circle saw its shares gain over 400% after an IPO , while Animoca Brands is considering listing in the US due to Trump’s pro-crypto laws. These trends have flooded Wall Street with capital hunting crypto’s upside potential – without directly holding actual tokens. OKX looks to ride this momentum with its potential IPO to offer enthusiasts an equity-based and regulated opportunity to capitalize on the booming crypto market. The exchange’s deep liquidity, expanding product offerings, and massive user base position OKX as a top option for institutional portfolios. Most importantly, an IPO will likely enhance OKX’s governance, global legitimacy, and transparency, especially as CEXs witness increased scrutiny. Besides enriching OKX’s company profile, an IPO may change the market outlook on exchanges from speculative platforms to authentic financial institutions.

Analysts half-expect things to get worse today, according to a report from CNBC, warning that the entire global oil market and economy is at risks never seen before if Tehran responds militarily as promised. Iran’s foreign minister said the country has “all options” on the table to defend its sovereignty. As of early Asian trading hours, US WTI crude jumped more than 2% to $75.22 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent crude pushed nearly 2% higher to $78.53. Iran’s threat to shut Strait of Hormuz triggers new panic Lawmakers in Tehran have approved a proposal to shut the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway that carries almost 20% of global oil supply. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said, “This time feels different, given the barrage of missiles that have been fired for over a week and now the direct involvement of the USA.” Iran’s decision to respond militarily, or even just harass shipping in the strait, could send prices sharply higher. Saul Kavonic, senior energy analyst at MST Marquee, told CNBC that “even a degree of harassment” of tankers in that region could push oil to nearly $100 per barrel. A full closure that lasts several weeks would trigger Western military action to reopen the strait, he said. The real concern is that a prolonged event would take supply off the market, fast. Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, agreed that a military response by Iran could go far beyond just naval threats. If Iran targets energy facilities in the Gulf or directly hits LNG and oil infrastructure, prices won’t stop at $100. “A prolonged closure or destruction of key Gulf energy infrastructure could propel crude prices to above $100,” Bob said. He warned that if Iran used all its military options, the conflict could last “longer than the last two Gulf Wars.” Goldman Sachs expects brief oil surge if flows get hit Meanwhile analysts at Goldman Sachs also said the fallout from the US strikes on Iran has raised the chances of a serious energy supply crunch. In a note led by Daan Struyven, the analysts said if flows through the Strait of Hormuz drop by 50% for just a month, and stay down by 10% for nearly a year, Brent crude could briefly hit $110 per barrel. If Iran’s oil exports fall by 1.75 million barrels per day, prices could touch $90. That’s the bank’s projection, even though they still think full-on supply cuts are unlikely. Goldman said both the US and China would have strong incentives to prevent that kind of sustained disruption. But they admitted, “the downside risks to energy supply and the upside risk to our energy price forecasts have risen.” That’s Wall Street code for: be ready for higher prices. The impact wouldn’t be limited to oil either. European natural gas markets are also in danger. Goldman warned that TTF futures could jump to €74 per megawatt-hour, or around $25 per million BTUs. That’s close to the levels that crushed demand during the 2022 energy crisis. If the disruption drags on, prices could spike to €100. Vandana Hari, CEO of Vanda Insights, said most traders are still sitting on their hands, watching for the next move from Iran. “The picture is a little bit mixed, and I think traders will err on the side of caution, not panicking unless there is more real evidence to do,” Vandana said. But nobody’s ignoring what’s happening. The Strait of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, is one of the most important arteries in the global energy system. A real closure, or even the threat of one, means delays in shipments, panic buying, and a surge in volatility. The global oil market just entered a dangerous new phase, and the next move belongs to Iran. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The average purchase price was approximately $106,408 per Bitcoin. The leading cryptocurrency has dropped over 4% in the last week, now trading at just above $101,000. With this latest acquisition, the company now holds 11,111 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at over $1.07 billion. The average cost basis stands at $95,869 per coin. Metaplanet shares traded down 3.5% today. This marks a major milestone in Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which began mid-2024 and accelerated through early 2025. Metaplanet’s total stash has grown nearly 28-fold since December 2024. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,111 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 11,111 BTC* pic.twitter.com/7ceEeSh1X4 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Metaplanet Reports Quarter to Date BTC Yield of 107.9% Metaplanet reports a quarter-to-date BTC yield of 107.9%, up from 95.6% in Q1 and 309.8% in Q4 2024. The metric, which the firm uses as a key performance indicator, tracks Bitcoin per fully diluted share over time, excluding the effects of dilution. The firm also posted a BTC gain of 4,367 BTC for $451.2 million for the ongoing quarter, based on reference prices from Bitflyer. The company has funded its Bitcoin purchases through a series of capital market activities, including multiple zero-coupon bond issuances and equity-based instruments. Since January, Metaplanet has issued and redeemed more than a dozen series of ordinary bonds and stock acquisition rights, largely subscribed by EVO FUND . Over 210 million shares have been issued under its “210 Million Plan.” Metaplanet Wants to Buy 210,000 BTC by 2027 Often dubbed as Japan’s Strategy, the company aims to buy 210,000 Bitcoins by the end 2027. Between May and June 2025 alone, Metaplanet raised over $300 million through bonds and exercised stock rights, with proceeds explicitly allocated for Bitcoin accumulation. The company formalized Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business line in December 2024, a pivot from its hotel management business. Since then, it has disclosed regular updates on its BTC position, including total holdings, cost basis, and share dilution metrics. As of June 23, Metaplanet’s fully diluted share count stood at 759 million, with Bitcoin per 1,000 fully diluted shares reaching 0.0146 BTC. The company has not indicated a halt or slowdown in its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. It continues to use capital raised through financial instruments to increase exposure to the digital asset, in line with its stated goal of enhancing shareholder value through BTC accumulation.

Rising global tensions and economic worries have shaken the market, causing altcoins to tumble too. But while most coins are stuck in a quiet phase, a few altcoins are quietly preparing for a strong comeback. Here are top discounted altcoins to buy during the market crash: XRP (XRP) XRP is currently trading at $2.02, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours. The current trend is bearish, but XRP could bounce back in July, with prices expected to range between $1.91 and $2.22. While it dropped over 12% this month, July could bring a rebound as analysts see a possible 10% rise if prices rise as expected. Stellar (XLM) Stellar is currently trading at $0.2303, down 2.6%. Stellar has dropped nearly 20% in June, showing bearish sentiment. However, July looks promising, and it could see a rebound with prices ranging from $0.26 to $0.28, a 23% gain from current levels. The RSI has dropped to 27.8, showing XLM is oversold, often a sign of an upcoming bounce. While most moving averages still point down, some momentum indicators are starting to turn positive. Sui (SUI) Sui is currently trading at $2.49, down 2.5% in the past day. Technical indicators are mostly bearish, but we could see a bounce if buying interest returns. With strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential, this dip could offer an opportunity, if the momentum shifts. SUI has lost over 30% this month and could continue to dip towards $1.97. However, analysts expect a rebound in July with targets ranging from $1.84 to $2.02. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.1523, down 1.3% in the past day. Dogecoin dropped over 33% in June, with bearish sentiment still lingering. But analysts expect a rebound to around $0.17 in July, a 19% gain from current levels. Dogecoin’s 2025 outlook remains cautiously bullish. If the market picks up and utility grows, DOGE could climb back to $0.30–$0.40, and could also retest its all-time high near $0.70. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is currently trading at $0.5463. Cardano started June with a bounce from $0.51 but remains range-bound between $0.65 and $0.70. Holding above $0.60 could trigger a bullish breakout, with targets up to $1.43. But if it fails, a drop to $0.50 is likely. Over the next 12 days, a move above $0.72 could push ADA up 15–18%, particularly if market sentiment improves.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|DOGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 03:59:44

The move would mark a sharp turnaround for the Seychelles-registered exchange, which exited the US market after a series of regulatory violations. In February, OKX agreed to pay over $504m in penalties to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice. OKX, one of the top three global crypto exchanges, will consider an IPO in the U.S., after relaunching in the U.S. in April. From IPOs to crypto treasury stocks, crypto is booming right now, but the rally is playing out in the stock market, at valuations that even surprised… — Yueqi Yang (@Yueqi_Yang) June 22, 2025 OKX Makes a Big Return to US Markets Prosecutors said the company operated an unlicensed money-transmitting business and failed to implement basic anti-money laundering controls. Between 2017 and its exit, OKX allegedly processed more than $1 trillion in trades for US users despite policies suggesting otherwise. Just two months later, OKX announced its return to the US market. The company set up a regional headquarters in San Jose, California, and tapped Roshan Robert, a former executive at Morgan Stanley and Barclays, as its US CEO. At the time, Robert said the firm’s re-entry reflected “a commitment to responsible growth” and added that OKX was working closely with regulators to stay compliant. The exchange has been working to rebuild its reputation, particularly in the eyes of US regulators. Its leadership has framed the relaunch not as a relabeling effort, but as a strategic reset focused on transparency and adherence to evolving US crypto laws. IPO Plans Signal Ambition, but Regulatory Hurdles Still Loom A listing on a US stock exchange would mark a big shift for OKX, potentially opening the door to greater institutional trust and a broader investor base. The company has not yet filed paperwork with the SEC, and the timeline remains unclear. OKX is not alone in exploring a public offering. Bullish , backed by investor Peter Thiel, and Gemini , founded by the Winklevoss twins, have both confidentially filed for IPOs in recent months. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuer Circle recently closed an oversubscribed listing valuing it at nearly $8.1b on a fully diluted basis. However, regulatory scrutiny continues to shadow OKX. In May, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission said it planned to shut down certain exchanges, including OKX, for operating without a license. If OKX proceeds with a US IPO, it will gauge investor interest while also revealing how much leeway regulators are willing to give crypto firms after past violations.

This new cryptocurrency, now in phase 5 of its presale, has raised $10,900,000 and sold over 560 million tokens, attracting 12,300 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers 100% returns on the price of launching at $0.06, making it a solid lending protocol in the decentralized finance field. And is it possible to achieve the same astronomical growth of Ripple (XRP) that happened in 2017, when the XRP increased its value 18x, to 3.84 dollars? XRP’s Historic Surge Ripple’s XRP electrified the crypto market in 2017. Starting at a modest $0.006 in January, it climbed steadily. By April, XRP reached $0.05, gaining traction among crypto enthusiasts. May saw it hit $0.25, fueled by a booming market. The real fireworks came in December, when XRP skyrocketed to $3.84 by January 2018. This translated to a staggering 63,900% return from its yearly low. Such growth showcased XRP’s ability to capitalize on market fervor. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to harness similar momentum with its innovative lending model, positioning it as a top crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting investor interest in phase 5 of its 11-phase presale. Priced at $0.03, the token has surged 200% from its phase 1 price of $0.01. With over 40% of phase 5 filled, the window to secure tokens at this level is closing fast. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, reducing potential gains. Investors buying now are guaranteed a 100% return at the $0.06 launch price. Moreover, analysts project a $3 post-launch value, suggesting a 9,900% return. This makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout crypto investment. Innovative Lending Platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is breaking the charts of decentralized finance with dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract system allows one to deposit their stablecoins into smart-contract pools and earn interest passively in dynamically changing rates. The Peer-to-Peer model is associated with direct lending, which makes it more transparent and allows users to control it. The app is based on Ethereum and has a Layer- 2 implementation, which guarantees cheap and speedy transactions. The team recently completed a Certik audit, scoring an impressive 80.00 for security with no vulnerabilities found. Furthermore, active monitoring and strong social media engagement bolster its reliability. This robust setup positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to invest in. Community Rewards and Incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fostering community engagement with exciting initiatives. A $100,000 giveaway is underway, splitting $10,000 in MUTM tokens among 10 winners. Participation requires a $50 presale investment and completing simple tasks like submitting a wallet address. Additionally, the team launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, who will receive bonus tokens for maintaining their rankings. These efforts strengthen investor trust and drive demand. As the crypto market evolves, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for its practical utility and community focus, making it a compelling crypto investment for 2025. Chasing Ripple’s Legacy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to challenge Ripple’s 2017 success story. While XRP leveraged market enthusiasm, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines affordability with cutting-edge DeFi solutions. Its $0.03 presale price offers a low entry point, unlike XRP’s post-rally highs. Analysts predict a $3 valuation post-launch, driven by its lending platform and stablecoin integration. With a guaranteed 100% return at launch and potential for exponential growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a top crypto to buy now. Don’t miss this opportunity—join the presale and explore its potential in the crypto market today.

Many believe it could stage another 10,000% rally—but not anytime soon. While analysts suggest that SHIB could repeat its explosive growth by 2030, a new meme coin is emerging that could potentially disrupt that timeline. Welcome to Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —the meme coin that won’t wait for 2030 to make millionaires. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Sluggish Climb Ahead? SHIB’s June 2025 chart reveals a market in consolidation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 35.72, hinting at potential upside, but trading volume tells a different story. With just $153.4 million exchanged in the last 24 hours—a 33.2% drop—SHIB is showing signs of fatigue. The token dipped 1.44% recently to $0.00001170, weighed down by weak short-term sentiment and uninspiring burn activity. Only 19 million tokens were burned in a 24-hour period—insufficient to trigger meaningful deflationary momentum. That’s not to say SHIB lacks long-term potential. But that rally might take years, possibly unfolding slowly between now and 2030. The Meme Coin Set For Massive Rally While SHIB consolidates and plays the long game, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is engineering a high-speed shortcut to meme coin dominance. More than just a meme token, LILPEPE is a Layer 2 blockchain purpose-built for speed, ultra-low fees, and rock-solid security—all powered by the viral force of memes. In just its first two presale stages, Little Pepe raised $1,325,000. It has now moved into Stage 3, where tokens are available at just $0.0012—a price point that’s attracting savvy early adopters like a magnet. With 1 billion tokens allocated for this stage, the presale aims to raise another $1.2 million, and based on current momentum, it may sell out in record time. This early-stage surge confirms one thing: top crypto investors see in LILPEPE what they saw in SHIB back in its infancy—but with far less waiting. LILPEPE Could Rally 10,000% Before 2026 Where Shiba Inu may take five more years to revisit its peak, Little Pepe could achieve a 10,000% rally before the end of 2025. That prediction comes from seasoned analysts tracking emerging meme coins with real tech and tokenomics behind them. LILPEPE isn’t just a meme—it’s an ecosystem. Its tokenomics reflect a mature, forward-thinking design: 26.5% of the 100 billion total supply is allocated to the presale. 10% goes to liquidity to ensure smooth trading on decentralized exchanges. 30% is set aside as chain reserves for sustainability. 10% is allocated for decentralized exchange (DEX) listings. 10% is earmarked for aggressive marketing to fuel brand growth. 13.5% supports staking and community rewards. 0% tax, ensuring fairness and appeal for all investors.

One of the biggest losers in the recent slide was XRP, which is down over 7% in the past month. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is down over 8% in the past week. The main trigger for this decline in the crypto market is rising military tensions in the Middle East. Trump’s recent threat to escalate tensions with Iran into military conflict has also been a major contributing factor. However, Bitcoin has shown its resilience, remaining above $104,000 since the conflict began. Amid this depressed performance of XRP and ADA, investors are looking for new opportunities for growth. One of the most exciting prospects in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which could be one of the biggest gainers of 2025. On-chain data shows that whales are quietly shifting capital into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in anticipation of the coming surge once things cool down in the Middle East. So far, investors in the project’s presale have raised over $10.95 million in the ongoing presale. A major factor for the optimism in the market is the recent passing of the GENIUS Act in the US Senate. The bill will provide regulatory clarity in the crypto sector and is expected to spur massive growth in the coming years. It could also increase enterprise adoption, leading to a flood of institutional capital into the crypto sector. To position yourself for the expected flood of capital, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect option. A deep dive into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector that is built for utility and scalability. The project is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders or borrowers. As lenders, they can deposit their assets in the protocol’s pools to earn interest. The interest payments they receive are based on the pool utilization rate. To determine the pool utilization rate, the pool measures the amount of assets being actively borrowed from a pool compared to the total amount of assets in that pool. As the utilization rate rises, and thus the interest rate, it pushes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it encourages lenders to deposit more liquidity in the pools to benefit from the rising yields. The result is that liquidity in the pools increases, which lowers the interest rates, creating a self-sustaining loop that ensures optimal capital utilization. To protect liquidity in the pools, all loans must be overcollateralized. That means that a borrower deposits collateral that is worth more than the value of the assets they acquire. If a loan falls below a set level of collateralization, liquidators step in and acquire the debt at a discount. This discount can be adjusted upwards to ensure speed liquidations. An internal stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a stablecoin that will be based on the blockchain and pegged to the value of the USD. To mint stablecoins, users of the protocol will need to deposit collateral that is over-collateralized. The main difference between Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin and other decentralized stablecoins is that it will allow multi-asset collateralization. That means a user will be able to back a single position with a basket of assets. They will also be allowed to top up their collateral to ensure the position remains collateralized. Best of all, they will earn interest from assets used as collateral for the stablecoin. This interest will go towards the interest payments for their stablecoin position, lowering their rates. The MUTM token presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 per token. So far, investors in the presale have raised over $10.95 million, with the figures rising daily as new investors rush to secure their tokens. The current token price in phase is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. That will reduce the guaranteed ROI from the current 100% to 71.43%. Many investors understand this metric, which has led to a surge of interest in the presale. So far, 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, barely two weeks after they launched. Summary Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a CertiK-audited presale project that is built on utility. That means it will continue to deliver value for its community long after it launches. Unlike meme coins, which run purely on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will never run out of steam. At the current price of $0.03 per token, you are getting your tokens at a 50% discount to the planned listing price of $0.06. This could be a life-changing opportunity, with analysts forecasting that the price of MUTM tokens could rise 2,100% after the tokens go live.

Solana is hovering under $150 despite strong DeFi inflows and growing ETF hype. A breakout above this level would catapult it toward $160. However if the altcoin slips below $145, $120 could be in the cards. But for those feeling the FOMO heading into summer the real buzz is around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a new crypto coin under $1 that’s generating viral attention for its explosive potential and ticking momentum indicators. Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the fifth phase of its presale. Early price predictions show the token will reach $2 after launch and $10 ATH by 2026. Stage 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed profit of 100% ROI at launch. If you’re searching for what to buy before June ends both Solana and Mutuum Finance offer better plays blue-chip stability paired with high-conviction rocket fuel. Solana price holds below $150 as momentum builds Solana (SOL) has seen price back towards a level of $148, after a brief pullback off of a high of almost $160 made back in early June. It is in the wake of interest in altcoins that has structurally strengthened as major rallies approach towards such going forward. The amount of on-chain activity has been high and the DeFi ecosystem in Solana has continued to expand with the total value locked (TVL) going above 4.8 billion, its highest since 2022. The present tendency of SOL to retest previous resistance as support fits that pattern of breakouts in small cap assets. In this regard, although Solana is a high-liquidity rally participant, recently unveiled lower-price tokens with increased volatility and upside are born, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Presale frenzy peaks, Mutuum Finance hits $11 million raised Mutuum Finance is running wild in popularity. With its trailblazing two-way lending model, this DeFi behemoth has already attracted more than 12,300 investors and raised $11 million, and it’s not slowing down. The Mutuum Finance token price will jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, a 16.67% increase, so investors who come aboard here are in for massive gains. Early bird investors are locking profits. Mutuum Finance lending: smarter, simpler, decentralized Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, offering users stable returns from USDT pools via the P2C framework and full ownership of direct crypto transfer via the P2P framework. Mutuum Finance’s USD-pegged stablecoin Mutuum Finance’s upcoming overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability while avoiding flaws found in algorithmic stablecoins. While the project is already certified by CertiK, Mutuum Finance is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and investors who pay attention at this point might benefit the most in the future. On top of that, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will each receive $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens. Solana (SOL) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging as two of the most compelling sub‑$1 altcoin plays heading into the summer 2025 rally. But Mutuum Finance is where the real breakout energy lies, still just $0.03, up to $11 million raised, and over 12,300 early investors locked in. With a unique two-way lending system, a stablecoin launch, and a 100% ROI already baked in at listing, MUTM is positioned as the highest-upside DeFi coin to buy now before its next price jump.

By contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading under $0.05 in its presale, is standing out. The project has already raised over $11 million in presale and 12,300 early supporters have already joined the campaign. MUTM’s tokenomics and DeFi lending model are fueling forecasts of a potential leap to $5 post-launch, making it a rare new cryptocurrency worth close attention in today’s market. Cardano price action Cardano (ADA) is now priced around $0.60, slightly above a major support level of $0.588 to $0.615. The wider resistance is at the level of $0.65-$0.70 where several rejections have been witnessed though the MACD and RSI indicators show signs of bearish or neutral momentum. Analyst projections are now mixed. On the one hand there is the group that predicts ADA to range between $0.60-$0.77 in the summer months and on the other are those that predict bullish upsides of $0.95-$1.00 by December, but such a route would require a clear breakout price above $0.66-$0.70. It is on this backdrop that a crypto is crawling onto crypto talks, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance presale hits $11 million Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the most promising DeFi players with its presale shattering more than $11 million and welcoming over 12,300 investors before its time. The hype for the project is in top gear, and this is a super strong indicator of the project’s future. In the current stage, MUTM tokens are at $0.03, but that is for a short while. Stage 6 will drive the price to $0.035. Demand is growing exponentially and Mutuum Finance’s first-mover advantage in the decentralized lending market is worth even more as it will be one of the greatest early-stage DeFi investments for 2025. $100,000 MUTM giveaway: 10 participants to win $10K Mutuum Finance is a new protocol wanting to compensate the early backers it has on its platform and has created a $100,000 giveaway , during which 10 entrants will be chosen and given $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. It will be a reward for the fast-growing community in the project and appreciation to early investors. But the clock is ticking. Don’t miss this opportunity to be one of the winners and in the process, earning a position as one of the most discussed new DeFi projects. Built on trust and transparency Most DeFi protocols fail because they are not practicing their promises but Mutuum Finance is demonstrating resilience through exhibiting genuine credibility and infrastructure. The platform’s smart contracts have been completely audited by CertiK. This type of third-party audit stabilizes Mutuum Finance’s foundation. Cardano’s $0.95 price target feels modest as it struggles to break above key resistance levels, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing serious attention with much stronger growth potential. With a target price of $5 by 2025, MUTM has already raised more than 11 million dollars from 12300+ early investors and is priced under $0.05. The strong tokenomics and a $100K giveaway of its real DeFi use have landed it among the winners of emerging altcoins.

Solana SOL, XRP XRP, and Dogecoin DOGE, which were hardest-hit among the altcoins, are showing signs of recovery as leveraged bets reset and spot buying returns. Liquidations pause as market resets Over the last 24 hours, crypto markets absorbed another $642 million in liquidations, adding to the $595 million flushed on Saturday, bringing the two-day tally to over $1.2 billion. Bitcoin BTC led the bleeding, with $230 million in liquidated bets, followed by ether ETH at $188 million in long liquidations. While, SOL saw $28 million in liquidations, XRP took $21 million, and DOGE over $25 million. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open). A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. The sell-offs began late Saturday after former U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed coordinated strikes on Iran’s key uranium enrichment sites. However, by Monday, the worst appeared to be over. Bitcoin clawed back to $101,237. Ether hovered near $2,236, SOL edged up to $133. While, XRP traded above $2, and DOGE hovered just around 15 cents. Losses persisted on the daily chart, but the bounce suggested dip buyers were stepping in fast. Analysts say institutional flows and growing use cases are helping some tokens snap back faster than others. Altcoins display resilience “While Bitcoin's volatility has been the focus after the U.S.-Iran escalation, the altcoin market is showing signs of divergent strength,” said Eugene Cheung, Chief Commercial Officer at OSL, said in a Telegram message. “Ethereum continues to attract institutional interest amid growing ETF inflows, while Solana and other Layer 1 tokens benefit from improving network activity, developer adoption, and ETF approval speculation,” Cheung added. Others say the market’s quick rebound reflects a broader belief that the geopolitical fallout will remain localized, with limited macro spillover. “The market is fairly optimistic that the Iran-Israeli conflict will remain muted and its economic impact will be locally contained,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “We expect that Iran has to engage in some retaliatory measures to maintain its regime's legitimacy, but such measures will be limited to avoid pulling all parties into a protracted conflict,” Ruck added. Still, risks remain. The U.S. hinted at “far greater” military responses if Iran retaliates, and any disruption to oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz could shake broader markets. But the speed of recovery suggests crypto remains in a macro uptrend, and liquidations, can be viewed as entry points.",Markets|Markets|liquidation|SOL|XRP|DOGE|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-23 05:23:20

Bitcoin slipped below $99,000, with Ethereum and other major altcoins following suit. Pi Coin also plunged 11%, nearing its all-time low, before a slight 0.55% rebound today. June’s 263 million token unlock continues to weigh heavily on Pi’s price , fueling selling pressure and investor concerns. Why Is #PiNetwork Price Low Right Now? Will It Rise Again? Global crypto correction is hitting all major coins — not just Pi. #Bitcoin , #Ethereum & #Solana have dipped recently, dragging the market sentiment down. When these giants fall, the whole market feels it.… pic.twitter.com/8f48DaHzCV — Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis (@drnicolas_) June 22, 2025 However, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis , the founder of Pi Network, has responded to concerns about the falling Pi price, attributing it to the broader crypto market correction. He pointed out that major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have also seen notable declines, impacting the overall market mood. So, Pi’s dip isn’t an isolated event, but it could be a part of a global trend. Temporary Dip, Long-Term Vision According to him, despite the bloodbath, Pi Network stands out with a unique setup. The project is in its Enclosed Mainnet phase, meaning it isn’t yet publicly tradable. Despite that, Kokkalis emphasized strong fundamentals, including over 50 million users, a growing ecosystem of real-world applications , and steady development. He reassured the Pi community, known as Pioneers, that what’s happening isn’t a crash but a transitional phase. Kokkalis believes the token’s true value will emerge once the Open Mainnet launches and Pi is listed on major exchanges. He framed the current situation as an accumulation phase, often misunderstood as weakness. For now, he urges users to stay patient and focused, noting that utility-based growth is already underway. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Founder Slammed as ‘Scammer’ for Defending Price Crash; He Responds , Analyst says, Prices to Stay Low Pi is officially in the $0.4 range, and I expect it to remain there until the end of August.

He believes the upcoming Pi Day 2 event is unlikely to influence the price, signaling low expectations for short-term momentum despite community buzz. What next? Much of the hype surrounds June 28, which marks Pi Day 2 and the conclusion of the .pi domain auction. Over 123,000 active bids have sparked optimism about ecosystem growth. While the Core Team hasn’t confirmed any updates, the market is anticipating something. Historically, Pi has rallied around such events, as seen with its 175% jump in May. However, caution remains due to the July 1 unlock of 40 million PI tokens, which could weigh on prices. For now, Pi is showing signs of strength, briefly decoupling from Bitcoin’s broader decline, driven by technical support and event-driven momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

We remain bullish on Bitcoin and MSTR as a proxy, viewing both as hedges against fiat currency and global instability. The fund's strategy only outperforms within a limited price range for MSTR; outside this, plain MSTR ownership has historically delivered better returns. Given the limited incremental benefit and added risks, we rate MSTE as a hold until clearer value over direct MSTR ownership emerges. Introduction The Harvest MicroStrategy Enhanced High Income Shares ETF (MSTE:CA) is a Canadian fund that aims to invest its assets into Class A shares of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). This company formerly was a software and business intelligence focused firm, but nowadays is more well known for its Bitcoin dominated balance sheet, due to its large holdings in this cryptocurrency. This fund looks to both provide access to the upside of MSTR while also giving investors consistent income from distributions - paid out monthly. Total leverage of the fund goes up to 25% and its investable units are denominated in CAD. Below are some details of the fund from its prospectus . Distribution : $0.66 / month AUM : $179.3M Management Fee : 0.40% Being that the main holding of this ETF is MSTR, a company that we like due to it being a proxy for Bitcoin, we are inherently bullish on the underlying company. We will review some points above MSTR in the following section that dictate our thoughts about the company. MicroStrategy Company Review MSTR is known for buying and holding Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on its balance sheet. The company has announced a plan to continue buying this cryptocurrency, outlining a long-term plan to continually invest further in Bitcoin through its 42-42 plan by 2027. The firm reveals that the money to fund these purchases would occur through both equity and debt raises, as well as the current operating cash flows generated by the firm itself. This plan entails details such as goals of $42B in equity and $42B in fixed income capital raises by the end of 2027, which should continue to fund its investments in Bitcoin. Furthermore, the company is leveraging its continual offerings of preferred shares , which offer high rates, to attract investors to the company and therefore generate even more cash for them to exchange into Bitcoin. Essentially, MSTR is becoming more and more of a Bitcoin hedge fund in a sense, where investors can view their investments in MSTR as a bullish play on Bitcoin (and crypto markets in general). Currently, MSTR holds a total of 592,100 Bitcoins , with an average BTC cost of ~$70,666. In nominal values, they have spent roughly $42B on their Bitcoin purchases over the years. The following chart shows the buying cadence (every week) and amount bought for YTD 2025. MSTR Bitcoin Purchases ( MicroStrategy ) We view MSTR as a great hedge against fiat currencies and also as a stable hedge against chaos happening across the world today. For example, the firm recently bought more BTC during the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, betting that the conflict and funding for it might boost the price of BTC. Ultimately, an investment in MSTR means that you have faith and believe in the market changing dynamics of Bitcoin. It may be that you view it as a hedge, truly do not believe in the current traditional finance systems, or a bit of both. Either way, Bitcoin’s influence on global financial markets cannot be understated and should be respected as an asset with both utility (in terms of transactions) and a hedge (against fiat currencies and as a store of value). It should be mentioned, however, that MSTR as a holding company of BTC frequently trades at a premium in terms of performance compared to buying BTC outright. Look at the below chart, for example, comparing YTD returns on BTC and MSTR. MSTR vs BTC YTD Performance (Yahoo Finance) The top blue represents MSTR, and BTC is the red line. With nearly a ~19% delta in YTD performance, one has to consider whether MSTR is an overvalued way to gain exposure to the underlying BTC asset. Either way, it would appear that the market places a premium on the leader, Michael Saylor, and his vision of what MSTR can do with their vast BTC holdings. In summary, we are bullish on the future of BTC, and therefore, MSTR. With this ETF holding MSTR and providing stable, recurring income from it, we also are therefore bullish on the future of this fund. However, there are risks and considerations stemming from the leverage and covered call elements of the fund that we will cover in the next section. Covered Calls and Leverage MSTE utilizes both leveraged and covered calls in order to increase overall returns for investors. Their goal is to have the fund be up to 25% leveraged and write covered calls on up to 50% of the fund . Currently, the fund is 22.8% leveraged . For the purpose of this analysis, we assume the fund is split up like so: 25% is 2x leveraged. For now, we assume that there is no interest cost related to the leveraging 50% is not leveraged but has covered calls written against it 25% just owns MSTE directly Let’s explore a scenario: The fund owns 200 shares of MSTR that were bought at $100 per share. 50 additional shares were bought on leverage. The fund has sold covered calls on 100 shares at a strike price of $125 for total proceeds of $500 Scenario Description Gain/Loss on MSTR Gain/Loss on Option Total Gain/Loss Without Leverage/Options No movement MSTR does not move at all. $0 $500 $500 $0 Mildly Up MSTR ends up at a price of $110 $2,500 $500 $3,000 $2,000 Mildly Down MSTR ends up at a price of $90 -$2,500 $500 -$2,000 -$2,000 Very Up MSTR ends up at a price of $160 $11,500 ($2,500 on covered call shares, $9,000 on the rest) $500 $12,000 $12,000 Very Down MSTR ends up at a price of $50 -$12,500 $500 -$12,000 -$10,000 It’s hard to see exactly how the leverage and options impact returns, as they sometimes impact the returns in the same direction (positive or negative) and sometimes have an opposite (but not always equal) impact. A few rules of thumb: If the stock price remains at or below the strike price, then the covered call strategy will result in higher returns (compared to if you did not sell the calls). If the stock price goes above the strike price, then investors will see positive returns, but the returns would be higher if you had not sold the calls. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. So if the stock price increases, you make more profit but if the stock price decreases you make less profit (both relative to a non-leveraged scenario). Let’s talk about the “Very Up” strategy. In the above scenario, the returns from having the covered calls and leverage are the same as if you had not done either. This is because the covered calls are decreasing potential returns by $3,000 while the leverage is increasing potential returns by $3,000. To be clear, these impacts will not always be equal. If instead the scenario was that the stock increased to $170, the total returns would be $13,000 while returns without leverage/options would be $14,000. MSTE gains with and without leverage/options (Doodad Capital) Above is a chart that visualizes the overall scenario. There are 3 main sections: $0 - $90: Investors are better off without the calls + leverage $90 - $160: Investors are better off using the calls + leverage $160+: Investors are better off without the calls + leverage So why are $90 and $160 the two points where the outcome flips? These are both points where the red and blue lines are exactly the same. This is because the negative impacts of leveraging are exactly canceled out by positive impacts of the calls (for the $90 case) or the positive impacts of leveraging are exactly canceled out by negative impacts of the calls (for the $160 case). These intersection points will change depending on various factors such as the call strike price, premium and interest costs of the leverage. For example, if instead the premium from selling the call was $1000, the intersection points would instead be at $80 and $170 instead. The key takeaway here is that investors in this kind of strategy would ideally see the stock price stay between the 2 intersection points. Otherwise, they would have larger returns without the additional call options and leverage. Finally, let’s talk about leverage interest. Since leveraging is a kind of debt, there will be an additional interest cost related to it. In this scenario, we borrowed enough cash to buy 50 shares of MSTR at $100 per share, resulting in a total debt of $5,000. The easy way to think about impacts of interest is that it changes the width of the range between the 2 intersection points. More interest would mean a narrower range, while less interest would result in a wider range. For example, with additional interest of $500, the range narrows from $90 - $160 to $100 - $150. Risks A key risk is BTC volatility. Being a cryptocurrency, it can sometimes be very volatile, as we all know. Therefore, the price of MSTR could also be impacted by swings in the price of BTC, as they are now so tied together. With a beta of 3.76 , this is a name that moves significantly compared to the market. This would be a risk that investors should keep in mind regarding the stability of their portfolio, and could therefore be a trade for more risk-tolerant investors. Another risk to consider is the additional cost of owning this ETF. Investors pay additional management fees as well as indirectly the leverage interest fees. All of this is fine if the returns outweigh the costs, but investors need to weigh the additional cost/complexity against the additional potential return they could gain. As we discussed, investors in this kind of strategy only make a profit if the share price ends up within a certain range, which limits the overall benefit of the fund. As you can see below, since inception, MSTE has actually lagged behind MSTR in returns by ~2% (the below chart is dividend adjusted, so proceeds from the covered call strategy are included). Investors could have saved on fees and the additional complexity by just buying MSTR instead. MSTR vs MSTE Returns (Stock Rover) Finally, we should also mention that while this fund is not very highly levered, it does have some leverage which could pose an additional risk. With leveraged investments, your losses could quickly compound, leading to potentially very large losses. Conclusion We are bullish on the future of BTC as we view it as a hedge against the traditional financial markets and as a safe haven in the event of conflicts around the world. Despite the risks and volatility associated with BTC, long-term, we believe that the currency will rise. For MSTE, it is interesting to see dual-features of it, offering both upside potential via leverage and recurring income via covered calls. However, we are not convinced if this additional complexity is providing enough value back to investors given the maintenance fee. The additional returns from the strategy are limited to only a specific window of price movement for MSTR and, as we showed, so far, investors would have been better off just owning MSTR. Until we see more evidence of incremental benefit from MSTE, we rate it as a hold.",MSTR|BTC-USD|MSTE:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-23 05:25:27

The tactic mirrors a nearly identical exploit on CoinMarketCap two days earlier , where attackers embedded similar code to serve wallet phishing prompts. In both cases, the attack relied on hijacking trusted platforms to bypass user skepticism — turning news and data sites into unwitting vectors for wallet drainers.

HAI price chart (Source: CoinGecko ) The breach stemmed from the compromise of a private key associated with an account that held ”minter” privileges—allowing it to create new tokens at will. Hacken confirmed the exploit in a statement on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday, noting that the attacker managed to mint hundreds of millions of tokens and dumped them on decentralized exchanges on the BSC network. ”A private key of an account with a minter role (ETH & BNB) was compromised, leading to unauthorized HAI minting and a dump on BSC DEXs ,” Hacken wrote. While the attacker is believed to have made off with around $250,000 in illicit gains, the real damage came from the hyperinflationary impact of doubling the token’s total supply in a matter of minutes. A Price Collapse and Attempted Recovery The price of $HAI plummeted by as much as 97% in the immediate aftermath of the exploit, triggering panic among holders. The token saw a modest rebound on Sunday but remains well below its pre-exploit levels. The incident sent shockwaves through the cybersecurity and Web3 communities, not only because of the scale of the attack but because of the symbolic irony—Hacken is, after all, a firm that advises projects on how to avoid precisely this type of vulnerability. In an unusually candid admission, Hacken’s co-founder and CEO Dyma Budorin took full responsibility for the incident, blaming the breach on a long-standing failure to upgrade the firm’s infrastructure with multi-signature protection for sensitive accounts. ”Responsibility is on me,” Budorin wrote on X. ”I didn't implement multisig bridge [infrastructure] 5 years ago. I understood the risk, but delayed bridge restructuring due to not unimportant reasons.” The company has since regained control by using its deployer wallet—which was not compromised—to revoke minting permissions from the affected accounts. To address the damage, Hacken is now planning a potential token swap that could help affected users recover losses. On social media, the team hinted at a larger restructuring effort involving what it called a “big merge between $HAI and Hacken equity shareholders,” which it claims is valued at over $100 million. While the full details of the compensation plan have not yet been released, the company said a comprehensive post-mortem will follow once the internal investigation is complete. A Case Study in Web3 Security Failures The breach comes just weeks after Hacken’s own Q1 Web3 security report warned that human error and misconfigured access controls represent the most significant threat vectors in the decentralized ecosystem. The report cited $1.6 billion in damages caused by such vulnerabilities in Q1 alone, noting that while smart contract bugs still pose a risk, “most damage is now caused by failures in people, processes, or permission systems.” This incident painfully illustrates that point. Even firms dedicated to blockchain security can fall prey to the very weaknesses they warn others about. Florida Investor Alleges $860K Scam Involving Fake Crypto Exchange and Denver-Based Trading “School” Meanwhile, a Florida man says he was duped out of $860,000 by a crypto trading scam involving a Denver-based education firm and a fraudulent crypto exchange that promised—and simulated—life-changing profits, only to ultimately vanish his funds behind a so-called system error. In a lawsuit filed last week in a federal court, investor Brian Firestone alleged that the Alpha Stock Investment Training Center (ASITC) and a fraudulent crypto exchange called CoinBridge Partners orchestrated an elaborate scheme that led to devastating financial loss. The trading “school,” which operated out of downtown Denver, reportedly coordinated the scam using a now-defunct website and a fake exchange address in Cherry Creek, Colorado. Firestone lawsuit against Alpha Stock Investment Training Center (Source: Justia) The Pitch: Education, Signals, and a $500 Hook According to the suit, Firestone was first contacted in December 2024 by a man identifying himself as John Smith, a representative of ASITC. Smith offered to teach cryptocurrency trading and provided Firestone with a $500 “starter gift” to begin learning signal-based crypto strategies. Signal trading involves following precise, real-time instructions from experts, or “professors,” to make specific trades. Firestone said ASITC professors would send him messages with exact times and amounts to buy or sell crypto, and he would carry out these instructions using his account on CoinBridge. Initially, the results were astonishing. Firestone claims that his $500 quickly grew to $55,000, prompting him to invest $50,000 more in January. Within weeks, his CoinBridge account allegedly ballooned to $2 million. But the rapid gains soon turned into devastating losses. According to the lawsuit, a failed trade reduced Firestone’s balance to just $12,000, leading him to wire $470,000 more in cash and take out a $330,000 loan from ASITC to continue trading. Following this, his account reportedly surged to $24.5 million. However, things took a suspicious turn on March 9 when a trade in Tether (USDT) failed to execute. Firestone frantically messaged Smith saying: “I can’t close it... I ncant clpsoe it.” The response was that a “system error” had caused the glitch, and his entire balance vanished overnight. In a final desperate bid to recover, Firestone says he borrowed another $1 million from ASITC, raising his account balance to $6.6 million. But when he was unable to repay part of his loan, ASITC allegedly shut down his CoinBridge account on May 1, cutting off access to all funds. Allegations of Fraud and a Fake Exchange Firestone’s lawsuit accuses ASITC, CoinBridge, John Smith, and ASITC founder Raymond Torres of fraud, theft, and racketeering, alleging the entire operation was a coordinated scam. The suit describes CoinBridge as a completely fictitious crypto exchange with fabricated investor figures and no legitimate regulatory standing. Although a real entity named CoinBridge Partners exists in Wyoming, it has denied any connection to the accused parties or the operation in Denver. Firestone’s ordeal highlights a broader trend in crypto-related fraud. According to blockchain security firm CertiK, over $2.1 billion has already been stolen in 2025 through various crypto scams, with a significant portion stemming from social engineering, wallet mismanagement, and fake platforms rather than traditional smart contract vulnerabilities. CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu emphasized that the rise in human-centered attacks marks a shift in the threat landscape: “While code-based exploits still exist, most attackers are now focusing on user behavior—exploiting trust, confusion, and urgency.” In 2024, phishing attacks alone led to more than $1 billion in damages across nearly 300 incidents, making it the most damaging attack vector in crypto security. Many of these scams used fabricated trading dashboards, AI-generated support agents, and deepfake communications to fool users into making irreversible transfers. Questions Remain as Authorities Investigate The ASITC website and CoinBridge platform have since gone offline, and both appear to have scrubbed their digital footprints. The physical address listed on ASITC’s website—1660 Lincoln St., Denver—now leads to a co-working space with no visible connection to crypto training. The lawsuit is expected to move forward as federal authorities begin investigating the financial and digital paper trails behind the scheme.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-23 05:30:00

This is a significant milestone in its efforts to rebuild its reputation and gain a foothold in one of the world’s most heavily regulated financial markets . The move comes months after OKX reached a $505 million settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Department of the Treasury. OKX agreed to pay $84 million in penalties and return $421 million in profits to US-based users. The case was widely seen as a major regulatory crackdown and, for many, marked a turning point in how offshore crypto firms approach compliance with US laws. OKX expands US presence Instead of retreating from the US market, OKX is doubling down. The firm has released a consolidated crypto trading platform specially designed for US customers. It also launched its non-custodial OKX Wallet, which enables US users to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 services. The wallet supports various blockchains and allows users to own their keys, whether you’re a newcomer in crypto or an advanced trader. OKX has further demonstrated its dedication by launching a US regional office in San Jose, CA. It has brought in Roshan Robert as the CEO of OKX USA to lead the next step in its US strategy. Robert was previously a senior executive at Morgan Stanley and Barclays, and he brought deep Wall Street experience to a company that had long been centered on offshore productions. In a recent interview , Robert said the team is looking to build a “super app” in the US. “Our long-term vision, of course, is to become a category-defining super app. And we plan to slowly work towards that goal,” he said. OKX’s IPO ambition isn’t solely a business milestone — it’s a statement. Regulatory certainty has been an issue that has continued to trouble crypto exchanges in the US since their inception, and many international exchanges have even refused to operate in the country. OKX has volunteered to be investigated by the SEC and other “reputable” agencies by listing in the USA. Analysts say the IPO would most likely be issued by OKX’s United States subsidiary, which has moved to California. This could happen very soon if the company can clear regulatory hurdles and market conditions remain favorable. Exchange fights to regain investor confidence OKX’s past encounters with regulators were a little bit scandalous. But it now seems to be learning from its past mistakes. The exchange has now stated it is focusing on Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures and effective anti-money laundering (AML), owing to which data and funds of US customers will be stored separately from its worldwide business. The change reflects a broader shift in the crypto industry, as companies that used to work in the legal gray areas now hurry to fall in line to plug into traditional financial infrastructure. If successful, OKX would add its name to a short but growing list of crypto companies to go public in the US, alongside Coinbase and Robinhood. The platform boasts a global user base of over 50 million people, a solid trading engine, and a growing set of DeFi products that just might set OKX up for the next wave of mainstream crypto adoption.

After years of legal battle, XRP could now come out stronger than ever. This could be the moment it breaks free from legal uncertainty and steps into a new era of clarity, adoption, and market confidence. XRP Breakout in August? On June 16, Ripple and the SEC jointly agreed to pause their appeals, which indicated that a final resolution is likely just around the corner. As part of the motion, Ripple would see the injunction against it dissolved and its civil penalty reduced to just $50 million, with the rest of the proposed fine returned. This was a clear sign that Ripple won, and the institutions are also starting to take note. What Happens Next? With the next update due by August 15, XRP’s major rally may be on hold until then. Judge Torres is expected to give a final ruling, likely confirming that XRP is not a security. If that happens, institutions waiting on the sidelines will finally be free to enter. XRP To Takeoff as ETF Odds Hit 95% At the same time, spot XRP ETF is now in its public comment phase. With strong legal momentum and rising demand, the odds of Polymarket approval are now at 91%. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas now rate the odds of an XRP spot ETF being approved at 95%. With everything falling into place, XRP looks ready for a big bull run.

In this roadmap, nine research areas and 34 workstreams are covered. The goal of the upgrades is to make Cardano (ADA) the best blockchain for scalable dApps and post-quantum resilience. These upgrades aim to deliver breakthroughs in protocol design, security, scalability, and interoperability. One of the most massive upgrades planned for Cardano is the Ouroboros Mega upgrade. The upgrade comprises seven specialized work streams that will advance speed, resilience, and fairness on Cardano. Research on Ouroboros dates to 2015, and there are over 3,000 academic citations. While these upgrades could eventually have a long-term price impact on Cardano (ADA), the slow pace of development has both positives and negatives. The positive side is that each step of development is scientifically evaluated and peer reviewed. However, it has a major downside in that growth is limited due to the slow pace of development. Consequently, investors have been looking for growth elsewhere, including in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising utility-based project in the DeFi sector. Quantum resilience on Cardano One of the main areas of focus for Cardano is to make the network resilient to the Quantum computing future. There are some features that the capabilities of these computers could pose a risk to the future of blockchain technology. As such, Cardano (ADA) aims to ensure it is ready to deal with any eventuality. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting investors in droves. What Mutuum Finance offers Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to borrow or lend assets. As lenders, users deposit their assets to earn interest. The interest rates in the pools are dynamically set by the pool utilization rate, which is set by market forces. As demand for assets in a pool rises, the utilization rate rises, which increases the interest rate. The rising interest rate pushes borrowers to repay loans, while lenders deposit more assets to benefit from the rising yields. This process leads to optimal capital efficiency while also increasing the total liquidity in the pools over time. To defend liquidity in the pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) requires that all loans by borrowers be overcollateralized. That simply means that they have to deposit more than the value of the assets they borrow in the pools. Various other protections are in place in the protocol. One of these is a strict token vetting process. Before an asset can be allowed to participate in the protocol, it has to be checked for volatility and liquidity. Additionally, its price data oracle is checked to ensure it is not subject to price manipulation. Another check that the team performs is to check the centralization of the project. A project that is in the hands of a central entity could easily be shut down with ease, placing the protocol’s solvency at risk. When adding assets that have a high level of centralization, the team will weigh the benefits to the community against the actual danger it poses to the protocol’s stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also CertiK audited, which is in line with its security posture. The goal of the audit was to ensure that the code was secure and safe for users to deposit their assets. On CertiK, it has received a Token Scan Score of 80. This CertiK audit has helped to boost trust in the presale, which continues to break new milestones. Details of the MUTM token presale So far, over $10.95 million has been raised in the ongoing MUTM token presale from around 12,350 buyers. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. The token price is set to go up by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6, and the process is expected to continue until the final listing price of $0.06. For phase 5 buyers, one of the main benefits is that they will get their tokens at a 50% discount to the final listing price. That is a massive bargain that all buyers are working to secure. It is worth noting that so far, 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, barely two weeks after they went live. As such, there are only 55% of the tokens available for phase 5 left for buyers to benefit from this bargain. Summary According to the latest estimates, MUTM tokens are expected to rise 31x. That means a $1,300 purchase in the presale could grow to $40,300. This is a massive opportunity that seasoned investors are looking forward to capitalizing on. You too can be part of this life-changing opportunity, and make massive returns, with long-term stable growth to boot.

46596819,https://invezz.com/?p=2773215,1750657814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,MUTM quietly builds 25x momentum while XRP and ADA see sharp drops,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/23/mutm-quietly-builds-25x-momentum-while-xrp-and-ada-see-sharp-drops/,"The past few days have been rough for XRP and ADA. At the same time, most of the market has held up quite well. XRP is down over 8% in the past month. It has seen a markedly steep decline. However, it remains about the $2 market, where it has hovered for the past few weeks. The faltering performance of XRP comes amid a recent update from the SEC, after it was announced that the case against Ripple Labs had been put on pause. Meanwhile, most of the market had been hoping for an outright dismissal, as has happened with other companies in the crypto world. That would suggest there are behind-the-scenes negotiations, which have triggered some panic instead of confidence. Cardano (ADA) has also struggled recently, dipping over 7% in the past week. The token has fallen clean through various support levels. While there have been signs of a recovery, that momentum quickly petered out. The trend is in line with global risk-off behavior across the market, especially after Trump hinted the US might be headed into open conflict with Iran. Amid this downward trend for XRP and ADA, investors are seeking out opportunities for growth elsewhere. One of the main beneficiaries of this trend is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has seen a massive surge in presale participation. The Muuum Finance (MUTM) project is utility-based, which has proven to be a major puller in this season. As the market moves away from more unstable assets like meme coins, utility-based projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are the main beneficiary. According to analysts, this trend could lead to 25x or more gains for MUTM tokens when they go live. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has to offer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to deposit their assets to earn passive income in the form of interest payments. The interest rate in the protocol’s pools is based on a pool utilization rate. To determine the utilization rate in a pool, the protocol measures the value of assets that are being actively borrowed versus the total value of the pool. On the protocol, users can also participate as borrowers by depositing overcollateralized collateral to secure loans. As borrowers, they have the benefit of gaining access to high-value assets without having to spend their current holdings. That way, they can benefit from market opportunities in real time with these high-value assets. When they are ready, they can repay their loans and regain access to their assets. To protect the long-term stability of the ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) features various protocol parameters designed to deal with price volatility. For instance, there is the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which determines the maximum amount a given asset can borrow. Overall, assets with high volatility tend to have more conservative terms due to their potential to cause insolvency. The protocol also implements the liquidity threshold, which determines the level at which a loan is considered undercollateralized. When it approaches this level, a borrower has the option to top up their collateral to push the limit back up. If they do not, liquidators step in and purchase part of the debt, or all of it at a discount. Another protective measure used in the protocol is the reserve factor. This is where a portion of the interest payments by borrowers goes into a common pool. These funds are used to ensure the long-term stability of the ecosystem. For more unstable assets like meme coins, the reserve factor can be set as high as 35%. Meanwhile, more stable assets like meme coins can get a reserve factor of 10%. The MUTM token presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale. Tokens in this phase are going for $0.03 per token, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, over $10.95 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,350 buyers. At the current price of $0.03, buyers are getting their tokens at a 50% discount off the listing price of $0.06. 45% of the presale tokens set aside for phase 5 have already been sold, barely two weeks after it launched. That means the opportunity to make a 100% guaranteed ROI is quickly diminishing. To further sweeten the deal, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a $100,000 giveaway for presale buyers.

46596820,https://invezz.com/?p=2773216,1750657977,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Ethereum steady at $2,500, but could MUTM pull off a 28x before ETH hits $4K?",https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/23/ethereum-steady-at-2500-but-could-mutm-pull-off-a-28x-before-eth-hits-4k/,"The latest on-chain data shows that Ethereum (ETH) is holding strong at around $2,500. This stability is driven by various factors, including a recent uptick in network activity. Data shows that around 1 million new ETH addresses have been created a week since the middle of May 2025. That represents a massive increase from the approximately 670,000 new weekly addresses created in the same period last year. This metric indicates a strong underlying network potential for ETH, which has consolidated around $2,500. According to forecasts, the number of new weekly addresses could keep rising by over 30% annually. That signals growing network adoption and wide ecosystem utility. The number of new addresses is widely used in the crypto sector as a signal of long-term adoption and user growth. As a result, analysts are interpreting the data as a sign of bullish momentum for Ethereum. This suggests demand-side strength is quietly lurking below the surface, and could explode at any time. Amid this trend, investors are positioning themselves to benefit from this massive altcoin rally. One way they are doing this is by purchasing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising project that is currently in the presale phase. According to projections, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could rise by 2,850% when it goes live. ETH headed To $4K While the market has been rocked by uncertainty, data shows that ETH is doing better than Bitcoin (BTC). This is a rare occurrence as Ethereum (ETH) tends to be closely correlated to Bitcoin (BTC). Before the current Middle East conflict, Ethereum was outperforming Bitcoin, and has since remained steady, despite the massive market shocks. The resilience, coupled with the positive address data, shows that Ethereum could rise higher. As more capital shifts into Ethereum (ETH), analysts forecast that it could trigger a new altcoin rally. Big investors are already positioning themselves to be the main beneficiaries of this expected rally. For instance, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently seen an uptick in participation, with over $10.95 million raised in the ongoing presale. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect buy One reason why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become a favorite of investors amid the pending altcoin rally is its focus on utility. In the past, the forecast has been on meme coins as investors have tried to cash in on the quick gains they offer. However, investors have come to accept that the only way to reliably grow value in the crypto sector is through utility. A good example of this is Ethereum. Since it went live, the price of ETH has risen 89,000%. Best of all, it continues to rise and consolidate those gains because of utility. Additionally, it has high liquidity, which makes it easy for traders to duck in and out of positions to make a profit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to follow in those footsteps. The project is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders on the protocol, they can deposit assets in a pool to earn interest. The interest rate in pools is based on the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises and the interest rate rises, it pushes borrowers to repay their loans. At the same time, it pushes lenders to deposit more liquidity in the pools to benefit from the rising rates. That leads to a situation where optimal capital efficiency is achieved. Price discovery on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) For Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to achieve market efficiency, pricing needs to be reliable and always accurate. To achieve this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement Chainlink price data oracles, which are a trusted source of data in the DeFi world. Additionally, they plan to implement backup price oracles to ensure there is always a reliable source of data that is accurate when the primary data source is not working. As a redundancy measure, they will implement both oracles to run concurrently. Additionally, they plan to implement the use of time-weighted price averaging as a reference point when there is enough on-chain volume. This data will be sourced from popular DEXs. The goal is to ensure that price discovery on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fair while ensuring the highest uptime possible. MUTM token presale details The MUTM token presale is currently in phase 5, where over $10.95 million has been raised from over 12,350 unique buyers. The presale has been a massive success, even after the 200% increase in the token to $0.03 from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have been sold, barely two weeks after they launched. With less than 60% of the tokens remaining in phase 5, this is your last chance to get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at a massive 50% off the token listing price of $0.06. Act fast and position yourself to benefit from the upcoming altcoin rally.

Amid a flood of institutional capital into the crypto sector, the crypto market is experiencing massive capital movements. According to on-chain metrics, one of the beneficiaries of this capital movement is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is quietly making its way into the spotlight. These inflows have triggered speculation that this could be the next big winner of 2025. So far, analysts forecast massive gains for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with estimates of a 3,450% gain making their way through crypto circles. There is good reason to trust this forecast, and in this article, we explore why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised for massive gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): built with a purpose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is deep in the 5th phase of its presale and has raised over $10.95 million from around 12,350 investors so far. MUTM tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. Analysts forecast strong performance after the presale, with the price expected to rise by 3,450%. Based on that projection, a $1,400 investment in the presale could grow to $48,300. One notable fact about the current phase 5 of the presale is that tokens are selling at a 50% discount to the listing price of $0.06. That means those who purchase their tokens in the current phase stand to make double what those who wait until the listing price will make. The protocol design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not powered by hype but by real utility. It is designed around a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders or borrowers. As lenders, they can deposit assets in a pool to earn interest. The interest rate they receive in a pool is based on the pool’s utilization rate. A pool’s utilization rate is determined by measuring the value of assets being actively borrowed in a pool against the total amount of assets in that pool. As the utilization rate rises, so does the interest rate. This rising interest rate pushes the borrowers to pay back their loans, while at the same time, it causes the lenders to deposit more assets to benefit from the rising rates. Over time, the liquidity in the pools increases, which leads to overall protocol health. It also ensures that the demand and supply-based actions of the lenders and borrowers lead to optimal market efficiency. To protect lenders’ liquidity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will require that all loans be overcollateralized. That simply means that borrowers will have to deposit assets of a higher value than the loan they take. The actual level of collateralization is determined by the intrinsic characteristics of an asset. For instance, an asset that shows high levels of on-chain trading volume, coupled with low volatility, will get better terms than assets that have high volatility and low liquidity. Due to the changing nature of the crypto market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will actively adjust the parameters. For instance, if an asset grows from obscurity, and the on-chain volume rises, and volatility falls, its parameters can be adjusted to encourage its use as collateral. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also operate a liquidity rewards program. In this program, rewards in MUTM tokens will be given out to encourage lenders to deposit more assets. This will have the effect of lowering the utilization rate and thus the interest rate in a pool. As a result, it will make the protocol more attractive to users, which is important to the long-term success of the project. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to use protocol revenue to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market. These purchases will apply positive price pressure on the tokens, which will boost their profile online. As such, it could develop a media buzz, leading to a surge of users into the protocol. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already listed on CoinMarketCap, the improved price performance could push it up the charts, increasing its visibility. CoinMarketCap has over 350 million monthly visitors, and this could serve as an important source of growth for the project. Summary Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a CertiK audited project that has been garnering massive attention from the crypto market in recent weeks. Already, some on-chain whale activity shows that the crypto market is taking notice. In the coming weeks, capital will continue to flow into the presale, with the momentum expected to carry on after the tokens’ public listing. With listings expected on major public exchanges, MUTM tokens could go parabolic. At the current price of $0.03, MUTM tokens represent your best opportunity for massive returns in 2025.

Meanwhile, Blockstream CEO Adam Back defended the premium on Strategy stock by pointing to the firm's rapid BTC accumulation. BTC Prague also shed some light on Europe’s potential in Bitcoin adoption, as Jan3’s Samson Mow met with French lawmaker Sarah Knafo to discuss a national Bitcoin reserve. France’s recent crypto investments could mean that there is growing interest, though EU-wide adoption still faces regulatory hurdles. Saylor Sees Bitcoin at $21 Million Bitcoin bull and Strategy founder Michael Saylor delivered a strikingly optimistic forecast for Bitcoin during his keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event. He predicted that the leading cryptocurrency could reach a price of $21 million within 21 years. Saylor’s bold projection is a big increase from his previous forecast at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he envisioned Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045. This dramatic revision reflects what Saylor described as an extraordinary shift in the geopolitical and regulatory landscape surrounding Bitcoin over the past year. Saylor credited his bullishness to unprecedented developments that he claimed were unimaginable just 11 months ago. Chief among these was the White House’s apparent embrace of Bitcoin, which he said was a landmark moment in US political history. He pointed to Donald Trump’s election victory in November of 2024 as a pivotal moment that ushered in a new era of pro-Bitcoin politics. According to Saylor, the notion that the United States could establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve or proclaim itself a global Bitcoin superpower was once inconceivable but is now becoming reality. Michael Saylor speaking at the BTC Prague event In addition to political changes, Saylor pointed out major legislative advancements, including progress on three crypto-focused bills in the United States — the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Bitcoin Act. He also mentioned that individual US states are increasingly embracing Bitcoin, which helps solidify the asset’s place in the mainstream financial system. While Saylor is an advocate for Bitcoin, his views on custody have attracted some criticism. Although Strategy holds a massive Bitcoin treasury — now totaling 592,100 BTC — the company refused to disclose the exact storage details of these holdings. Saylor pointed to security concerns as the reason for withholding proof-of-reserves information. His previous opposition to self-custody also sparked backlash. However, he reversed this stance in October 2024 by stating his support for self-custody by those “willing and able.” The BTC Prague event itself saw strong support for self-custody and open-source Bitcoin tools. Danny Sanders, chief commercial officer at Trezor, reported that more than 5,000 attendees participated in the event. Adam Back Defends Strategy’s Stock Premium Blockstream CEO Adam Back defended the premium on Strategy stock by saying it is justified given how quickly the company doubles its Bitcoin per share. Back also spoke at BTC Prague in an interview with Bitcoin podcaster Stephan Livera, where he explained that Strategy’s track record of growing its Bitcoin per share every 16 to 18 months reduces risk for investors, making the 2x multiple seen in MSTR stock trading “not unreasonable.” He explained that this growth rate means that investors can reach parity with the market net asset value (mNAV) in about a year and a half, effectively de-risking their position. Back pointed out that Strategy’s stock premium—which is currently around 1.7x on a basic share basis and 1.9x on a diluted basis—is backed by a solid asset base. The company has aggressively used leverage through at-the-market equity offerings and convertible senior notes to build up its Bitcoin reserves, now valued at approximately $60.89 billion. Despite MSTR’s recent price decline of 7.45% over the past 30 days, Back held firm that evaluating the time required to “overcome the premium” is a useful lens for investors in Bitcoin treasury stocks. Strategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: Saylor Tracker ) He warned that while elevated mNAVs can be speculative, they also often come with high potential yields. Still, such positions can lead to volatility and investor unease. As an example, he pointed to Japanese firm Metaplanet, which has seen its mNAV fluctuate between 5 and 10. Back acknowledged that holding the stock during such swings could be nerve-wracking, but said the firm has consistently rebounded. Metaplanet recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC after a new purchase on June 16, which allowed it to surpass Coinbase to become the seventh-largest publicly listed Bitcoin holder. France Could Lead Europe’s Bitcoin Future Meanwhile, Jan3 founder Samson Mow is turning his attention to promoting Bitcoin adoption at the nation-state level in Europe, after a promising meeting with pro-Bitcoin French lawmaker and European Parliament member Sarah Knafo at BTC Prague. Mow shared on social media that the two discussed creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for France and pushing for more favorable regulations toward Bitcoin. He is optimistic about launching a wave of nation-state Bitcoin adoption starting in France and potentially spreading across Europe. Knafo said that France must take a leading role in the conversation around Bitcoin. She described her meeting with Mow as an “excellent discussion,” and called him a seasoned expert in national Bitcoin strategies, including his advisory role with El Salvador’s government. Mow resigned from Blockstream in 2022 to focus entirely on Bitcoin nation-state adoption through his company Jan3. He confirmed that his team has been invited to France for further discussions. Knafo also met with Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, and called him “visionary and ambitious.” He even suggested that more Bitcoin-related projects are on the horizon for France and the broader European region. France has recently shown increasing engagement with Bitcoin through both government and private initiatives. Earlier this month, Paris-based Blockchain Group purchased 624 Bitcoin for €60.2 million, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. Additionally, France’s state-owned bank Bpifrance announced in March that it would invest €25 million into purchasing cryptocurrencies to support local blockchain projects. Despite these developments, there are still concerns about the pace of crypto adoption across Europe. Some industry leaders argue that the region continues to lag behind other parts of the world due to regulatory hesitation and limited institutional participation. Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at European RWA tokenization platform Brickken, pointed to a lack of corporate engagement and structural barriers that prevented Bitcoin from being embraced as a reserve asset. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, while now fully in effect as of December 2024, has yet to fully resolve these issues or lead to widespread adoption across the continent.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-23 05:58:20

The pop-up message appeared to be part of a legitimate Cointelegraph promotion and told visitors they had been randomly selected to receive 50,000 “CTG” tokens, valued at over $5,000. The offer seemed polished and convincing, featuring the company’s branding and interface elements that mimicked real airdrop campaigns. It included a countdown timer and prompts to connect crypto wallets, standard elements in genuine token distribution efforts. However, the entire experience was fabricated by attackers. A similar front-end attack appeared on CoinMarketCap over the weekend. Security Firm Flags CoinTelegraph Frontend Hack Originating From Ad System Scam Sniffer, a blockchain security firm, flagged the breach and posted a public alert, warning that Cointelegraph’s frontend had been compromised. “Please be cautious,” the firm tweeted, alongside screenshots of the injected code and the fake airdrop interface. The scam was likely designed to trick users into granting wallet permissions, ultimately allowing hackers to drain all funds. Cointelegraph later confirmed the breach and issued a warning . The company urged users not to interact with the fraudulent pop-up and emphasized that it has never issued a “CTG” token or launched an initial coin offering. It also assured readers that a fix was underway. ALERT: We are aware of a fraudulent pop-up falsely claiming to offer “CoinTelegraph ICO Airdrops” or “CTG tokens” that are appearing on our site. DO NOT: – Click on these pop-ups – Connect your wallets – Enter any personal information We are actively working on a fix. — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 23, 2025 According to Scam Sniffer, the malicious JavaScript code came from the site’s advertising system rather than its core infrastructure. Hackers Shift From Emails to Embedded Ads as Scam Tactics Evolve The file, served via Cointelegraph’s ad partner, contained wallet-draining scripts disguised as standard ad delivery code. This technique has become more common in recent months as attackers seek to exploit vulnerabilities in trusted platforms’ third-party systems. CoinTelegraph's frontend has been compromised. Please be cautious. pic.twitter.com/sH025Zek8p — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) June 23, 2025 The scam interface showed a fake reward worth $5,490 and labeled the transaction process as “secure,” “instant,” and “verified.” Once users clicked to connect their wallet, the script triggered a function that could initiate approvals and transfers without the user’s informed consent. These types of attacks are particularly dangerous because they appear on well-known, trusted websites. Many users assume such platforms have adequate security measures and may let their guard down. This makes ad-based exploits far more effective than phishing links sent through email or social media. Fake CTG Token Never Existed on Major Exchanges or Blockchains The CTG token mentioned in the scam does not exist on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, or any legitimate exchange. Neither is there a record of it on Ethereum or other major blockchains. These red flags may be obvious to veteran users, but newer entrants to the space are often unaware of what to look for in a legitimate token offering. Similar breaches have been reported across the crypto space. CoinMarketCap too experienced a comparable incident this month, where attackers embedded a wallet-draining link into a front-facing promo box on the site. In that case too, the compromise stemmed from third-party code, not the core platform. As more crypto companies depend on external ad services, their surfaces for attack increase dramatically. Even if a platform is secure at the application level, malicious scripts delivered through external partners can easily bypass protections. The growing trend has prompted calls for stricter auditing of third-party integrations and more robust sandboxing of external content.

According to Wedson, Binance’s spot trading volume has once again reached a dominant position in the market, which historically means a bullish signal for Bitcoin. Joao Wedson said the following in a statement on his social media account: “Binance’s Spot volume is now equal to all other exchanges combined. Also, Binance’s Spot volume is 10 times larger than Coinbase. The gap between Binance and other exchanges in spot volume is about to turn positive, which has triggered bull periods for Bitcoin in the past. Therefore, it is important to follow this trend closely.” Wedson also called on investors to make data-based evaluations, saying, “Off-chain data does not lie. Be careful.” Related News: Caution: A New Type of Cryptocurrency Scam Has Emerged - Here Are the Precautions to Take The Alphractal team, on the other hand, announced in their analysis of on-chain data that old whales, the classic big investors of Bitcoin, have not yet taken action. Stating that BTC transaction volumes over $ 100,000 remain at 2020 levels, the analysis stated that such big movements are usually seen in bull markets, but there has been no significant increase since 2022. Joao Wedson also drew attention to the “Bitcoin Long Term Power Law” model that he uses for Bitcoin’s long-term price prediction. This special log-log scale chart reveals Bitcoin’s potential with trend lines drawn with linear regression. According to Wedson, according to this model, it seems unlikely that the BTC price will remain below $108,000 until 2033, as it would contradict Bitcoin's historical growth curve. *This is not investment advice.

Markets have been highly volatile over the past week amid geopolitical tensions and the US air strike on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. Those tensions escalated with Iran threatening to close the Straits of Hormuz, a key shipping channel, which would impact global oil prices. Russia has also reportedly stated that countries are ready to supply Iran with nuclear weapons.

Crypto Market Outlook Digital assets continued to weaken over the weekend following US military action in the Middle East and more rhetoric from Iran and Russia as the situation escalates. Markets lost 4% in a fall to $3.15 trillion but managed to recover slightly during early trading in Asia on Monday morning. Losses were led by Bitcoin, which fell to $98,500 briefly in its first sub-six-figure dip since May 8. However, BTC had reclaimed the $101,000 level at the time of writing. Ethereum dumped more than 7% in a fall to $2,135, its lowest level since it broke above $2,000 in early May. Nevertheless, it also made a minor recovery to trade around $2,240 on Monday morning. Altcoins were all in the red aside from Hyperliquid as markets continue to weaken again.

Bitcoin dropped below $99,000 for the first time since May, with Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin also falling sharply. Though prices slightly recovered by late Sunday, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum remained down, reflecting investor caution amid growing global uncertainty. The rising geopolitical tensions after Trump’s strike on Iran and the continuous debt pressure weigh on markets. Amid this unease, renowned author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has renewed his warning about what he calls the “biggest global debt bubble burst in history.” As digital assets and traditional markets fluctuate, Kiyosaki’s predictions are again sparking conversations across the financial world. GLOBAL MONETARY COLLAPSE COMING? Will you be richer or poorer when biggest debt bubble in history bursts. I recommend owning gold, silver, and BITCOIN if you want to be richer when the Global Debt Bubble bursts. BIGGEST LOSERS will be savers of fake fiat money and especially… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 Kiyosaki’s Call for Tangible Assets In a recent X post, Kiyosaki urged investors to move away from fiat currency savings and instead build positions in tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. His long-held belief is that these alternatives offer better protection against looming economic instability. He reiterated that the global economy is dangerously inflated with debt and that a collapse is not only possible but likely. Past Predictions Back in Focus I shouldn’t brag but in 2013 I published “Rich Dads Prophecy” predicting the world economy today. It still pisses-me -off that so many modern day “prophets” whose names I will not mention, due to “professional courtesy” are now claiming to have warned of this extreme crisis we… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 19, 2025 Kiyosaki’s views aren’t new. He previously discussed similar warnings in his book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, which he claims accurately forecasted today’s economic scenario. Lately, he’s expressed frustration over what he sees as newer voices gaining recognition for insights he believes he shared years ago. His prediction of a potential silver surge, possibly doubling in value by year-end, has also resurfaced in recent discussions, further strengthening his focus on commodities. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Biggest Market Crash in History Is Coming , Looking at the current scenario, he bets high on silver and believes it is the best investment right now, as of June 2025. He believes gold and Bitcoin are currently too expensive and is waiting for a price drop before buying more. Impact on Investor Sentiment Kiyosaki’s warning hits hard for many investors who are already nervous about the shaky state of the global economy. While some think he’s being overly dramatic, others agree with his advice to move money into things like gold, silver, and Bitcoin instead of relying too much on regular cash savings. With growing doubts about the strength of traditional currencies, his message is gaining attention. As markets face more uncertainty, voices like Kiyosaki’s, whether you agree with them or not, are pushing more people to think about where their money is safest during tough times. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The company is investigating a breach on its US network with characteristics consistent with the hacking collective known as the Scattered Spider, Reuters reports . The group, sometimes referred to as “UNC3944,” is believed to be mostly made up of young adults and based in the US and the UK. It’s known to have made several other high-profile breaches targeting Visa, Marks & Spencer, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and several others. An Aflac spokesperson says the firm is still in the early stages of reviewing the attack and that it is not yet ready to divulge information relating to the number of affected customers or how long the investigation will go on. Aflac, which offers accident and pet insurance plans in the US and Japan to its 50 million users, has now potentially exposed its customers’ personal information, including their Social Security numbers and health-related information. Steve Cagle, CEO at healthcare security firm Clearwater, says that Scattered Spider’s specialty seems to be social engineering techniques, such as tricking help desks into resetting credentials and bypassing multi-factor authentication. The group is also known to be expert SIM swappers, which is when a hacker takes control of a target’s mobile phone plan in order to receive their 2FA (two-factor authentication) codes and log in to their accounts. Noah Michael Urban, a member of the group, was recently ordered to pay back $13.2 million to 59 victims after being charged with masterminding a SIM swapping scheme, according to The Register . Urban is currently facing 20 years in federal prison on each wire fraud charge.

After U.S. airstrikes targeted three major Iranian nuclear sites, President Donald Trump declared the attacks a “success,” warning of intensified retaliation if provoked. These strikes come after a week of conflict between Israel and Iran, rattling global markets. Against this geopolitical backdrop, the market capitalisation of the industry dropped 1.50% to $3.1 trillion. Trading volume spiked 26.23% to $136.38 billion as volatility followed with full force. Bitcoin is down 1.27% at $101,497.55, Ethereum lost 1.99% to trade at $2,241.94, and XRP slipped 2.52% to $2.02. Talking about sentiments, the Fear & Greed Index dropped to 37, highlighting growing investor anxiety. Crypto Liquidations Today Surge to $647M In the past 24 hours, total crypto liquidations rose to $647.41 million, affecting over 185,000 traders. Of these, long positions accounted for a whopping $504.95 million, indicating that bullish traders were caught off guard by the swift price reversal. It is worth nothing that the largest liquidation was a $35.45 million BTC-USDT long on HTX. Source: CoinGlass Bybit led the exchanges with $252.46 million in liquidations, followed by Binance at $137.57M and Gate with $96.57M. The majority of liquidated positions were long, with ratios as high as 95.14% on Bitmex and over 90% on Bitfinex and CoinEx. Which signal a strong bias toward expecting upward price movement that ultimately collapsed. Crypto Market Cap Analysis The total crypto market cap currently sits at $3.09 trillion, recovering slightly from an intraday low of $3.04T. Technically, the price touched the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential oversold conditions. The RSI at 38.41 also hints at bearish exhaustion, with room for a short-term relief bounce. However, the market remains below the 20-day SMA of $3.23T, confirming ongoing downward pressure. With BTC dominance at a cycle-high of 64.9%, altcoins are underperforming. ETH dominance has slipped to 8.7%, reflecting broader weakness across major Layer 1s. While the market has witnessed the wrath of external influences, the business still has top gainers in this chaotic session. Which include Story IP with +11.35% intraday gains, Four with +10.39% price surge, and Sonic with +7.68% gains, showing that select microcaps are still attracting speculative interest. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs 1. Why are crypto liquidations so high right now? The $647M liquidation spike comes from a sharp market downturn triggered by geopolitical tensions and overly optimistic long positions getting wiped out. 2. What does a Fear & Greed Index of 37 mean? An index reading of 37 signals “Fear,” indicating investors are cautious. 3. Is the crypto market likely to recover soon? Technically, the RSI and Bollinger Band levels suggest a potential short-term rebound. However, recovery will heavily depend on geopolitical developments.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 07:05:03

This buying came amid the ongoing Iran-Israel war, which has caused the entire crypto market to drop 5% to 10%. Metaplanet Bought 1,100 Bitcoin According to the Metaplanet report , the latest Bitcoin was purchased at an average price of 15,535,502 yen per BTC, which is roughly $105,946 per Bitcoin. Despite the high price tag, MetaPlanet seems calm. What makes this move even more remarkable is the 306.7% year-to-date (YTD) return MetaPlanet has achieved in 2025 alone. This performance reflects not just Bitcoin’s strong rally this year, but also the firm’s strategic timing and belief in Bitcoin as a store of value. Metaplanet 1% Bitcoin Plan As of June 23, the Metaplanet holds a massive 11,111 BTC, acquired for around $1.07 billion, at an average cost basis of $95,869 per Bitcoin. Meanwhile, just last week, Metaplanet bought 1,112 more Bitcoins for about $117.2 million. But the company isn’t stopping there. Metaplanet has already announced plans to raise $5.4 billion, aiming to own 1% of all Bitcoin in existence, about 210,000 BTC, by the end of 2027. It’s one of the boldest Bitcoin strategies ever seen from a public company. Metaplanet Stock Price plummets by 8% The market has been watching Metaplanet’s Bitcoin moves closely. After the announcement, Metaplanet’s stock price showed some volatility. On June 23, 2025, Metaplanet shares closed at 1635 JYP, down 8.77% for the day, following a period of strong gains earlier in the month. The recent dip reflects broader market jitters, not just from the Bitcoin purchase but also due to the escalating conflict in the Middle East, which has rattled global stocks.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 07:08:31

But behind its classrooms and job-ready courses lies a big financial strategy few expected — a growing Bitcoin treasury inspired by none other than Michael Saylor, the Strategy CEO known for turning Bitcoin into a corporate asset. From Napster to Bitcoin: Jetking’s Early Bet on Decentralization In an exclusive interview with Coinpedia, Jetking’s CFO Siddarth Bharwani revealed the company’s long-standing interest in peer-to-peer systems since the Napster era. So, when Bitcoin emerged, its decentralized structure instantly clicked with Jetking’s tech-savvy leadership. By 2017, the company began exploring Bitcoin. But it was Saylor’s high-profile move to institutionalize Bitcoin at MicroStrategy that truly changed the game for Jetking, transforming their view of Bitcoin from a tech curiosity to a potential treasury asset. “It was Michael Saylor’s move to institutionalize Bitcoin on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet that catalysed our own shift in perspective — highlighting Bitcoin not just as a technology, but as a transformative treasury asset. This conviction led us to formally begin accumulating Bitcoin in March 2022.,” the CFO shared. COVID-19: The Crisis That Forced a Financial Rethink Jetking’s pivot to Bitcoin wasn’t just driven by curiosity, it was born out of survival. The pandemic devastated Jetking’s operations, wiping out 40 years of physical expansion in just 12 months. In March 2022, Jetking took its first steps, formally buying Bitcoin as a treasury asset. “We looked at Bitcoin and Bitcoin being the hardest money available on earth, we went ahead and bought Bitcoin on our Balance sheet,” he said. 18,000 Bitcoin by 2030: The Big Bet Jetking isn’t stopping at a few Bitcoins. The company has an ambitious roadmap to accumulate 210 BTC by 2025, and eventually reach 18,000 BTC by 2030. “Capital efficiency is maximized through Fundraises, cash flow recycling and market-hedged exposure — all while aligning dilution control with long-term Bitcoin appreciation and shareholder value creation.” The company is focusing on capital efficiency, market-hedged exposure, and disciplined fundraises, all while keeping shareholder dilution under control. They want to build Bitcoin exposure the smart way, not the reckless way. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This is commonly considered one of the symptoms of the long-range upward movement. The recent breakout of the consolidation range has strengthened this structure, with DOGE currently located inside a breakout system that can cause another increase. The technical analyst Javon Marks affirms that the upward structure is intact since DOGE trades above the necessary trend line support. Marks pointed out the possible price of $0.6533 in case of the continuation of bull pressure. This would constitute a nearly 260 percent gain in price as compared to the present cost of 0.1712. In the long term, should things play out, then the token may reach the region of 1.25, which is more than 600% higher than the current valuation. Nevertheless, these targets will be reached on the condition of sustained buying pressure and market support. Price Action Experiences Consolidation with Pamphlets of Accumulation Over the last 24 hours, Dogecoin has dropped by 1.60 percent, and it has lost 13.36 percent over a week. Although this temporary decrease has been witnessed, the price has been held in a more extensive upward trend. June 19 daily charts are associated with volatility, as the DOGE reached a maximum of $0.171250 around 1:00 AM and dropped to the bottom of $0.169600 by 7:30 AM. Such apprehension is shown in movements such as those of traders who have not yet found a determining point but who have regular volume patterns with phases of periods active in accumulating. Source: Yahoo Finance The current resistance zone stands at $0.170378, which DOGE has tested but not yet decisively breached. The ability to hold above the $0.165 level is considered crucial for maintaining the upward trajectory. A break above the near-term resistance, accompanied by rising volume, could strengthen bullish signals and drive price momentum toward the following resistance zones. New Competitor Enters Market With Bold Target As DOGE maintains its bullish posture, a new project called Little Pepe is gaining traction with aggressive market positioning. Operating as a Layer 2 blockchain, Little Pepe introduces the $LILPEPE token as the central utility asset of its network. The project aims to combine fast, low-fee blockchain performance with meme coin culture, positioning itself as the next significant evolution in the meme coin space. With ambitions of capturing market share from established tokens like Dogecoin, Little Pepe is reportedly targeting a return of up to 16,828% for early participants. Since its presale launch, $LILPEPE has rapidly gained traction. Stage 1 tokens were priced at $0.001, selling 500 million tokens and raising $500,000 within just 72 hours. Stage 2 followed at $0.0011, with over 1.16 billion tokens sold and $733,987 raised. Currently, Stage 3 is underway at $0.0012, having raised $1.53 million with more than 1.42 billion tokens sold, and aiming for a $2.525 million target. The next price stage will rise to $0.0013, rewarding early participants with the lowest entry price before the token hits major exchanges. As Dogecoin eyes a move toward $2 amid favorable technical signals, Little Pepe is capturing investor attention with its innovative blockchain technology and tiered presale model, adding a new dynamic to the meme coin market and giving traders exciting alternatives for significant short-term and long-term gains.

The firm currently has a total of 11,111 BTC holdings, valued at over $1.07 billion. Metalplanet bought the digital asset at an average purchase price of 15,535,502 yen ($106,408 million) per Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s stock (3350T) dropped slightly by 5.05% in the past 24 hours on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, reaching 1,690 Japanese yen. The firm’s stock has seen an uptick of more than 373% year-to-date.

(@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Metaplanet’s latest acquisition marks a major milestone in its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which commenced in mid-2024 and accelerated through early 2025. Since December 2024, the company has grown its stash nearly 28-fold since it formalized its Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business initiative, pivoting from its hotel management business. The investment company also reported a quarter-to-date BTC yield of 107.9%, up from 95.6% in Q1 and 309.8% in Q4 2024. The firm uses the metric as a key performance indicator to track Bitcoin per fully diluted share over time, excluding the effects of dilution. Metaplanet also posted a BTC gain of 4,367 BTC for $451.2 million for the ongoing quarter, based on reference prices from Bitflyer. The Tokyo-based firm has funded its Bitcoin purchases through a series of capital market activities, including multiple zero-coupon bond issuances and equity-based investments. Since January, Metaplanet has issued and redeemed more than a dozen series of ordinary bonds and stock acquisition rights, largely subscribed by EVO FUND. The company has issued over 210 million shares under its ‘210 Million Plan.’ The investment firm’s board of directors resolved on June 16 to issue $210 million via no-interest bonds and raised that figure to buy more BTC. Metaplanet revealed that it aims to purchase 210,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2027. According to Bitbo data, if successful, the acquisition would make the company the second-largest holder of Bitcoin among public companies, behind Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy. Previously, under the firm’s 21 million plan, it would hold 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026, with no concrete plan for more buys. Between May and June 2025 alone, the company raised over $300M through bonds and exercised stock rights, with proceeds explicitly allocated for Bitcoin accumulation. A June 3 report from Standard Chartered found that, the Bitcoin reserve strategy trend has led to 61 publicly listed firms out of a total of 124 now holding a combined 3.2% of all BTC that will ever exist. Bitcoin remains resilient amid ongoing global geopolitical tensions Metaplanet added to its Bitcoin reserves amid an escalation in the Middle East war and the looming uncertainty over global financial markets. Investors are watching to see how the financial system will react when markets open on Monday, following the involvement of the U.S. in the conflict over the weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Saturday evening that the United States had launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. He revealed that the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The price of Bitcoin has slid by roughly 1% in the last 24 hours and had dipped below the $100K mark on Sunday, before recovering and hovering at $101,800 at the time of publication.

46600014,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72243,1750663457,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Projected Timeline for $10,000 In XRP to Become $1 Million",https://timestabloid.com/projected-timeline-for-10000-in-xrp-to-become-1-million/,"The possibility of turning a $10,000 XRP investment into $1 million remains one of the more ambitious yet widely discussed goals among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. As XRP continues to build momentum, several analysts and platforms have offered forecasts on how and when this milestone could realistically be achieved. This article reviews the valuation milestones required to reach the million-dollar mark and evaluates predictions from industry figures and research platforms regarding the timelines involved. Understanding What It Takes to Reach $1 Million from $10K in XRP At the current trading price of approximately $2, a $10,000 investment would acquire 5,000 XRP tokens. For this amount to grow into a $1 million portfolio, XRP would need to rise by nearly 9,900% to reach $200 per coin. Reaching this price level would mark a historically significant leap for XRP, surpassing its all-time high of $3.84 recorded during the 2017–2018 bull cycle. Though XRP has delivered major gains in previous cycles, replicating such growth in today’s market conditions poses substantial challenges. At $200 per unit, XRP’s total market capitalization would exceed $12 trillion. This would place its value above the combined market caps of several of the world’s largest technology firms, including Apple and Google. As a result, while the math behind the $10,000-to-$1 million scenario is straightforward, its feasibility continues to be debated among analysts and investors. Forecasts Suggest Varied Timelines to the $210 Mark Analysts have outlined different scenarios and timelines for when XRP could reach the required $200 price level. Among the more optimistic voices is Javon Marks, who believes XRP could reach $200 as a result of what he describes as a breakout from its “largest coil pattern of all time.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He draws a comparison to XRP’s multi-year consolidation from 2014 to 2017, which preceded a major rally. Marks believes the 2017–2024 period resembles that earlier setup, stating he still holds a triple-digit outlook for XRP in the current market cycle. In line with this bullish perspective, some in the XRP community have projected even higher valuations, with certain estimates ranging up to $305. These expectations are built on confidence in XRP’s long-term positioning and its potential role in the evolving financial system. On the other hand, several research platforms present more conservative projections. According to Telegaon , XRP might not reach $236 until 2050. This places the $1 million outcome over two decades into the future. Similarly, Changelly’s forecast suggests a timeline between 2034 and 2040 for XRP to reach $200. These estimates reflect a cautious approach and assume a more gradual pace of adoption and market growth. Contrasting Views from the XRP Community and Analysts Within the XRP community, such long-term projections are often dismissed as overly cautious. Critics of the 2050 and 2040 timelines argue that these projections stem from analysts who are unwilling to consider XRP’s future potential. Some community members attribute these estimates to “Bitcoin maxis” who prioritize Bitcoin’s dominance over competing digital assets. A notable alternative view comes from BarriC, a respected voice within the XRP ecosystem. He has predicted that XRP could reach $200 between 2032 and 2033. This estimate, while still conservative compared to Marks’ outlook, is viewed by many as more reasonable and achievable. Additionally, Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer of CryptoGuard, has stated that XRP could reach $1,000 by 2035 , implying an earlier arrival at the $200 threshold. While the goal of turning a $10,000 investment in XRP into $1 million requires the token to reach $200, opinions differ widely on when such a price level might be reached. From as early as this cycle to as late as 2050, expert predictions span decades. Despite this range, interest in XRP’s long-term trajectory remains strong.

These figures earned Cardano first place on a weekly basis. While there was a 0.3% increase in the number of commits on a monthly basis, there was a 9.8% decrease in the number of developers. Cardano’s ecosystem-wide activity was on a downward trend, with 1173 commits (-25.26%) and 176 developers (-19.92%) showing a decline compared to previous months. Ethereum, while underperforming in terms of direct core contributions, stands out with its ecosystem scale. 1567 projects running on the Ethereum network were supported by a total of 1572 developers this week. Developers made 24,144 commits to these projects. However, there was a 24.68% decrease in the number of developers and an 18.04% decrease in the number of commits.

Everyone wants to be perfectly positioned to take full advantage of the coming altcoin season. The month has seen crypto markets pick up momentum, with an influx of institutional funds driving the surge. Bold investors understand that June represents the last real opportunity to make massive gains when the market goes parabolic. If you want to make a smart buy right now, one of your best options is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in the presale phase, which represents an opportunity for massive upside. According to analysts, the MUTM tokens could rise over 20x when they go live. Here is a deep dive into some of the projects that savvy investors are looking at in the month of June 2025, with a focus on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is under the radar. XRP XRP, created by Ripple Labs, has been at the center of a legal whirlwind in recent years. However, 2025 is panning out to be a great year for the project. The SEC lawsuit is in the process of winding up, and Ripple is expanding its solutions across the world in the Middle East and Asia. RippleNet has seen growing adoption in Japan and Singapore, where major institutions have added it to their services. As such, it is still growing into its role of being a better alternative to SWIFT and its legacy systems. Ripple Labs also recently upgraded the XRP ledger to allow native support for issuing assets. That could expand its role beyond remittances, making the network a complete layer 1 for tokenization and DeFi. While these developments are promising, XRP has a long way to go before it can gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for SWIFT. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a more promising prospect. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot (DOT) is a multi-chain powerhouse built for scalability using parachains. After a slow 2024, DOT is signaling some new momentum. In June, the network rolled out a new feature called Asynchronous Backing that makes parachains faster, boosting the throughput 10x. Additionally, community governance has been implemented and is executed faster. With a post to speed and more control to the community, DOT is a good project to consider. However, the improvements to the network have not had as much of an impact as expected. Considering this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be a better option for bigger gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) It began as a whisper in the corners of Crypto X and has now spread into a massive movement. On X alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a following of over 10.5k followers. The project is proving that it is not just another crypto project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the future of utility-based growth. Created by a team of committed developers, this project could deliver the most explosive gains of 2025. As a sign of the team’s commitment, they submitted the code for an audit to CertiK early on, and they got back positive results. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a Token Scan Score of 80 on CertiK, just one of its many accomplishments. Where the project truly shines is in the protocol design. It is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their funds into the protocol’s pools to earn interest. The interest that they receive is based on the pool utilization rate. As the number of loans taken by borrowers rises, in comparison to the total in a pool, the utilization rate rises. This causes the interest rates to rise, which encourages the borrowers to repay their loans. At the same time, it inspires more lenders to join the pools to benefit from the rising yields. Over time, this creates a positive feedback loop that ensures optimal capital efficiency. Lenders receive mtTokens when they deposit assets into the pools. These mtTokens represent the value of their deposit, plus any interest they accrued. As a result, this system makes it easy to keep track of the interest payments. Additionally, lenders do not need to actively claim or compound their interest.

Naturally, the financial markets have responded negatively to this news, and the crypto market has not been left out. Interestingly, the Bitcoin price had sat above the $100,000 psychological level for the longest. However, it was only a matter of time before it lost this support and crashed further, especially as the digital asset seems to only have major support in the 5-digit territory. Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $90,000 In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Master Ananda has revealed major bearish formations for the Bitcoin price. With the $100,000 support having held so far through the last week, it suggested there is still some buying going on for the cryptocurrency. However, the chart does not show enough strength to hold this level. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications Since the market has been rocked by over $1 billion in liquidations in the last week, it has transferred some weakness to the BTC price, putting the bears in charge once again. Pointing this out, Master Ananda explains that the weekly chart, in particular, is not showing any good signs. The current Bitcoin price action seems to only be a continuation of the bearish price action that began after it hit a peak of $111,900 back on May 19, 2025. Since then, the decline has been consistent, and the crypto analyst says the market looks “terrible” right now. Given the crash, the major support for Bitcoin is no longer above $100,000, but over 10% below it. As the price has previously broken below $100,000, the first support the market could see would be at $88,888. Failure to hold at this point would trigger another 5% decline toward $82,500 before bulls are able to put up any fight. What Happens If BTC Stays Above $100,000? While the bearish trend is the most dominant at this point, there is still the possibility that the Bitcoin price could stay back above $100,000 and hold the fort there. In this case, it is likely that the bullish trend would continue. The crypto analyst highlights this in another post, forecasting a very sharp upward move if this happens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again In the case of a recovery, then Bitcoin could retest the upper trendline that sits right above $108,000. And as for how long all of this could take to play out, the crypto analyst believes that the entire thing shouldn’t take more than two weeks to actually unfold and pick a direction. “Do not be afraid if the market shakes, Bitcoin is going up; Crypto will grow, regardless of the short-term,” the analyst said in closing.

Key Takeaways: FTX is seeking to fully reject 3AC’s $1.5B claim, calling it legally and factually unfounded. The exchange argues 3AC breached margin terms and ignored warnings before a necessary $82M liquidation. FTX says 3AC is shifting blame to recover losses from its own failed trading, at the expense of other creditors. In a recent court filing , lawyers representing FTX argued that 3AC’s request to recover funds from the bankrupt exchange’s estate should be “disallowed in its entirety.” The objection follows a November 2024 ruling by a Delaware bankruptcy judge permitting 3AC to increase its claim from $120 million to $1.5 billion , citing new evidence related to asset liquidations. 3AC Claims FTX Dumped $1.5B in Assets Weeks Before Its Collapse 3AC claims that FTX liquidated roughly $1.5 billion in its assets just weeks before the hedge fund itself collapsed. However, FTX attorneys dismissed the claim as resting on “an unreasonable and unsupportable starting premise,” citing “inaccurate figures” and a “blindness to the actual events.” The filing points to a June 2022 breach of margin requirements by 3AC following the fallout from Terra’s collapse. According to the objection, when 3AC’s account fell below the required $240 million balance, the firm failed to respond for over six hours. Instead of meeting the shortfall, it allegedly withdrew $18 million in ETH. FTX then moved to liquidate the account, recovering $82 million. The lawyers argue this move not only complied with credit and margin agreements but also protected the estate from further losses. FTX lawyers say 3AC’s $1.5 billion claim 'defies logic' and should be tossed -Lawyers for the FTX bankruptcy estate have objected to a $1.53 billion claim from collapsed trading firm Three Arrows Capital, urging the court to dismiss 3AC’s claim in full. -The lawyers say 3AC’s… https://t.co/YCMn4AwEs6 — Rukawa Kaede. (@show4653) June 23, 2025 Without the liquidation, they claim, 3AC’s account would have been $18 million underwater by the time FTX filed for bankruptcy. “Forced liquidation was not only permitted but necessary,” wrote Steven Coverick of Alvarez & Marsal, who conducted a forensic review of the transactions. His findings were submitted alongside the objection. British Virgin Islands King’s Counsel Stephen Atherton also weighed in, dismissing 3AC’s legal arguments under BVI law as flawed. FTX’s team maintains that 3AC is attempting to recoup losses from its own aggressive trading by targeting the exchange’s creditor pool. “FTX creditors should not and cannot serve as a backstop for 3AC’s failed trading strategy,” the filing states. 3AC has until July 11 to respond, with a non-evidentiary hearing scheduled for August 12. Sam Bankman-Fried’s Release Date Set for 2044 FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now projected to be released from federal prison on December 14, 2044 , after serving less than 21 years of his 25-year sentence for fraud tied to the FTX collapse. He was also fined over $11 billion. Federal records confirm that Bankman-Fried has been moved from New York to a transfer facility in Oklahoma following nearly two years behind bars. The move comes after Bankman-Fried was reportedly placed in solitary confinement earlier this month for giving an unauthorized interview to Tucker Carlson. His incarceration began in August 2023, after Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked his bail due to allegations of witness tampering involving leaked diary entries from former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, who was a key witness in the case.

The minting happened in two steps as the company made $1 billion earlier and later added another $1 billion, which CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed. Whale Alert posted on X , highlighting the latest $1 billion USDT mint at Tether’s Treasury address. Paolo Ardoino explained that the USDT is “authorized but not issued”. Tether holds it in reserve for future use, like customer redemptions or moving tokens between blockchains. Tether creates new USDT to meet future needs Tether’s recent decision to mint $2 billion worth of USDT on the Tron blockchain comes after another $1 billion USDT mint on Ethereum on June 18, just before the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC meeting . Tether has created a historic pattern in which it preemptively boosts stablecoin reserves ahead of possible liquidity surges. So many investors and analysts now assume the company expects the market conditions to change. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain said the company is preparing in advance for expected demand because it is issuing large amounts of USDT without putting it directly into circulation. Stablecoins like USDT also lack the volatility of regular cryptocurrencies. They are common in market trends that Tether’s minting behavior follows, such as when investors increase their activity or when trading volumes spike on major exchanges. Popular crypto investor and commentator Lark Davis described the minting as a sign that “dry powder” is entering the system. This means the capital exists and will be deployed once favorable market conditions arise. His comments show hope of an upcoming shift to a more risk-on investment environment if the Fed leans toward cutting interest rates or signaling continued support for financial markets. Tether builds up reserves to keep USDT stable Tether continues to grow its reserves to support the stability and trust behind its popular stablecoin tied to the value of the U.S. dollar, USDT. Minting more tokens and holding them in reserve gives users confidence that they can always redeem their USDT for dollars if needed because it proves each USDT in circulation is fully supported by assets of equal value. The most recent $2 billion minting happened on the Tron blockchain because Tron offers fast and low-cost transfers for users who need to move large amounts of money quickly and affordably. Tether is giving users more flexibility in how they use the token and allowing exchanges and crypto to choose the network that best suits their needs in terms of speed and transaction fees by spreading USDT across multiple blockchains like Tron, Ethereum, and others. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, said the newly minted USDT allows the company to respond faster to future demands from exchanges, institutional clients , or users who want to swap USDT between blockchains. This is because they are created in advance and held in Tether’s treasury as inventory. The company says it issues new tokens to ensure smooth service, not to influence or predict price movements, but some people in the crypto community think these large mints usually happen before Bitcoin and Ethereum prices rise and show incoming market rallies Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-quietly-thriving-in-japan-payment-sector-heres-the-latest/,"Mai, co-founder of the XRPL Japan Association, shared a video on X from the XRPL Japan Community Day after-party showing a person paying for beer and tacos using XRP. The transaction was completed through a mobile phone, visually demonstrating the token’s utility in a real-world setting. According to her caption, the payment was successfully executed with XRP, underscoring ongoing efforts to promote real-world use cases for the digital asset within Japan’s growing XRP community. XRP Payment in Action at Community Gathering The video depicted a casual but purposeful demonstration of XRP being used to settle a transaction for food and drinks. This simple but important moment was showcased as part of a larger effort to normalize digital payments through the XRP Ledger. The setting—a relaxed after-party following XRPL Japan Community Day—allowed attendees and followers to witness the practicality of XRP in informal, day-to-day scenarios. The visual of the person using their mobile device to pay underscored the token’s potential as a reliable medium of exchange. Paying for beer and tacos by XRP at the after party of @XRPLJapan Community Day pic.twitter.com/YaDp8eHUKC — Mai ＠Xaman/XRPL Japan (@Mai_XRPLJapan) June 21, 2025 Mixed Reactions from the XRP and Crypto Communities Responses to Mai’s post varied widely. Some users drew comparisons to early Bitcoin milestones. One such reaction came from Michael Gigliotti, who suggested that the moment might be remembered similarly to Bitcoin’s first commercial transaction—paying for pizza in 2010. In a related tone, a commenter named LFC Fan entertained the idea that this could one day be seen as “XRP Taco Day,” alluding to a potential tradition within the XRP community that commemorates its early real-world uses. Not all replies shared this optimistic view. A more critical response came from a user identified as Shine195, who expressed frustration with XRP’s lack of price movement and perceived it as underwhelming in comparison to Bitcoin. They criticized the continued positioning of XRP alongside BTC, asserting that XRP lags significantly in value and market performance. Such comments reflect a long-standing split within the community between those who focus on utility and those who prioritize asset appreciation. Local Utility as a Driver for Broader Adoption Mai’s video and the broader XRPL Japan Community Day serve as part of a larger strategy to advance the perception of XRP as more than just a speculative asset. By making it visible in ordinary, real-world contexts—such as buying tacos and drinks—advocates aim to underscore its transaction efficiency and simplicity. These grassroots applications help the public engage with the token outside the abstract discussions on blockchain or trading platforms. As more community events adopt similar practices, such demonstrations may serve as blueprints for broader adoption in retail and social settings.

This is how Robert Kiyosaki feels for the precious metal as of June 2025. In his most recent post from today on social media platform X, the famous author has touted silver as “ the best investment today, June 2025 ”. He’s currently waiting for gold and Bitcoin (BTC) to drop further before he can add more positions, but why the sudden shift to silver? The investor, who predicted the financial crash in 2008, believes that this is a prime time for accumulating silver. Part of his reasoning stems from the fact that gold and Bitcoin are near their all-time high levels, as of the moment of writing. He’s boldly stated that silver is currently a “ bargain” at these prices, and his predictions are that it could 2X, or even 3X this year. He has steadily been warning his followers of the next financial crash, which he thinks will be throughout the summer. FYI: Silver is the best investment today….june 2025.

He’s not shying away from the king crypto, as his predictions call for Bitcoin to reach $1M per coin, and he is not the only one who has made such high calls. Kiyosaki focuses more on the quantity of Bitcoin he has, and the number of ounces in gold/silver, as he has commented on a recent post of his. He has been accumulating since the price was $6000, and he “ wishes that he bought more ”. Kiyosaki has always been a Bitcoin bull, as he frequently discusses it across all of his social channels aimed financial literacy.

Estimates for Uniswap’s average price in 2028 range from $25.43 to $29.06. UNI’s average price in 2031 will be $45.41, with a maximum price of $47.22. Uniswap, a DeFi protocol founded in 2018 by former mechanical engineer Hayden Adams. The Uniswap exchange is a 100% on-chain automated market maker (AMM) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. The AMM allows DeFi users to swap ether (ETH) for any ERC-20 token without intermediaries, solving many liquidity problems most exchanges face.

Uniswap price analysis on the daily time frame The one-day price chart of Uniswap coin confirmed an undecided trend in the market. The UNI/USD value has elevated to a $6.27 high for the day. Green candlesticks on the price chart signify a returning buying momentum. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility.

Whereby, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $5.52. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the neutral region. The indicator’s value has been recorded at index 43.09 today. The undecided trend is represented by a flattening curve on the RSI graph. Further stability in the market can be expected if the buying momentum continues. Uniswap price analysis on 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Uniswap coin shows a mixed volatility as bears defend the EMA trend lines. The coin value has corrected to $6.27 in the past few hours. However, the decreasing volatility signifies relatively lower chances of an upcoming reversal. The Bollinger bands are converging, leading to a decrease in volatility. This decrease in volatility signals a lower market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $7.86, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $5.75, securing the support.

Uniswap price analysis gives a neutral prediction regarding the ongoing market trends as the coin’s price is slowly increasing after a strong correction that was observed until yesterday. If buyers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might aim for a surge toward $6.5. On the other hand, a failure to meet further buying demand might trigger a rejection. In such a case, UNI’s price might drop below immediate support channels and head toward the $5.8 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $23.01 level by 2027 and above $45.41 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing a slow recovery phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining value, and so is UNI. As buyers gained ground around $6.24, positive sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $10.90, while the average price is expected to be around $9.08. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.8 and $7.5; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $47.22 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

46601891,https://cryptonews.com/?p=373851,1750665714,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/46601891.jpeg,XRP ETF Approval Odds Jump to 95% — Spot Rally Incoming?,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-etf-approval-odds-jump-to-95-is-a-spot-rally-incoming/,"Bloomberg analysts now place the odds of an XRP spot ETF approval at 95%, fueling renewed speculation around institutional capital inflows and a potential shift in crypto market dynamics. Key Takeaways: Bloomberg analysts place XRP ETF approval odds at 95%, citing increased SEC engagement. Major firms like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton are backing XRP. Delays in approval could hurt US competitiveness. The updated projection shared by ETF specialists James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas follows growing regulatory engagement with multiple crypto ETF filings. Seyffart noted on X that increasing interaction from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is “a very positive sign,” as applications from major asset managers move forward. XRP Joins Solana, Litecoin, and Others in ETF Review Spotlight XRP is among a slate of digital assets under review, alongside Solana, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, and others. The SEC has already acknowledged XRP’s 19b-4 filings, with a final decision expected by October 17, 2025. Seyffart cautioned that while approval feels inevitable, the timeline remains unclear: “Could be something we’re talking about in the next month or two. Or it could be something that waits until October or later.” Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares are among the firms backing XRP ETF applications, signaling strong institutional support. Along with Solana and Litecoin, XRP now leads the field in projected approval probability, with others like Cardano, Dogecoin, and Polkadot assigned 90% odds. The analysts’ outlook reflects a broader trend: the SEC appears increasingly willing to treat many of these assets as commodities, potentially easing their path to regulated products. Still, the slow pace of movement has raised concern. Industry observers warn that delays could erode the U.S.’ competitive position in digital asset innovation. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 Proponents argue that faster approvals, especially for high-profile assets like XRP, would address rising investor demand and solidify regulatory clarity. On June 11, VivoPower, a publicly listed firm, announced a partnership with the Flare blockchain to generate yield from its XRP holdings. The move could indicate that institutional players are looking for ways to leverage their crypto assets without liquidating them. In May, VivoPower also invested $121 million in XRP as a strategic reserve, making it the first company in the world with an XRP-focused treasury. XRP Shows Signs of Price Compression XRP is trading around $2.015 as of June 23, showing signs of price compression following a sharp drop from recent highs above $2.30. The Bollinger Bands across the daily and 30-minute charts are tightening, indicating reduced volatility and a potential breakout setup. On the 1-day chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 43.68, signaling mild bearish momentum, but not yet oversold. The MACD remains slightly below the signal line with negative histogram bars, suggesting that sellers remain in control. Price has dropped below both the middle Bollinger Band and the 20-day SMA, which may act as resistance near $2.03 and $2.11. Zooming into the 30-minute chart, RSI has bounced to 52.19 with a bullish MACD crossover, indicating short-term strength. Support was found near $1.996, and a mild recovery has followed. In the 1-minute chart, momentum is mixed, with RSI hovering near 41.74 and MACD flattening out after a brief bullish attempt. If XRP holds above the $2.00 psychological level, a retest of $2.03 resistance is likely. A break below $1.996 could expose lower supports near $1.93.

46602166,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753637,1750665726,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46602166.jpeg,Global markets are barely reacting after Iran's retaliation. Here is why,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/global-markets-largely-unfazed-by-iran/,"Global markets are barely reacting after US President Donald Trump confirmed on Saturday that American forces struck Iran’s nuclear sites and Iran promised in turn to make the country suffer “severely” with its retaliation today. Iran also shut down its Strait of Hormuz, the most important oil route in the world, where 20 million barrels pass through every day. That’s around a fifth of global oil trade. What should have been a massive geopolitical shock barely moved the needle for traders, and investors appear convinced the situation is contained. According to CNBC, many believe it won’t spread beyond the region, and some even view it as bullish for risk assets like crypto. By press time, the MSCI World Index, which tracks large and mid-sized firms across 23 developed markets, had only dipped 0.12%. That mild drop came alongside strange behavior in so-called “safe” assets. The Japanese yen fell 0.64% against the dollar. Gold edged down by 0.23%, now sitting at $3,360 per ounce. Meanwhile, the US dollar index rose 0.35%. The message? This isn’t being treated like a crisis. Traders ignore Iran’s warning to close oil chokepoint Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush, said Trump’s attack on Iran has actually eased concerns for investors. “The markets view the attack on Iran as a relief with the nuclear threat now gone for the region,” he told CNBC. He also said he sees little chance of the conflict spreading further, calling the situation “isolated.” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, told CNBC, “It all depends on how Iran responds. If they accept the end of their military nuclear desires … then this could be the end of the conflict and markets will be fine.” Boockvar added that he doesn’t believe Iran will actually disrupt the oil flow. Marko Papic, chief strategist at GeoMacro Strategy, spelled out the real danger. If Iran blocks the strait, oil will shoot over $100, stocks could drop 10%, and investors will run to safety. But, he said, this is highly unlikely. “Markets are subdued now given the limited tools Tehran has at its disposal to retaliate,” Papic said. Iran’s threat to shut the strait isn’t new. They said the same thing in 2018 when the US left the nuclear deal. Back in 2011 and 2012, then–Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi floated similar threats. Nothing came of them. Papic added, “Tehran understands that, if they were to close the Strait, the retaliation from the US would be swift, punitive, and brutal.” China’s dependence limits Iran’s options The other factor keeping things calm is China. Iran relies heavily on China to buy its oil, and Beijing has no interest in a disrupted Gulf. Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights, said on CNBC’s Squawk Box Asia that the chances of Iran actually closing the Strait of Hormuz are “absolutely minimalistic.” She warned that Iran would turn oil-rich neighbors into enemies and put its entire economy at risk. Andrew Bishop, head of policy research at Signum Global Advisors, agreed. He said Iran won’t want to provoke China and risk retaliation on its oil infrastructure. “Disrupting supplies will also put a target on the country’s own oil production, export infrastructure, and regime,” he said, noting that both the US and Israel are currently “trigger-happy.” Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explained that China depends not just on Iran but on oil from the whole region. “Its national security interest really would value stabilization of the situation and a de-escalation enabling safe flows of oil and gas through the strait,” he said. While there’s no sign yet of military de-escalation, there’s also no sign of a blockade. The Joint Maritime Information Center confirmed that “US-associated vessels have successfully transited the Strait of Hormuz without interruption.” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, doesn’t think any of this has hurt the US bull market. “Geopolitically, we think that Trump has just reestablished America’s military deterrence capabilities,” he said. He expects the S&P 500 to reach 6,500 by the end of 2025, and he believes the destruction of Iran’s nuclear sites could lead to “radical transformation” in the region. For now, investors are calling Iran’s bluff. Markets remain calm. Crypto is steady. Oil still flows. And unless Iran does something more than talk, that’s unlikely to change.

Legal Structure for Bitcoin Reserve Approved The new law empowers the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to manage a dedicated Bitcoin reserve fund, which will be maintained outside the state treasury. Legislative appropriations, dedicated fees, investment income, and voluntary donations of cryptocurrency will support the fund. It introduces formal guidelines for the acquisition, custody, and liquidation of digital assets under state supervision. A key provision in SB 21 limits investments to digital assets with a minimum average market capitalization of $500 billion over the preceding 12 months, a criterion currently met only by Bitcoin. This restriction is designed to mitigate exposure to volatile or thinly traded tokens, effectively making Bitcoin the sole eligible asset for the reserve. Additional Measures to Protect State Crypto Holdings SB 21 follows the earlier passage of House Bill 4488, a complementary measure enacted to protect the state's Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency reserves from being absorbed into Texas’s general revenue fund. Without this legal safeguard, funds allocated for digital asset holdings faced the risk of being liquidated in 2025 to cover budgetary shortfalls. Together, the two pieces of legislation form a comprehensive framework: HB 4488 secures the legal status of Bitcoin reserves under state law, while SB 21 provides the operational authority to purchase and manage those assets. Policy Adjustments and Oversight Provisions During its progression through the legislature, SB 21 underwent several revisions. Notably, the House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency introduced clearer operational protocols, risk management guidelines, and limits on speculative investments using public funds. These amendments were aimed at addressing concerns over Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility and the fiscal prudence of allocating government resources to such assets. Broader Implications and Industry Response The decision to formalize Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset marks a notable development in state-level digital asset policy. Supporters argue that this move could enhance Texas’s financial resilience, act as a hedge against inflation, and position the state as a leader in digital asset integration within public finance. However, critics have flagged the initiative’s exposure to risks, including market volatility, regulatory shifts, and cybersecurity threats. Questions remain about whether allocating taxpayer resources to inherently speculative assets aligns with sound fiscal governance.

In his words, “SEC v XRP final decision could be delayed until late 2026.” The tweet has drawn attention due to its bold projection, despite the lack of any official confirmation or judicial documentation to substantiate such a delay. BALE’s statement remains speculative and is currently regarded as an unverified rumor. BREAKING SEC v XRP final decision could be delayed until late 2026 Huge month in August — BALE (@AltcoinBale) June 22, 2025 Procedural Developments Undermine Claim of Delay Contrary to BALE’s claim, the current legal status surrounding the SEC v. Ripple case suggests a more immediate resolution could be approaching. According to a June 21 report by Times Tabloid , recent filings in the Southern District of New York indicate a significant procedural step toward concluding the matter. Specifically, both Ripple and the SEC jointly submitted a renewed motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60. The motion requests Judge Analisa Torres to amend the final judgment, including reducing Ripple’s civil penalty from $125 million to $50 million, returning $75 million to the company, and lifting the longstanding injunction that has prevented institutional sales of XRP. This latest motion replaces an earlier request filed in May, which Judge Torres denied due to insufficient justification and procedural flaws. However, the June filing appears to have been more carefully constructed, citing “exceptional circumstances” such as changes in regulatory frameworks and a mutual interest from both parties to conclude the litigation without further delay. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additional Court Actions Indicate Imminent Decision In addition to the motion to amend the final judgment, the SEC and Ripple filed a status report with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on June 16. In it, both parties requested that the ongoing appeals and cross-appeals be placed in abeyance while Judge Torres considers the revised motion. The report included an agreement that the SEC would provide another update by August 15 if the motion remains pending. Although there is no specific legal deadline for Judge Torres to issue a decision on the revised motion, legal professionals following the case believe a resolution could arrive soon. Notably, Australian lawyer Bill Morgan and U.S. attorney Fred Rispoli have both projected that a ruling may come within weeks. Potential Outcomes and Conclusion of the XRP Case Should Judge Torres approve the motion, it would effectively restructure the penalty imposed on Ripple, formally dismiss all pending appeals, and dissolve the injunction on XRP’s institutional sales. This would lead to a limited remand to the Second Circuit to finalize and officially conclude the case. While it remains technically possible for judicial timelines to extend, current legal filings and professional assessments suggest that a final decision is more likely to occur within the near term.

The buyer appeared after nearly $80M in long liquidations for ETH. Whale activity remains significant for Ethereum (ETH), as whales are buying the dip. One newly created wallet withdrew 50,256 ETH from the Binance hot wallet, in tranches of 3,000 ETH. The whale started filling up the new wallet in the past 24 hours, after being first funded by a known Binance hot wallet. The whale started buying during one of the periods of rapidly sliding prices for ETH, when the asset wiped out more than 12% of its price. Its average entry was at $2,265 per ETH, starting from the beginning of the price slide. The whale activity suggests a rebound may be on the way, with predictions of a 25% price rally. The whale held only ETH valued at $112.8M, with a minimal amount of WETH. Buying ETH often precedes various forms of staking or usage as collateral to tap the current value and unlock liquidity. Large-scale ETH owners are cautious about taking profits, instead increasing their position and moving liquidity into DeFi. | Source: CryptoQuant Whales have also switched from panic-selling and liquidation to ongoing slow accumulation with the expectation of long-term ETH growth. Overall, whales have switched to accumulation since the end of 2024, with relatively small profit-taking in the past weeks. ETH shows signs of local lows The buying activity sets up expectations that ETH may be done with its downward correction, after nearly $80M in long liquidations in the past 24 hours. ETH open interest fell over the weekend following market volatility and liquidatoins, sliding to $14B from a recent level of $16B. Long positions are still over 75% of open interest, suggesting more liquidations could be instore. ETH traded at $2,239.78, sliding under its recent range. However, even ETH price crashes have led to additional buying from whales, with the goal of achieving a lower average price. ETH also rebounded from its lows against Bitcoin, once again returning to 0.022 BTC. Ethereum holders flock to big DeFi protocols Ethereum is becoming the playground of whales, with liquidity flowing to the top protocols. Based on DeFiLlama data, the Ethereum chain now locks around $57B in total value, with $125.67M in stablecoins. However, DeFi protocols are dominated by the three big sources of ETH passive income. LidoDAO holds over $20B, while Aave returned above $19B TVL. EigenLayer holds over $10B in ETH. The other DeFi protocols holding over $5B in value include Ethena, Ether.Fi and Spark. Lending remains near its peak, leading to whale accumulation and deposits into major protocols. ETH accumulation also follows the recent Pectra upgrade , as whales prepared for running the new larger nodes requiring 2,048 ETH. At the current price range, DeFi remains relatively safe from liquidations. Whales have rebuild lending positions with a high accumulation of liquidable loans at around $1,600, and another significant accumulation just above $1,000. For ETH, the current price action suggests more dips are possible, with most of the liquidable long positions at around $2,100. Liquidating short positions could bring ETH back above $2,300. For now, the overwhelming attitude for ETH is bearish, though still allowing for the occasional whale accumulation.

Speaking with Bitcoin Podcast host Stephan Livera at the BTC Prague conference, Back noted that the firm has rapidly doubled the amount of Bitcoin per share, reducing risk for investors. “In the case of MicroStrategy, we see that duration being 16 to 18 months. The stock has traded at twice its net asset value (NAV) at times. In that context, the premium seems reasonable,” Back said. According to Back, the premium in the stock prices of companies holding Bitcoin treasury is not theoretical, but a natural result shaped by market conditions. He pointed out that companies' issuance of new shares at this premium and the purchase of Bitcoin increases the amount of BTC per share. “These companies buy more Bitcoin thanks to the premium, thus increasing the amount of Bitcoin falling to shareholders,” he said. Describing MicroStrategy’s strategy as “an arbitrage between the fiat world and the future of Bitcoin,” Back stated that this method does not put investors at risk in the long run because the company compensates for this premium with Bitcoin. Related News: Watch Out: In the Middle of a Busy Week, There Are Lots of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List However, Back noted that smaller companies trading at a higher premium pose a greater risk of volatility. Giving the example of MetaPlanet, Back said the company’s NAV multiple fluctuates between 5 and 10, which can stress investors. However, he emphasized that such companies can be more agile in accumulating Bitcoin due to their smaller size. He added that being located in regulatory advantageous regions such as Japan can also facilitate this process. Back, who also opposed Bitcoin's “diminishing returns” theory in his speech, drew attention to the anomalies experienced in previous cycles. Arguing that factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, China's mining ban and money supply expansion overshadowed the 2020-2021 cycle, Back said that historical data could be misleading for this reason. Stating that there could be an “S-curve”-like acceleration in Bitcoin adoption, Back suggested that this cycle could trigger widespread adoption, unlike in the past, and break previous patterns. Back, who also spoke about Blockstream’s new initiatives in the last part of the conference, explained that with the company’s new application, users will be able to buy Bitcoin directly to their own wallets. He also stated that they are trying to make self-storage more accessible with Jade and Jade Plus hardware wallets. “Self-custody is critical to the decentralization of the Bitcoin network. People holding their own keys is crucial to the security and control of the network,” Back said. *This is not investment advice.

Monthly volumes have surged from under $100 million in early 2023 to over $3 billion by 2025, representing a 30-fold increase in just two years. The study, drawing on data from 20 leading fintech companies including Reap , offers the most comprehensive insight to date into the global adoption of stablecoins for cross-border payments. Reap , Asia’s leading stablecoin-enabled financial technology provider, is proud to have contributed transaction-level insights for the B2B segment, one of the fastest-growing use cases for stablecoins. Reap observed a significant acceleration in stablecoin-funded card transactions during the latter half of 2024. This surge indicates that stablecoins have expanded their use case beyond the crypto ecosystem. “Stablecoins are no longer limited to the Web3 space, they’re becoming a credible alternative for global business finance,” said Daren Guo, Co-Founder of Reap. “We’re proud to contribute real-world transaction data to this pivotal report. From remittances across Asia to cross-border payments in Mexico, stablecoins are enabling faster, more efficient global flows and Reap is building the frictionless, stablecoin-enabled infrastructure to support them.” The report also identifies key geographic corridors driving stablecoin flows. The most active transactions originate from the USA, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Japan, and the UK. Notably, the Singapore-China corridor stands out as the most active route for stablecoin flows. Both Hong Kong SAR and Singapore frequently feature in these transactions, underscoring their significance as regional financial hubs. “As an early Venmo engineer who wrestled with mountains of payment code, seeing money transfer simplified to just a few lines with stablecoins is revolutionary. My years in fintech and crypto have convinced me: stablecoins are the future of payments, and Reap is leading this transformation by leaps and bounds.” Anthony Yim, Co-founder of Artemis. Reap’s regional growth closely mirrors the global trends outlined in the Artemis report. The company’s growing footprint across Asia and beyond reflects strong demand for stablecoin infrastructure in high-volume corridors. This alignment further validates the growth potential of stablecoins transactions within the markets Reap operates in. Download Stablecoin Payments from the Ground Up here .

46607116,https://invezz.com/?p=2773444,1750670450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,These 4 meme coins will outperform BTC once Fed starts cutting rates,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/23/these-4-meme-coins-will-outperform-btc-once-fed-starts-cutting-rates/,"If the Federal Reserve slows rate hikes and finally signals cuts, the crypto market could erupt—and meme coins might be leading the charge. Bitcoin is a slow-moving mothership. It moves billions, but the real fireworks often come from the meme coin trenches when markets shift to a risk-on stance. These tokens have rabid fan bases, cult-like communities, and social media buzz strong enough to move markets. And with the Fed hinting at a potential pivot, meme coins are entering full pre-pump mode. Here are four meme coins perfectly positioned to outrun Bitcoin in a rate-cut rally—and they’re not waiting around for the party to start. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A meme chain built to moon Stage 3 of its presale is live, and at just $0.0012 per token, it’s setting the pace for 2025’s biggest meme-driven breakout. This isn’t your typical frog-themed gamble. LILPEPE is launching its own dedicated Layer-2 blockchain, explicitly built for memes. It features anti-bot technology, ultra-low fees, and a launchpad allowing communities to create meme tokens in minutes. It’s like PEPE but with infrastructure. Presale momentum is electric. Over $1.4 million has been raised already in Stage 3, with 1.3 billion tokens sold in under 24 hours. And if that wasn’t enough, the team has just announced a jaw-dropping $777,000 giveaway, with 10 lucky winners each receiving $ 77,000 in $LILPEPE . You must complete a few social tasks and earn big while you share the word. With a starting price under a penny, upcoming exchange listings, and a real Layer-2 chain in the works, LILPEPE could dwarf Bitcoin’s upside in the short term. If BTC pulls a 2x on rate cuts, LILPEPE could pull a 200x. BONK: Solana’s wildcard with real volume What makes BONK special is its community. The project sits squarely inside Solana’s ecosystem, buzzing on Twitter and Discord, and already plays nice with Solana NFTs and DeFi. Its branding is sharp, the memes hit hard, and the growing social hype isn’t just smoke. OKX even praised Bonk’s “creative energy and active user base” as key drivers of growth. BONK still trades under a penny, but analysts are targeting late 2025 levels near $0.0000288, which represents a nearly 2x increase from current levels. If the Fed loosens up and the market swings to a risk-on stance, BONK could ride Solana’s wave straight to new highs. Think of it as Dogecoin’s younger, faster cousin—and one with way more left in the tank. FLOKI Inu: The veteran with the Viking Army Currently, FLOKI boasts a $730 million market capitalization and a daily trading volume of $37 million. However, what truly sets it apart is the ecosystem it’s built: a play-to-earn game (Valhalla), a DeFi suite (FlokiFi), a merchandise and NFT marketplace, and even a crypto education platform. The community has helped push FLOKI to multiple all-time highs, and with 20% of the supply staked, the loyalty runs deep. Stakers are even earning up to 20% APY—try getting that from your bank if the Fed cuts rates. Speculators believe FLOKI could easily double or triple from current levels in a bull run, and with Elon’s dog as its namesake, the meme fuel is limitless. FARTCOIN: The wildcard going full gas Born on Solana, driven by humor, and fueled by viral AI backstories, this coin exploded in late 2024 with a 370% pump from its lows—and it hasn’t slowed down since. And when word dropped that Coinbase might list FARTCOIN, the price rocketed past $1, pushing the market cap over $1 billion. FARTCOIN now has a passionate base, real volume, and the kind of chart setup meme traders live for (rounded bottom, clean breakout, and loads of liquidity). In a meme-fueled bull run, this could be 2025’s most ridiculous—and most profitable—ride. Final thought: Meme coins were built for Fed pivots Bitcoin might be the store of value, but meme coins are the store of velocity. If the Fed starts cutting rates, expect retail to go wild—and these four tokens are sitting at the intersection of utility, narrative, and sheer meme magic. If you’re waiting for a signal, this is it. LILPEPE, BONK, FLOKI, and FARTCOIN are warming up for liftoff.

Skeptical traders are dismantling the project’s pitch—calling out its anonymity, over-marketed presale mechanics, and lack of working products. For every glowing thread praising Ruvi AI’s “potential,” there’s a growing pile of posts warning it's a familiar setup: all hype, no proof. The project boasts big presale returns and a sleek whitepaper filled with buzzwords like “AI multi-tool,” “decentralized governance,” and “community-led growth.” But what Redditors are seeing behind the curtain doesn’t add up. There's no visible team, no GitHub code commits, and no evidence that the promised tech even exists beyond mockups and vague timelines. Investors are being asked to buy in early, without an audit report in hand or clarity around how their funds are being used. This article dives into the growing rift between perception and reality—from Ruvi’s risky tokenomics and delayed audit to its missing leadership—and shows why many in the crypto community are now looking toward safer, fully-audited projects like XYZVerse as a more transparent alternative. Ruvi AI’s Presale Hype Faces Harsh Reality Check Amid mounting optimism surrounding Ruvi AI’s presale and blockchain‑AI ambitions, a wave of skepticism is emerging on Reddit, particularly in r/CryptoScams. Users warn the project bears classic scam signals: anonymity, aggressive marketing, and questionable withdrawal mechanics. One Redditor bluntly wrote: Source: www.reddit.com Despite Ruvi AI’s marketing claims—highlighting community‑driven development and advanced tools—Reddit users remain unimpressed. One warned: Source: www.reddit.com These critiques highlight persistent concerns: No clear team or credentials – Users note the project’s leadership remains opaque. Hard‑sell tactics via WhatsApp/ads – Many view inbound WhatsApp messages and social ads as red flags. Withdrawal “fees” or “taxes” to unlock funds – Often seen among exit‑scam models to prevent cash‑outs. Tokenomics: Too Good to Be True? Ruvi AI’s tokenomics center around a fixed total supply of 5 billion $RUVI tokens, with 30% allocated to a multi-phase presale. The presale tiers feature aggressive bonuses — with big buyers receiving up to a 100% match and guaranteed post-sale price jumps from $0.015 to $0.07, suggesting a 366% instant upside. Beyond the presale, 25% of tokens are earmarked for user rewards, 15% for treasury, another 15% for partnerships and growth, and 10% dedicated to liquidity. The roadmap also promises staking perks and a decentralized governance model. On paper, it feels engineered for early investor gratification. However, the lack of any vesting for presale tokens raises immediate concerns. Early buyers get full control from day one — a mechanism that could invite instant sell-offs and volatility. A detailed critique from r/TheHolyCoins found the whitepaper “heavy on marketing polish” but light on fundamental safeguards like vested token release, raising suspicion that rapid gain structures may outpace genuine utility. Audit in Progress — But Delayed Amid mounting optimism from presale profits, Ruvi AI has reportedly secured a smart contract audit from well-regarded firm Cyberscope. The initial announcement says the audit is underway, aiming to bolster credibility and ensure contract safety. Still, the delay of the formal report until after the presale is a red flag: investors are asked to commit funds before any third-party validation occurs. Some promotional articles tout the Cyberscope audit as already “boosting credibility,” but those appeared before any independent audit report was published, raising the question: is Ruvi marketing its own press release as validation? Until the audit is fully released and independently verified, assurance remains theoretical at best. Why XYZVerse Feels Safer and More Transparent Than Ruvi AI In the crowded and often chaotic world of crypto presales, XYZVerse stands out as a rare example of a project actually delivering transparency, security, and real utility—qualities that Ruvi AI, despite its aggressive marketing and high presale numbers, still struggles to convincingly demonstrate. At the heart of this contrast is trust. XYZVerse has completed full KYC verification and undergone comprehensive smart contract audits by top-tier firms like SolidProof and Pessimistic—resulting in clean audit reports that explicitly confirm both the absence of critical vulnerabilities and the authenticity of the team behind the project. Ruvi AI, by comparison, has announced an audit from Cyberscope, a respectable blockchain security firm, but the full report remains pending until after presale completion. While this announcement marks progress, relying solely on a forthcoming report is a far cry from the documented assurance and immediate transparency that audit reports bring. Real-World Utility vs. Vaporware Utility is XYZVerse 's next trump card. It already powers a live, on-chain sportsbook (bookmaker.XYZ) that has processed over $100 million in bets and serves more than 20,000 active users—a concrete, working product. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is still operating in anticipation mode: there are no live decentralized applications, no beta testing, and no functional product visible beyond marketing materials and roadmap promises. Tokenomics: Structured vs. Suspicious When it comes to tokenomics, XYZVerse again shows greater discipline. Its total supply of 100 billion tokens is clearly allocated: 17.9% presale, 17.1% reserved for burns, 15% for liquidity and exchange listings, 10% for the team and development, and 10% dedicated to staking and ecosystem growth. Each allocation is tied to specific wallet addresses—transparent, on-chain, and verifiable. Ruvi AI, by contrast, has revealed only its total supply of 5 billion tokens with 30% reserved for presale, but offers no public supply breakdown, no vesting schedules, and no clarity on how presale funds are channelled. Fundraising transparency further differentiates the two. XYZVerse has publicly documented over $14 million raised in a multi-stage presale, complete with dashboard-tracked price tiers and verifiable transactions. Ruvi AI’s $1.6–1.8 million presale is impressive in headline terms, but lacks proof: no on-chain receipts, no wallet records, and no third-party validation to substantiate the claimed figures . Finally, the roadmap narrative is telling. XYZVerse marches toward a Token Generation Event (TGE) in the second half of 2025 and planned exchange listings at approximately $0.10 per token—with each milestone carefully laid out and progress regularly tracked. Ruvi AI’s roadmap, by contrast, has already seen major elements—like token release schedules and team visibility—pushed back or quietly removed without any accountability or updated timelines. Verdict: XYZVerse Sets the Standard, Ruvi AI Fails to Meet It While Ruvi AI continues to draw attention through aggressive marketing, its lack of team transparency, absence of a working product, delayed audit, and unverifiable fundraising leave investors with more questions than answers. In contrast, XYZVerse offers a model of presale accountability—featuring a fully KYC-verified team, independent audits from SolidProof and Pessimistic, on-chain sportsbook utility already live, and publicly traceable token allocations. It has raised over $14 million through a documented, milestone-driven process and continues to build with transparency at every level. Until Ruvi AI matches that level of visibility and delivery, it remains speculative at best—and a cautionary example of why serious investors are turning to projects like XYZVerse.

The crypto community on Reddit has voiced significant concerns, suggesting that the project might be more about speculative hype than genuine technological advancement. The Concerns Raised by the Crypto Community Reddit forums, particularly those dedicated to uncovering scams, have been vocal about Ruvi AI's approach, which includes aggressive marketing and a lack of transparency about the team and technology behind it. The absence of verifiable information has led many to question whether the project is trustworthy. Source: www.reddit.com Marketing vs. Material: Scrutinizing Ruvi AI's Claims Ruvi AI's marketing materials boast of a revolutionary blockchain-AI fusion, promising significant returns and technological breakthroughs. However, deeper inspection reveals numerous red flags: No transparent team disclosure. Over-reliance on buzzwords and conceptual promises without tangible output. Funding use remains unclear, with no audit reports or financial transparency. Source: www.reddit.com Comparative Analysis: XYZVerse's Approach to Transparency and Security Contrasting sharply with Ruvi AI, XYZVerse highlights how trust and reliability are built in the crypto space. With fully disclosed audits and a clear, KYC-verified team, XYZVerse showcases a commitment to transparency that Ruvi AI currently lacks. XYZVerse not only has a comprehensive audit trail but also offers immediate, tangible products to its users, marking a significant difference from Ruvi AI's yet-to-materialize promises. Tokenomics and Project Viability While Ruvi AI presents a tempting tokenomics model, it's important to critically assess the sustainability and real-world utility of such models. XYZVerse provides a more structured and feasible economic framework, with clear allocations and planned use of funds that enhance project viability and investor confidence. Conclusion: Navigating Hype vs. Substance in Crypto Investments The contrast between Ruvi AI and XYZVerse serves as a powerful example for investors in the crypto space. While flashy marketing and lofty promises can attract initial attention, the longevity and success of blockchain projects rely heavily on transparency, verified technology, and a responsible approach to user engagement and financial management.

46605620,https://finbold.com/?p=247595,1750670535,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,R. Kiyosaki warns of ‘global monetary collapse’,https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-warns-of-global-monetary-collapse/,"Robert Kiyosaki , the outspoken author of Rich Dad Poor Dad and longtime critic of fiat monetary systems, has reignited debate over the future of global finance with a bold new warning issued via X on June 23. Labeling the current environment as the “biggest debt bubble in history,” Kiyosaki cautioned that a global monetary collapse may be on the near horizon, and that only those holding tangible, hard assets will avoid being caught flat-footed. “GLOBAL MONETARY COLLAPSE COMING?” he wrote. “Will you be richer or poorer when the biggest debt bubble in history bursts? I recommend owning gold, silver, and BITCOIN… Biggest losers will be savers of fake fiat money and especially bonds.” While Kiyosaki has long been critical of fiat currency debasement and central bank interventionism, this most recent statement signals a sharpening of tone. Rather than positioning collapse as a long-tail risk, he now frames it as an imminent systemic event, raising the stakes for passive investors still parked in government paper or low-yielding cash. Gold and Bitcoin on hold, Silver takes center stage In a follow-up post later that day, Kiyosaki clarified his tactical allocation: “Silver is the best investment today… June 2025. Gold and Bitcoin are high and I am waiting for a correction before adding more.” FYI: Silver is the best investment today….june 2025. Gold and Bitcoin are high and I am waiting for gold and Bitcoin to crash before I add to my position. That’s what I think. Do your own research. Take care. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 This shift is notable. While Kiyosaki remains structurally bullish on both gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ), his current focus on silver suggests a conviction that the market is underpricing its monetary and industrial role. Silver remains significantly below its inflation-adjusted high of $50, and despite strong fundamentals, including tightening supply and surging demand for industrial applications, it continues to trade with elevated volatility and low institutional positioning.

33767162,[object Object],1750670761,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Recovers from Dip Under $100K After US Attack on Iran – Why BTC Bull Token Could Explode Next,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-remains-strong-as-btc-bull-token-soars/,"Bitcoin ($BTC) bounced back to $101K late Sunday, shaking off losses incurred after US and Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites early that morning. Amid the chaos, BitMEX’s Arther Hayes predicted that $BTC will rebound thanks to ‘its safe haven status.’ As $BTC looks to strengthen its position as a store of value, now could be a prime time to eye BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , one of the best long-term crypto to hold . $BTCBULL will distribute free $BTC when the #1 crypto reaches key targets. As such, you can capitalize on the success of the world’s largest crypto, now worth ~$102K , for less than a cent. $BTC Survives Geopolitical Shock, Holds Key Support Levels Over the weekend, $BTC briefly dipped below $98.5K following US and Israeli airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Dubbed ‘Operation Midnight Hammer,’ the strikes targeted key sites in Iran’s nuclear infrastructure – Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan – using more than 125 warplanes and bunker-buster munitions. The shockwaves rippled through the crypto market. Yesterday, $ETH plunged ~10% , and assets like $SOL, $XRP, and $DOGE fell to multi-month lows. $BTC, however, rebounded quickly. After dropping from a ~$103K high to a ~$98K low, it has since stabilized at ~$102K. Ahead of Bitcoin’s rebound, Hayes suggested that further money printing will prompt investors to turn to $BTC to protect against inflation. Additionally, 0x Research’s Markus Thielen said that as long as $BTC remains above the short-term realized price of $98K and the $100K trend support, ‘ traders can continue to look for tactical rally opportunities .’ Crypto trader DonAlt also noted that $BTC is mimicking gold’s 2024 breakout , consolidating below key resistance before a potential surge. If history repeats itself, it could be on the verge of a major move. As $BTC strengthens its position as digital gold, $BTCBULL offers a way to tap into the OG coin’s upside every time it climbs. $BTCBULL Raises $7.3M+ Ahead of Handing Out $BTC $BTCBULL is gaining significant traction, having already snagged over $7.3M on presale. It’s attracting hype over the real $BTC airdrops it offers when the crypto leader hits major milestones: $150K and $200K. Plus, when $BTC hits $250K, holders can claim a share of a massive 2.1B $BTCBULL airdrop. Since Hayes predicts $BTC could hit $250K by this year’s end, these rewards might be just around the corner. To qualify for the airdrops, you only need to hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet , a top non-custodial crypto wallet . To enjoy lower fees while using the wallet, purchase a bit of $BEST , its native token. To earn more passive income, you can stake $BTCBULL at a commendable 56% APY. $BTCBULL also has planned deflationary token burns at $125K, $175K, and $225K, aiming to reduce supply and potentially boost its value. With whales dropping $31.9K , $20K , and $14.3K into the presale recently, major industry players clearly see $BTCBULL as having serious upside potential. Win Free $BTC as It Solidifies Its Role as a Safe-Haven Asset $BTC’s swift recovery after a significant black swan event shows how resilient it is as a safe-haven asset. With Hayes, Thielen, and DonAlt all pointing to bullish $BTC signals, market momentum is building. If their predictions hold, the next big breakout could be moments away. As such, there’s no better time to grab some $BTCBULL and earn free $BTC when it hits new highs. You can buy $BTCBULL on presale for just $0.002575. If market conditions remain favorable, it could reach $0.06467 by year’s end , marking an ROI of 2,411%. This isn’t financial advice.

Changpeng Zhao (CZ) took to X to raise the alarm after CoinTelegraph and CoinMarketCap (CMC) were both hit by hackers. His message is simple: be careful with WalletConnect and think twice before trusting even familiar sites. Read on to know more. CMC and CoinTelegraph Compromised The warning follows a pair of security breaches that hit the crypto world hard. On June 21, the crypto security tracker @realScamSniffer reported that CoinTelegraph’s frontend had been compromised, with malicious code found in its ad system. CZ quickly responded, linking this to an earlier attack on CoinMarketCap which, importantly, is owned by Binance. “2 days ago CMC, now CT. Hackers are targeting information web sites now. Be careful when authorizing wallet connect,” CZ posted. According to his post, the CMC hack led to 39 victims and a total loss of $18,570. He also confirmed that CoinMarketCap will cover all losses. That’s a small sum by crypto standards, but the method of attack, targeting trusted info sources, is what really matters here. It’s not just wallets and exchanges anymore. Even crypto media isn’t safe. 2 days ago CMC, now CT. Hackers are targeting information web sites now. Be careful when authorizing wallet connect. For CMC, based on initial on-chain analysis, there are 39 victims with a combined loss of $18,570. @CoinMarketCap will cover all losses. https://t.co/egkekyjAYQ — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 23, 2025 CZ: “Everything Before an ATH Is a Dip” In a separate tweet, CZ turned to the market – offering a subtle take on where things might be headed next. He didn’t mention Bitcoin directly, but the message was clear: “Everything before a new all-time high is a dip.” That may sound bullish, but CZ added a catch. He said only a small number of strong coins are likely to reach new ATHs. His advice is to look for projects with long-term staying power and real growth potential. For context, Bitcoin’s last ATH was on May 22, when it hit $111,970. CZ Reacts to Elon’s Bold AI Plan CZ also weighed in on another big tech headline. Elon Musk’s announcement about the next version of Grok, his AI chatbot. Musk says Grok will try to rewrite all of human knowledge, correcting errors and adding what’s missing before retraining on the new data. CZ responded, “I look forward [to seeing] how this initiative will play out,” and noted that it’s a “highly debated issue.” He didn’t say more, but the tone suggests he’s watching closely and maybe a bit skeptical. All in All When CZ speaks up – especially on scams, market trends, or major tech moves – it’s worth paying attention. This time, his message is loud and clear: double check what you click, think long-term, and don’t blindly trust the platforms you’ve always used.

With this in mind, traders can look to the week's major events that could affect markets. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress is likely to be the main event. Powell will probably be grilled by Republican party members for not cutting interest rates and ""costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars,"" as President Donald Trump has repeatedly said in his Truth Social posts. Powell, however, is expected to reiterate the Fed's independence and the data-dependent path forward for rates. Traders will closely watch Powell's take on the interest-rate trajectory, given the backdrop of Trump-appointed Fed Governor Christopher Waller's recent comments that interest rates could be reduced in July. ""With the market's pricing of future inflation well anchored, early cracks emerging in the labor market and housing activity evidently weak, there are reasons for the Fed to consider adopting a dovish shift in the July FOMC meeting and guiding towards a cut in September — a path already priced into the U.S. swaps market,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said on X . Dovish hints could prompt more risk-taking in financial markets, boding well for BTC, which has held mainly above $100,000 throughout the recent escalation of conflict in the Middle East. Markets expect the Fed to deliver two 25 basis-point cuts this year, but the take is not unanimous/ ""We continue to think that clarity on the inflation story — whether tariffs are a one-off price shock or if they prompt more sustained inflation pressures — may not come before the December FOMC meeting, meaning we will see just one rate cut this year,"" analysts at ING said in a note to clients Friday. ""However, if the jobs market continues to weaken, that may well be a 50bp cut."" Core PCE On the data front, the core personal-consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, scheduled for release on Friday, is the marquee release. According to Pepperstone, the consensus is for the data to show a 0.1% month-on-month increase in May, resulting in an annualized growth rate of 2.6% and a three-month annualized rate of 1.6%. Expectations of a benign 0.1% increase support the Fed rate cut bets; however, according to ING, the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs is expected to kick in from July. Trump's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, announced in early April, is set to expire on July 9, following which the heavy 'Liberation Day' tariffs take effect. So far, the president has made a deal with the U.K. and announced a trade framework with China. Beijing is yet to sign the deal and the European Union remains quiet. Iran tensions are not over yet While the oil market is calm for now, Iran could inflict damage even without closing the Strait of Hormuz, a trade route that carries about a fifth of the world's oil. By constantly threatening the closure of the strait alone, Iran could push up shipping insurance costs, ultimately adding to oil prices. The cost to insure a vessel for the journey via the Strait of Hormuz has already risen from 20 cents a barrel to 80, a report by South China Morning Post said, quoting the Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers. ""By planting enough belief that they could disrupt this key logistical channel, maritime costs could rise to the point that it would have a significant impact on the supply of crude and gas,"" Weston noted.",Markets|Bitcoin|Powell|Markets|Inflation|US|Economy|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-23 09:28:45

Many of its critics called it an experiment that would fail. Those critical voices were vindicated when the FTX exchange shut down. It seemed like SOL was now a loss. However, what saved Solana (SOL) was that it was built on utility and practical solutions. Over time, it continued to rise and shot past $100. Since then, it has continued to grow, and in January 2025, it reached a new all-time high of $294. The gains of Solana (SOL) prove that utility always wins in the end. It is the reason why investors are looking at projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which are built on utility. The main difference between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Solana (SOL) is that MUTM tokens are still at their bargain-basement price. Investors are rushing to secure their tokens, expecting explosive growth that is driven by pure utility. If you are looking for your biggest score in the crypto world, MUTM tokens should be your go-to purchase. A Deep Dive into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project was conceived as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders on the protocol provide utility, while borrowers join pools to take loans. The interest rate in the pools is decided by market forces of demand and supply. As more borrowers join a pool and use up more assets relative to the total value of assets in the pool, the interest rate rises. A rising interest rate causes borrowers to repay loans, while also pushing more lenders to deposit liquidity in a pool. Consequently, the interest goes down. This self-sustaining loop ensures that the ecosystem achieves optimal capital efficiency. To protect the liquidity of the pools, all loans must be overcollateralized. That simply means that borrowers deposit assets of a higher value than the loans they take. The exact levels of collateralization are decided by protocol parameters. These parameters include the liquidation threshold and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Unstable assets like meme coins will usually get more conservative parameters. That ensures that there is enough of a buffer for liquidators to act in time and purchase the debt at a discount. To ensure that liquidators act as fast as possible, the incentive they receive will be variable. It can be adjusted upward as needed. The protocol will also use a reserve factor. This is where a portion of the interest paid by borrowers goes into a common pool. The reserve factor can be set as high as 35% for unstable assets, and as low as 10% for more stable assets. Funds in this reserve factor will be used to stabilize the ecosystem during periods of heightened market volatility. To ensure the long-term survival of the ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to engage in liquidity mining. This is a process where they offer rewards to liquidity providers. One of the immediate impacts of that program is that it will lower borrowing costs, helping to improve protocol participation. Additionally, they plan to implement a buyback-and-distribute program. In this program, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will purchase MUTM tokens off the open market. These purchases will help boost the price of MUTM tokens, helping to boost the project’s profile and boosting user participation. To have the most impact, these purchases will be limited to high-value assets that are in high demand. Low-value assets will not be added to the liquidity mining program due to their outsized impact on the stability of the ecosystem. The MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a massive success so far. It has raised around $10.95 million from around 12,350 unique investors. So far, about 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have been sold, barely two weeks after they went on sale. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03 each, a massive 50% discount to the listing price of $0.06. The token price is set to go up by 16.67% in the upcoming phase to $0.035 per token. One of the main reasons for the current pace of the presale is the planned beta version launch.

This move has sparked questions about the status of the high-profile partnership and the ambitious plans for new hardware. What Triggered the Removal of OpenAI Deal Promotions? The immediate cause for OpenAI pulling these materials appears to be a legal challenge. According to reports, the removal stems from a Trademark lawsuit filed by another company, IYO, which also operates in the AI device space. The lawsuit centers on the name ‘io’, which was apparently being used by the venture involving OpenAI and Jony Ive . A judge has reportedly issued a restraining order specifically targeting the use of this name in promotional materials, leading to their swift withdrawal from OpenAI’s website and YouTube channels. This situation highlights a growing challenge in the rapidly expanding AI sector: the crowded landscape of names and intellectual property. As more startups enter the fray, conflicts over branding and trademarks are becoming increasingly common. Is the Jony Ive Partnership and OpenAI Deal Still On Track? Despite the removal of promotional content, sources close to the matter suggest the underlying OpenAI deal with Jony Ive and the device venture remains active. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the partnership is ‘on track and has NOT dissolved or anything of the sort.’ This indicates that while the specific ‘io’ branding is facing legal hurdles, the core collaboration between Sam Altman’s OpenAI and Jony Ive’s design firm is intended to continue. The partnership between OpenAI and Jony Ive , announced with considerable fanfare, aims to bring Ive’s renowned design philosophy to the world of artificial intelligence hardware. The vision is reportedly to create consumer devices that offer novel ways for people to interact with AI, moving beyond traditional screens and interfaces. This legal snag, while potentially delaying promotional efforts, doesn’t necessarily signal the end of this ambitious project. Understanding the Trademark Lawsuit by IYO The Trademark lawsuit brought by IYO against OpenAI and its venture focuses on potential consumer confusion. IYO, an existing player in the AI device market, argues that the use of the ‘io’ name by the OpenAI/Ive venture is too similar to their own branding, potentially misleading customers about the origin or affiliation of the products. A report in Bloomberg Law indicated that the judge presiding over the case was receptive to IYO’s argument that OpenAI’s promotional video might already be causing this confusion. Key aspects of the lawsuit include: Plaintiff: IYO, an existing AI device maker. Defendants: OpenAI and the venture involving Jony Ive. Core Issue: Trademark infringement based on the name ‘io’. Legal Action: Request for a restraining order to prevent the use of the disputed name in promotions. Judge’s Stance: Indicated openness to the argument of consumer confusion based on existing promotional material. This legal challenge underscores the importance of thorough trademark searches and clearance in the early stages of launching new products or ventures, especially in crowded and rapidly evolving markets like AI hardware. Why is an OpenAI AI Device Significant? OpenAI’s potential foray into physical hardware with an AI device represents a strategic shift for the company, moving beyond its software and API offerings. Partnering with a design luminary like Jony Ive signals a serious intent to create consumer products that are not only technologically advanced but also intuitively designed and aesthetically appealing. The significance lies in several areas: New Interaction Paradigms: An OpenAI device could explore innovative ways users interact with AI, perhaps through voice, gesture, or other non-traditional interfaces, making AI more accessible and integrated into daily life. Hardware-Software Synergy: Bringing hardware and software development under one roof (or a close partnership) can lead to optimized performance and unique features not possible with software alone. Market Expansion: Entering the consumer hardware market opens up new revenue streams and allows OpenAI to compete in a different arena than its current enterprise and developer-focused models. Setting Design Standards: With Jony Ive’s involvement, the device could set new design benchmarks for the nascent AI hardware category. For the cryptocurrency and broader tech community, this move is interesting as it shows how core AI technology is expected to manifest in tangible products, potentially creating new ecosystems where digital assets or decentralized technologies could play a role in the future. Challenges and Opportunities in the AI Device Space While the prospect of an OpenAI AI device is exciting, the path is fraught with challenges. The current Trademark lawsuit is a prime example of the legal hurdles involved. Other challenges include: Hardware Development: Designing, manufacturing, and distributing hardware is complex, costly, and requires different expertise than software development. Market Competition: The AI device market, while young, is attracting significant interest from tech giants and startups alike. User Adoption: Convincing consumers to adopt new types of devices requires demonstrating clear value and ease of use. Privacy and Security: AI devices handling personal data raise significant privacy and security concerns that must be addressed rigorously. However, the opportunities are substantial. A successful AI device could tap into a massive potential market, redefine human-computer interaction, and solidify OpenAI’s position as a leader not just in AI models but also in their practical application in daily life. The involvement of Jony Ive specifically addresses the critical challenge of design and user experience, which is often a weak point for technology-first companies. Actionable Insights from the OpenAI Trademark Lawsuit For founders, investors, and observers in the tech and AI space, the situation offers several insights: Prioritize Legal Due Diligence: This case is a stark reminder that trademark and intellectual property checks are crucial early in the startup process, especially when choosing a name. Understand Market Crowding: The AI sector is booming, leading to potential name conflicts. Be prepared for potential legal challenges related to branding. Partnerships Add Complexity: High-profile partnerships like the OpenAI deal with Jony Ive bring significant attention, which can also magnify legal issues when they arise. Hardware is Hard: Moving into physical products involves manufacturing, supply chain, and new legal risks (like hardware-specific IP) distinct from software. Market Sentiment vs. Reality: The initial panic around the pulled videos contrasted with reports that the deal is still on track highlights the need to look beyond initial headlines and seek confirmation from reliable sources. While this specific legal issue pertains to a name, it serves as a cautionary tale about the complexities involved in bringing ambitious AI projects, particularly those involving hardware, to market. What’s Next for the OpenAI and Jony Ive Collaboration? With the Trademark lawsuit ongoing and a restraining order in place regarding the ‘io’ name, the venture will likely need to rebrand its device or project. This requires time, effort, and potentially new marketing materials. The focus will now shift to how quickly they can resolve the legal issue or pivot to a new name, and whether this setback impacts the planned timeline for the development and launch of their AI device . The partnership between OpenAI and Jony Ive remains a fascinating development to watch. It combines cutting-edge AI research with world-class design expertise, holding the potential to create truly innovative products. Navigating this legal challenge successfully will be a key test for the collaboration. Concluding Thoughts: A Minor Setback or a Sign of Deeper Issues? The removal of promotional materials due to a Trademark lawsuit is undoubtedly a setback for the OpenAI deal with Jony Ive and their planned AI device . It highlights the legal complexities inherent in a rapidly evolving market. However, if reports are accurate that the core partnership is intact, this may prove to be a temporary hurdle requiring a simple rebranding, rather than a fundamental issue with the collaboration or the product vision itself. The situation serves as a valuable case study on the intersection of innovation, high-profile partnerships, and the often-overlooked challenges of intellectual property in the tech industry.

Strategy’s founder and Bitcoin advocate, Michael Saylor, congratulated the move, replying to Cardone with, “Congratulations on acquiring 1000 BTC.” The American real estate mogul revealed that the $5B group currently had over 14.2K units to its name and was looking forward to adding 5K units this year, along with another purchase of about 3K BTC. The strategy combines cash-flowing real estate with Bitcoin’s long-term upside, creating a portfolio that Cardone described as “two best-in-class assets.” The Cardone Capital Group said it was ready to partner with Grant to invest in “cryptorized” real estate. Cardone Capital invests $15.6M in BTC to diversify beyond real estate On June 20th, the group revealed that it acquired 150 BTC worth around $15.6 million as part of its plan to diversify holdings beyond real estate. Grant had claimed almost a week earlier, on June 14th, that real estate market was broken and he was going to fix it using the real estate/BTC model. He said this as the group unveiled a $1.6 billion five-year dual-asset investment strategy that would increase Bitcoin investments and reduce focus on real estate. Grant further explained that this was the fifth fund this year, and the “Boca Deal” was almost filled. A summary infographic report showed that the group planned to reduce real estate allocations from 77% in year one to 45% in year five. It also showed that BTC allocations would increase from 33% to 66% within the same period. The data also revealed that the company had so far invested nearly $100 million in Bitcoin and over $1 billion in real estate, with plans to increase future investments by a minimum of $5 million. According to the Cardone Capital Group, its initial BTC position allocated $290 million to buy 2.914K BTC at an average price of $100K per BTC. The group claimed that additional BTC would be purchased using $140 million of monthly cash flow from real estate holdings within the next five years. The company added that it would invest in institutional-grade cold storage to ensure security and align its long-term BTC hold strategy with macro Bitcoin market cycles. Cardone joins a growing list of institutions adopting Bitcoin reserves A U.S. SEC filing earlier this month revealed that Hong Kong-based real estate and logistics company Reitar Logtech planned to purchase up to $1.5 billion in Bitcoin as part of its treasury diversification strategy. John Chan, Chairman and CEO of Reitar Logtech, said the treasury diversification initiative emphasized his company’s commitment to maintain a strong financial foundation while scaling its global logistics technology platform. DDC Enterprise also raised approximately $528 million to accelerate its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company’s founder, Chairwoman, and CEO, Norma Chu, said the funding was expected to propel DDC into one of the top global corporate Bitcoin holders. Prenetics also became the first healthcare firm to launch a Bitcoin treasury strategy with a $20 million BTC purchase. The company acquired 187.42 BTC at an average price of $106,712 and stated that its board had approved allocating the majority of its $117 million balance sheet to Bitcoin. Prenetics plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings through institutional capital partnerships and to implement advanced return strategies. It also plans to accept Bitcoin payments across its direct-to-consumer platforms, including IM8 Health and CircleDNA. Metaplanet , Strategy, Tesla, MARA, and others continued to acquire more BTC as two academic researchers, Murray Rudd and Dennis Porter, predicted that Bitcoin could soar to $4.3 million by 2036 if these institutional buying trends continued. Rudd and Porter employed pure mathematical modeling to analyze Bitcoin’s market dynamics.

Congratulations on acquiring 1000 BTC. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 21, 2025 Cardone Capital’s entry into Bitcoin comes as 132 publicly listed companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up from 89 in April. Their combined holdings exceed 800K BTC and are worth over $88 billion. The real estate titan’s decision to pursue 4,000 total Bitcoins represents over $400 million in digital asset exposure at current prices. Source: Cryptonews This institutional adoption wave has accelerated dramatically following Bitcoin’s rally to $111,965 in May, spurring companies across diverse industries to race for Bitcoin exposure while investor appetite remains strong. Institutional Bitcoin Buying Frenzy Reaches $1.5B Monthly Peak June 2025 has witnessed an extraordinary surge in corporate Bitcoin accumulation, with major institutional players deploying over $1.5 billion across multiple high-profile purchases. This represents the largest monthly corporate buying spree in Bitcoin’s history. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has emerged as the most aggressive buyer, adding 1,111 Bitcoin for $118.2 million just days ago , bringing their total holdings to 11,111 BTC valued at over $1.07 billion. The company’s ambitious 210,000 Bitcoin target by 2027 would represent approximately 1% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply, with CEO Simon Gerovich declaring this “Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy Bitcoin.” MicroStrategy continues leading the corporate adoption charge with multiple purchases throughout June, including 10,100 Bitcoin for $1.05 billion , bringing their total holdings to approximately 592,100 BTC worth over $60 billion. The company’s relentless accumulation strategy has inspired a global wave of imitators, with healthcare company Prenetics investing $20 million for 187.42 BTC , Norwegian firm K33 targeting 1,000 BTC through a $9 million share issue, and UK-listed Smarter Web Company adding 45.32 BTC to reach 168.08 total holdings. This buying wave is geographically diverse, spanning Japan’s capital markets to Europe’s regulated exchanges and North America’s public companies. Most notably, Metaplanet’s financing mechanisms include 555 million moving-strike warrants capable of raising $5.4 billion to facilitate massive Bitcoin accumulation strategies. The company’s quarter-to-date Bitcoin yield of 107.9% has attracted significant institutional attention, and its stock has surged over 408% year-to-date. Technical Analysis Reveals Critical Resistance Despite Institutional Support Despite the massive institutional buying pressure, Bitcoin’s technical structure reveals signs of weakness, suggesting the current rally may be losing momentum. Source: TehThomas on TradingView The hourly chart analysis shows Bitcoin experiencing a “fake-out” following an initial sweep higher that failed to sustain momentum. The asset is currently trading around $101,988 after breaking down from an ascending channel pattern. The breakdown of this technical structure occurred despite massive institutional capital injection, indicating that supply pressure from existing holders may be overwhelming the new institutional demand. The 15-minute timeframe provides even more granular evidence of supply-demand imbalance, with Bitcoin trapped within a distribution pattern where red supply zones are successfully containing rallies while demand zones around $98,500-99,500 represent the next major support confluence. The order flow data also reveals a telling pattern of aggressive selling activity at resistance levels above $100,800, with multiple red entries indicating that sellers are using any strength to distribute positions. This suggests that while institutional purchases provide temporary support, the prevailing market structure favors sellers capitalizing on institutional buying to exit positions. The detailed hourly analysis with order flow shows Bitcoin testing the critical $100,000 psychological barrier while facing resistance from the 65-period exponential moving average at $102,451 and the 200-period EMA at $104,109. The time and sales data reveal consistent selling pressure, with green buy entries quickly absorbed by red sell entries at higher price levels. This indicates that institutional buying may occur at technically disadvantageous levels. The combination of broken technical support around $103,000-104,000, bearish moving average configuration, and negative order flow dynamics suggests that Bitcoin could face continued downside pressure toward $98,000-99,000 despite the institutional capital injection.

A survey of 730 Gen Z and Millennial investors by financial advisory giant deVere Group found that 73% of respondents preferred Bitcoin. According to deVere CEO, Nigel Green, Bitcoin and gold are not rivals but “ radically different assets ” and solve different problems. “Gold is stability. Bitcoin is growth. If you want to build and protect wealth over the long term, you should be holding both.” The survey aligns with several other studies that imply a seismic shift from traditional investments toward Bitcoin’s dominance as a safe-haven asset. For instance, on-chain analytics company CryptoQuant revealed in January that over 60% of cryptocurrency investors are aged between 25 and 44 years old. “The momentum behind Bitcoin among younger investors is undeniable ,” says Green. “They see it as digital gold – borderless, accessible, and aligned with the future.” Bitcoin Enthusiasm is Growing Younger investors view Bitcoin as a “cornerstone of modern portfolios,” the survey noted . The younger cohort gets attracted to transparency, portability, and potential for exponential surge. Respondents also said that Bitcoin’s operation outside the traditional banking system is a notable advantage. “This generation is right to question the old models. But diversification is timeless,” said Green. Last week, the CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, Hunter Horsley, posted on X, comparing Bitcoin to US Treasuries, rather than gold. “I don’t think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being gold,” he wrote. “Rather, I think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being U.S. Treasuries and other governments’ bonds.” I don't think Bitcoin's competition is going to end up being gold.

He also stressed that Bitcoin is moving toward broader acceptance, particularly after spot ETFs and broader corporate adoption, adding legitimacy and fresh demand. “We’re living through a rare convergence,” Green added. “You have the old guard doubling down on gold, and the new guard surging into Bitcoin. Both are being driven by the same core fear: erosion of purchasing power.

In just two weeks, he lost over $35 million by trading Bitcoin. What’s surprising is that he was often right about market direction, but still walked away with huge losses. So, what exactly went wrong? And what can other traders learn from his mistakes? From $39M to $4M – The Shocking Slide It all began on June 8, when AguilaTrades created a new wallet and moved $39.18 million worth of USDC from Bybit to Hyperliquid, a trading platform used for perpetual BTC contracts. His strategy was bold: he went long on Bitcoin, betting that the price would keep rising. How did AguilaTrades( @AguilaTrades ) lose over $35M in just 2 weeks? 1/ Let's take a closer look at his trades — and see what lessons we can learn. https://t.co/LeSb2QO0PX pic.twitter.com/xt7nGnZJsu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 23, 2025 Initially, things looked good. On June 9, he opened a large long position on Bitcoin as the price started climbing. His unrealized profits soon reached a peak of $5.76 million. But instead of locking in those gains, he held on, waiting for more. That wait cost him dearly. Ignoring the Signs – And the Losses Pile Up As geopolitical tensions rose due to the Israel-Iran conflict , the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply. Aguila was forced to close his long position, this time with a $12.47 million loss. But he didn’t stop there. Just six days later, on June 15, he went long again. Once more, BTC climbed, and his gains hit $10 million. And once again, he didn’t sell. But, when the market turned, his profits vanished, and he walked away with another $2.95 million in losses. Then came June 20. Another long position. Another rally. Another chance to cash out, this time with $3.2 million in profits. But he didn’t take it. As Bitcoin dropped again , his losses deepened to a painful $17 million. Change in Strategy—But Too Late After three failed long trades, he finally flipped his strategy and went short, betting that Bitcoin would drop. Unfortunately, Bitcoin bounced, and his losses added another $2.33 million.

Key Takeaways: A new whale opened a $100M ETH long on Hyperliquid using 25x leverage. The position has $800K in unrealized gains but carries high risk due to full capital exposure and tight margin. Hyperliquid continues to attract bold traders like James Wynn. According to onchain data , the trader deposited 4.28 million USDC and immediately deployed the capital into a 25x leveraged long, amounting to 44,523 ETH. The entry price for the position was $2,247.22, with ETH currently trading around $2,266, resulting in unrealized gains of over $800,000. High-Stakes Ethereum Long Bet on Hyperliquid Faces Liquidation at $2,196 The high leverage bet comes with a liquidation level set at $2,196, a relatively narrow margin in current market conditions. The position appears under a cross-margin setting, allowing full capital exposure. The wallet shows no spot, vault, or staked assets beyond this single perpetual contract, underscoring the size and risk concentration of the trade. The funding rate on the trade currently stands at a minor loss of -$2,509.93, which indicates moderate market sentiment skew. A newcomer gambler, 0x916E, deposited 4.28M $USDC into #Hyperliquid and opened a 25x leveraged long on $ETH an hour ago. The position reached 44,523 $ETH ($100.4M), with a liquidation price of $2,196. https://t.co/8u5DW0D4Vj pic.twitter.com/NjrSPoWRM3 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 23, 2025 The activity suggests growing interest from high-net-worth participants willing to take directional bets on Ethereum’s short-term trajectory. Hyperliquid, a rising player in the perpetual DEX market, has increasingly become a hub for large leveraged positions. One trader who found fame through extravagant bets on the platform is James Wynn, who turned a $7,000 PEPE wager into more than $25 million. Riding that wave, he began trading perpetual futures on Hyperliquid in March, despite having no prior experience with derivatives. In less than a month, Wynn claimed to have grown a $3 million position into $100 million through high-leverage trades, attracting massive attention from the crypto community. However, the turning point came in May, when Wynn opened a $1.25 billion long position on Bitcoin using up to 40x leverage. A geopolitical tweet from former President Trump caused markets to turn, triggering Wynn’s liquidation. His massive bet was wiped out, leaving him with nearly nothing. Ethereum Staking Surges Despite Market Slump As reported, Ethereum staking has reached a new milestone , with more than 35 million ETH, over 28.3% of the total supply, now locked into the network’s proof-of-stake system. Over 500,000 ETH was staked in just the first half of June. The trend signals a shift in investor behavior, with many opting to earn yield rather than sell at current prices. Currently, more than 25% of all staked ETH is handled by liquid staking giant Lido, while Binance and Coinbase account for 7.5% and 7.4%, respectively. Coinbase has also emerged as Ethereum’s largest node operator, controlling over 11.4% of staked ETH via its validators. Notably, Ethereum is witnessing its most intense whale accumulation in seven years, with large wallets adding over 871,000 ETH in a single day on June 12. This marks the highest daily inflow in 2025 and has pushed total holdings in 1,000 to 10,000 ETH wallets past 14.3 million ETH, according to Glassnode.

""Whale Rush!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-falls-amid-us-iran-tensions-this-altcoin-soars-whale-rush/,"Following the US attack on Iran, tensions in the Middle East rose rapidly. Retaliation from Iran was immediate and the Iranian Parliament approved a bill to close the strategically important Strait of Hormuz. While these developments were taking place, there were significant declines in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins. While these declines were taking place, an altcoin attracted attention with its rise. According to data, blockchain-based open intellectual property project Story (IP) rose while Bitcoin and altcoins fell. Following this rise, the altcoin was announced by the X account. This announcement excited investors and also increased the price. Accordingly, Story (IP) increased investors’ expectations by showing a strong increase of over 10% amid the downtrend in the cryptocurrency market. “Notifications are on. Big things are coming. Soon.” Following this mysterious post and the rise, whales’ IP interest also increased. According to Lookonchain’s post, two whales have purchased $47.5 million worth of IP in recent days. Accordingly, one whale bought $17.8 million and the other bought $29.7 million. Story (IP) continues to trade at $3, up more than 10 percent in the last 24 hours. 2 whales have accumulated 16M $IP ($47.52M) recently. Whale 0x9921 accumulated 6M $IP ($17.82M).

According to portfolio disclosures dated 20 June, Cathie Wood’s investment firm sold 609,175 CRCL shares across three of its funds—ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). This latest move comes after a 20.4% spike in Circle’s stock price on the same day. Based on market value, the divestment was worth approximately $146.2 million, marking ARK’s largest single-day exit from the stablecoin issuer since its shares went public. The breakdown includes 490,549 shares from ARKK, 75,018 from ARKW, and 43,608 from ARKF.

Earlier in the week, the firm had sold $52 million worth of shares on 16 June and another $45 million on 17 June, both following price upticks. These transactions appear to be part of a broader strategy of profit-taking during CRCL’s volatile ascent in the public markets. Since its listing at $31 per share, CRCL has skyrocketed more than 400%, now trading near $240. Circle remains a top holding for ARK Invest Despite the significant sales, ARK Invest continues to be a major Circle shareholder. The firm initially acquired 4.5 million shares shortly after the company went public and still retains more than 3.2 million shares. At current prices, ARK’s remaining stake is worth about $779 million, placing it as the eighth-largest holder of CRCL stock. Circle now features prominently in ARK’s portfolio alongside other core positions, including Tesla (TSLA) and Robinhood (HOOD). This latest sale, while substantial, appears to be part of an ongoing portfolio rebalancing rather than a full exit. IDG-Accel China leads Circle’s shareholder base Circle’s shareholder registry is still topped by the Beijing-based IDG-Accel China Capital Fund II, which holds 23.3 million shares, making it the company’s largest shareholder by a wide margin. Compared to ARK’s holdings, IDG-Accel has maintained a long-term strategy, with no recent publicised sell-offs. The massive gains in CRCL stock have led to increasing scrutiny over investor behaviour, especially as more institutional players take profits in the wake of rallies. Yet the stock remains volatile and continues to draw speculative interest, with ARK’s trades serving as a bellwether for sentiment shifts among large-cap fund managers.

According to media reports , the decision was announced following its latest monthly meeting, with officials confirming that the launch will take place at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson. Executive Director Anthony Apollo described WYST as a “public good” and reiterated that all interest earned from the token’s reserves would be transferred quarterly to the state’s School Foundation Fund. WYST will be fully backed by a mix of U.S. dollars, Treasury securities, and repurchase agreements. The Commission has previously confirmed that WYST will be overcollateralized to maintain a stable 1:1 peg with the dollar. A multi-year journey First floated in 2022 by Wyoming lawmakers , the concept of a state-issued digital token has since transformed into a legislated and technically mature initiative. The idea was formalised in March 2023 with the passage of the Wyoming Stable Token Act, which established the legal framework and created the Wyoming Stable Token Commission to oversee the project. Initial test deployments of WYST began in early 2024 across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and scaling solutions such as Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. However, those test tokens held no monetary value and were used solely to validate the functionality and performance of the underlying infrastructure. WYST technical foundation Over the past months, the state has tapped a number of prominent blockchain firms to aid in its efforts. Back in May, the Commission partnered with Inca Digital Federal LLC to enhance risk monitoring and ensure compliance with federal and state standards. Under this agreement, Inca provides real-time analytics, threat detection tools, and market intelligence to help safeguard the token’s operations from fraud and other illicit activity. A month later, the Commission identified Solana and Aptos as the two leading blockchain platforms for hosting WYST after narrowing down an initial list of 11 candidates. Both networks met the state’s requirements around high throughput, low fees, and strong vendor support after the test phase . Solana was selected for its high-throughput, production-proven architecture capable of sub-second finality. Aptos was chosen for its modular upgrade capabilities and its use of the Move language, which enhances security through resource-oriented programming. LayerZero, the cross-chain messaging protocol, will also play a key role in facilitating WYST’s interoperability across supported blockchains. The platform allows tokens to move securely between networks without the need for traditional centralized bridges, reducing exposure to common vulnerabilities and improving user experience. In his latest comments, Apollo said WYST may be deployed across multiple blockchain networks via LayerZero.

Recently, a development caught attention when OpenAI pulled promotional content related to its much-discussed partnership involving a new device io startup . While this might initially suggest issues with the collaboration, the reality points to a specific legal hurdle. Why the Promotional Video Disappeared: A Trademark Dispute The reason behind OpenAI removing a video highlighting the friendship between Sam Altman and Jony Ive , alongside their planned device venture, stems from a legal issue. According to reports, a judge issued a restraining order specifically concerning the use of the name ‘io’. This court action was triggered by a trademark dispute . The complaint was filed by a company named ‘iyO’. This entity originated from Alphabet X, Google’s ‘moonshot factory’. ‘iyO’ is developing its own product: generative AI-powered earbuds. The core of the trademark dispute is the potential for consumer confusion between ‘io’ and ‘iyO’, particularly given the promotional activities by OpenAI that used the ‘io’ name. What This Means for the Jony Ive Partnership and io Startup Despite the legal action and the removal of promotional materials, the significant partnership between OpenAI , Sam Altman , and Jony Ive involving the io startup remains intact. Reports indicate that the deal is still progressing as planned and has not been dissolved. OpenAI itself confirmed this, stating that the court order relates only to the use of the ‘io’ name in certain materials. OpenAI has publicly acknowledged the situation, updating their original announcement page with a note about the temporary takedown due to the court order following the trademark complaint from ‘iyO’. While they comply with the order, OpenAI has also stated they do not agree with the complaint and are reviewing their legal options. This indicates a potential ongoing legal battle over the naming rights. For now, the focus is on resolving the naming issue, allowing the collaboration between OpenAI , Sam Altman , and Jony Ive to continue developing the planned device under the io startup umbrella, even if the final product name needs adjustment or the legal challenge is fought. Navigating Legal Challenges in Tech Ventures This incident highlights a common challenge faced by new ventures in the tech space: intellectual property and naming rights. As companies develop products and brands, ensuring unique and legally defensible names is crucial. A trademark dispute can disrupt marketing, branding, and even product launches, requiring significant time and resources to resolve. While the specific video is no longer on OpenAI ‘s official platforms, it reportedly remains accessible on other sites, such as X (formerly Twitter), illustrating the difficulty of completely removing information once it’s public. The situation underscores the importance of thorough legal checks during the early stages of naming and branding a new company or product, especially when high-profile figures like Sam Altman and Jony Ive are involved, drawing significant public attention. Conclusion: A Minor Setback for a Major Partnership The removal of promotional content due to a trademark dispute over the ‘io’ name is a temporary setback for OpenAI and the venture with Jony Ive and the io startup . Importantly, the core deal and the collaboration between these influential figures remain on track. While OpenAI navigates this legal challenge, the focus on developing innovative hardware continues. This event serves as a reminder that even major tech initiatives can face unexpected hurdles related to intellectual property.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level.

The decline marked a significant reaction to heightened geopolitical tensions, with risk assets broadly under pressure. However, the sub-$100,000 level proved short-lived. BTC recovered during early Monday trading in Asia, rebounding to around $101,871 at the time of writing. The swift recovery underscores ongoing market sensitivity to geopolitical developments, while also highlighting the strength of near-term technical support. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and other major altcoins extended last week’s losses. Bitcoin now hovers near a key support level at $100,000. A decisive close below this threshold could signal a deeper correction, with the next downside target near Sunday’s intraday low of $98,200. Market participants remain cautious, with geopolitical risk continuing to drive volatility across both crypto and traditional asset classes. In this volatile environment, one early-stage project that has consistently garnered investor interest is Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale continued to see strong inflows even in this risk-off environment. Middle East tensions weigh on sentiments The Israel-Iran conflict entered its 11th day on Monday, June 23, with Israel’s military confirming strikes on surface-to-surface missile launch sites in western Iran. The development follows a significant escalation on June 13, when Israel carried out large-scale attacks targeting Iranian missile infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and senior military officials. Aerial assaults continued into Monday, intensifying after the US launched bunker-buster bomb strikes over the weekend on three of Iran’s nuclear sites. The Trump administration has described the strikes as a targeted effort to degrade Tehran’s nuclear capabilities. President Donald Trump declared that the US operation had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, though senior officials noted that it remains too early to fully assess the extent of the damage. Iran has sharply condemned the US involvement, accusing Washington of crossing “a very big red line.” Tehran responded with a warning that it would retaliate against what it sees as direct American aggression. Despite the military escalation, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the administration “does not seek war” and reiterated an interest in returning to diplomatic engagement. Bitcoin Pepe shows strength The crypto market has experienced heightened volatility in recent months, marked by sharp rallies, steep corrections, and fluctuating investor sentiment. Amid this backdrop, the Bitcoin Pepe presale has remained resilient, continuing to draw consistent capital inflows. The sustained interest suggests the project may be well-positioned to navigate current market conditions. Billed as the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe aims to redefine meme tokens by combining Bitcoin’s base-layer security with the scalability features more commonly associated with chains like Solana. This integration of infrastructure strength with cultural relevance sets it apart from many meme tokens that lack underlying technical substance. To support the growth of its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has formed strategic partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. The project’s dual approach—merging functional utility with meme-driven momentum—is gaining market traction. The development team has also shared visuals of ongoing infrastructure progress to enhance transparency and build trust. The presale has already raised over $15.3 million, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0416. The token is set to be listed on MEXC and BitMart, a move expected to boost liquidity, increase visibility, and reinforce market credibility. An additional listing announcement is anticipated on June 30, adding to investor interest as the presale nears completion.

46607079,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=171230,1750672213,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46607079.jpeg,Shocking Crypto Market Dip: Geopolitical Events Trigger $1B Liquidations & Bitcoin Price Fall,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-market-dip-liquidations/,"BitcoinWorld Shocking Crypto Market Dip: Geopolitical Events Trigger $1B Liquidations & Bitcoin Price Fall The cryptocurrency market experienced a sudden and significant downturn, sending ripples of concern through the investment community. This latest crypto market dip appears closely linked to escalating global tensions, specifically following reports of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The swift reaction across digital asset prices highlighted the market’s sensitivity to external geopolitical factors, leading to substantial losses for many holders. Geopolitical Events Trigger Market Turmoil While often touted as a decentralized and uncorrelated asset class, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have shown increasing sensitivity to macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. The recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites served as a stark reminder of this connection. Such events typically trigger a ‘risk-off’ sentiment across global financial markets, where investors tend to move away from perceived higher-risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies towards safer havens like gold or government bonds. The news broke, and the immediate reaction in the crypto space was a sharp price decline across the board. This rapid sell-off demonstrated how quickly external, non-crypto-specific events can influence market dynamics and investor behavior. Massive Crypto Liquidations Exceed $1 Billion One of the most dramatic consequences of the sudden price drop was a cascade of crypto liquidations . According to data reported by The Block, citing CoinGlass figures, daily liquidations surged past the $1 billion mark. Liquidations occur in the leveraged trading market. Traders use borrowed funds to increase their position size. If the market moves against their position significantly, their collateral is insufficient to cover potential losses, and the exchange automatically closes their position. The scale of over $1 billion in liquidations within a 24-hour period underscores the severity and speed of the market correction. This event primarily impacted traders holding long positions (betting on prices going up), who were caught off guard by the sharp downturn. Mass liquidations can also exacerbate price falls, as the forced selling adds further downward pressure on the market. Understanding liquidations is crucial for anyone involved in leveraged crypto trading. It highlights the inherent risks associated with using borrowed capital in such a volatile environment. The $1 billion figure serves as a powerful illustration of the financial leverage present in the market and the potential consequences of sudden price swings. Bitcoin Price Fall: A Brief Dip Below $100k As the market reacted to the geopolitical news and subsequent liquidations, the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), experienced a notable Bitcoin price fall . According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin briefly dipped below the significant psychological and technical level of $100,000. This marked the first time BTC had traded below this threshold in approximately 45 days, causing concern among investors who had grown accustomed to its recent stability above this level. While the drop was sharp, Bitcoin showed some resilience, quickly rebounding to trade around $100,735.18 shortly after. This relatively swift recovery from the sub-$100k level suggests underlying buying interest remains, or that the initial panic selling subsided relatively quickly. However, the breach of this key level, even if brief, signals increased volatility and potential uncertainty in the near term. Bitcoin’s ability to hold relatively steadier compared to other assets during such downturns is often attributed to its larger market capitalization and deeper liquidity. However, even the market leader is not immune to significant price movements triggered by major external events. The Altcoin Market Reaction: Bigger Losses While Bitcoin saw a significant price fall, the impact on the broader altcoin market reaction was even more pronounced. Altcoins, which are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, generally experienced larger percentage losses during this downturn. This is a common pattern observed during crypto market corrections. Why do altcoins often suffer more? Higher Volatility: Altcoins, especially smaller-cap ones, are typically more volatile than Bitcoin. Their prices can swing more dramatically in either direction. Lower Liquidity: Many altcoins have lower trading volumes and less liquidity than Bitcoin. This means that relatively smaller sell orders can have a larger impact on their price. Risk Perception: In a ‘risk-off’ environment, investors tend to flee towards perceived safer assets. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is often seen as the least risky asset compared to the vast and diverse altcoin market. Leverage: High leverage in altcoin perpetual futures markets can lead to cascading liquidations that accelerate price declines. The recent dip highlighted this disparity, with many altcoins seeing double-digit percentage losses while Bitcoin’s drop was comparatively less severe. This reinforces the idea that while altcoins offer potential for higher returns, they also come with significantly higher risk, particularly during periods of market stress. Impact on Bitcoin ETF Inflows The market dip also coincided with a change in the trend for Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). After a notable nine-day streak of positive inflows, June 20 saw a dip in inflows. Coupled with the subsequent price fall, this suggests the inflow streak may come to an end on June 23, depending on the day’s activity. Consistent ETF inflows have been a significant bullish factor for Bitcoin in recent months, indicating growing institutional and traditional investor interest. A pause or reversal in this trend, even if temporary, could signal a shift in short-term sentiment or a reaction from institutional players to the increased market volatility and the broader geopolitical impact crypto is experiencing. Monitoring ETF flows remains a key indicator for gauging institutional participation and sentiment in the Bitcoin market. Understanding the Geopolitical Impact on Crypto The notion that cryptocurrencies are entirely detached from traditional finance and global politics is increasingly being challenged. While their underlying technology is decentralized, their price is determined by supply and demand within a market that is populated by participants who are also affected by global events. Here’s how geopolitical events can influence crypto: Impact Factor Explanation Risk-Off Sentiment Global instability causes investors to reduce exposure to perceived risky assets, including crypto. Safe-Haven Narrative Conversely, some view Bitcoin as a potential safe haven during times of currency devaluation or political instability, although this narrative is debated and not always reflected in price action during global crises. Sanctions & Regulations Geopolitical conflicts can lead to discussions or implementations of stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies to prevent their use in illicit activities or circumventing sanctions. Economic Uncertainty Events impacting global trade, energy prices, or economic stability can influence overall market liquidity and investor confidence, affecting crypto demand. The recent dip underscores the importance of considering the broader global landscape when analyzing cryptocurrency market movements. While internal factors like technological developments and adoption rates are crucial, external forces can trigger significant and rapid price changes. Conclusion: Navigating Volatility in the Crypto Market The recent crypto market dip , triggered by geopolitical tensions and resulting in over $1 billion in liquidations and a temporary Bitcoin price fall below $100k, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the digital asset space. The amplified altcoin market reaction further highlights the varying risk profiles within the ecosystem. While painful for those caught off guard, such events are not uncommon in this relatively young and rapidly evolving market. Investors should understand that external factors, including geopolitical impact crypto , can significantly influence prices. Managing risk, avoiding excessive leverage, and maintaining a long-term perspective are often cited as prudent strategies when navigating these turbulent periods. As the market digests the impact of recent events, vigilance and informed decision-making remain paramount.

Honeypot v2 boasts Permissionless Refereed Tournaments (PRT), an intriguingly-named fraud-proof system. It’s designed to ensure rollup resistance to Sybil attacks without forcing networks to rely on permissioned validators or heavy hardware. And it’s not the only innovation that can be found under the hood of the Honeypot dapp. Cartesi Sweetens Honeypot When Cartesi first launched Honeypot on Ethereum two years ago, the dapp effectively gamified security testing, transforming a laborious process into something more rewarding. It achieved this by implementing a community-incentivized audit and hacker battlefield. Despite these flourishes, there’s serious business being taken care of in the background. In the time that’s elapsed since Honeypot’s release, rollups have come to play an increasingly important role in onchain activity and the economic value that passes through them has soared. By processing transactions away from the main Ethereum chain, rollups allow network users to take advantage of greater throughput and lower costs. But security on these Layer-2 solutions is paramount, particularly when they’re obliged to “roll up” multiple transactions into a single batch and submit them to Ethereum. As for where Honeypot comes into all this, the app is designed to challenge the security of Cartesi rollups. Can anyone hack the application to obtain the funds locked in the rollup contract? So long as those funds remain untouched, Honeypot – and by extension Cartesi – is working as expected. The Canary in the Coalmine Honeypot is essentially the canary in the coalmine: an early warning system designed to alert blockchain users should a Cartesi rollup run into a problem. Since any project can spin up its own Cartesi rollup, the benefits of Honeypot extend far beyond Cartesi itself. As Cartesi Founder Erick de Moura explains, “Honeypots allow projects to commit their own funds to validate the integrity of their fault proofs before asking others to rely on them. It’s a gradual, transparent path toward trustless security that reflects the values this ecosystem was built on.” If Ethereum is to scale further – which by Vitalik Buterin’s admission it desperately needs to – it will fall to rollups to do a lot of the heavy lifting. Honeypot thus has a major role to play in giving projects confidence that their rollups are working as intended by allowing them to test their inviolability.

Filed in a Delaware bankruptcy court, the objection argues that the massive claim has no merit and should be thrown out entirely. FTX Calls Out 3AC’s Risky Bets 3️⃣ What really melted Over 13th – 14th June 2022 the account fell by $282M because: • Crypto prices tanked (‑$222M) • 3AC themselves yanked out another (‑$60M) FTX didn’t “seize” anything. — MBottjer (@Mbottjer) June 22, 2025 In a new court filing, FTX lawyers slammed 3AC’s claim as “illogical and baseless,” arguing the hedge fund knowingly made high-stakes bets on rising crypto prices. When the market crashed in 2022, those leveraged positions imploded, but FTX says that doesn’t mean other creditors should cover 3AC’s losses. 3AC’s claim is based on its account balances as of June 12, 2022, alleging that FTX held and then liquidated $1.53 billion in assets. But FTX disputes those numbers, saying the real crypto balance was only $1.02 billion and that 3AC had $733 million in liabilities. After market downturns and 3AC’s own $60 million in withdrawals, FTX claims only $284 million remained, far from the billion-dollar claim. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance’s CZ Issues Urgent Scam Alert: Is Crypto Media at Risk? , Liquidation Was Legal — and Beneficial? FTX also clarified that it only liquidated $82 million in 3AC’s assets, which was allowed under existing credit and margin agreements.

Moreover, 3AC now has until July 11 to respond to FTX’s objection, with a hearing set for August 12. Meanwhile, both firms continue battling in courtrooms around the globe, 3AC is chasing a $1.3 billion claim against Terraform Labs, while FTX is on a mission to claw back funds through a wave of lawsuits.

That contender is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a meme coin rewriting the rulebook and gaining momentum at a speed that’s now impossible to ignore. While ADA and TRX continue to build on their legacy frameworks, LILPEPE is attracting new waves of investors with a potent combination of price potential, infrastructure innovation, and cultural appeal. And if early metrics are any indication, this meme coin isn’t content with short-term hype—it’s aiming for dominance. Cardano and Tron: Slowing Giants? Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) have spent years trying to solve the blockchain trilemma of scalability, decentralization, and security. Cardano trades at $0.61 as of this writing. 4.45 million addresses holding ADA, but user growth has plateaued over the past year, with minimal increases in active addresses. Tron, on the other hand, trades at $0.27. Tron’s high TVL is primarily driven by USDT ($62 billion in 2024), with 28% of transactions originating from small retail holders. This dependence on stablecoin activity, rather than diverse dApp ecosystems, limits organic growth in other areas. Both projects are showing signs of maturity—and that’s not necessarily a good thing for investors hunting for 10x, 50x, or even 100x returns. ADA, while improving its smart contract ecosystem through recent upgrades, remains sluggish in terms of adoption. TRX has performed better in terms of transaction volumes, but regulatory uncertainty and a centralized perception have limited its upside. That’s why newer, more agile tokens like LILPEPE are capturing attention, especially from investors willing to take calculated risks for massive upside. LILPEPE: The Meme Coin Built for Utility and Speed Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is not just another meme coin riding on viral energy. It’s one of the rare projects in the space that combines a humorous, community-driven brand with real technological ambition. Deployed on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, LILPEPE has already raised over $1.3 million during its presale, having quickly sold out both of its first two stages. It’s now in Stage 3, priced at just $0.0012, and the momentum continues to build. What separates LILPEPE from traditional meme tokens—and even some utility-focused altcoins—is its plans to launch a dedicated Layer 2 blockchain solely for meme coins. This L2 network is designed to be the fastest and most cost-effective chain on the market, featuring native sniper bot protection —a much-needed innovation in a space where bot front-running has become a significant problem for retail investors. It doesn’t stop there. LILPEPE’s blockchain will also feature a meme coin launchpad, making it the go-to ecosystem for emerging projects in the same space. In effect, it’s not just creating a token—it’s building the foundation for the next generation of meme-driven blockchains, with LILPEPE at the center of it all. Major Exchange Listings and Viral Growth Another key differentiator is LILPEPE’s exchange strategy. While ADA and TRX already trade on most major platforms, they’re no longer considered fresh news. LILPEPE, meanwhile, has confirmed two centralized exchange listings upon launch, with plans to expand further by listing on the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. This move could instantly thrust it into mainstream visibility and significantly increase its market capitalization. Add to that the project’s $777,000 giveaway campaign—where 10 winners will receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens—and you have a recipe for mass adoption. This campaign alone has dramatically expanded the community, driving thousands of new users to the presale and rapidly increasing wallet count. The energy is growing by the hour, not by the week. Final Thoughts Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) are solid, established names—but that’s also their weakness in a market that thrives on disruption. Little Pepe is that disruption. It’s a token designed for virality, built for scale, and backed by a roadmap that could leave traditional altcoins behind. While ADA and TRX continue their slow and steady climb, LILPEPE is launching with the kind of force that topples giants. And if the early signs hold, it won’t be long before the meme coin that started at less than a penny overtakes them both.

In a recent post, crypto analyst Bale suggested that a final resolution might be delayed until late 2026. However, seasoned legal expert and XRP advocate Bill Morgan swiftly dismissed that possibility, calling it highly unlikely unless an unexpected turn occurs in court. Bill Morgan: A 2026 Delay Is Improbable According to Bill Morgan , a delay extending into 2026 is “not on the cards” unless Judge Analisa Torres rejects the most recent joint motion filed by Ripple and the SEC. If that were to happen, it could derail the settlement process entirely and force both parties to pursue full appeals, likely stretching the case through higher courts and over an extended timeline. Morgan considers this outcome improbable, as it would disregard the practical progress already made. He noted that the most sensible outcome remains for both sides to accept the 2023 summary judgment, which found Ripple’s institutional XRP sales to violate securities laws but cleared programmatic and other distributions. The remedies being considered, such as financial penalties and dissolution of the permanent injunction against Ripple, are aligned with that ruling, and continuing the process through mutual agreement is the most efficient path forward. This is not on the cards unless Judge Torres rules against the latest joint motion and rather that make the common sense decision to live with the summary judgement decision and the current penalty and permanent injunction, the settlement process breaks down completely and both… https://t.co/K6iU3OfQ4y — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 23, 2025 Where the Case Currently Stands The SEC first filed suit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that the company raised over $1 billion through unregistered XRP sales. In July 2023, Judge Torres delivered a landmark ruling that partially favored Ripple. While she sided with the SEC regarding institutional sales, she determined that XRP itself is not a security and that programmatic sales and other distributions did not violate securities laws. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Since then, legal proceedings have focused on determining penalties and final remedies. In May 2025, both parties submitted a joint proposal for remedies, indicating progress toward resolution. Although Judge Torres denied an initial sealing request on procedural grounds, the court instructed the parties to refile , seen largely as a technical issue rather than a sign of discord. Legal Experts See Closure on the Horizon John Deaton, who represented more than 75,000 XRP holders during the proceedings, also expressed optimism that the Judge will grant the motion . Former SEC enforcement attorney Marc Fagel noted that, barring unforeseen developments, the court’s pace and the collaborative posture of both parties suggest a resolution is within reach. Meanwhile, Fred Rispoli predicts the judge will issue a decision within weeks. This growing consensus among legal experts reinforces the notion that the long-running dispute may finally be coming to a close. Looking Ahead Unless Judge Torres takes the unexpected step of rejecting the joint motion and triggering a full appeal process, the Ripple-SEC case appears to be approaching its final chapter. All indications suggest that both parties are working toward closure rather than preparing for a renewed courtroom battle. As of today, the ultimate decision lies with Judge Torres. With procedural hurdles nearly cleared, a resolution could soon bring an end to one of the most closely watched legal battles in crypto history.

Get ready for a significant update that underscores the growing influence of traditional finance in the digital asset space. We’re talking about Spot Bitcoin ETFs , and their holdings have just hit a massive milestone that’s turning heads across the Crypto Market . According to data compiled by @hildobby_ on Dune Analytics, Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States now collectively control a substantial portion of the total BTC supply . This isn’t just a small percentage; it’s a figure that highlights the rapid pace of Institutional Bitcoin adoption since these products launched earlier this year. Understanding the Massive Spot Bitcoin ETF Holdings Let’s break down the numbers that are making waves: Percentage of Total BTC Supply: 6.13% Combined On-Chain Holdings: 1,218,000 BTC Approximate Value: $121.2 billion (based on market prices at the time of data collection) These figures, derived from on-chain data tracked by reliable sources like Dune Analytics, demonstrate a clear trend: institutions and large-scale investors are using the Spot Bitcoin ETF structure to gain exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated and familiar way. The fact that over 6% of the entire BTC supply is now held within these wrappers is a powerful indicator of institutional appetite. What Does This Massive Influx of Institutional Bitcoin Signify? The accumulation of 1.218 million BTC by Spot Bitcoin ETFs is far more than just a statistic; it’s a strong signal for the entire Crypto Market . Here’s what this surge in Institutional Bitcoin holdings tells us: Validation as an Asset Class: Large institutions, pension funds, and asset managers are increasingly comfortable treating Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset, worthy of significant allocation. Increased Liquidity and Accessibility: ETFs provide an easy way for investors who cannot or prefer not to hold physical Bitcoin directly to participate in its price movements. This expands the pool of potential investors dramatically. Maturing Market Infrastructure: The success and growth of these ETFs reflect the maturing infrastructure around Bitcoin, including regulated custodians, trading platforms, and data providers. This level of commitment from traditional finance players via Spot Bitcoin ETFs adds a layer of stability and legitimacy that was less apparent in earlier cycles of the Crypto Market . It signifies a deeper integration of Bitcoin into the global financial system. How Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Reshaping the BTC Supply Landscape One of the most direct impacts of these massive holdings is on the available BTC supply . Bitcoin has a finite supply capped at 21 million coins. When large amounts are held in long-term investment vehicles like ETFs, it reduces the amount of Bitcoin actively trading on exchanges or held by short-term speculators. Think of it this way: the 1.218 million BTC held by Spot Bitcoin ETFs are essentially locked away for the investors in those funds. While ETF shares trade, the underlying Bitcoin is typically held by a custodian and not readily available for sale on the open market by the ETF manager unless inflows reverse significantly. This dynamic can lead to a supply squeeze, especially if demand continues to grow. With a significant portion of the circulating BTC supply moving into these institutional vaults, any sustained buying pressure could have a more pronounced effect on price than it would in a market where supply is more fragmented and readily available. The Ripple Effect on the Wider Crypto Market The success of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the resulting surge in Institutional Bitcoin holdings have broader implications for the entire Crypto Market : Increased Awareness and Confidence: The prominent presence of Bitcoin ETFs managed by household names like BlackRock and Fidelity brings Bitcoin into mainstream financial conversations, increasing awareness and potentially confidence among retail investors. Paving the Way for Other Crypto Assets: The regulatory approval and market success of Bitcoin ETFs could set a precedent for ETFs tracking other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, potentially opening up new avenues for institutional and retail investment in the future. Shift in Market Structure: While retail investors remain crucial, the increasing dominance of institutional holdings could influence market volatility patterns and trading strategies. This shift indicates a maturation of the Crypto Market , moving beyond its early, primarily retail-driven phase into one where institutional capital plays a significant role. Navigating the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Bitcoin The accumulation of over 6% of the BTC supply by Spot Bitcoin ETFs is undoubtedly a bullish signal, highlighting strong demand for Institutional Bitcoin products. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges and future dynamics: Continued Inflows: Will the pace of accumulation continue? This depends on market performance, regulatory environment, and broader economic conditions. Concentration Risk: While diversification is inherent within the ETF structure, the concentration of a significant portion of BTC supply in a few large funds could introduce new systemic risks, although this is mitigated by the distributed nature of Bitcoin itself. Regulatory Landscape: Future regulatory decisions could impact the operation and growth of these funds. For investors, this development reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a major asset class attracting serious capital. It suggests that the trend of institutional adoption is likely to continue, potentially providing a strong foundation for future price appreciation, though market volatility remains a factor. In Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Bitcoin The fact that Spot Bitcoin ETFs now command over 6% of the total BTC supply is a landmark moment. It underscores the rapid and significant adoption of Bitcoin by institutional players, validating its role in modern investment portfolios. With over 1.2 million BTC under management, valued at over $121 billion, these ETFs are not just a new product; they are reshaping the dynamics of the BTC supply and signaling a new era for the entire Crypto Market driven by increasing Institutional Bitcoin participation. This growth story is far from over, and its implications will continue to unfold.

This emerging protocol is built for decentralized lending and borrowing through both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With a presale price of just $0.03 and over $11 million already raised, Mutuum has gained attention from over 12,300 holders anticipating its beta platform launch. A $2,000 investment at the current price can grow to $70,000 at a 35x return—showing clear upside potential for early adopters. Unlike speculative tokens with no backing, MUTM is supported by an infrastructure designed for scale, compliance, and real yield. Ten early believers will also be rewarded in a $100,000 giveaway , each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Layer-2 Scalability and CertiK-Audited Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed with Layer-2 integration to ensure faster transactions and drastically lower fees. This technical upgrade will reduce the burden of congestion and make high-frequency borrowing, lending, and collateral interactions more efficient. Users will interact directly with non-custodial smart contracts, improving both speed and affordability compared to Layer-1 limitations. Security has already been validated through a CertiK audit, with a Token Scan score of 80.00 and a Skynet rating of 75.56. The audit included both static analysis and manual review, demonstrating that Mutuum’s smart contracts meet rigorous safety standards. This makes it one of the few small-cap projects with institutional-grade review prior to launch. Passive Income, Stablecoin Utility, and Lending Freedom Earning on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will take two distinct forms. In the P2C model, users will supply assets like ETH, BTC, BNB, AVAX, USDT, or USDC into protocol-controlled pools. These pools will generate interest based on demand. As more borrowing occurs, interest rates rise, and depositors earn more. Each deposit will be represented by mtTokens, which automatically accrue interest and can be transferred or used in other parts of the protocol. In the P2P model, users can lend directly to others under fully customizable terms. This includes support for meme coins and non-traditional tokens like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB—giving lenders the chance to earn in areas most platforms ignore. Alongside lending, Mutuum will launch its own decentralized stablecoin. This asset will maintain a $1 peg, minted only when users borrow against collateral and burned when debt is repaid or liquidated. Governance will adjust the interest rate to manage supply. For example, if the price of the stablecoin rises above $1, interest rates can be lowered to encourage minting. If it drops below $1, rates can be raised to reduce supply. All minting will be permissioned and capped, reducing risk across the system. Interest generated from stablecoin borrowing will be directed to Mutuum’s treasury and used to execute MUTM token buybacks. Those tokens will be redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the platform’s designated contracts. This creates a sustainable, revenue-backed dividend model that rewards long-term participants while increasing demand for the token itself. As the project nears its beta launch, all core systems—from stablecoin mechanics to interest rate logic—are being prepared for full on-chain deployment. With CertiK verification, Layer-2 performance, customizable lending, and a protocol-first dividend strategy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a structure designed to reward early conviction and provide real utility in DeFi.

This follows a successful Stage 1 at $0.001 (raising $500,000) and Stage 2 at $0.0011 (raising $733,987).

The project advertises itself as the first Layer 2 blockchain to focus on meme tokens. Its point of sale is its low fee and rapid speed which are geared towards viral meme culture and crypto trading. The Little Pepe model incorporates humor, scalability, and token utility to diversify meme projects in a safe Layer 2 environment. The token is not taxed and has specific liquidity, which may enhance the outcomes of service provision after the launch. Tokenomics and Roadmap Raise Expectations for Breakout Potential The LILPEPE tokenomics reserve 26.5 percent of tokens for presale and 30 percent in chains to sustain long-term performance and development. The other 13.5 percent will be used as staking rewards to encourage long-term holding behavior among the community members. With liquidity, DEX listings, and marketing at 10% each, the ecosystem seems designed for robust circulation and adoption. There are no buy and sell taxes, which attract traders who want to transact without any friction and those who would like to enter or exit the market quickly. The purpose of marketing funds is to spur growth in the community. $LILPEPE is expanding the ecosystem and integrating with Layer 2 which helps to drive scalability and token value up higher. The presale terms reflect a phased release model since tokens can only be claimed when all release phases are closed. Investors anticipate the listing will be at elevated prices, and any delays may impact sentiments. Little Pepe also launched a massive $777,000 token giveaway . A total of 10 winners will each receive $77,000 worth of $LILPEPE tokens. Dogecoin Remains Flat Despite Broader Meme Coin Activity Dogecoin (DOGE) currently trades at $0.1707 without significant fluctuation over the last 24 hours. Despite its market cap of $25.57 billion, its volume has declined by more than 44%. Investors appear to be wary of DOGE regardless of its record-breaking performance and its mentions on social media. DOGE has not received an update or upgrade with any utility to attract new retailers. Its popularity relies largely on social activity and the infrequent interest of influencers. The newer tokens, such as LILPEPE, however, are applying real applications and governance features to appeal to long-term users.

This strategic move helps it tap into a region responsible for nearly 20% of global crypto trading volume. This strategic move positions Solana as a pivotal infrastructure layer in one of crypto’s fastest-growing markets. The news has sparked interest among investors, who are now keenly watching Solana’s price moves for short-term trade insights. While the MoU provides a long-term tailwind, the immediate question on traders’ minds is: Can SOL build momentum to bounce back from current lows? In this Sol price analysis, I take you through Solana’s network health and how it could perform on the charts. On-Chain Metrics Fuel Solana? According to data from Artemis , Solana maintains a leading position in both daily active addresses and transaction volume. Solana network averages over 1 million daily active users, significantly outpacing Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon. On the transaction front, Solana logs 100–120 million daily transactions, showing scalability and usage consistency. This high throughput reflects sustained developer and user activity across DeFi, NFTs, and new consumer-facing apps. It also builds a compelling case for Kazakhstan’s decision to select Solana as its blockchain of choice. Solana Price Analysis: Solana, at the time of press, is trading at $134.49, down 0.67%, but rising volume suggests growing buying interest. The RSI has rebounded from oversold levels of 33.01 to 40.73, signaling a possible trend reversal. SOL has bounced from strong support at $129, while the 20 SMA at $137.46 remains the next key hurdle. Successively, a breakout could push prices toward $148, $152, and $156.88, respectively. On the downside, $129 remains the critical support to watch. With fundamentals strengthened by the Kazakhstan MoU and on-chain activity strong, SOL appears poised for a short-term rally, provided the momentum holds.

Elon Musk's X plans in-app trading and payments but makes no mention of Dogecoin integration despite his historical support. Bitcoin Pepe smashes $15.2m presale as world's first Bitcoin meme ICO builds ""Solana on Bitcoin"" toward June 30th exchange announcement. The meme coin space is far more diverse than anyone could have predicted a few years ago. Among the flagship meme projects, Dogecoin—the OG that started it all—has evolved into something resembling a vast ecosystem with real institutional interest, ETF speculation, and integration into major platforms like Coinbase's Base network. What began essentially as a joke has become a $25B market cap phenomenon that's weathered practically every storm in crypto. Dogecoin's recent performance indicates its status as a maturing asset. Recording yearly gains of 35% to date, and much higher in its early spring peak, DOGE has shown remarkable resilience despite volatility across traditional markets. Recent speculation about a potential DOGE ETF has intensified, with prediction markets giving it around a 50-50 chance of SEC approval by the end of 2025. But there's something entirely different happening on the other side of the meme coin universe. Bitcoin Pepe might belong superficially to the ""Pepe"" category of meme coins, but only on the surface. Underneath the familiar branding lies something unprecedented—the world's first meme coin ICO launched directly on Bitcoin, building infrastructure that could fundamentally change how the oldest blockchain functions. Bitcoin Pepe chose Bitcoin specifically to solve its seven-transaction-per-second limitation while building on crypto's most trusted foundation. The core innovation is the PEP-20 token standard, which promises to deliver thousands of transactions per second to Bitcoin's ecosystem, essentially creating ""Solana on Bitcoin"" functionality. With an incredible $15.2m raised and confirmed tier 1 exchange listings ahead of June 30th announcements, the market is clearly taking this seriously. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): Building the future of Bitcoin infrastructure Bitcoin Pepe is attempting something that sounds impossible—making Bitcoin fast while keeping it secure. Departing from the traditional meme coin formula, the team wanted to solve the biggest problem holding Bitcoin back from modern applications. It’s ambitious, but the market is backing it sincerely. For example, every staking pool sold out completely, with participants locking tokens for yields ranging from 75% up to a vast 10,000% APY. An astonishing $15.2m has so far been raised in the ongoing presale. The team is now in the process of onboarding additional tier 1 exchange partnerships, with MEXC and BitMart already secured, triggering $300K in immediate buying activity. June 30th will reveal which other major exchanges are joining and could see the price rocket as the presale sails past $15M. We've just seen ANOTHER major pump! $BPEP just hit $15 MILLION raised. 💪Since dropping our listing announcements, $BPEP has gone parabolic. BitMart ✅ Uniswap ✅ Tier 1 announcement coming June 30th ✅The window’s still open… but not for long. Buy $BPEP now ➡️… pic.twitter.com/f9tDkYbwSs — Bitcoin Pepe (@BitcoinPepe_) June 18, 2025 In the meantime, they’ve been locking in some great partnerships that are already creating utility across multiple sectors: Mobile Finance: Plena Finance integrating BPEP into their app serving millions of users Bitcoin Gaming: GETE Network building gaming infrastructure that runs on Bitcoin Content Creation: BETV developing platforms where creators earn BPEP Casual Gaming: GemuPlay adding BPEP rewards across 200+ game titles Development transparency has increased with leaked screenshots showing the Bitcoin bridge, native DEX, and dedicated block explorer in various completion stages. This team is building comprehensive infrastructure rather than pinning hopes on a viral price rush. With positioning available at $0.0416 in the current stage, this might be the last chance to get in before Bitcoin Pepe hits public markets and the real price discovery begins. The window is closing fast to get involved with the best crypto to buy now, both for short-term price action and long-term utility play. Dogecoin (DOGE): The institutional meme coin Dogecoin has earned its status as crypto's most beloved success story. Created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, DOGE has survived multiple bear markets, regulatory uncertainty, and countless predictions of its demise. The current technical setup has traders watching closely. After finding support near $0.167, DOGE is consolidating around $0.17 while showing signs of accumulation. Companies accept DOGE for payments, fans use it for tips and small transactions, and the community remains one of crypto's most engaged. Elon Musk's influence remains a wildcard factor. While his recent X payment announcements didn't specifically mention Dogecoin, his historical support has proven capable of moving markets. For crypto veterans, Dogecoin represents authenticity in a space increasingly dominated by complex protocols and venture capital. It exists because someone thought putting a dog meme on a blockchain would be fun, an origin story that resonates through every grassroots crypto project like Bitcoin Pepe itself. Bitcoin is set to evolve Dogecoin and Bitcoin Pepe represent completely different philosophies. DOGE offers the stability of a proven community with growing institutional recognition. Bitcoin Pepe bets on being the first to crack Bitcoin's utility problem while introducing meme culture appeal. Bitcoin Pepe's announcements about exchanges on June 30th could trigger the kind of coordinated launch that transforms presale projects into market phenomena. Ranking among the best crypto to buy now, it’s totally unexposed to the masses—for now, at least. Bitcoin Pepe's window is closing fast, though. With confirmed MEXC and Bitmart listings and rumors about bigger exchanges joining June 30th announcements, positioning at $0.0416 might be the last chance before this hits public markets. Once those exchange partnerships get announced, presale access ends forever. Bitcoin Pepe's presale window is rapidly closing. With confirmed MEXC and Bitmart listings and rumors of larger exchanges joining by June 30th, current positioning at $0.0416 may be the last opportunity before public market entry. Once these exchange partnerships are announced, presale access will conclude permanently. To learn more and to buy Bitcoin Pepe, check out the official website .

46608152,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753692,1750673412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46608152.jpeg,FTX lawyers reject 3AC’s $1.53B claim,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ftx-dismisses-3acs-1-53b-claim/,"Collapsed crypto exchange FTX lawyers have rejected a $1.53 billion recovery claim from Three Arrows Capital’s liquidators. The firm’s lawyers argued that the losses resulted from a risky trading strategy that should not be paid for by creditors. 3AC liquidators initially filed a $120 million claim in FTX’s bankruptcy case in June 2023 and expanded it to $1.53 billion in November 2024. The company alleged claims including breach of contract, fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. FTX accuses 3AC of risky leveraged strategy The hedge fund alleged FTX held $1.53 billion in its assets that were liquidated to settle liabilities in 2022, contributing to 3AC’s collapse. The firm argued that the transactions were avoidable and the defunct crypto exchange’s debtors had delayed providing the information that would have uncovered the liquidations. Chief Judge John Dorsey sided with 3AC and granted the motion in March. FTX filed an objection on Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, its lawyers maintaining that the claims were illogical and baseless. They also argued that the hedge fund “bet big” that crypto prices would increase, and when they instead dropped, the company became a victim of its “own risky strategy.” “The Joint Liquidators ask this Court to force other Exchange customers and creditors to foot the bill for 3AC’s failed strategy by asserting illogical and baseless claims for $1.53 billion.” -FTX Lawyers. The lawyers also disputed the account balance and how 3AC arrived at the $1.53 billion figure. They believe the firm relied on inaccurate account balances from June 12, 2022, when the company’s crypto balance was $1.02 billion, not $1.59 billion, and the negative U.S. dollar amount was $733 million, not $1.3 billion. The theory of lost assets, which FTX believes is the crux of 3AC’s argument, is based on the crypto balance on June 12, 2022, and asks to recover all of the balance lost in subsequent days. The lawyers said it’s a false premise and lacks any legal or factual merit, and that 3AC is owed nothing. The collapsed crypto exchange maintains that 3AC only had an available balance of $284 million, which was further chipped away by crypto market price declines and withdrawals by 3AC of $60 million. FTX also revealed that the Singapore-based firm had a negative USD balance and a positive digital asset balance at the end of the day on June 12, 2022. Lawyers acting for FTX noted in the objection that the only liquidation against 3AC was for $82 million in crypto. They argued that the amount was contractually permitted under the credit and margin agreements to ensure the firm complied with account balance requirements. The lawyers also claimed in the objection that the liquidation did not reduce the overall account balance because the value was added to the fiat 3AC account in USD. FTX said the $82 million liquidation benefited 3AC by preserving the value of its accounts. The Singapore-based hedge fund has until July 11 to file a reply to FTX’s objection. A non-evidentiary hearing is also set for August 12 before Chief Judge Karen Owens in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. 3AC files $1.3B claim against Terraform Labs In August last year, 3AC also pursued claims against collapsed crypto firm Terraform Labs through a $1.3 billion claim in Terra’s bankruptcy case. The hedge fund’s liquidators alleged that Terraform Labs misled 3AC about the stability of tokens in the Terra ecosystem, including Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), and the UST-tied token Luna (LUNA). The liquidators, represented by Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer of Teneo Holding, argued that Terraform Labs advertised the tokens in a manner that inflated the price of the assets. Those misrepresentations induced 3AC to invest heavily in Terra just a few months after UST depegged from the dollar, causing a massive crash in the Terra ecosystem, and implicating several companies. 3AC liquidators were seeking damages caused by its direct purchases of UST and LUNA and associated damages from the complete loss of value of its crypto investments caused by the collapse of LUNA and UST. On March 30, Terraform opened a claims portal for investors affected by its collapse. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Let’s dive into the latest market movements that have caught everyone’s eye. According to fresh data from CoinGecko, the global crypto market cap has experienced a dip, currently standing at $3.21 trillion . This figure reflects a 3.1% change over the past 24 hours. While daily fluctuations are common in the volatile world of digital assets, understanding the context behind these numbers is crucial for any participant in the space. Understanding the Global Crypto Market Cap What exactly is the global crypto market cap , and why does this number matter? Think of it as the total estimated value of all cryptocurrencies currently in existence. It’s calculated by multiplying the current price of each cryptocurrency by its circulating supply and then summing up all these values. It provides a snapshot of the overall size and health of the cryptocurrency market at any given moment. Here’s a quick breakdown: It’s a key metric for tracking market growth or contraction. A higher market cap generally indicates broader adoption and investor confidence. Fluctuations are normal and influenced by various factors. A 3.1% dip within 24 hours, while not catastrophic, signifies a notable movement. It suggests that selling pressure has temporarily outweighed buying activity across the board. Analyzing Bitcoin Dominance and Ethereum Dominance Beyond the total market cap, two other figures provided by CoinGecko are equally insightful: Bitcoin dominance and Ethereum dominance . Market dominance refers to the percentage of the total market cap that a specific cryptocurrency holds. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, so their dominance figures are closely watched. According to the data: Bitcoin’s market dominance is currently 62.7% . Ethereum’s market dominance is currently 8.39% . What does this tell us? Bitcoin continues to hold the lion’s share of the market’s total value. Its movements often dictate the overall market trend. Ethereum, while significantly smaller in dominance than Bitcoin, is the second-largest player and the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems, giving its dominance figure considerable weight. Changes in dominance can signal shifts in investor sentiment. For instance, if Bitcoin dominance rises during a dip, it might suggest investors are moving towards the perceived safety of BTC. Conversely, if altcoin dominance (the collective dominance of all other coins) rises, it could signal a period where investors are taking on more risk, often referred to as an ‘altcoin season’. The current figures show BTC firmly in the lead, which is typical during periods of market uncertainty or after a significant run-up. Why the Dip? Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Prices Understanding the reasons behind a dip in the global crypto market cap requires looking at a confluence of factors that influence cryptocurrency prices . While the exact cause for any specific 24-hour movement is often complex and multifaceted, here are some common drivers: Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news, inflation data, interest rate changes by central banks, and global political events can significantly impact risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors about new regulations in major economies can create uncertainty and lead to selling pressure. Investor Sentiment and News Events: Major hacks, exchange issues, or even influential figures making positive or negative comments can sway market sentiment rapidly. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, investors may sell assets to realize profits, leading to temporary dips. Technical Indicators: Traders often make decisions based on chart patterns and technical analysis, which can lead to concentrated buying or selling activity around certain price levels. Liquidation Events: In derivatives markets, large price swings can trigger cascading liquidations of leveraged positions, exacerbating downward movements. Pinpointing the precise catalyst for this 3.1% dip would require detailed analysis of market news and trading activity over the specific 24-hour period. However, it’s likely a combination of these factors contributing to the overall shift. The Impact of a Market Dip: Challenges and Opportunities A dip in the global crypto market cap presents both challenges and potential opportunities for market participants. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Dips can be sharp and unpredictable, making it difficult for short-term traders. Investor Psychology: Seeing portfolio values decrease can lead to panic selling, locking in losses. Uncertainty: It can be hard to determine if a dip is a temporary correction or the start of a longer downturn. Opportunities: Potential Buying Opportunities: For long-term investors, dips can offer a chance to buy assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum at lower prices. Learning Experience: Market volatility provides valuable lessons in risk management and emotional control. Re-evaluation: Dips encourage investors to revisit their portfolios and investment strategies. It’s important to approach market dips with a clear head and a well-defined strategy rather than reacting impulsively to short-term price movements. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Volatility Given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency prices , especially during market dips, what can investors do? Here are some actionable insights: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the projects you invest in. A temporary market dip doesn’t necessarily mean a good project has failed. Focus on fundamentals. 2. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market dip perfectly, invest a fixed amount at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly). This averages out your purchase price over time and reduces the risk of buying only at peaks. 3. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Bitcoin and Ethereum hold significant dominance, exploring other promising projects can spread risk. However, ensure you understand each asset. 4. Have a Long-Term Perspective: The crypto market has historically experienced significant volatility but has shown resilience and long-term growth. Focusing on the long game can help weather short-term downturns. 5. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For traders, using stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the market moves against your position. 6. Stay Informed, But Avoid Constant Monitoring: Keep up with major news impacting the market, but avoid checking prices every five minutes, which can fuel anxiety. Navigating dips requires discipline and a focus on your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Looking Ahead: What Could Influence the Market Next? While the 3.1% dip is the current focus, the market is constantly looking for the next catalyst. Factors that could influence the global crypto market cap and cryptocurrency prices in the near future include: Further macroeconomic data releases (inflation, jobs reports). Regulatory developments in key regions (US, EU, Asia). Technological advancements and upgrades within major networks (like Ethereum’s ongoing development). Increased institutional adoption or investment. Significant movements in the stock market, particularly tech stocks, which crypto often correlates with. Keeping an eye on these potential influencers can help provide context for future market movements, whether they lead to recovery or further dips. Conclusion: A Snapshot of Market Dynamics The recent 3.1% dip in the global crypto market cap to $3.21 trillion, as reported by CoinGecko, serves as a fresh reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin dominance remains strong at 62.7% and Ethereum dominance at 8.39%, the overall market valuation saw a notable contraction in 24 hours. Understanding these key metrics – market cap, dominance, and the factors influencing cryptocurrency prices – is vital for making informed decisions. Market dips are a normal part of the cycle, presenting challenges related to volatility and sentiment but also potential opportunities for those with a clear strategy and a long-term perspective. As the market continues to evolve, staying informed and disciplined remains key to navigating its unpredictable waters.

In 2025, however, the crypto landscape has dramatically evolved. Investors now demand more substantial infrastructure, authentic blockchain utility, and active community-driven governance. As a result, Pepe Coin faces significant headwinds, navigating an environment where memes alone aren't enough to sustain long-term success. The early success of Pepe Coin relied heavily on cultural resonance and speculative trading frenzies. Yet as the cryptocurrency market matures, a new breed of investors—savvier and more discerning—are seeking genuine, sustainable value. Pepe Coin’s inability to evolve with comprehensive decentralized governance, practical real-world applications, and transparent operational frameworks now clearly limits its potential. Simultaneously, intensified regulatory oversight and heightened market competition add further pressure. Meme coins that once thrived solely on humorous branding and speculation now face stringent scrutiny, both from investors and regulators alike. Without significant innovations or governance adaptations, Pepe Coin risks obsolescence, overshadowed by more versatile, utility-rich competitors. Investors Are Jumping Ship—PEPE’s Failure to Adapt Pepe Coin’s declining momentum symbolizes a broader industry shift where meme tokens increasingly must justify their existence beyond entertainment. The crypto ecosystem has steadily transitioned from purely speculative assets toward tokens with proven, enduring utility and active community governance. Today's crypto investors, both retail and institutional, prioritize projects that provide clear long-term benefits, sustainable tokenomics, and robust governance. Meme coins lacking these features face dwindling investor confidence. While PEPE remains culturally iconic, its failure to integrate essential utilities—such as transparent governance structures, substantial real-world use-cases, and genuine blockchain mechanisms—dramatically undermines its appeal. The market’s evolution towards utility-driven meme coins reflects broader societal shifts prioritizing transparency, decentralization, and actionable crypto use-cases. Meme tokens that empower their communities and support robust decentralized governance structures are now favored. PEPE’s stagnation in meeting these criteria severely curtails its growth prospects, leading investors to more innovative and practical alternatives. Neo Pepe Coin Takes Crypto World by Storm—Beyond the Memetrix While Pepe Coin struggles to adapt, Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) rapidly emerges as a revolutionary meme token, skillfully combining meme-driven culture with advanced blockchain functionality. Leveraging Ethereum’s secure and scalable infrastructure alongside sophisticated open-source smart contracts, Neo Pepe Coin decisively redefines the meme coin narrative. Neo Pepe Coin’s groundbreaking presale has dramatically exceeded market expectations. Now confidently progressing towards Stage 4, the presale has already attracted investments cumulatively raising over $2 million across all stages. Analysts and crypto commentators recognize Neo Pepe Coin’s presale as one of the standout successes of the year, highlighting strong investor confidence and substantial market enthusiasm. Industry recognition has firmly positioned Neo Pepe Coin as one of the most promising crypto presale opportunities currently available. Its distinct blend of meme appeal and sophisticated blockchain functionality garners significant attention, clearly marking it as both culturally impactful and technologically advanced. How Neo Pepe Coin Delivers Real Blockchain Utility Unlike typical meme tokens, Neo Pepe Coin offers genuine blockchain-based solutions. At its core lies an advanced decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), powered by the innovative NEOPGovernor smart contract. This structure empowers token holders with at least 1 million $NEOP to directly influence project governance, including critical decisions on treasury management, liquidity enhancement, and broader ecosystem development. Complementing its governance strengths, Neo Pepe Coin implements a sophisticated auto-liquidity mechanism through Uniswap, automatically applying a 2.5% fee on every transaction to strengthen liquidity pools. This innovative approach permanently burns liquidity provider (LP) tokens, guaranteeing lasting market stability and investor confidence. Defying Centralization—Neo Pepe’s Crusade for Decentralized Freedom In a crypto climate increasingly threatened by centralization and regulatory pressures, Neo Pepe Coin symbolizes genuine decentralized resistance and autonomy. Through transparent governance, immutable smart contracts, and the absence of hidden wallets, Neo Pepe Coin embodies true blockchain values—transparency, autonomy, and collective control. Neo Pepe Coin resonates deeply with decentralization advocates and crypto enthusiasts, positioning itself as a robust counter-narrative against centralized crypto entities. It proudly upholds the foundational blockchain principles of transparency and community empowerment, attracting a dedicated following committed to genuine decentralization. 4 Explosive Reasons $NEOP Is This Year’s Meme Crypto to Watch Unmatched DAO Governance Transparent, structured proposal and voting mechanisms. Defined timelines ensure democratic participation and robust community engagement. Next-Level Auto-Liquidity Continuous liquidity boosts via automatic transaction fees. Permanent burning of LP tokens fortifies market integrity and trust. Dynamic 16-Stage Presale Clearly staged presale phases with incremental price increases, rewarding early investors.

This latest acquisition, executed at an average price of approximately $106,408 per Bitcoin, further solidified the Tokyo-based investment firm’s position among the world’s top ten largest corporate holders of the original cryptocurrency, increasing its lead over Coinbase in 10th place and trailing Hut 8 in 8th by 273 BTC. Metaplanet Sets Its Sights Higher Chairman Simon Gerovich confirmed the buy via a post on X, where he revealed that the company was targeting 30,000 BTC before the end of 2025. Additionally, in an infographic shared in a follow-up post , Gerovich outlined his firm’s path to hitting 210,000 BTC by 2027. He projects the company acquiring 70,000 BTC in 2026 to get to 100,000, and adding another 110,000 the following year to own exactly 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply. Metaplanet’s rapid rise, from 97.850 BTC in April 2024, has been driven by relentless capital market activity. The organization has utilized a combination of stock acquisition rights and zero-coupon bond issuances, primarily directed to EVO FUND, to fuel its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The 1,111 BTC, bought for $118.2 million, follows a similar pattern, coming weeks after a $117 million acquisition of 1,112 BTC on June 16, which increased its holding to 10,000 BTC. Before that, the firm purchased 1,088 BTC on June 2 for approximately $117.5 million. Its average buy-in across all 11,111 BTC now stands at $95,869. Metaplanet measures success through the “BTC Yield” metric, reflecting Bitcoin accretion per fully diluted share. In a statement shared on X, the firm revealed that the metric has soared 306.7% year-to-date, with a particularly strong 107.9% gain between April 1 and June 23, translating to a hypothetical gain of 4,367 BTC purely from operations, worth ¥66.189 billion at their reference price. Despite this aggressive strategy, the company’s stock was down 5.39% at the time of this writing, changing hands at ¥1,685, possibly due to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East following the United States’ bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities. The dip was also witnessed in the price of Bitcoin. Currently trading at around $101,511, the asset is down 4.5% over the past week and 6.5% in the last month. BTC Treasuries Catching On Metaplanet’s buying spree is not just reshaping its own balance sheet; it signals a deepening institutional embrace of Bitcoin as a core treasury reserve asset. According to HODL15Capital, by June 16, 24 companies had increased their holding of the number one crypto asset by an additional 11,902 units. These include Singapore’s Genius Group, which bought 100 BTC and is targeting 1,000, and Sweden’s first Bitcoin treasury company, H100, which recently increased its ownership of the asset to 169 BTC. Others , such as China’s DDC Enterprise and New York-based Mercurity, are planning to raise $528 million and $800 million, respectively, to purchase Bitcoin.

One such tale belongs to a relatively unknown trader who, like many, missed Solana at $0.50—but still managed to ride the wave from $3 to $250, turning a modest $ 20,000 investment into a $2.3 million windfall during the 2021 bull run. But while many cashed out and faded into obscurity, this trader is back on the radar—not for buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another blue-chip asset, but for going all-in on something completely different: a presale meme coin called Little Pepe ($LILPEPE). And here’s the kicker—he’s betting bigger on Little Pepe than he ever did on Solana. From Layer 1 glory to a Layer 2 meme revival To understand the conviction behind this trade, you need to look beyond the memes. While $LILPEPE heavily leverages internet humour and meme culture, its underlying infrastructure isn’t just fluff—it’s building a Layer 2 blockchain designed to offer ultra-low fees, lightning-fast transactions, and Ethereum compatibility. Layer 2s have been the core focus of Ethereum scaling in the past few years, with networks like Arbitrum and Optimism gaining real traction. What $LILPEPE does differently is inject this tech-savvy approach into meme culture—a combo that has so far remained largely untapped. According to the trader, “Solana was a bet on technology adoption. $LILPEPE is a bet on culture catching up to tech.” Why he’s betting big This trader isn’t some moonboy throwing darts. His strategy is data-driven and based on a clear pattern: early narrative dominance. Let’s break it down: Timing: $LILPEPE is still in Stage 3 of its presale, selling at $0.0012 per token. The presale has already raised over $1.3 million, with nearly 1.3 billion tokens sold. That means there’s still room before the $2.5 million cap is reached—but the window is closing fast. Narrative Arbitrage: Crypto thrives on narratives. In 2021, it was DeFi. Then came NFTs, Layer 1 wars, and more recently, meme coins. What $LILPEPE is doing is combining multiple narratives—meme coin energy, Layer 2 scalability, and a zero-tax ethos—into one project. Tokenomics: Only 26.5% of the supply is allocated for presale, meaning scarcity post-launch could be significant. There’s also 0% tax on buys and sells, removing friction for traders looking to enter or exit quickly. Marketing Firepower: $LILPEPE has set aside 10% of its supply for marketing, an unusually large slice for a project at this stage. Influencer partnerships, viral memes, and even real-world stunts like billboards are reportedly in the works. Community Incentives: The project runs a massive $777K giveaway, with 10 winners set to receive $77,000 worth of tokens each. Participation requires a minimum $100 buy-in, and the tasks include social sharing—an ingenious way to trigger virality while rewarding engagement. The Layer 2 angle that most are missing People often overlook the project’s own Layer 2 chain. Most meme currencies are only compatible with Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, but $LILPEPE is developing its Layer 2, which utilizes the EVM and is designed to be both fast and cost-effective. This positions $LILPEPE not just as a meme coin but as a platform for future projects, giving it longevity beyond the typical meme cycle. The Layer 2 will allow developers to build on the chain using Solidity, which could attract a wave of meme-friendly dApps, NFTs, and games. And for early adopters? That means ecosystem dominance. Meme coin… or Trojan horse? Let’s be clear: $LILPEPE leans heavily into meme aesthetics. The roadmap starts with a phase called “Pregnancy”, and the community catchphrases like “LILPEPE GO BRRRR” or “All hail the LILPEPE chain” seem more satirical than strategic. But that’s the beauty of it. While competitors fight for seriousness and technical validation, $LILPEPE is winning attention—and in crypto, attention is liquidity. This trader’s philosophy? “Smart money doesn’t always follow fundamentals. It follows attention, community, and momentum. $LILPEPE is about to own all three.” Final thoughts: Is $LILPEPE the next Solana moment? It’s easy to laugh off meme coins—until they outperform everything else in your portfolio. What $LILPEPE represents is a new kind of hybrid: culture-first, tech-backed, and community-driven. The fact that an experienced trader is putting serious capital into this presale—not after it hits the mainstream—should raise eyebrows. He missed Solana at $0.50. He didn’t make that mistake again. The question is—will you?

With the increasing number of Germans investing in crypto assets, it has become crucial for the government to create a regulatory framework to maintain stability and protect investors. As of 2025, Germany is implementing MiCA rules while tightening AML/CFT compliance. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in Germany What is the German Government Saying About Cryptocurrency? Crypto Tax in Germany Crypto License in Germany Crypto Adoption in Germany Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in Germany March 6, 2025: The Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) publishes an updated circular on the income tax treatment of crypto assets. Key changes: The term “virtual currencies and other tokens” is replaced with “crypto assets.” Differentiation between active and passive staking for tax purposes. Tax implications for decentralized finance (DeFi) are addressed for the first time. New requirements for transaction overviews and tax reporting. Clearer guidelines for valuing crypto assets, including the use of daily market rates. Emphasis on documentation and retention obligations for taxpayers. Transitional rules apply for tax years up to and including 2024 to help taxpayers adapt to the new provisions. February 18, 2025: Legal analysis highlights the impact of the new Act on the Digitalisation of the Financial Market (Finanzmarktdigitalisierungsgesetz, FinmadiG) and the Act on the Supervision of Markets for Crypto-Assets (Kryptomärkte-Aufsichtsgesetz, KMAG). These acts introduce transitional provisions for crypto service providers and allow for a smooth application of MiCAR (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) in Germany. Existing licenses remain valid until December 31, 2025, under a grandfathering regime, giving providers time to transition to MiCAR-compliant licenses Date Regulation/ Law Details June 30, 2024 MiCA regulation Provisions for ARTs and EMTs became applicable May to November 2024 Crypto tax update Short-term and long-term tax, mining, staking, and income tax April 20, 2023 EU parliament adopted MiCA (EU-2023/1114) EU-wide regulations for crypto assets December 16, 2020 Electronic Securities Act (eWpG) Legalized all electronic securities (came into effect in June 2021) January 1, 2020 Exchange and custodian licensing BaFin icesenes required for crypto operations November 2019 Crypto custody law for banks Banks can sell and store crypto as regulated by BaFin November 29, 2019 Implementation of Directive (EU) 2018/843 5th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive was adopted What is the German Government Saying About Cryptocurrency? The Free Democratic Party of Germany explicitly called for the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the country. However, it is not regulated yet. Besides the federal government, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regulates crypto. BaFin regulates: Licensing and enforcement of AML and CFT rules Blockchain-based lending through the German Banking Act Prohibits any illicit activity in the crypto space Crypto Tax in Germany Capital gains tax: Since cryptocurrencies are not acknowledged as stocks, but rather ‘private economic goods,’ therefore, CGT does not apply . Income tax: The income tax on cryptocurrency ranges from 0% to 45%, depending on the total income. Tax-free event: Gains from crypto trading are exempted from tax up to 1000€ per year. Income from staking and mining is free up to an exemption limit of 256€ per year. Tax reporting: The Last date for the 2024 tax return is July 31, 2025; if the tax return is prepared by tax advisors, the deadline extends to April 30, 2026. Crypto Income in 2025 Tax rate Up to 12.084€ 0% Up to 17.430€ 14-24% Up to 68.430€ 24-42% Up to 277.825€ 42% Over 277.826€ 45% Crypto License in Germany Custody hold: Custody hold requires obtaining a license from BaFin for managing third-party rights and services . CASP license: Crypto assets service providers also require a BaFin-authorized license to operate in Germany. Operating crypto-to-crypto, fiat-to-crypto exchanges, custodial wallet services, and other activities requires licensing. How to get a license? Crypso businesses are required to register with BaFin, establish a local presence in Germany, hold minimum capital (€125,000 to €350,000), and comply with AML and KYC regulations . At least one member of the business must be a resident of the EU. Crypto Adoption in Germany Adoption rate: By 2025, around 27.32 million Germans will use cryptocurrency, representing 32.84% of the population. This indicates an increase in the adoption from previous years. Crypto revenue: The revenue in the crypto market in Germany is projected to reach US$2.5 billion in 2025. An annual growth rate of 16.33% is expected, resulting in US$2.9 billion by 2026. Crypto holdings: The German government sold its entire crypto holdings in mid-2024 (46,359 BTC, approx $3.9 billion), and as of 2025, it does not hold any cryptocurrency. Conclusion Crypto trading and holding are legal in Germany, as the government has provided a set of rules to operate any crypto-related activity. Germany’s main focus for implementing a structured approach is to ensure investors’ protection and financial stability. With its light crypto tax, Germany is considered one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the European Union. If Germany maintains this stability in the crypto space, it can position itself as the crypto leader in the EU in no time. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

There has also been a dramatic drop in the Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), which highlighted a significant investor exit from risk amid increased geopolitical tensions. In fact, the ELR plunged to -0.25 within just three days, levels not seen since the aftermath of China’s 2021 crypto mining ban, when it hit -0.35, but over a longer period of one month. Traders Flee Risk Amid Uncertainty According to CryptoQuant’s analysis , this sharp and rapid decline signals a wave of deleveraging, where both forced liquidations and voluntary position closures have reduced Open Interest across derivatives markets. The immediate catalyst appears to be the escalating conflict between the US and Iran, which has injected a fresh wave of uncertainty into already fragile markets. Such a swift ELR contraction means that market participants are aggressively pulling back from risk, as they anticipate further volatility. While this trend reflects short-term caution, CryptoQuant suggests that panic-driven selloffs may also create strategic opportunities for longer-term investors. Despite this, the current environment is one of rising unpredictability, and leveraged trades now come with amplified risk. This phase matches historical stress points and is indicative of a market recalibration that could either stabilize with time or descend further depending on macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle May Still Be Intact Even as the market struggles amidst volatility, on-chain data shows that long-term holders remain resilient, choosing to hold rather than sell. One key indicator, the Binary CDD 30-day moving average, has stayed below the critical 0.8 threshold and peaked instead at around 0.6 before beginning to decline. This behavior essentially means that long-term investors are not actively moving or spending older coins. The absence of high CDD activity implies that seasoned holders still expect further upside. While some cooling is evident, especially after a period of aggressive price action, the lack of major distribution from long-term wallets hints that the bull cycle remains intact. As in past cycles, Bitcoin often climbs higher in a “staircase” pattern – pausing, consolidating, then rallying further. The muted on-chain activity and subdued sentiment could, counterintuitively, set the stage for the next leg up, as history shows Bitcoin tends to rally hardest when few are paying attention.

However, with Pi2Day just around the corner on June 28, the Pi Network community, known as “Pioneers,” is buzzing with excitement. But while hopes are high for a big announcement, Pi Coin’s (Pi) price is telling a different story. Pi Network Major News: Big Hints, Bigger Expectations The Pi Core Team recently teased a connection between Pi Network and generative AI (GenAI), hinting that co-founder Nicolas Kokkalis’ appearance at a GenAI panel might be linked to something major. A full explanation is expected on Pi2Day . This has led some users to believe AI could be integrated into Pi, possibly improving mining, apps, and security. The conspiracy theories surrounding the #PiNetwork and the announcement of #GenAi continue. A video has now emerged that is supposed to prove that it is a Pi partnership with an unknown company called appen. There is certainly nothing behind it! #CryptoNews $Pi #Binance #Ai pic.twitter.com/Z7TdKZiTHg — Pi Network News Global 𝛑 (@PiNewsGlobal) June 23, 2025 To make things even more exciting, Pi recently launched a long-awaited KYC (Know Your Customer) sync feature. This update fixes years of user complaints and adds to the optimism for something bigger on Pi2Day. Google Trends shows that interest in “Pi2Day” has skyrocketed, proving just how closely people are watching. Pi Coin Drops Despite the Hype Unfortunately, the buzz hasn’t helped Pi’s price. In the past month alone, Pi has crashed by over 35%, now trading around $0.50, just 24% away from its all-time low. It recently closed its weekly candle at its lowest level yet, showing how much pressure the token is under. This drop is happening at the same time global crypto markets are also taking a hit. Rising tensions, especially after the recent U.S. strike on Iran, have created investors. Meanwhile, Pi’s supply on centralized exchanges jumped from 345 million to 362 million in just a week, adding more selling pressure. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Key US Economic Events Could Trigger a Massive Crypto Market Sell-Off , According to Piscan data , exchanges now hold over 359 million Pi coins in total. Gate.io holds the most with 168 million, followed by Bitget with 122 million, showing a growing supply ready to be traded or sold. Looking at the market sentiment, crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin says that Pi is stuck around the $0.40 mark and may hover there through August unless something big changes in the broader market. While many are hopeful Pi2Day could spark a rally, Dr. Altcoin doesn’t think the event alone will be enough to lift the price past $0.60 anytime soon. So, What’s Next? While Pi2Day could still bring positive news that boosts Pi’s price, nothing is confirmed yet. The community is hopeful that this year’s Pi2Day could be the turning point, especially with rumors of exchange listings or AI partnerships, but for now, it’s all speculation. All eyes are on June 28 to see whether Pi Network can deliver the breakthrough its community is waiting for or if the hype will fall flat amid a tough market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pi2Day, celebrated annually on June 28 (6.28), is a key event for Pi Network to announce achievements, new developments, and potentially significant updates for its community, like AI integration or mainnet progress. Will Pi2Day cause Pi Coin’s price to rally? While the community hopes for a rally, crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin suggests Pi Coin may stay around $0.40 through August, believing Pi2Day alone isn’t enough to push its price significantly higher than $0.60.

Recent on-chain data analysis has shed light on the significant activities of investment manager Abraxas Capital , revealing a substantial position in the market that has resulted in considerable gains. This firm appears to be capitalizing on bearish sentiment through carefully constructed trades. What Are Crypto Short Positions and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the specifics of Abraxas Capital’s holdings, let’s clarify what a short position is in the context of cryptocurrency. Essentially, short selling is a trading strategy where an investor borrows an asset (like BTC or ETH) and sells it on the open market, with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price. The difference between the selling price and the repurchase price is the profit, minus any fees. Why would a firm take crypto short positions ? Typically, this strategy is employed when an investor believes the price of an asset is likely to fall. It’s a way to profit from a declining market. Unlike simply holding assets (going long), shorting involves borrowing, which introduces complexities and risks, especially when leverage is involved. Abraxas Capital ‘s Strategy Revealed by On-Chain Data According to insights from on-chain analyst The Data Nerd, shared on the social media platform X, two specific addresses have been identified as belonging to Abraxas Capital . These addresses are currently holding leveraged short positions across several prominent and emerging cryptocurrencies. The use of on-chain data allows observers to peer into the transactions and holdings of large market participants, offering transparency that isn’t always available in traditional finance. The analysis points to leverage ranging between 5x and 10x on these positions. Leverage magnifies both potential profits and potential losses. A 5x leverage means that for every 1% drop in the asset’s price, the short position gains 5% (before fees). Conversely, a 1% rise could lead to a 5% loss on the initial margin. This high degree of leverage indicates a strong conviction in the downward price movement of the targeted assets. Breaking Down the Assets: Bitcoin Short , Ethereum Short , and Others Abraxas Capital’s portfolio of short positions isn’t limited to just one or two assets. The firm has diversified its bearish bets across several cryptocurrencies, including: Bitcoin (BTC): As the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, a Bitcoin short position is a direct bet against the broader market sentiment. Ethereum (ETH): The second-largest crypto, an Ethereum short targets the extensive DeFi and NFT ecosystems built on its blockchain. Solana (SOL): A high-throughput blockchain often seen as a competitor to Ethereum. SUI (SUI): A relatively newer Layer 1 blockchain project. HYPE (HYPE): (Note: The specific asset ‘HYPE’ might refer to a less common or meme-coin asset. On-chain data accuracy relies on correct identification). This mix of established giants like BTC and ETH, alongside newer chains like SOL and SUI, suggests a strategy that isn’t solely focused on the top market cap assets but also includes bets on potential downturns in newer ecosystems. Understanding Unrealized Crypto Profit : What Does $79.92M Mean? The headline figure is the approximately $79.92 million in total unrealized crypto profit . What does ‘unrealized’ mean in this context? It signifies the profit that exists on paper based on the current market price of the assets since the short positions were opened. However, this profit has not yet been locked in because the positions are still open. The firm has not yet bought back the borrowed assets to close the shorts. This $79.92 million represents the potential gain if Abraxas Capital were to close all these leveraged short positions at the current market prices. It’s a substantial figure, highlighting the scale of their trading activity and the extent of the price drops in these assets since they initiated their shorts. However, it’s crucial to remember that this profit can fluctuate with market movements until the positions are closed. The Mechanics of Leverage: Amplifying Gains and Risks The 5x-10x leverage applied to these positions significantly amplifies the potential outcome. Leverage allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital (margin). If the market moves favorably (prices drop for short positions), the returns on the initial margin can be very high. However, if the market moves unfavorably (prices rise), the losses are also magnified, and the position can face liquidation if the losses exceed the margin collateral. For example, a 10x leveraged short on BTC means that a 10% increase in BTC price could wipe out the entire margin used for that position, leading to liquidation. Managing leverage is a critical aspect of risk management in trading, especially with volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Why This Matters: Implications for the Market The revelation of a major investment firm like Abraxas Capital holding such large, profitable crypto short positions offers several insights: Institutional Sentiment: It suggests that at least some institutional players foresaw or are betting on continued downward price action in these specific assets or the broader market. Market Impact: While not necessarily the sole driver, large short positions can contribute to selling pressure if they are actively managed or scaled. On-Chain Data Value: This case underscores the power of on-chain analysis in providing transparency into the activities of large market participants, offering valuable data points for other traders and analysts. Challenges and Risks of Shorting Despite the reported unrealized crypto profit , holding leveraged short positions is not without significant risks: Liquidation Risk: As mentioned, adverse price movements can lead to rapid liquidation of the position, resulting in substantial losses. Unlimited Loss Potential: Theoretically, if an asset’s price keeps rising, the potential loss on a short position is unlimited (though leverage mechanisms on exchanges often include liquidation to prevent this). Funding Costs: Holding short positions on leveraged platforms often incurs periodic funding fees. Market Volatility: Crypto markets are known for sudden, sharp price swings that can quickly turn a profitable position into a losing one. Actionable Insights from On-Chain Analysis The ability to track the positions of entities like Abraxas Capital through on-chain data provides a powerful tool. While not financial advice, observing where large players are placing their bets (long or short) can inform individual trading strategies or provide a pulse on institutional sentiment. It highlights the growing sophistication of market analysis using publicly available blockchain data. Summary: A Glimpse into Institutional Bearish Bets The reported $79.92 million in unrealized crypto profit from Abraxas Capital ‘s leveraged crypto short positions across assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, and HYPE offers a fascinating look into how institutional investors are navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While this figure represents potential profit that is subject to market fluctuations until realized, it underscores the scale of their bearish bets and the power of leverage. This case also serves as a prime example of how on-chain data analysis is becoming an indispensable tool for understanding market dynamics and the strategies of major participants, including those taking significant Bitcoin short and Ethereum short positions.

In a note on Monday, Matrixport opined that “leveraged traders have pushed [ETH’s] price higher in the absence of fundamental support,” adding that this made the asset more susceptible to the “outsized decline” the asset saw over the weekend. Ether slumped over 8% in a Saturday sell-off, leading losses among majors as traders reacted to the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites in a surprise airstrike. The firm pointed to last week’s sharp drop in ETH as evidence of this position-driven fragility and warned that elevated leverage levels could continue to pressure prices. At press time, ETH traded near $2,248 — down from last week’s high above $2,400 — as derivatives data showed traders aggressively hedging downside risk. Options market signals echo that caution, as CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole noted over the weekend . According to data from Amberdata, ETH’s 25-delta risk reversals — a measure comparing the cost of puts versus calls — have skewed negative across June to July expiries. This suggests investors are paying up for protection against downside volatility. QCP Capital further noted in a weekend market update that “risk reversals in both BTC and ETH continue to show a preference for downside protection,” adding that long holders are actively hedging their spot exposure.

46612392,https://cryptonews.com/?p=373962,1750678963,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/46612392.jpeg,Ethereum Price Prediction As ETH Continues to Fall Behind Bitcoin in June 2025,https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-falls-behind-bitcoin-june-2025/,"Ethereum (ETH) has gone down by 14.5% in the past week as rising tensions in the Middle East have sparked a strong sell-off that has now pushed the token to the low 2,000s. The United States bombed nuclear enrichment facilities in Iran during the weekend and a new chapter in this armed conflict between Israel and Iran began as a result. The market was spooked by the news and a downward move that started on Wednesday accelerated during the weekend, pushing ETH from nearly $2,900 to its current level of $2,260. Bitcoin (BTC) has been increasing its dominance in the crypto market as investors have rotated their capital out of altcoins amid the uncertainty and volatility triggered by these events. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that BTC’s dominance has been steadily increasing in the past year, moving from 54.1% in June 2024 to 64% as of today. As a result, ETH’s dominance has stepped back from 18.2% to 8%. It appears that investors continue to see Bitcoin as the safer bet of all in the crypto market, which favors a bearish Ethereum price prediction. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Could Drop to $1,800 if It Fails to Recapture These Levels Looking at the 4-hour chart, we can see that ETH has broken below two key supports already, the first at $2,380 and the second at $2,320. The token has now stepped out of consolidation as a result of this bearish breakout and could be heading to retest the $1,800 shortly as the uptrend has now been reversed. Momentum indicators have improved slightly as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has stepped out of oversold territory for the time being and has moved above the 14-period moving average. It is still too early to say that this is the end of the downtrend. What this improvement could mean in the near term is that ETH will retest these support levels from below and could then resume its downward momentum after it raises enough buy-side liquidity. As Bitcoin’s dominance continues to increase, all crypto presales associated with the top crypto stand to reap the benefits of its positive performance. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has emerged as one of the most promising new presales as the project is raising the necessary capital to launch a layer-2 scaling solution for the Bitcoin network that unlocks the untapped potential of its DeFi ecosystem and more. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Keeps Surpasses $1.5M Raised to Launch its L2 Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) leverages the efficiency of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to unlock the potential of the Bitcoin network to become the home of the market’s most successful decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. The project creates a scalable Solana-based side chain that bundles transactions offline before sending them to the Bitcoin mainnet and provides near-instant finality. As a result, developers will be able to create efficient dApps for DeFi services like lending and borrowing and yield farming, create low-cost payment platforms that use BTC as their main token, and interfaces through which users can mint meme coins on the Bitcoin blockchain. The demand for $HYPER will explode once the solution is embraced by top wallets and exchanges. Hence, at its discounted presale price of $0.012, this token offers significant upside potential to early buyers. To buy $HYPER, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

Despite this increase, SPX6900 has fallen by 37% in the past week, as the wider market takes a big hit from the conflict in the Middle East . On the other hand, SPX remains up by 25% in a month and by a huge 9,900% in the past year, with the meme token only having set its current ATH of $1.73 some 12 days ago. It therefore continues to be one of the hot top-100 coins of the moment, with the coming weeks likely to bring further price increases as more investors plow into the token. SPX6900 Price Prediction: Traders Jump Ship as SPX Price Drops 37% in a Week, What’s Next? SPX’s chart looks very different from that of most other coins in the top 100, in that it has enjoyed a peak in the past couple of weeks, and not only in January, when Donald Trump took office. However, the flipside of this is that the coin entered a strongly overbought position, with its 37% drop in the past week providing a much-needed correction. Source: TradingView Indeed, SPX6900’s relative strength index (purple) has dropped to 40 this morning, which could be a prelude to a rebound. On the other hand, its MACD (orange, blue) has yet to return to its baseline or to become oversold, so it may be a few days before the token begins rallying again. But in the medium-term, SPX continues to look very promising, with its volumes still near their highest-ever levels, at around $100 million today. The meme token has been able to rise to new highs this month as a result of an influx of new investment, with major asset manager BlackRock being the most notable new investor in SPX . Open interest in the coin is also higher than it has been in every month prior to June , while its funding rate remains at a healthy 5.5%, indicating strong demand. This Cup & Handle pattern could make #SPX6900 go absolutely parabolic soon! pic.twitter.com/ghbhutWhXq — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) June 21, 2025 And analysts are continuing to predict big things for the SPX6900 price in the coming weeks and months, with some highlighting a classic cup-and-handle pattern as a signal of an incoming breakout. Its fortunes in the next few days and weeks will depend on what happens in Iran, with a further escalation – such as the blocking of the Strait of Hormuz – likely to depress demand in the near term. However, if conditions settle, SPX could easily reach $1.25 by the end of July and $1.50 by the end of August. Bitcoin Bull Raises $7.3 Million in Snowballing Presale: Is Deflationary Meme Coin Ready to Explode? As good as SPX looks at the moment, it won’t be the only new token to do well this summer, particularly if market conditions (e.g. tariffs, Middle East) improve. There are also other, newer coins ready to surge in the coming weeks, including several presale tokens that have been building strong momentum recently. One of these is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL), a deflationary ERC-20 token that has now raised $7.3 million in its ongoing ICO. Last chance to buy BTCBULL before launch! The countdown ends on June 30th. Here’s what’s coming: BTCBULL token burns BTC airdrops at price milestones BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K Join the herd: https://t.co/FQZXEzFwWu pic.twitter.com/aeUmLJcSOC — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 2, 2025 What’s exciting about Bitcoin Bull is that its deflationary tokenomics are connected to Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance. With a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, the token will conduct burns whenever BTC reaches price milestones for the first time. This will begin with $125,000, and repeat with each additional $25,000 added for the first time, shrinking BTCBULL’s supply in the long run. Not only that, but Bitcoin Bull will host airdrops of Bitcoin itself, with these happening whenever BTC adds $50,000 to its price for the time (starting with $150,000). This could make BTCBULL hugely profitable to hold, particularly when owners can stake it for a passive income. However, the coin’s presale will end in just under seven days, so investors will have to move quickly if they want to buy the token before it lists. They can do so by going to the Bitcoin Bull website , where BTCBULL is selling at its final presale price of $0.00258.

Ten of the top 100 coins have seen increases over the past 24 hours. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 2.8% over the past day, now standing at $3.23 trillion, compared to Friday’s $3.37 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $161 billion, back to the typical levels. TL;DR: The crypto market has seen a notable drop over the weekend; BTC and ETH dropped around 1% over the past day each; At one point, BTC fell below the psychologically relevant $100,000 level; The probability of BTC ending 2025 above $200,000 has dropped to 3.5%; This is not over yet, analysts say, as market braces for instability; The market may experience additional hits. Crypto Winners & Losers All the top 10 coins per market cap are down today. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 0.7%, now trading at $101,924, nearing the psychologically relevant $100,000 mark. This is also the smallest decrease in this category. Also, Ethereum (ETH) fell by 1%, changing hands at $2,251. This is the category’s second-smallest drop. XRP (XRP) saw the highest decrease in this category of 2.6% to the price of $2.02. Moreover, ten of the top 100 coins saw their prices increase in the same period. The best performer is Story (IP) , with the only double-digit increase of 11.6% to $3.06. At the same time, Filecoin (FIL) fell the most, followed by Toncoin (TON) . They’re down 3.9% and 3.8% to $2.12 and $2.75, respectively. Speaking of XRP, Bloomberg analysts recently placed the odds of an XRP spot ETF approval at 95% . The timing of these approvals/launches is more uncertain. Could be something we're talking about in the next month or two. Or it could be something that waits until October or later.

Volatility markets are telling us this isn’t over. “Amid mounting geopolitical pressure, we’re seeing classic risk-off behavior with falling prices, spiking volatility, and a pullback in upside positioning,” Dawson says. At one point, BTC has pulled back from $104,300 to $100,300. At the same time, there was also spike in short-term implied volatility by 10% to 45%. This happened as traders began pricing in fresh risk. Moreover, ETH plunged nearly 14% from $2,550 to $2,200, along with a 15-point jump in 7-day IV to 83%. This reflects increased downside hedging and uncertainty, Dawson says. “Ethereum’s double-digit loss and volatility spike to 83% show just how fast risk can unravel when leverage is high,” he adds. Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata Without a clear de-escalation trigger, the company expects more cautious positioning and subdued momentum in the month ahead, the Head of Research notes. Dawson notes that the BTC options market is currently “scaling back on optimism.” The probability of BTC ending 2025 above $200,000 has dropped to 3.5%. The chance of it surpassing $150,000 in that same period fell to 11%. “Bulls are losing conviction as geopolitical risk and macro headwinds overshadow halving optimism and ETF flows.” At the same time, the likelihood of BTC closing below $80,000 remains unchanged at 20%. All these percentages “show the options market leaning defensive. Traders aren’t betting big on upside right now.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $101,924. At one point over the past day, the coin saw a sharp drop from the intraday high $102,739 and below the psychologically critical $100,000 mark to $98,467. It has recovered somewhat since. Over the past 7 days, we have seen a decrease of 4.5% from the intraweek high of $108,771. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,251. The price saw a daily high of $2,280, falling to $2,134, before rising slightly to the current price. Over the past week, ETH fell 13.7% from the weekly high of $2,671. Moreover, the crypto market sentiment has entered fear territory. The Fear and Greed Index has dropped from 48 on Friday and 40 on Sunday to the current 37 . Now, fear is driving the prices potentially pushing them lower. But it can also present a chance to buy the dip.

The crypto market has seen a significant drop in a day, while the stock markets saw a mixed picture on their last day of trading. The S&P 500 went down by 0.22%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 0.43%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.083%. Investors were on edge over the Israel-Iran war and the US’s potential role. They were then surprised by the US attacks on Iran on Saturday, and this is bound to reflect on the stock market. Is this dip sustainable? Given the current geopolitical and economic developments, the prices may decrease further. Bitcoin may fall below $100,000 and ETH below $2,100.

The deal, which was announced on Monday, will see Diamond Lake Minerals renamed to DiamondLake and refocussed on building a cryptocurrency treasury business. That effort is inspired by Strategy’s bitcoin BTC-heavy corporate treasury strategy but swaps BTC for emerging altcoins. Shares of Diamond Lake Minerals’ were last trading at $3.96, suggesting the deal could be worth above $70 million. The acquisition is expected to close within 20 days, pending standard conditions. Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin framed the move as a bet on the future of cryptocurrencies. He cited legislative shifts like the recent passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act through the country’s Senate as catalysts that could unlock altcoin potential. ""We believe the same results achieved with Bitcoin can be replicated at a fraction of the cost in the alt-coin segment,” Konanykhin said. DiamondLake’s CEO Brian J. Esposito called the deal “historic,” emphasizing the company’s long-standing ambition to bring tokenization into the core of public market investment strategies. The new company will focus on tokenizing real-world assets and making them accessible to everyday investors. The acquisition comes roughly a month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Unicorn and three of its executives, including Konanykhin, for allegedly raising over $100 million in a “massive securities fraud.” The agency claims Unicoin misled investors by inflating real estate valuations and promoting outsized, unrealistic returns, such as a 9 million percent gain, through aggressive marketing campaigns. The SEC is seeking disgorgement and civil penalties. Konanykhin has dismissed the charges as “blatantly false,” and suggested the SEC is still going after crypto firms, even after the regulator dropped cases against firms including Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap. He rejected a proposed settlement meeting in April, calling the SEC’s terms “unacceptable.” In a letter to shareholders, he argued that Unicoin had complied with U.S. regulations and accused the regulator of inflicting “multi-billion-dollar damages” through its probe.",Finance|Unicoin|acquisition|Exclusive|News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-23 11:45:00

In a new video update, crypto strategist Cheds tells his 49,800 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend remains strong as the price of BTC trades above multiple moving averages on the weekly chart. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is just taking a breather after climbing from its 2025 low of around $74,000. “I think it’s hard to call a top here… How can you call a top? Look at this weekly chart. It’s by definition a stage one uptrend in a sense that it’s price above a rising EMA (exponential moving average) 8, and with this incredible price distance to a rising MA (moving average) 200, and a pretty good slope to the rising 200 as well. So there’s plenty of strength. There’s no way to call the top yet. We certainly know we’re consolidating.” Source: Cheds/YouTube In 2021, Bitcoin cratered after failing to take out the $69,000 level twice. The loss in bullish momentum triggered a bear market that sent BTC down to $16,000. For now, Cheds outlines levels to watch as Bitcoin consolidates. “$88,500 for me is the last level that needs to hold should $96,000 get tested and fail. And it’s a zone, not a number… Any kind of top now is not based on available information.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $101,957.

This transaction involves a staggering 23,552 ETH, valued at approximately $52.56 million at the time of the transfer, according to on-chain analytics shared by Onchain Lens on X. Who is DiscusFish and Why Does F2Pool Matter? Before diving into the implications of this move, it’s important to understand the entities involved. DiscusFish is a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency space, particularly within the mining sector. F2Pool is one of the world’s largest and oldest cryptocurrency mining pools, supporting the mining of various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and previously Ethereum (before its transition to Proof-of-Stake). While F2Pool is primarily known for mining, individuals associated with such large-scale operations often hold significant crypto assets. Therefore, a large ETH deposit from an address linked to a co-founder is noteworthy. The Massive ETH Deposit to Binance: What Happened? On-chain data indicates that an address associated with DiscusFish moved 23,552 ETH directly to Binance. This is a substantial amount by any standard, immediately raising questions within the market. Transfers of this magnitude from addresses associated with long-term holders or prominent figures to centralized exchanges like Binance are often interpreted as potential preparation for selling. Exchanges provide the necessary liquidity for large trades without causing excessive slippage on smaller decentralized platforms. Key details of the transaction: Amount: 23,552 ETH Approximate Value: $52.56 million Origin: Address linked to F2Pool co-founder “DiscusFish” Destination: Binance Exchange Source of Information: Onchain Lens (via X) The move of such a large quantity of Binance ETH immediately alerted on-chain analysts and traders, who constantly monitor for signs of significant supply changes hitting exchanges. Why Would a Crypto Whale Deposit $52.5M in ETH? A crypto whale deposit of this size isn’t made without reason. While the exact motive remains speculative unless confirmed by DiscusFish himself, several possibilities are typically considered: Preparation for Selling: This is the most common interpretation. Moving assets to an exchange is a necessary step before executing large sell orders to realize profits, manage risk, or exit a position. Seeking Liquidity: The funds might be needed for other ventures, investments, or operational costs, requiring conversion to stablecoins or fiat. Lending or Derivatives: The ETH could be intended for use in lending protocols or complex derivatives trading available on the exchange, rather than an outright sale. Diversification: The individual might be looking to reallocate capital into other assets, either within crypto or traditional markets. Given the scale, any intention to sell even a portion of this Binance ETH could potentially add selling pressure to the market, depending on how and when it is executed. Analyzing the Potential Market Impact Large movements of crypto assets to exchanges are closely watched because they represent potential supply increases available for trading. A significant crypto whale deposit like this, particularly for a major asset like ETH, can sometimes precede price volatility. If the deposited ETH is indeed sold, it adds sell-side pressure, which could lead to a price decline, especially if market demand isn’t strong enough to absorb the supply. Conversely, sometimes these large deposits are used for other purposes (like lending or derivatives), or the selling is done gradually via OTC (Over-The-Counter) desks, minimizing direct impact on exchange order books. However, the sheer size of this ETH deposit means it’s a factor traders are now considering in their analysis of ETH’s short-term price action. Staying Informed: Tracking Crypto Whale Deposits This event highlights the value of on-chain analysis in the cryptocurrency market. Tracking large transfers from known entities or significant addresses can provide insights into potential future market movements. While not a guaranteed predictor, monitoring crypto whale deposit activity is a key tool for many traders trying to gauge market sentiment and potential supply/demand dynamics. Tools and platforms that analyze blockchain data allow anyone to observe these large transactions, offering a degree of transparency not typically found in traditional financial markets. Staying informed about such movements, like this large Binance ETH transfer, can help market participants make more informed decisions. Conclusion The reported deposit of 23,552 ETH ($52.56 million) by an address linked to F2Pool co-founder DiscusFish into Binance is a significant event in the crypto space. While the exact intentions behind this massive ETH deposit remain unconfirmed, the move to a major exchange like Binance is often interpreted as preparation for potential selling. This crypto whale deposit serves as a reminder of the impact large holders can have on market dynamics and underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data for insights into potential shifts in supply. The market will now watch closely to see if this deposit translates into significant selling pressure for Ethereum.

This collaboration, announced today, aims to integrate Algorand’s blockchain technology with Paycode’s robust payment infrastructure. As revealed in a press release, the aim is to bring financial inclusion to underserved communities in regions with limited internet access. The partnership has sparked optimism in the Algorand community, contributing to a slight uptick in ALGO’s price despite broader market volatility. Algorand joins forces with Paycode to bolster financial inclusion The Algorand Foundation and Paycode are set to revolutionize digital payments by combining Algorand’s scalable, secure blockchain with Paycode’s offline-first payment solutions. Algorand Foundation @AlgoFoundation · Follow 🚨 Big news for AlgorandWe’re partnering with Paycode, a global leader in offline biometric payments, to bring secure, inclusive financial infrastructure on-chain.Together, we’ll deliver blockchain-powered payments to underserved communities in Afghanistan, Ghana, Zambia, 3:58 pm · 23 Jun 2025 197 Reply Copy link Read 11 replies Operating in countries like Afghanistan, Ghana, Zambia, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Paycode has already facilitated $250 million in secure aid and social payments, leveraging biometric identity and real-time transaction capabilities. Through this partnership, the two organizations will explore hosting elements of Paycode’s infrastructure on Algorand’s blockchain. Per details in the announcement, the focus will be on transparent aid disbursement, stablecoin-based settlements, and resilient financial tools for offline environments. This initiative aligns with Algorand’s mission to address global challenges such as financial exclusion. By enhancing digital identity systems and enabling secure payments in remote areas, the collaboration seeks to empower millions who lack access to formal financial services. “This partnership brings blockchain into direct service of people who need it most,” said Staci Warden, CEO of the Algorand Foundation. “Paycode is already reaching some of the most difficult places to serve. Together, we have the opportunity to make those systems more transparent, efficient, and trusted.” ALGO price up despite market turbulence The announcement by Algorand Foundation has bolstered investor confidence, with Algorand’s native token, ALGO, up on the day. ALGO price dipped alongside other cryptocurrencies over the weekend, but was up nearly 2% on Monday. The token traded around $0.16 as of June 23, 2025. Though barely notable, the price increase stands out against a turbulent crypto market, where many assets have faced downward pressure. For ALGO, positive sentiment from the partnership’s potential to expand Algorand’s real-world utility has bulls eyeing breakout above $0.2. What’s likely to boost the Algorand price? Analysts attribute ALGO’s resilience to Algorand’s growing ecosystem and its focus on practical applications. Recent developments, including the launch of AlgoKit 3.0 and tokenized US Treasuries, have strengthened Algorand’s position as a hub for real-world assets and decentralized finance. The Paycode partnership further underscores Algorand’s commitment to scalability and compliance, positioning it favorably for institutional adoption. Despite a 29% price drop over the past month, bulls have a slight edge given overall predictions for the crypto market. Analysts at QCP shared a positive outlook via X on Monday. “Markets seem to be discounting the chance of major escalation. The US is pressuring China to contain Tehran, which may be calming sentiment,” they noted. As the geopolitical situation unfolds, market participants will closely monitor ALGO’s performance.

Just two months prior, OKX settled all of its lawsuits with US authorities and is already starting to relaunch its crypto operations in the US market. OKX is excited to make a quick turnaround from being accused of regulatory violations to being accepted again by investors. OKX agreed with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to pay a settlement of $504 million in penalties. Crypto journalist Yueqi Yang wrote on X that OKX, one of the top three global crypto exchanges, “will consider an IPO in the U.S. after relaunching in the U.S. in April. From IPOs to crypto treasury stocks, crypto is booming right now, but the rally is playing out in the stock market, at valuations that even surprised industry insiders.” US authorities allowed OKX exchange to continue operations in America after the company agreed to restructure its policies to comply with regulations, including a settlement payment of $504 million to the DOJ. OKX officially re-entered the US market in April 2025. US shareholders will now be able to access a crypto ecosystem with one of the world’s biggest user bases. An IPO further aligns OKX with strict regulatory requirements, instilling trust in traditional investors. The move may further introduce investors to cryptocurrencies and raise awareness of blockchain business models. The Trump administration has encouraged crypto businesses to relocate to America. Crypto-based IPOs have become a new craze in the business world, alongside Bitcoin treasuries. OKX has shown various initiatives to prove its long-term interest in the US market, including opening a regional department in San Jose, California. Roshan Robert, US CEO of OKX, has been appointed head strategist to lead the crypto operations in America. Robert has had extensive experience in the finance industry, including senior executive positions at Barclays and a career at Morgan Stanley. Robert said he wants to create a “super app” for the US market. This may refer to a similar concept of Elon Musk’s “everything app”, which includes an assortment of services in one app. Robert wishes to move the company forward from being an offshore crypto company to an established business in the US. American regulatory bodies have become supportive of the crypto industry, dispelling uncertainty when regulating crypto businesses such as OKX. Many exchanges have avoided America to bypass the inherent drama that comes with the environment. However, OKX has volunteered to allow US regulators to open up their business model and scrutinise it with a fine-tooth comb. The US stock market can offer many benefits to the OKX exchange, such as introducing traditional investors to the crypto market in a controlled environment and introducing an element of trust to a trustless financial innovation. The timeline for the IPO is not clear yet, and the SEC has not fully approved the application. However, there have been other crypto businesses that have been successful in their attempts to go public. Gemini, for example, is a crypto company founded by the Winklevoss twins and successfully initiated an IPO in recent months. The news, however, has not been entirely positive for OKX, with Thailand’s SEC shutting down its operations due to not having a license in the country. US approval, therefore, may be a game changer for the crypto exchange because the company has operations across the globe to contend with. Crypto IPOs have encouraged various crypto businesses to create their public offerings. The big names include Winklevoss’ Gemini, Peter Thiel’s Bullish, and FalcolnX. OKX has taken a humble approach to dealing with US regulators, agreeing to pay over $500 million in penalties as part of a settlement plan. The DOJ accused the crypto exchange of serving US customers without a money transmitter license. OKX made a public statement saying that the company wishes to balance innovation with regulatory compliance, learning from past mistakes, and moving forward with a new business roadmap. From the perspective of a crypto exchange, gaining IPO status and adhering to strict regulations may protect the exchange from further legal challenges from the DOJ officials.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-23 11:54:56

In the last 24 hours alone, XRP slipped by 2% to $1.99, sparking concerns among investors and XRP enthusiasts. This 2.18% decline yesterday adds to a 7.93% drop since June 19, when XRP was priced at $2.17. At one point, XRP even touched $1.90, raising fears of a deeper correction. But experts suggest the problem isn’t with XRP itself. Why Did XRP Drop This Week? Analysts believe the XRP price fall isn’t about weak fundamentals but rather a result of broader market-wide pressure. According to Versan Aljarrah , co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, the recent drop reflects overall market volatility, not a failure in XRP’s utility or use case. “XRP is simply following broader market sentiment,” he explained. Geopolitical Tensions Rock the Crypto Market The global crypto market is currently bearish . Over the last 24 hours, it has dropped by 2.6% , affecting nearly all major assets. Here’s a quick snapshot of this week’s top losers: Bitcoin: -4.9% Ethereum: -14% XRP: -8.3% Solana: -14.7% Dogecoin: -14% Cardano: -15.7% Sui & BCH: -20.3% each The Israel-Iran conflict is believed to be the main trigger. The Israel-Iran Conflict and Its Ripple Effects On June 22, the U.S. bombed three key Iranian nuclear sites, marking the most aggressive Western military action against Iran since 1979. In retaliation, Iran launched missiles at Israel and threatened U.S. bases in the Middle East. Iran’s parliament has also voted to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil passage. Oil Prices Surge – Crypto Takes a Hit The conflict has sent oil prices soaring: Brent Crude: +3% WTI Futures: 5-month high If oil prices climb to $100–$150 per barrel, as some analysts warn, it could lead to global inflation, lower liquidity, and a crypto sell-off. Rising energy costs also hurt Bitcoin mining profitability, adding further pressure to the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Holders Are ‘Cosmic Royalty’ Leading a Global Financial Shift , Can XRP Bounce Back?

Expert EGRAG Crypto predicts XRP could hit: $6.70 $13 Even $27 if historic trends repeat Over the past year, XRP has gained 310.4%, outperforming even Bitcoin and Ethereum. Supporters argue its real value lies in its utility, not market noise. Final Thoughts XRP’s fall below $2 may feel alarming, but market analysts urge caution. The decline appears to be part of a broader correction in the crypto market, driven by geopolitical and macroeconomic shocks. As always, short-term volatility doesn’t erase long-term potential—especially for utility-driven assets like XRP. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A Japanese publicly listed company is making waves in the crypto world with a significant move that underscores a growing global trend. Metaplanet, a firm that has been increasingly vocal about its pivot towards a Bitcoin -first treasury strategy, just announced a major increase in its holdings, bringing its total stash to a rather symmetrical number. Metaplanet’s Latest Bold BTC Acquisition In a recent announcement shared via their official communication channels, Metaplanet confirmed a substantial addition to their Bitcoin reserves. The company acquired an additional 1,111 BTC. This isn’t just any purchase; it’s a move that significantly boosts their position and signals continued conviction in the digital asset. This latest BTC Acquisition is particularly noteworthy, not just for its size, but also for the round number it brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to. Following this purchase, Metaplanet now proudly holds a grand total of 11,111 BTC. For context, acquiring 1,111 BTC represents a significant capital allocation for any company, especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. It reflects a deliberate strategy to increase exposure to Bitcoin as a core component of their financial planning. Who is Metaplanet and Why the Focus on Japan Bitcoin? Metaplanet is a company that has been undergoing a transformation. While its original business activities might have been in different sectors, it has recently gained prominence specifically for its strategic shift towards accumulating Bitcoin . Think of them as Japan’s answer to companies like MicroStrategy, which have aggressively adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Their focus on Japan Bitcoin isn’t just about being a Japanese company buying crypto. It highlights the increasing interest and potential for corporate adoption within Japan’s unique economic and regulatory environment. Japan has a well-established history with cryptocurrency, being one of the first countries to regulate exchanges. However, corporate adoption at this scale is still relatively new and highly impactful. Metaplanet’s strategy appears to be rooted in macroeconomics. With global currencies, including the Japanese Yen, facing inflationary pressures and potential devaluation concerns, companies are seeking alternative stores of value. Bitcoin , with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, presents itself as a potential hedge against these risks. By positioning themselves heavily in Bitcoin , Metaplanet is betting on its long-term appreciation and its ability to preserve capital in an uncertain economic climate. The Growing Trend of Corporate Treasury in BTC Metaplanet’s move isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s part of a larger, evolving trend where companies are beginning to consider Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of their Corporate Treasury strategy. This shift was largely pioneered by US-based companies, but it’s now gaining traction globally, including in Asia. Why are companies looking at Corporate Treasury allocation in Bitcoin ? Several factors are driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: Traditional fiat currencies are subject to inflation, eroding purchasing power. Bitcoin’s capped supply makes it attractive as a potential hedge. Store of Value: Similar to gold, Bitcoin is seen by proponents as a digital store of value, capable of preserving wealth over time. Potential Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential compared to traditional assets or holding cash. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet away from solely holding fiat currency or low-yield traditional assets. Attracting Talent/Innovation: For some tech-forward companies, embracing Bitcoin aligns with their brand and can attract employees and investors interested in the digital economy. Companies like MicroStrategy remain the most prominent example, holding tens of thousands of Bitcoin . Tesla also made a significant purchase, although they have adjusted their holdings over time. Metaplanet is now positioning itself among the significant corporate holders, particularly as a leader in the Japan Bitcoin space. Benefits and Challenges of a BTC Acquisition Strategy Adopting a BTC Acquisition strategy for a company’s treasury comes with both potential benefits and significant challenges. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: The most obvious benefit if Bitcoin’s price increases. Balance Sheet Strength: A rising BTC price can significantly boost a company’s reported asset value. Hedge Against Currency Devaluation: Protection against the weakening of the local fiat currency (relevant for Metaplanet with the Yen). Increased Visibility and Investor Interest: Becoming a ‘ Bitcoin company’ can attract a specific type of investor. Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can swing dramatically, leading to potential impairment losses on the balance sheet (as per accounting rules). Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is still evolving globally, which could impact holdings or the ability to transact. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for Bitcoin can be complex, often treated as an intangible asset subject to impairment testing. Public Perception: Some stakeholders might view holding Bitcoin as too risky or speculative. Metaplanet’s decision to make such a large BTC Acquisition suggests they have weighed these factors and are comfortable with the risks, believing the long-term benefits outweigh them. Their strategy is a bold statement of confidence in Bitcoin as a future global reserve asset. Metaplanet’s Holdings: A Closer Look at 11,111 BTC The number 11,111 is visually striking and easy to remember. While perhaps coincidental, it adds a layer of symbolic interest to Metaplanet’s significant Bitcoin stack. At current market prices (which are constantly fluctuating), 11,111 BTC represents a substantial investment, likely valued in the hundreds of millions of US dollars. This places Metaplanet firmly on the map as a significant corporate holder of Bitcoin , especially within the Asian market. Their journey to 11,111 BTC wasn’t a single event. Metaplanet has been accumulating Bitcoin over time, demonstrating a phased approach to building their treasury position. This latest purchase of 1,111 BTC is a significant leap towards their stated goal of becoming a major Bitcoin -centric company. This level of commitment from a publicly traded Japanese company could serve as an example for other firms in Japan and across Asia who are watching the performance and strategy of early corporate adopters like Metaplanet. Implications for Japan’s Crypto Market and Beyond Metaplanet’s aggressive BTC Acquisition strategy has several potential implications: Validation for Bitcoin: A major publicly traded company in a G7 nation making Bitcoin a core treasury asset lends significant credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset. Encouragement for Other Japanese Firms: Metaplanet’s success (or challenges) with its strategy could influence other Japanese companies considering similar moves. Increased Institutional Interest: Large corporate buys contribute to the overall demand for Bitcoin and signal increasing institutional adoption. Focus on Japan’s Regulatory Environment: As more companies in Japan consider this path, it might put pressure on regulators to provide clearer guidance or frameworks for corporate crypto holdings. The move reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is transitioning from a niche retail investment to an asset class considered by sophisticated financial players and corporations looking to protect and grow their capital in the long term. Metaplanet is at the forefront of this shift in Japan. What Can We Learn? Actionable Insights Metaplanet’s journey offers several insights for investors and businesses alike: Conviction Matters: Metaplanet’s repeated and large purchases demonstrate high conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, despite short-term volatility. Macroeconomic Drivers are Key: Their strategy is clearly linked to concerns about fiat currency stability and inflation. Understanding these macroeconomic factors is crucial when evaluating Bitcoin’s role. Corporate Adoption is a Growing Force: While still early, the trend of companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is real and could be a significant demand driver over time. Japan is a Market to Watch: Metaplanet’s move puts the spotlight on Japan as a potential hub for corporate crypto adoption in Asia. Due Diligence is Essential: While Metaplanet is making bold moves, any company or individual considering a significant BTC Acquisition must conduct thorough due diligence on risks, security, and accounting. Metaplanet isn’t just buying Bitcoin ; they are adopting a strategic financial posture that is increasingly being explored by forward-thinking corporations globally. Summary: Metaplanet Solidifies its Position as a Japan Bitcoin Leader In conclusion, Metaplanet’s latest acquisition of 1,111 BTC, bringing their total holdings to 11,111 BTC, is a significant development. It underscores their unwavering commitment to a Bitcoin -centric Corporate Treasury strategy and positions them as a leading example of corporate BTC Acquisition in Japan. This move reflects a broader global trend of companies seeking hedges against macroeconomic uncertainty and recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value. As Metaplanet continues its journey, the market will be watching closely to see how this bold strategy unfolds and whether it inspires more Japanese and Asian companies to follow suit into the world of Japan Bitcoin .

Analyst Reveals Key BTC Ratio To Watch,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-to-30-beyond-2026-analyst-reveals-key-btc-ratio-to-watch/,"The market technician known on X as Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX) has published a post that condenses years of his XRP/BTC work into one number—2,041 satoshis—and a set of time-stamped price targets that reach as high as $30 per XRP once Bitcoin hits $270,000. In the post, the analyst begins with a sharp rebuke of critics who, in his words, “pretend to be idiots just to troll” before pivoting to a rigorously structured roadmap. He breaks price action into five nested horizons—intraday, daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly—and assigns each its own decision-making role. XRP Moon Scenario: $30 Target Needs One Final Signal The crux of the argument is that monthly price candles must be read in isolation from what he calls the “noise” of the lower frames if traders want to understand where serious accumulation or distribution is taking place. “Bullish target: ~$4–4.5 (3.5 K sats on 120–130 K BTC). Very bullish target: ~$18–30 (7 K–12 K sats / 270 K BTC).” Those levels are not merely numeric goals; they are the by-product of a ratio he views as structural. A monthly close below 2,041 satoshis would, paradoxically, increase his confidence in the “very bullish” path—but only “very long term (2026+),” because such a breakdown would probably trigger what he calls a flush toward 1,800, 1,500 or even 700 sats first. Conversely, a defense of that shelf preserves a less spectacular—but cleaner—advance toward 3,500 sats (~$4–4.50 at current six-figure Bitcoin prices) and keeps alive the 7,000-to-12,000-satoshi objective for the extended cycle top. Related Reading: XRP Daily New Addresses Plunge 80% In 2025 — Bearish On-Chain Metrics Raise Alarm The thread’s most practical value may lie in its explanation of why no immediate weekly up-trend should be expected even in the “most bullish” scenario. Dr Cat points to classic Ichimoku conditions—Chikou Span under price, a downward-angled Kijun-sen and a bearish Tenkan/Kijun cross—arguing that history shows it can take “~26 weeks at least” for those signals to unwind. Any rally toward 2,700 sats in the next couple of months would therefore be viewed as a Kijun retest ripe for rejection rather than the start of a sustained breakout. The analyst also clarifies a point that has caused confusion among casual readers: his $270,000 Bitcoin estimate is a macro-cycle cap, not a near-term forecast. He explicitly states that he expects the current market cycle to “extend to 2026 and beyond,” which is why the loftiest XRP numbers sit at the far right of his timeline. Everything, he insists, flows from the ratio between the two assets, not from dollar-denominated targets considered in isolation. Related Reading: ‘Out of Time’: XRP Consolidation Hits Final Moment, Analyst Alerts Context comes in the form of a brief exchange with a skeptic posting under the handle “Woo tard of Wall St”, who mocked the notion of a $7 XRP at 270,000 BTC. Dr Cat’s reply—delivered without diluting his language—underscores how strongly he views the time-horizon mismatch between traders who obsess over daily candles and those who plot quarterly swings. Technicians may quibble with the assumption that one static ratio can govern a three-year outlook, but the post offers a coherent, internally consistent playbook: watch the monthly close against 2,041 sats. Hold it, and the roadmap favors an eventual attack on 3,500 sats and, later, 7,000-plus. Lose it, and the pair probably capitulates before any “monster move” can emerge in the second half of the decade. Either outcome, Dr Cat argues, will resolve whether the XRP narrative of under-performance finally gives way to what would be its most spectacular out-performance against Bitcoin since 2017. For market participants seeking a single data point to anchor their risk management, 2,041 satoshis now functions as that fulcrum. Until the monthly candle prints, every tick above or below the line will feed the debate over whether XRP is coiling for a generational breakout—or simply rehearsing another round of disappointment. At press time, XRP traded at $2.01.

According to the latest report by Crypto.com, the number of crypto owners across the world surged by 14% in 2024 to hit 659 million by the end of the year. The total market capitalization of digital assets has also doubled from $1.7 trillion at the onset of 2024 to around $3.3 trillion as of writing. In this article, we’ll dive into some of the key growth trends in Web3, including where the most adoption has been happening, regulatory factors at play as well as the strategic role of retail-focused exchanges like XBO when it comes to onboarding more stakeholders from emerging markets like the LATAM region and EMEA. Crypto Awareness is on an Uptrend in Emerging Economies According to a recent Web3 global survey by Consensys, 93% of the people surveyed across the world are aware of crypto assets. What’s more intriguing, however, is the level of awareness in emerging countries; most of the respondents who claim to understand crypto were from Nigeria (77%), South Africa (65%) and India (60%). At the same time, crypto ownership is also significantly higher in these emerging economies; Nigeria leads the pack again with the number of respondents who own or have previously owned crypto at 73%, South Africa (68%) the Philippines (54%), Vietnam (54%) and India (52%). The percentage of Africans or Asians who intend to invest in crypto assets within the next one year was also significantly higher compared to other regions. Source: Consensys The U.S. Leads in Institutional Adoption, But Not Yet There… According to Chainalysis ‘ 2024 Global Adoption Index ’, the U.S ranked fourth in the overall indexing which comprised four major metrics; Centralized service value received ranking, Retail centralized service value received ranking, DeFi value received ranking, Retail DeFi value received ranking. What stood out was the amount of institutional capital from U.S. companies that found its way into the crypto market. For context, Bitcoin Spot ETFs attracted over $129 billion in inflows between their launch date on January 10, 2024 and the close of the year. Source: Farside But despite the impressive institutional figures, it is worth noting that retail adoption isn’t picking up as much in the U.S. compared to the emerging economies mentioned above. This can be attributed to the uncertain regulatory environment compared to other advanced regions like Europe where MiCA provisions came into full application on December, 30 2024. On the brighter side, the U.S. senate recently passed the Genius act which sailed through with a 68 – 30 vote; with the bill now going to the House, there is a good chance it will become the first of its kind stablecoin regulatory framework for companies looking to issue or manage this type of digital asset within the U.S.A. At the core, the Genius Act introduces clarity in stablecoin regulation, protecting consumers and reinforcing national security measures when dealing with stablecoins. “The bipartisan GENIUS Act will provide regulatory clarity to this important industry, keep innovation on shore, add robust consumer protection, and reaffirm the dominance of the U.S. dollar,” – noted the co-sponsor of the bill, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). MiCA Framework Has Positioned Europe for Web3 Innovation As mentioned in the previous section, the MiCA framework is now in full effect. While this regulation had earlier on been met with skepticism, more crypto companies are setting up shop in Europe thanks to the clarity it provides. Some of the notable firms that have received a MiCA license since the framework was adopted include OKX which has established its European base in Malta, Crypto.com also a similar path during the same wave. Both crypto exchanges now have the flexibility to provide their services across the EU owing to the passporting provision for MiCA-licensed entities. The latest survey on Web3 startups indicated that Europe tops the world with over 3900 crypto startups; while this number may have reduced as most of these companies were not MiCA-compliant at the time of the survey, it is evident that the clarity in registration has placed Europe ahead when it comes to Web3 innovation. A Growing Market in LATAM Countries Another worthy observation is the growing Web3 market in LATAM countries. Out of the top 20 in the Chainalysis adoption list, LATAM countries featured prominently with the likes of Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and Argentina making the cut. What’s particularly interesting in these markets is the levels at which adoption is happening. In Argentina for example, the football governing body, Argentine Football Association (AFA) has partnered with XBO, a leading digital crypto exchange focused on making digital asset trading secure, accessible and user-friendly. This strategic partnership is testament to a growing demand by LATAM countries, from retail to institutions to governments like El Salvador which had already adopted Bitcoin as legal tender but dropped it earlier this year following pressure from the IMF. It is also worth noting that LATAM was the second faster growing region, with a 42.5% year-over-year growth in crypto adoption according to the Chainlysis report. Source: Chainalysis Conclusion Web3 has come a long since Bitcoin’s debut in 2009; today, crypto is the only financial market globally that trades 24/7. But more importantly, we’re witnessing the adoption of Web3 both on a retail and institutional level. On the retail front, emerging economies are driving the metrics while advanced countries like the U.S. lead in institutional activity. The next decade will surely be interesting for Web3, it will be intriguing to witness how the latest regulatory developments steer adoption as well as the growing crypto use cases in the LATAM region, Africa and Central & Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO).",Information,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 12:02:15

Notably, the coin’s price dropped as low as $1.95 on Sunday before recovering slightly above $2. Nevertheless, amid this fragile macro environment , analyst Egrag Crypto believes XRP is still poised for an explosive upward move that could catapult the asset as high as $27 if a key technical breakout unfolds in July. In a Sunday post on X, the analyst framed XRP’s current market structure as part of a larger bullish formation. “XRP – Kangaroo + Gaussian Channel + EMA = Valhalla,” he wrote, asserting that the token remains above the critical threshold of the Gaussian Channel on the weekly timeframe. Notably, he pegged the channel’s upper limit at $1.75 and warned that falling below it could be like sinking into “quicksand” or a slip that risks ending the current bullish cycle altogether. Despite this risk, he’s confident that XRP has one more “epic” leg up. He pointed to the 21-week EMA as a key line in the sand, noting that while brief deviations below it may signal macro consolidation, a full-bodied close above it, particularly above the $2.33 resistance, would strongly confirm renewed bullish momentum. “Closing full-body candles above the 21 EMA is an extreme bullish sign, ” he stated. He added that a decisive breakout above $2.65 would mark a “GO/GO” moment for XRP’s long-term trajectory. Egrag also revisited his broader thesis, based on XRP’s breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern, the same kind that preceded its historic rally in 2017. That previous breakout saw XRP climb from $0.23 to $3.84, a 1,560% move. By comparison, the recent breakout in November 2024 has so far yielded a modest 485% gain, suggesting that the full potential of the pattern is yet to play out. That said, according to Egrag, if XRP maintains key support levels through June and confirms the bullish breakout in July, it could trigger what he calls the “Valhalla rally,” a meteoric rise to $27. It’s not the first time he’s mentioned this target, but this time, he ties it to Fibonacci extensions, wave theory, and long-term structural analysis. Adding to the bullish sentiment, fellow analyst Dark Defender echoed Egrag’s confidence. “ Nothing has changed on the XRP side,” he wrote , pointing out how the $1.88 support held firm during the recent dip. He noted that XRP still maintains its Monthly Wave 5 structure, part of a broader Elliott Wave count forecasting a push toward a new high. Dark Defender also cited a bounce at $2.07 as confirmation of market resilience and reiterated that a surge above $3.50 remains likely if Wave 5 unfolds as expected. His analysis leans heavily on Fibonacci retracement levels. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.0,1, reflecting a 1.93% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-23 12:09:55

Binance Japan has officially announced the upcoming launch of NEIRO crypto spot trading against the Japanese Yen (JPY). This move marks another step in broadening the accessible assets for users engaging in JPY crypto trading on the exchange. What’s the Big News from Binance Japan? The core announcement is straightforward yet impactful for the Japanese crypto market. According to an official statement from the exchange, Binance Japan will list the NEIRO/JPY spot trading pair. This means users will soon be able to directly trade NEIRO using Japanese Yen. Here are the key details you need to know: Trading Pair: NEIRO/JPY Listing Date & Time: June 25, 2024, at 08:00 UTC Trading Type: Spot Trading This addition is specifically for the crypto spot trading market, allowing users to buy and sell NEIRO for immediate settlement in JPY. Why is Binance NEIRO Listing Against JPY Important? The listing of Binance NEIRO directly against the Japanese Yen is particularly noteworthy for several reasons, primarily centered around accessibility and market integration within Japan. For Japanese residents and those trading on Binance Japan , having a direct JPY pair simplifies the trading process, removing the need to first convert JPY to a stablecoin like USDT or a major crypto like BTC before acquiring NEIRO. This direct route can save on transaction fees and reduce complexity. Furthermore, adding a direct JPY pair can potentially increase liquidity for NEIRO within the Japanese market, making it easier for both buyers and sellers to execute trades at desired prices. It signals Binance Japan ‘s commitment to providing tailored trading options for its local user base. What Exactly is NEIRO Crypto? Before diving into trading, it’s crucial to understand the asset itself. NEIRO crypto represents the native digital asset of a specific blockchain project. Typically, such cryptocurrencies power their respective ecosystems, facilitating transactions, enabling participation in governance, or serving specific utility functions within decentralized applications (dApps) or networks. Understanding the project’s fundamentals, use case, technology, and team is a vital step before engaging in crypto spot trading of NEIRO or any other digital asset. Sweetening the Deal: Zero Maker Fees Promotion To celebrate the launch of the NEIRO/JPY trading pair, Binance Japan is rolling out an attractive promotion. Users will benefit from zero maker fees for trades on this specific pair for a limited time. Here are the details of the promotion: Promotion Detail Information Eligible Pair NEIRO/JPY Spot Trading Promotion Period June 25, 2024, 08:00 UTC to July 25, 2024, 07:00 UTC Benefit Zero Maker Fees Zero maker fees mean that users who place limit orders that add liquidity to the order book (maker orders) will not incur any trading fees during this period. This can significantly reduce the cost of accumulating or distributing NEIRO, making it an opportune time for active traders to engage with the Binance NEIRO pair. Understanding Crypto Spot Trading For those new to the term, crypto spot trading involves buying or selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery. When you place a spot trade on Binance Japan , you are trading the actual underlying asset (NEIRO) against another asset (JPY) at the current market price. Unlike derivatives trading (like futures or options), you own the cryptocurrency directly once the trade is settled. Spot trading is often considered more straightforward than derivatives and is the primary way many users enter the crypto market. The NEIRO/JPY pair on Binance Japan will operate within this spot market framework. Actionable Steps for Trading NEIRO/JPY If you are a user on Binance Japan and wish to trade the new Binance NEIRO pair, here’s what you might need to do: Ensure Account Verification: Make sure your Binance Japan account is fully verified to enable trading. Deposit JPY or NEIRO: Fund your account with Japanese Yen or deposit NEIRO if you hold it elsewhere. Navigate to Spot Market: On June 25th at 08:00 UTC, the NEIRO/JPY pair will become available in the spot trading section of the platform. Place Your Order: Use limit or market orders to buy or sell NEIRO against JPY. Remember the zero maker fee promotion applies to limit orders that add liquidity. Understand Risks: Always be aware of the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets and trade responsibly. Potential Benefits and Considerations The addition of the NEIRO/JPY pair brings potential benefits but also requires consideration of inherent market challenges. Benefits: Direct access to NEIRO using JPY for Binance Japan users. Potential cost savings through the zero maker fee promotion for a month. Increased liquidity for NEIRO within the Japanese market. Diversification opportunities for portfolios focused on JPY crypto trading . Considerations/Challenges: Cryptocurrency market volatility can lead to rapid price changes. Liquidity for a newly listed, potentially less common asset like NEIRO might initially be lower compared to major pairs. Understanding the NEIRO project’s long-term viability and risks is crucial. Regulatory changes in Japan could impact trading conditions. Conclusion: A New Opportunity on Binance Japan The upcoming launch of the NEIRO/JPY spot trading pair on Binance Japan is an exciting development for traders in the region. It expands the range of assets available for direct JPY crypto trading and introduces the NEIRO crypto asset to a wider audience on the platform. Combined with the limited-time zero maker fee promotion, this listing presents a potentially attractive opportunity for users looking to engage with Binance NEIRO through crypto spot trading . As always, thorough research and a mindful approach to risk management are essential when participating in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/crypto-financial-services-company-matrixport-explains-the-reason-for-ethereums-volatility-here-are-the-details/,"Crypto financial services firm Matrixport noted in its latest analysis that Ethereum’s (ETH) recent price movements were largely driven by positioning in the futures market, but there was no strong fundamental dynamic to support this rise. Matrixport: Ethereum Price Rises on Futures Positions, Lacks Fundamental Support The report stated that Ethereum’s recent sharp pullback was a result of an overheated market structure due to the use of high leverage. Matrixport emphasized that leverage levels are still high, warning that this could create more selling pressure in the short term. On the other hand, the company stated that Bitcoin (BTC) has tried to turn its direction upwards with reaction purchases in recent days, but considering seasonal trends, this recovery is unlikely to be sustainable. According to Matrixport, it is critical for Bitcoin to defend the $98,000 level to maintain its current technical structure. A breakdown below this level could trigger a broader correction. The analysis also emphasized that due to the intensity of leveraged long positions, sharp downward movements in the market could occur again in the short term. Due to this structure of Ethereum, a warning was made that it could lose value more quickly in the event of a possible negative news flow or market shock. As a result, Matrixport advised investors to be cautious, noting that markets are currently driven by the balance of leveraged derivative positions, not fundamentals. *This is not investment advice.

The volume of perpetual swaps liquidated was double the activity on centralized exchanges. Solana’s native SOL token is switching to decentralized demand, as DEX perpetual swaps surpass centralized exchange volumes. On-chain liquidations were 96% higher compared to trades on centralized exchanges, showing the growing demand for on-chain perpetual swaps. Solana DEX markets record activity surge During the latest market downturn, Solana saw over $94M in perpetual swap liquidations, compared to around $47M in centralized liquidations on derivative markets. Jupiter DEX was the biggest carrier of long liquidations in the past 24 hours. The rush to trade SOL derivatives also put Jupiter DEX in the top 5 of Solana-based fee producers, with over $3.88M in fees for the past 24 hours. SOL slid to $134.33 following a turbulent weekend that wiped out value from the top assets. The token also crashed to a local low of $128.30, then recovering quickly to also wipe out long positions. Solana has been trading in a range since its recovery following the 2022 crash, and has been suitable for derivative trading on short-term volatility. Following the weekend, liquidations shrank open interest from $3.55B to $2.9B, though still leading to an expansion of long positions to 76% of all open interest. Stabble DEX boosted SOL perpetual swaps Until recently, SOL was mostly used as a baseline trading asset, included in meme token pairs. While other chains hosted their native perpetual DEX, SOL was mostly included in meme trading. The recent spike in on-chain liquidations is linked to the growing activity of Stabble, one of the currently active perpetual swap DEXs on Solana. Solana saw a new trend of perpetual DEX swaps with Stabble, a newly introduced derivatives DEX. | Source: Dune Analytics Stabble has been increasingly active since its token launch in June. The perpetual swaps DEX is just starting out, with $3M in liquidity locked and just over $1B in monthly volumes. However, Stabble turned into the most active DEX, surpassing other Solana-based platforms, including Raydium, Meteora, and Orca. SOL is also among the trending assets on Hyperliquid , entering the top 5 of the most active pairs. The SOL-USD pair traded with over $798M in daily volumes, with over $408M in open interest. The increased activity also drew in whales with significant positions. One of the whales is currently holding a long position on SOL with a notional value above $17M, which holds an unrealized loss of $5.7M . The short-term market volatility also attracted an older Hyperliquid trader with a history of shorting SOL. The trader is sitting on $9.3M in unrealized gains, with other short positions also in the green. The SOL position had a notional value of $39M. The large-scale size of whale short bets may signal downward pressure on the price of the asset, but may also lead to a short squeeze. SOL is still facing pressure from the regular unlocks of Alameda Research, as well as spot selling from fee-generating apps. The expectation for another drop closer to $100 is increasing both spot and derivative activities. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Websites providing real-time data, charts, and news are essential tools for investors and enthusiasts alike. However, a recent alert from a prominent figure in the crypto space serves as a stark reminder that even these seemingly innocuous information hubs can pose significant risks. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of crypto giant Binance, recently issued a critical CZ warning via his X account, highlighting a worrying trend: hackers are actively targeting cryptocurrency information websites. Why are Crypto Information Sites Targeted? Understanding the Threat to Crypto Security Cryptocurrency information websites, such as CoinMarketCap, Cointelegraph, CoinGecko, and many others, serve as vital resources for the community. They provide crucial data like price movements, trading volumes, market capitalization, and breaking news. Their high traffic volume and the nature of their user base – individuals actively involved with digital assets – make them attractive targets for malicious actors. The primary goal is often to exploit users’ connections to their cryptocurrency wallets. Unlike traditional websites, many crypto-related platforms integrate features that allow users to connect their digital wallets directly. This can be for various reasons, such as tracking portfolios, accessing premium features, or participating in specific site functionalities. While convenient, this wallet connection point creates a potential vulnerability if the website’s security is compromised. Hackers aim to inject malicious code that intercepts wallet connection requests, tricks users into signing harmful transactions, or steals private keys or seed phrases. Recent Incidents: The CoinMarketCap Hack and Cointelegraph Attack CZ’s warning was not theoretical; it was based on recent, tangible events. He specifically mentioned two high-profile incidents that occurred just days apart: CoinMarketCap Incident: According to CZ, malware was reportedly planted on CoinMarketCap’s website. While details about the specific type of malware and its delivery method are still emerging, the goal was likely to compromise users interacting with the site. CZ stated that on-chain analysis indicated that 39 victims had collectively lost $18,570 due to this incident. This suggests the malware was effective in tricking a number of users into compromising their funds, likely through fraudulent transaction approvals or seed phrase theft prompts. Cointelegraph Incident: Shortly after the CoinMarketCap news, CZ highlighted that Cointelegraph’s front end was also attacked. A ‘front-end attack’ typically refers to compromising the part of the website that users directly interact with (the browser-side code). This could involve injecting malicious JavaScript that creates fake pop-ups, redirects users to phishing sites, or attempts to capture sensitive information entered by the user. These incidents underscore the evolving tactics of cybercriminals. They are moving beyond direct attacks on exchanges or individual wallets to targeting the infrastructure and services that crypto users rely on daily. How Does a Malicious Wallet Connection Work? Understanding the mechanics of how attackers exploit wallet connections is crucial for self-protection. When you connect your crypto wallet to a website, you are typically giving that site permission to see your public addresses and potentially propose transactions for you to approve. You still need to manually approve any transaction using your wallet interface (be it a browser extension, mobile app, or hardware wallet). However, if a website is compromised, malicious code can: Display Fake Prompts: The compromised site might show a pop-up designed to look exactly like your wallet’s interface, asking for your seed phrase or private key. Propose Malicious Transactions: Instead of a legitimate transaction (like interacting with a DeFi protocol), the site proposes a transaction that, if approved, would drain your wallet or transfer assets to the hacker’s address. The details shown on the fake prompt might be misleading. Install Malware: In some cases, visiting a compromised site could attempt to download and install malware onto your device that can monitor your activity, steal clipboard data (like addresses), or log keystrokes. The danger lies in the user’s trust in the website they are visiting. If the site looks legitimate, users are more likely to interact with prompts that appear on the screen, even if they are malicious. Protecting Yourself: Actionable Steps for Enhanced Crypto Security Given the increased threat landscape, especially concerning websites you connect your wallet to, proactive security measures are non-negotiable. Here’s how you can significantly reduce your risk: Be Extremely Cautious with Wallet Connection s Connect Only When Necessary: Do not keep your wallet connected to websites when you are not actively using a specific feature that requires it. Disconnect immediately after use. Verify the URL: Always double-check the website’s URL before connecting your wallet or interacting with any prompts. Phishing sites often use URLs that are very similar to legitimate ones (e.g., ‘CoinMarkettCap.com’). Bookmark legitimate sites and use those bookmarks. Understand Permissions: When connecting your wallet, pay close attention to the permissions the site is requesting. A simple information site should likely not need permission to initiate transactions or access extensive contract interactions. Enhance Device and Software Security Use a Hardware Wallet: For storing significant amounts of crypto, a hardware wallet (like Ledger or Trezor) is highly recommended. They keep your private keys offline, meaning even if your computer is infected, the keys needed to sign transactions are safe on the physical device. You must physically approve transactions on the hardware wallet itself. Keep Software Updated: Ensure your operating system, web browser, browser extensions (especially wallet extensions), and antivirus software are always up to date. Updates often include critical security patches. Dedicated Browser/Profile: Consider using a dedicated web browser or a separate browser profile solely for interacting with crypto websites and connecting your wallet. This isolates your crypto activity from your general browsing, reducing the risk of cross-contamination from other potentially compromised sites. Install Reputable Antivirus/Anti-Malware: Use reliable security software and run regular scans on your computer. Stay Informed and Skeptical Be Wary of Pop-ups and Prompts: Treat unexpected pop-ups or requests for your seed phrase or private key with extreme suspicion, regardless of which website you are on. Legitimate services and wallets will rarely, if ever, ask for your seed phrase online. Follow Alerts from Trusted Sources: Pay attention to warnings from reputable figures like CZ and official announcements from the crypto websites you use. Educate Yourself: Continuously learn about common crypto scams and attack vectors. Knowledge is your first line of defense. The Significance of CZ’s CZ Warning CZ, having led one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has unparalleled insight into the security challenges facing the ecosystem. Binance is constantly defending against sophisticated attacks, giving CZ a front-row seat to the evolving tactics of cybercriminals. His decision to issue this public CZ warning underscores the severity and prevalence of these specific types of attacks targeting users through seemingly trustworthy information platforms. It’s a call to action for the entire community to heighten their security awareness and practices. The Broader Impact of Attacks Like the CoinMarketCap Hack Attacks on widely used platforms like CoinMarketCap and Cointelegraph have repercussions beyond the immediate financial losses for the victims. They can erode trust in the crypto ecosystem as a whole, making new users hesitant to enter the space. Furthermore, they highlight the interconnectedness of the ecosystem – a vulnerability in one seemingly unrelated service (like an information website) can lead to compromised user funds held on exchanges or in personal wallets. While the $18,570 lost in the reported CoinMarketCap incident might seem relatively small in the grand scheme of crypto hacks, it represents real losses for 39 individuals. It serves as a potent reminder that even ‘small’ exploits can have significant impacts on individuals and that the total damage from such widespread, low-level attacks across multiple platforms could be substantial. Staying Ahead of the Curve The digital asset space is constantly evolving, and so are the methods employed by malicious actors. Staying ahead requires not just reacting to specific warnings like the recent CZ warning but adopting a proactive and security-first mindset in all your crypto interactions. Treat every website interaction, every wallet connection request, and every transaction approval with caution and scrutiny. The convenience of instantly accessing information and connecting wallets comes with inherent risks. By understanding these risks and implementing robust security practices, you can navigate the crypto world more safely and protect your valuable assets from falling victim to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, whether they originate from a compromised information site or elsewhere. Conclusion: Vigilance is Your Best Defense CZ’s recent warning about hackers targeting crypto information websites like CoinMarketCap and Cointelegraph is a critical reminder that security threats exist even where you least expect them. The convenience of a simple wallet connection can become a vulnerability if not handled with extreme care on potentially compromised sites. Attacks like the reported CoinMarketCap hack demonstrate that these threats are real and result in tangible losses for users. By staying informed, being skeptical of unexpected prompts, verifying URLs, and employing robust security measures such as using hardware wallets and dedicated browsers, you can significantly enhance your crypto security . Pay heed to the CZ warning and make security your top priority in the digital asset space.

Notably, Bitcoin briefly plunged below $100,000 on Sunday following a market-wide decline triggered by a U.S. strike on Iran’s nuclear facility , aligning Washington with Israel in the ongoing Middle East conflict. According to an analysis by TradingShot , the recent drop formed a descending channel similar to the correction between December 17, 2024, and January 13, 2025. In both cases, Bitcoin broke below the 50-day moving average ( MA ) and formed a lower low. The January move led to a sharp reversal that retested the all-time high, the analyst noted in a TradingView post on June 23. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView TradingShot also pointed out that the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is once again testing the 41.20 support level, reinforcing the similarity between the two patterns. Given the shorter uptrend since the April 7, 2025, low, the analyst suggested this could be a bull flag, often seen as a continuation pattern within a broader bullish cycle. While a medium-term breakout remains unconfirmed until a weekly candle closes above the record high, T radingShot has set a provisional target of $111,900 for the next potential high. Bitcoin’s short-term play Meanwhile, prominent trader Michaël van de Poppe commented in a June 23 X post that Bitcoin’s reclaim of the $100,000 level marked a possible liquidity grab below prior lows, a bear trap that triggered strong buying interest. Poppe noted that Bitcoin may consolidate in the short term, but a breakout above $102,500 could confirm the end of the correction and spark a renewed rally. He identified $103,800 as a key level for bulls to target. #Bitcoin bounces up swiftly. The second option is filled, peak liquidity taken beneath the low at $100,500 and quick reversal upwards. I think we'll stall for a bit, and once it breaks $102,500, it will likely accelerate upwards and then, the correction is over. pic.twitter.com/d6I12ZMhS7 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 23, 2025 Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $101,260, down 1.4% on the day and over 3% on the weekly chart.

The forecast, which presents a massive upside for the altcoin, is based on the Elliott Wave Theory—a key technical analysis tool. XRP Wave Map Signals Cycle Top Ahead Crypto analyst, XForceGlobal on X (formerly Twitter) has presented a bold new forecast for XRP, projecting a cycle high between $20 and $30. The analyst shared a chart that dissects XRP’s price action over the last several months, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is currently in the final stages of a corrective wave before beginning a powerful multi-leg impulsive rally. If this wave count plays out as the market expert says, XRP could be on the verge of its most aggressive breakout to date. Related Reading: XRP Price Targets $3.61 In Short Term As ‘Cup’ Turns Hot The analysis focuses on XRP’s medium-term correction, which has taken the form of a complex WXY structure. According to the chart, XRP is nearing the completion of Wave 2, a corrective phase that began after the last upward impulse. XForceGlobal has pinpointed a key Fibonacci confluence zone between $1.60 and $1.90, where XRP’s pullback is expected to find support. The chart clearly marks this area as a potential springboard for the next bullish phase, as long as the price does not fall below the $1.618 level, which serves as the invalidation point for the current setup. Despite XRP’s historical track record of sluggish performance and ongoing skepticism within the crypto community about the bullish forecast, XForceGlobal maintains confidence that the cryptocurrency will reach the ambitious $20-$30 cycle top—a move he believes could unfold well into 2026. Intermediate Targets First, Cycle High Later According to XForceGlobal’s chart, once XRP completes its current corrective move, the analyst predicts that the first leg of this upcoming rally may take the cryptocurrency past the $5 mark in Wave 3, followed by a deeper Wave 4 pullback and a final thrust into Wave 5 toward $6 or more. Related Reading: XRP 5-Wave Count Shows When The Price Will Hit All-Time Highs Above $5 While these targets represent an intermediate-term bullish setup, on a macro scale, the long-term wave map implies that the whole structure could later culminate in a parabolic cycle top rally that sends XRP between $20 and possibly even $30. This optimistic outlook gains further credibility, as the analyst notes that XRP’s internal wave count for the flat scenario has taken longer to resolve than initially expected. Beyond technicals, XForceGlobal highlights that market psychology plays a central role in its bullish forecast. He notes that the XRP community has weathered regulatory battles, market crashes, and years of stagnation, most notably the US SEC lawsuit. This prolonged adversity has turned XRP holders into “battle-tested veterans” who are largely immune to fear-driven selling. This resilience, according to the analyst, could be the key to the next bullish phase of XRP’s price action.

Key Takeaways: Blockstream CEO Adam Back says altcoin season is over and urges a shift toward Bitcoin and BTC treasuries. Over 240 public companies now hold Bitcoin, signaling growing institutional interest and adoption. Some BTC treasury firms are trading at steep premiums, raising concerns about investor overexposure. “TSRY SZN is the new ALT SZN for speculators,” he wrote on X on Monday, adding, “Time to dump ALTs into BTC or BTC treasuries.” Back’s remarks come as public companies ramp up Bitcoin accumulation through innovative financial strategies such as convertible notes and equity offerings. These firms, he noted, are buying BTC “on repeat to increase Bitcoin per share,” making them increasingly attractive for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin without holding the asset directly. 240 Firms Now Hold Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin has doubled since June 5, rising from 124 to over 240. Collectively, they now hold approximately 3.96% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Back, who has long championed institutional adoption as a path to “hyperbitcoinization,” reiterated his view that Bitcoin-focused companies offer a potential lifeline to traders stuck in underperforming altcoins. “Maybe they can make back their losses by switching to BTC by way of treasury companies,” he said. yes but i was encouraging them to find a way out of alts. maybe they can make back their losses by switching to btc by way of treasury companies. — Adam Back (@adam3us) June 22, 2025 Still, some treasury firms are drawing scrutiny for the high premiums investors are paying. Metaplanet, a Japanese investment firm, traded at a premium of over $596,000 per BTC-equivalent on May 27, sparking concerns about overvaluation. Momentum behind corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to grow. On June 12, Nasdaq-listed Mercurity Fintech Holding announced an $800 million raise to establish a long-term Bitcoin reserve. Days earlier, France-based Blockchain Group revealed plans to raise $340 million for a similar move. While altcoins lack the same traction, institutional interest hasn’t vanished entirely. Interactive Strength, a Nasdaq-listed fitness tech firm, recently announced plans to raise $500 million to create a Fetch.ai token treasury, suggesting that selective altcoin bets still hold appeal. Utility over speculation. Interactive Strength is allocating up to $500M to purchase $FET as a core component of their AI-powered fitness roadmap. This is what real-world AI adoption looks like. https://t.co/XyaZhUTVxm — Fetch.ai (@Fetch_ai) June 12, 2025 Texas Establishes Public Bitcoin Reserve Notably, Bitcoin adoption has gained momentum at both the national and state levels. Last week, Texas became the first U.S. state to create a publicly funded Bitcoin reserve, following the passage of Senate Bill 21 signed by Governor Greg Abbott. The reserve, overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar, is designed as a standalone fund separate from the state treasury. Unlike similar initiatives in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas is creating a standalone reserve fund entirely separate from the state treasury. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . While Texas moves ahead, other states are retreating from similar efforts. Florida, Arizona, and several others have recently scrapped or vetoed crypto legislation over concerns about volatility and digital assets’ long-term viability.

Its trading platform for crypto perpetual futures has been rapidly embraced by crypto native market participants as an alternative to centralized exchanges. Data from Lookonchain shows a recent transaction made by a speculator who deposited $4.3 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) tokens and opened a long position in the top altcoin worth approximately $100.4 million. A newcomer gambler, 0x916E, deposited 4.28M $USDC into #Hyperliquid and opened a 25x leveraged long on $ETH an hour ago. The position reached 44,523 $ETH ($100.4M), with a liquidation price of $2,196. https://t.co/8u5DW0D4Vj pic.twitter.com/NjrSPoWRM3 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 23, 2025 This netted significant trading fees to HYPE and favors a bullish short-term Hyperliquid price prediction. Although HYPE is not used to settle transactions within this project’s proprietary layer-one blockchain, it can be used by traders to lower transaction fees through staking . This large ETH long positions indicate that deep-pocketed operators are increasingly trusting Hyperliquid with their funds as the platform has proven its efficiency, technical robustness, and commitment to keep innovating and growing. Hyperliquid Price Prediction: HYPE Retests and Bounces Off Key Support at $30 Looking at the 4-hour chart, HYPE made a bullish breakout out of its descending price channel on Sunday with strong volumes as it rose from $33 to $35. This happened after the token bounced strongly off the $30 level – a key psychological threshold where there was probably a significant volume of order blocks. This favors a bullish Hyperliquid price prediction. Rising tensions in the Middle East don’t seem to have deterred investors from scooping up this token at a lower price, possibly as they expect that trading activity could spike during the turmoil. The price will likely retest the upper bound of this descending price channel to confirm the strength of buyers’ interest. If it encounters enough liquidity, the price could fully reserve the downtrend and move up to retest HYPE’s $46 all-time high. One of the most innovative aspects of Hyperliquid is the fact that its trading platform functions in an efficient proprietary layer-one platform specifically designed to process transactions quickly and efficiently. As the home of meme coins , the Solana network needs to ensure that it can continue to scale to keep up with rising transaction volumes from this segment of the crypto market. Solaxy (SOLX), a layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, is just two hours away from wrapping up its successful crypto presale. Don’t miss your chance to invest in this promising project at its discounted presale price. Solaxy (SOLX) Raises $58M and Prepares to Launch Its Mainnet in Early July Solaxy (SOLX) is ready for the next stage of its development as its presale is about to end. The team behind this L2 has already made significant progress in deploying a testnet and a block explorer that investors can check to analyze the performance of the solution in real time. Now, they have set a date for July 7 to launch the Solaxy mainnet and will soon list the protocol’s utility token, $SOLX, on top exchanges to make it available to the general public. Early buyers of $SOLX will reap the highest returns once the solution becomes widely adopted by top wallets and exchanges. In addition, this token offers attractive staking rewards of 74% at the time of writing. To buy $SOLX before the presale ends, head to the Solaxy website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap SOL or USDT or use a bank card to invest.

The FIUSD stablecoin, planned to debut later this year, will be available to Fiserv’s roughly 10,000 financial institution clients including regional banks and 6 million merchant locations, the firm said in a press release . The token will run on Solana SOL, a blockchain known for its speedy transactions, and will use back-end infrastructure from stablecoin issuers Circle (CRCL) and Paxos. According to the company, FIUSD will eventually interoperate with other leading stablecoins, while the platform will also explore using deposit tokens, or blockchain-based versions of customer deposits, Rather than trying to upend the current system, Fiserv is positioning FIUSD as a ""bank-friendly"" piece of infrastruture that works together with traditional payment rails, with built-in compliance, fraud and risk monitoring tools. In a separate announcement, Fiserv said it’s partnering with PayPal (PYPL) to link FIUSD with PayPal USD (PYUSD), enabling businesses and consumers to move stablecoins between platforms. The two firms aim to streamline cross-border transfers, payouts, and vendor payments using interoperable digital dollars, a press release said. ""Fiserv is uniquely positioned to advance stablecoin-powered payments and help democratize access to blockchain financial services,"" said Takis Georgakopoulos, chief operating officer of Fiserv. ""We believe FIUSD will provide our clients with the efficiency and optionality they need to thrive in the evolving banking and payments ecosystem."" The move reflects a growing push among global banks and traditional financial behemoths to embed blockchain technology and stablecoins, a type of digital currency with prices anchored to an external asset such as fiat currencies, into their offerings. The trend is accelerating as the U.S. Senate passed the so-called GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins. For example, JP Morgan unveiled a deposit token JPMD for institutional clients with a test transaction on Ethereum layer-2 Base.

The token’s 24-hour trading volumes have surged by 41%, possibly as this bearish breakout blew up a significant number of long positions. XRP has been consolidating for a while after the token surged near its all-time highs in January. A handful of legal victories against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a change in leadership within the regulatory agency for a pro-crypto figure – Paul Atkins – favor a bullish XRP price prediction. Meanwhile, the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD) and the rapid expansion of its market cap paired with the latest announcement concerning USDC support within the Ripple blockchain has also strengthened XRP’s prospects. That said, the market has underplayed and ignored most of these bullish catalysts for the most part of 2025. XRP Price Prediction: Retest of $1.9 Support Seems Highly Likely Crypto liquidations in the past 24 hours have surged to more than $620 million as per data from CoinGlass . This has been the result of the latest developments in the Middle East. XRP dropped to $1.91 and bounced off that level and it now seems headed to retest a former support at $2.08 from below to confirm a bearish outlook. If the price rejects a move above that area, it could result in a significant downturn in the short-term as it means that XRP has broken its consolidation to the downside. Meanwhile, the long-term price trend has shifted to bearish as the token is now trading below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Trading volumes at $1.91 were quite high and above the average. This confirms the relevance of this price zone and the existence of significant buying interest at that level. Hence, this, along with the $2.08 resistance, are the key areas to watch in the next few hours. Any development in the Middle East that could point to an escalation in the conflict – e.g. the involvement of more countries – could further plunge XRP as the price of the U.S. dollar will likely rise. In the meantime, Bitcoin (BTC) has been resilient to this downturn as investors see it as a safe haven during times of geopolitical distress. This hot crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) stands to gain if the top crypto climbs to a new all-time high in the midst of the turmoil. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Rewards Will Be Unlocked Once BTC Reaches Certain Price Milestones BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) introduces an innovative rewards system tied to the performance of Bitcoin (BTC). Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, a new reward will be unlocked every time BTC adds an extra $25,000 to its price. The first milestone, set at $125,000, will trigger an automatic token burn of BTCBULL that should raise the price of this meme coin immediately. Meanwhile, once BTC reaches $150,000, token holders will receive a direct airdrop. These actions are performed automatically by smart contracts that have been audited by two crypto firms – Coinsult and Solid Proof. To buy $BTCBULL and benefit from BTC’s next leg up, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

The company plans to raise a substantial amount of capital, specifically earmarked for expanding its Bitcoin treasury . This decision highlights a growing trend among corporations exploring digital assets as a core component of their financial strategy. Green Minerals: Diving Deep into Mining and Bitcoin Green Minerals , primarily focused on the exploration and potential extraction of minerals from the seabed, operates within the specialized and capital-intensive field of deep-sea mining . Their core business involves navigating complex geological environments and regulatory landscapes to potentially source valuable resources. However, their recent announcement signals an expansion of their strategic focus beyond just physical assets. According to a statement on their official website, the company intends to raise up to $1.2 billion with partners. The primary objective of this massive capital raise isn’t solely for mining operations but explicitly includes growing their Bitcoin treasury . This makes the acquisition and holding of digital assets a fundamental part of their overall financing and asset management approach. This move is particularly noteworthy because it comes from a company in a traditional, resource-based industry, rather than a tech or finance firm. It suggests a broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, into diverse corporate structures globally. Why Build a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury? The concept of a corporate Bitcoin treasury has gained traction over the past few years, notably popularized by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla. But why would a company, especially one like Green Minerals involved in deep-sea mining , choose to allocate significant capital to volatile assets like Bitcoin? There are several potential reasons driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, given its decentralized nature and capped supply. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin’s historical price performance offers the potential for significant returns on investment, which could enhance shareholder value. Diversification: Holding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet away from traditional fiat currencies and assets. Attracting Investment: Embracing digital assets can appeal to a new class of investors, particularly those interested in the crypto space. Strategic Innovation: It positions the company as forward-thinking and adaptable in a rapidly changing financial landscape. For Green Minerals , integrating Bitcoin into their strategy could be seen as a way to future-proof their finances, leverage potential crypto market growth, and perhaps even mitigate some of the specific risks associated with long-term, capital-intensive projects like deep-sea mining . Comparing Traditional vs. Bitcoin Treasury Assets Traditionally, corporate treasuries hold assets like cash, short-term government bonds, and other low-risk, liquid investments. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Traditional Treasury Assets (Cash, Bonds) Bitcoin Treasury Primary Goal Capital preservation, Liquidity Potential growth, Inflation hedge, Diversification Volatility Low High Liquidity Generally High High (depending on market conditions) Potential Return Low High (but also high risk of loss) Regulatory Environment Well-established Evolving and uncertain Storage/Security Banks, Financial Institutions Requires specialized digital asset security (wallets, custody solutions) This table highlights the fundamental difference in risk profile. A corporate Bitcoin strategy is inherently more speculative than holding traditional assets, aiming for growth rather than just preservation. What are the Challenges and Risks for a Bitcoin Treasury? While the potential rewards of holding digital assets like Bitcoin are significant, so are the risks. Green Minerals and its partners will need to navigate several challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, potentially leading to significant paper losses on the company’s balance sheet. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, which could impact how companies can hold, manage, or use their Bitcoin holdings. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss due to hacking or mismanagement of private keys. Accounting and Tax Treatment: The accounting and tax rules for corporate crypto holdings are complex and vary by jurisdiction. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, Bitcoin can still be viewed with skepticism by some investors or the public, potentially affecting the company’s image. Execution Risk: Successfully acquiring and managing such a large amount of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise. For a company in deep-sea mining , which already faces its own set of technical, environmental, and regulatory hurdles, adding the complexities of managing a large Bitcoin treasury adds another layer of challenge. Actionable Insights for Investors and the Market The announcement by Green Minerals provides several key takeaways: Expanding Corporate Adoption: This reinforces the narrative that corporate interest in Bitcoin and other digital assets is not limited to tech companies but is spreading across diverse sectors, including traditional industries like deep-sea mining . Strategic Intent: When a company explicitly raises capital for crypto acquisition, it signals a strong, deliberate strategic intent rather than just allocating spare cash. Due Diligence is Key: Investors interested in Green Minerals or similar companies adopting crypto strategies should perform thorough due diligence. Understand the company’s rationale, risk management approach, and the potential impact of crypto volatility on their financials. Market Signal: Large capital raises targeting Bitcoin can provide positive sentiment for the broader crypto market, indicating continued institutional demand. This move by Green Minerals could potentially pave the way for other companies in resource or industrial sectors to consider similar strategies involving a corporate Bitcoin treasury. Conclusion: A Bold Step into Digital Assets Green Minerals’ plan to raise $1.2 billion specifically to bolster its Bitcoin treasury is a bold and significant development. It represents a clear commitment to integrating digital assets into the core of their financial strategy, moving beyond the traditional confines of the deep-sea mining industry. While the strategy comes with inherent risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility and the evolving regulatory landscape, it also positions Green Minerals to potentially benefit from the growth of the digital asset class and diversify its balance sheet. This decision serves as a compelling example of how companies across different sectors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a potential long-term store of value and a strategic treasury asset in the digital age.

Market Tension Meets On-Chain Calm Over the past week, BTC weathered increased volatility caused by escalating tensions in the Middle East as the U.S. bombed several suspected Iranian nuclear facilities. As CryptoPotato reported, on June 22, the asset plunged below $100,000, with the shockwave of the U.S. attack wiping out as much as $700 million in leveraged positions. At the same time, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) suffered losses of their own, dipping 6% and 7% respectively. Despite the turmoil, Bitcoin’s dominance grew, reflecting a flight to relative safety amid a broader market steeped in red. Against this background, the latest CQ report paints a picture of deliberate accumulation by LTHs. The 30-day moving average of the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) indicator, a metric tracking when long-held coins move, peaked around 0.6, dropping well below the 0.8 threshold. This implies that seasoned investors are not rushing to sell, signaling that the bull cycle remains structurally intact. “This moderation below 0.8 still implies the market may be entering a consolidation period, and further price or time correction could follow,” noted Avocado_onchain. “Historically, Bitcoin’s explosive rallies tend to occur when market attention fades and sentiment is quiet, making the current silence potentially a precursor to the next big move.” Meanwhile, data from Glassnode shows that short-term holders (STHs), who have been in the market for under 155 days, are sitting on slim 3% unrealized gains, suggesting limited profit-taking pressure from recent buyers. Price Holds Key Support Amid Demand Slowdown Elsewhere, ETF inflows and accumulation by deep-pocketed investors have notably slowed , with daily ETF purchases dropping from a peak of 9,700 BTC on April 23 to roughly 3,300 BTC as of June 22. Similarly, whale balance expansion has halved from 3.9% month-on-month in late May to 1.7%. Price action reflects this tense situation. While BTC is showing some resilience above $100,000, its recent performance over the past week, where it dropped 4.9%, and the month, where it shaved 5.6% off its price, are signs of the current struggle. The weekly range oscillating between $98,975 and $108,771 also highlights the rejection near the psychological and technical barrier at $110,000. Additionally, daily volatility has been elevated, as seen by the 24-hour swing between $98,467 and $102,782 per CoinGecko data. However, Bitcoin is still outperforming the broader crypto market, down 6.70% over the past week. This relative strength, coupled with LTH inactivity, could be a sign of underlying support building even as short-term demand falters.

As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $98,385 on Sunday before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. The airstrikes and escalation cratered the market, triggering widespread panic and leading to over $1 billion in liquidations. BTC is struggling during the ongoing session, with the price marginally up, trading around $101,252. Arthur Hayes Remains Confident About Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest pullback does not have industry veteran Arthur Hayes worried. Hayes believes the decline will not impact market sentiment in the long term and is confident about the flagship cryptocurrency’s long-term strength. Hayes believes BTC’s recent price action and decline are temporary, and the broader economic backdrop could soon turn bullish for the asset. Hayes hinted that rising global pressure could lead to more liquidity injected into the financial system, benefiting BTC , and restoring it as a reliable store of value. “Do you hear that? It’s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass, and BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status.” The BitMex co-founder's comments came after Bitcoin briefly slipped below $100,000 over the weekend, falling to a low of $98,385 on Sunday as geopolitical tensions escalated. However, it rebounded to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,982. BTC’s recent slide has seen it drop to its lowest levels since May and is part of a broader downturn in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin still shows signs of weakness, as pointed out by Rekt Capital on X, “Two weeks ago, Bitcoin's downside wicked almost -4% below $104400 before ultimately Weekly Closing above said level This week, Bitcoin is downside wicking -5% below $104400. Of course, Bitcoin could very well confirm a breakdown. But until the Weekly Close is in, it's not a confirmed breakdown just yet, and if the breakdown does become confirmed, then we won't be able to rule out a possible downside deviation until $104400 flips into resistance.” Spot Bitcoin ETF Demand Loses Steam Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US experienced a sharp drop in inflows as investor sentiment turned bearish amid escalating geopolitical concerns thanks to US airstrikes on Iran. According to data from SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.02 billion in inflows over the past week, a substantial decline from $1.39 billion the week prior. The previous week started well, with Bitcoin ETFs registering $412.2 million in inflows on Monday and $216.48 million on Tuesday. Wednesday saw $389.57 million in inflows, while Thursday was a holiday due to Juneteenth. However, inflows fell off a cliff on Friday with just $6.37 million, down 98% from the average of the previous three days. Friday’s activity was confined to BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $46,91 million in inflows. However, this was offset by a $440.5 million outflow from Fidelity’s FBTC. Markets have been jittery since the US launched coordinated airstrikes on Iran, marking a turning point in the Israel-Iran conflict. Iran warned of consequences and shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a key passage used for transporting nearly 20% of the world’s oil supply. Analysts point out that oil prices could spike if the conflict continues. Crypto Market Register $1B In Liquidations Crypto market liquidations topped $1.3 billion on Sunday as investors reeled from the news that the US had conducted airstrikes at key installations in Iran. With traditional markets shut over the weekend, the crypto market was the first to bear the brunt of the escalating geopolitical situation. As a result, BTC dipped below $100,000 on Sunday, while other cryptocurrencies registered notable declines. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $100,000 for the first time since the beginning of May as market sentiment plunged after the US conducted air strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. The airstrikes marked a significant escalation in the Middle East, triggering panic across the crypto market. As a result, liquidations topped $1 billion, impacting over 240,000 traders. However, despite Sunday’s stunning collapse, markets have recovered. While BTC fell to a low of $98,385 on Sunday, it recovered to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. Analysts believe markets are pricing in the conflict and do not expect a prolonged escalation in hostilities. Iran’s foreign minister also met with Russian officials in Moscow as diplomatic backchannels reopened following the airstrikes. BTC’s climb back above $100,000 comes alongside modest movement in gold prices, and a subdued reaction across oil and equity futures. According to analysts, traders are expecting a limited and contained conflict. The Kobeissi Letter posted on X that markets are expecting a short-lived war, stating, “Over the last 72 hours, the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites, Russia said countries are ready to supply Iran with nukes, and Iran's parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz. Yet, stock market futures are down a mere -0.5% at the open, and oil prices are up less than +2.5%. This is NOT a market that is pricing in a long-term conflict. If the market was pricing in JUST a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, oil prices would be at $120+. Objectively, the market is still expecting a short-lived war.” Pav Hundal, lead analyst at Swyftx, believes that if tensions in the Middle East decrease, investor confidence could rebound, allowing prices to recover. “We saw a lot of Twitch trading in the hours after the US attacked Iranian nuclear targets, and right now trade volumes remain elevated. If we start to see a softening in tensions in the Middle East, we should start to see a rebound in investor confidence, and the price should start to grind back up.” However, he cautioned that nobody knows what will happen next in the Middle East, creating further market industry. “Nobody, including Trump, knows what is going to happen next in the Middle East, and that just creates the kind of uncertainty that traders hate.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Thursday (June 12), falling nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC fell to a low of $102,854. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC registered a drop of 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Sentiment changed on Tuesday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,519. Source: TradingView BTC registered a marginal increase on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 0.24% to $104,631. BTC reached an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, it fell 1.19%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,888. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 1.17% to $102,180. BTC plunged below $100,000 on Sunday, falling to an intraday low of $98,385 as market sentiment worsened. However, it recovered to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers struggle to build momentum and push the price higher. A bearish MACD indicates that buyers are in control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The stall in business activities has been linked to the region’s weak manufacturing and service industries. Germany, the largest economy in the area, posted 50.4 points, up from 48.5 points in May, attributed to high demand in the manufacturing sector. Private sector business activities in the eurozone are still struggling to recover, with the latest Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) data indicating stagnation in both the services and manufacturing sectors. The PMI remained unchanged from May, posting a 50.2 points PMI slightly below market expectations of 50.5 points and barely above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The services industry jumped as expected to 50 points from 49.7, manufacturing PMI remained unchanged at 49.4, and the forecast rose to 49.8 points. Business activity stalls in the eurozone despite easing financial conditions Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said that the eurozone economy has struggled to gain momentum for six months. He revealed minimal growth, with activity in the services sector stagnating and manufacturing output rising only moderately. Business activities in the region remained unchanged despite a more accommodative monetary stance by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB has recently reduced its deposit facility rate by 25 basis points to 2.00%. The regional disparities are becoming more pronounced, with Germany, the largest economy in the region, showing a marginal return to growth. The flash composite PMI rose to 50.4 in June from 48.5 in May. The rise was triggered by increased demand in the manufacturing sector, the fastest rise over three years. De la Rubia said there is a good chance that Germany would finally break out of the stop-start growth pattern after two years of being stuck in it. The German services sector PMI rose to 49.4 in June 2025, up from 47.1 in May, which surpassed market expectations of 47.5. The data showed a slight increase in activity, which marked a change from the three-month downturn, mainly affected by the Trump tariff wars . However, Germany continued to record a downward trajectory with the composite PMI dropping to 48.5 in June from 49.3 in May. That is the tenth consecutive monthly decline. Manufacturing and services business activities declined, with firms citing low domestic demand, intensifying international competition, and uncertainty surrounding global trade. Sales fell sharply for the thirteenth consecutive month in June, with factory orders declining sharply, last seen in February. Markets remain uncertain in the eurozone Jonas Feldhusen, Junior Economist at HCOB, said the outlook is certainly clouded. According to him, the question arises whether the decline in manufacturing output this month represents a temporary dip or marks the end of the upward trend. Persistent cost increases in services and renewed geopolitical tensions may further discourage monetary easing in the coming months despite easing inflation pressures in the goods sector. Markets expect the ECB to hold its interest rate benchmark steady at 2.00% during the next policy meeting on 23-24 July. U.S. strike on Iran over the weekend added to the volatile economic landscape with renewed fears of a long-term conflict in the Middle East. The war can potentially trigger oil prices since at least 20% of global crude oil shipments pass through the Strait of Hormuz . Trump’s 90-day pause on a reciprocal tariff truce is set to expire on 9 July, creating more uncertainty in the region. Negotiations are still ongoing, although Europe has not secured a trade agreement to avoid another wave of disruptions in business activities. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The head of a construction firm in Cheongju is now facing serious charges, accused of a massive financial crime that allegedly involved diverting company funds towards cryptocurrency investments and settling personal debts. This incident shines a spotlight on the potential for financial misconduct when traditional structures meet new asset classes, raising questions about oversight and corporate responsibility in the era of digital finance. For those tracking the intersection of finance and digital assets, this case represents a significant development. Unpacking the Shocking Korean CEO Embezzlement Case At the heart of this unfolding story is a prominent Korean CEO embezzlement case. According to reports from Yonhap News, the chief executive of a construction company based in Cheongju, South Korea, has been formally indicted. The indictment stems from allegations that the CEO misappropriated a staggering 25.9 billion won, which translates to approximately $18.7 million USD at current exchange rates. This significant sum was allegedly siphoned off from the company’s coffers over an extended period. The timeline of the alleged embezzlement is particularly lengthy, reportedly spanning from June 2012 all the way through January 2025. Such a prolonged period suggests a potentially systematic diversion of funds rather than an isolated incident. While the indictment has been made, the legal process is ongoing, and the specific details of how the funds were moved and utilized are expected to be further revealed as the case progresses through the South Korean judicial system. How Does This Crypto Crime Impact South Korea? This incident registers as a notable crypto crime South Korea has seen, primarily because of the alleged use of embezzled funds for cryptocurrency investments. While the CEO is also accused of using money to pay personal debts, the crypto connection adds a layer of complexity and public interest. South Korea has a vibrant and active cryptocurrency market, with a high rate of retail participation. However, this also makes the market susceptible to being associated with illicit activities, even if the crime originates in a traditional sector like construction. Cases like this can fuel public and regulatory skepticism towards digital assets. They can be cited by critics as evidence of the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, even when the underlying crime (embezzlement) is a long-standing issue in traditional finance. For the burgeoning crypto industry within South Korea, such high-profile scandals, regardless of their origin, can contribute to calls for stricter regulations and increased scrutiny, potentially impacting innovation and adoption. Key concerns arising from this case include: Reputational Damage: Associating crypto with fraud and embezzlement, even if only as a destination for stolen funds. Regulatory Pressure: Potentially increasing the urgency for more stringent oversight on both crypto platforms and cross-sector financial flows. Investor Confidence: While the crime didn’t originate from a crypto platform itself, the connection might erode confidence among potential investors. Beyond Crypto: The Construction Firm Fraud Unveiled While the crypto angle grabs headlines, it’s crucial to remember that the alleged crime is fundamentally a construction firm fraud case. The core accusation is the embezzlement of funds belonging to the company. This points to potential failures in corporate governance, internal controls, and financial oversight within the construction firm itself. How was a single individual, the CEO, allegedly able to divert such a significant amount of money over more than a decade without detection by internal audits, board oversight, or external auditors? The case is made even more complex by the mention of the CEO’s past allegations of collusion with local officials and police. If true, these past issues could suggest a pattern of behavior or potentially indicate systemic vulnerabilities that might have facilitated the alleged embezzlement. A construction firm, especially one dealing with potentially large contracts and public works, requires robust financial management and transparency. The alleged activities here starkly contradict these requirements. Aspects of the alleged construction firm fraud: Allegation Amount Involved Timeline Alleged Use of Funds Embezzlement 25.9 billion won ($18.7M USD) June 2012 – January 2025 Cryptocurrency investments, Personal debt repayment This situation highlights the critical importance of independent oversight and stringent financial controls in companies, regardless of their sector. The alleged duration and scale of the fraud suggest significant lapses. Identifying the Patterns of Financial Misconduct The alleged actions of the CEO fall squarely under the umbrella of financial misconduct . Embezzlement is a specific type of fraud where a person entrusted with funds or property illegally takes it for their own use. In this case, the alleged motive appears to be twofold: speculative investment in cryptocurrency and the necessity of paying off personal debts. This combination of motives is not uncommon in fraud cases, where individuals facing financial pressure (debts) may turn to risky ventures (like speculating with stolen funds in crypto) in an attempt to recover or get rich quickly. Identifying financial misconduct often involves looking for red flags such as: Unexplained wealth or lifestyle changes by executives. Lack of segregation of duties in financial processes. Weak internal controls and audit functions. Unusual or complex transactions. Excessive executive control over finances with little oversight. Past allegations or history of unethical behavior. The lengthy period over which the alleged embezzlement occurred suggests that these red flags either went unnoticed, were ignored, or were actively concealed. Understanding these patterns is crucial for preventing future incidents and strengthening corporate integrity. What This South Korea Crypto Scandal Means for Regulation This specific South Korea crypto scandal, while originating from traditional corporate fraud, will undoubtedly add fuel to ongoing discussions about regulating the digital asset space. While the crime wasn’t a crypto-native fraud (like a rug pull or exchange hack), it demonstrates how traditional illicit funds can flow into the crypto ecosystem. This raises questions about Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures not just within crypto exchanges but also at the intersection points between traditional finance and crypto. Regulators in South Korea have been actively working on frameworks for digital assets. This case may accelerate efforts to ensure better tracking of large transactions, improved information sharing between financial sectors, and potentially stricter rules regarding the source of funds used for significant crypto investments. It underscores the challenge regulators face in monitoring capital flows across increasingly interconnected financial systems. Potential regulatory considerations: Strengthening AML/KYC rules for large crypto transactions. Improving cross-sector financial surveillance. Enhancing corporate governance requirements to prevent internal fraud. Increased cooperation between financial regulators and law enforcement regarding digital asset flows. Ultimately, this case serves as a stark reminder that while technology evolves, the fundamental motivations for financial crime often remain the same. Ensuring accountability requires vigilance across all sectors. Summary: The indictment of a Korean construction firm CEO for allegedly embezzling $18.7 million highlights a significant instance of financial misconduct, reportedly funding cryptocurrency investments and personal debts. This case, spanning over a decade, underscores potential weaknesses in corporate governance and adds to the narrative surrounding crypto crime in South Korea. As the legal proceedings continue, the incident prompts further discussion on regulating capital flows between traditional finance and digital assets, emphasizing the need for robust oversight to prevent fraud regardless of where the stolen funds end up.

The FIUSD asset will use the infrastructure of Paxos and Circle to build payment gateways for business clients. Fiserv, one of the leading providers for payment gateways, will launch a Solana-based stablecoin. The new asset, FIUSD, will be tailored to institutional usage, and it will be a part of Fiserv’s larger digital asset platform. Solana will be the first blockchain to host FIUSD Initially, FIUSD will launch on Solana, while Fiserv announced it would explore partnerships with other public blockchains. Solana already carries USDC , relying on the fully regulated stablecoin for worldwide acceptance and trading access. The chain carries over 11B in stablecoin liquidity, mostly used for crypto native trading. Solana carries 4.8% of the total stablecoin supply and will be the first chain to carry FIUSD. | Source: Artemis Fiserv’s move follows the advancement of the US Genius Act , offering more favorable regulations for stablecoins. Other payment companies like Stripe or large tech corporations have also explored the addition of stablecoins to their stack. “ With our scale, reach, and technology leadership, Fiserv is uniquely positioned to advance stablecoin-powered payments and help democratize access to blockchain financial services. Together with our other cloud-native banking and merchant platforms, we believe FIUSD will provide our clients with the efficiency and optionality they need to thrive in the evolving banking and payments ecosystem,” said Takis Georgakopoulos, COO of Fiserv. FIUSD will be tailored to the needs of 10,000 financial institutional clients and millions of merchant locations. Fiserv’s stablecoin will be able to carry a part of the $90B in annual transactions, due to the asset’s speed and scalability. It also announced that the new stablecoin will not add to processing costs for clients. Following the stablecoin announcement, FI traded at $163.38, in the middle of its range for the past 12 months. Fiserv to offer stablecoins to institutional clients The FIUSD stablecoin will target the needs of large-scale institutional clients and use Paxos’s fully regulated approach to issue and distribute the asset. The partnership arrives just days after the launch of Paxos Labs, a platform for creating third-party branded stablecoins. Circle will further partner with Fiserv to embed the new stablecoin into merchant sites and payment gateways, similar to other fintech solutions. Fiserv’s stablecoin was announced soon after JP Morgan Chase patented its own JPMD stablecoin for large-scale clients with bank deposits. Unlike JP Morgan, FIUSD will work directly for live payments, instead of running a sandbox program. Similar to JP Morgan Chase, Fiserv will also explore the offerings of tokenized deposits, which differ from stablecoins in that they reflect balances in the bank’s own books. Tokenized deposits can give banks more flexibility in asset transfers. Stablecoins have been proposed as a tool for 24/7 transfers and for streamlining business processes where other tools are unavailable. Stablecoins as a whole have expanded to a new peak of $247.2B, encompassing a mix of tokens backed by US treasuries, bank deposits, or by other crypto assets. Stablecoins remain a key payment tool and are now more widely used by online merchants.

A recent survey suggests that despite rising geopolitical tensions , a significant portion of investors in South Korea remain surprisingly optimistic about the future of the crypto market. This insight offers a fascinating look into how different investor bases perceive risk and opportunity in volatile times. What is the Latest Crypto Market Sentiment in South Korea? Conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between June 17 and 20, the survey tracked weekly trends among South Korean cryptocurrency investors. The findings reveal a complex picture of expectations and sentiment: Overall Optimism: 38.7% expressed optimism or extreme optimism about the market. Neutral Stance: 35.4% held a neutral view. Fear and Pessimism: 25.9% indicated feelings of fear or extreme fear. This breakdown shows a leaning towards positive or neutral sentiment, even as external pressures mount. It highlights a resilience or perhaps a long-term perspective among a substantial segment of South Korean investors. What is the Bitcoin Price Outlook According to the Survey? The survey specifically queried investors on their expectations for Bitcoin (BTC) value in the upcoming week. The results show a notable shift towards bullishness compared to the previous week: Bitcoin Price Expectation This Week (June 17-20) Last Week Increase or Significantly Jump 41.9% 37.0% Stable Market 33.4% 36.0% Decline or Sharp Drop 24.7% 27.0% The increase in those expecting a rise and the decrease in those expecting stability or decline suggest growing short-term confidence in Bitcoin’s performance among these investors, despite the prevailing macro environment. Is the Crypto Bull Market Still Alive? One of the most compelling questions in the survey addressed the status of the current market cycle, particularly against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. While global events often trigger sell-offs and uncertainty, Korean crypto investors presented varied, yet often hopeful, perspectives: Bull Market Intact: 34.3% believe the bull market is still ongoing. This is a significant portion who see recent dips as temporary corrections rather than the end of the upward trend. Rebound Expected Post-Tensions: 29.2% anticipate a broad market recovery once geopolitical tensions subside. This group acknowledges the current impact but sees it as a temporary setback. Bull Run Ended / Bear Market Begun: 23.2% hold the view that the bull run has concluded and a bear market has commenced. This represents the more cautious or pessimistic segment. Bitcoin-Only Gains: 13.3% believe only Bitcoin will see gains even after the conflict eases, suggesting a flight to the perceived safety or dominance of BTC over altcoins in uncertain times. Combined, nearly two-thirds (34.3% + 29.2% = 63.5%) of respondents hold a view that is either currently bullish or expects a return to bullish conditions once external factors improve. This highlights a strong underlying belief in the market’s potential among South Korean investors. Understanding the Geopolitical Impact Crypto The survey acknowledges the frustration felt by investors when negative geopolitical headlines disrupt market recoveries. Cryptocurrency markets, known for their volatility, can be particularly sensitive to global instability. Conflicts, political uncertainty, and economic sanctions can lead to: Increased Risk Aversion: Investors tend to move away from riskier assets like crypto towards perceived safe havens (though the ‘safe haven’ status of Bitcoin itself is debated and sometimes observed during specific crises). Supply Chain and Economic Shocks: Broader economic impacts of conflicts can affect investor liquidity and confidence. Regulatory Uncertainty: Geopolitical events can sometimes trigger discussions or actions around regulating cryptocurrencies at a national or international level. The fact that 34.3% of Korean crypto investors still see the crypto bull market as intact despite these clear external pressures is a notable data point, suggesting that internal market dynamics or a long-term conviction in the technology might be outweighing short-term fear for many. Key Takeaways and What It Means This survey provides valuable insight into the mindset of a significant group of investors in a key market like South Korea. While the overall sentiment is mixed, the proportion of investors maintaining a bullish stance or expecting a post-tension rebound is substantial. It suggests that while geopolitical impact crypto is real and acknowledged, it hasn’t universally crushed the long-term optimism fueled by previous market cycles and ongoing adoption trends. For market observers, this highlights the importance of looking beyond just price charts and considering the diverse psychological factors and regional sentiments that influence investor behavior. The survey underscores that conviction in the underlying technology or the potential for future gains remains strong for many, even when global headlines are grim. Conclusion: Hope Persists Amidst the Storm In conclusion, the survey of Korean crypto investors paints a picture of cautious optimism and persistent hope. Despite the acknowledged drag from geopolitical tensions , a significant minority believes the crypto bull market continues, and an even larger group expects a strong recovery. The Bitcoin price outlook also saw an uptick in positive expectations. While fear is present, it does not dominate the sentiment for the majority. This resilience in investor conviction from South Korea serves as a compelling data point for understanding the current state of the global crypto landscape.

The historic bill establishes the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a publicly held fund that will hold Bitcoin as a long-term investment of Texas's financial holdings and as a future inflation hedge. How the Texas Bitcoin Reserve Works The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is designed to be independent of the state treasury as a whole, giving it free rein to manage digital currencies. The reserve will be operated by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, advised by a crypto advisory committee made up of three investment experts. The only market-capitalization assets worth more than $500 billion,—are simply Bitcoin at present—are worthy of holding, to maintain the fund's focus on the most secure digital asset. The reserve can grow not only directly by purchasing through surplus funds but also through forks, airdrops, investment income, and even public donations of cryptocurrency. In order to ensure transparency and accountability, a biennial public report on the reserve holdings and performance will be submitted. Another companion bill, House Bill 4488, also protects the reserve from sweeping into the state's general revenue fund, preventing it from being subject to shifting budget priorities and budget crises. Why Texas—and Who's Next? Not only is Texas the initial state to pass a Bitcoin reserve law, but it is also the initial state to direct funds from real public coffers and create a separate, actively managed structure for holding Bitcoins. Arizona and New Hampshire passed similar bills, but their reserves are backed only by non-tax revenues like forfeited cryptocurrency assets or donations. Texas's bold action is already becoming contagious: Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and several others introduced Bitcoin reserve bills, and experts say there could be a ”global race” to stock up on BTC as state governments and even universities start diversifying with digital assets. How Will the Reserve Be Managed? Texas Comptroller has broad authority to purchase, retain, and, if necessary, liquidate Bitcoin reserves. Security is paramount: the law demands intensive cold storage procedures and allows the state to engage skilled custodians and liquidity providers with a minimum of five years' experience trading digital assets. Investment approach, risk protection, and staying informed of evolving regulations will be aided by the advisory committee. Transparency is inherent: the biennial public report will disclose the amount and value of Bitcoin being held, investment performance, and any updates on the status of the reserve. Such disclosure is intended to guard against volatility and risk concerns, as well as make Texas a leader in responsible crypto finance. Potential Effect on Spot ETF Inflows and the Market Texas's move is not symbolic. By adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the state is issuing a powerful message to institutional investors, pension funds, and other government agencies. According to analysts, if even a few states follow Texas's example, demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs and direct ownership of BTC might soar, accelerating supply constrictions and in turn potentially driving prices higher. Already, US spot Bitcoin ETFs hold over 5.9% of the total BTC supply, and state-level adoption would further cement Bitcoin as ”digital gold” for public and private investment portfolios. What's Next for State Crypto Adoption? As Texas's reserve goes live later this fall, all eyes are on the experiment unfolding. Will the reserve outperform traditional assets and initiate a domino effect of copycat measures? Or will volatility and political opposition to temper the trend? In the meantime, Texas has made its bet as the first state to buy Bitcoin with public funds—a development that may reshape the future of American government finance. Bottom Line Texas's action to add Bitcoin to its treasury is a watershed in crypto mainstream adoption in public finance. As other states consider following its lead, the Lone Star State's pilot program may set the standard for digital asset stewardship—and propel the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin across the country at an accelerating pace.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-23 14:01:16

Momentum Remains Bearish Despite the recent bounce, the overall momentum remains bearish on higher timeframes such as daily or weekly. For example, the MACD is falling on those two timeframes and does not give any signs of a possible reversal. This implies that the $2 support will be put under significant pressure still.

The South Korean crypto community, often dubbed the K-Community, is a significant force in shaping global sentiment and trading volumes. Understanding which digital assets are capturing their attention provides invaluable insight into emerging trends and market focus. Last week, from June 13 to 19, the Bitcoin World K-Community platform offered a fascinating glimpse into the tokens that were most searched for and discussed. Understanding the Korean Crypto Community ‘s Focus The data collected from the Bitcoin World K-Community platform highlights the distinct interests within this vibrant market. We can break down their focus into two key areas: what they are actively searching for and what they are mentioning in discussions. These two metrics don’t always align perfectly, offering a nuanced view of engagement. What Were the Top Crypto Searches Korea ? When the K-Community members went looking for information, certain tokens stood out significantly. The volume of searches often indicates potential interest, research activity, or perhaps reaction to recent price movements or news. Here are the top 10 most searched tokens: XRP : 60,593 searches – Leading by a massive margin, indicating strong, sustained interest. ETH : 17,970 searches – Ethereum remains a core interest, likely due to its foundational role and ongoing developments. BTC : 17,252 searches – Bitcoin, the market leader, consistently ranks high. ONDO : 14,156 searches – A notable presence, suggesting growing interest in this specific altcoin. SOL : 11,383 searches – Solana continues to attract significant search volume. UXLINK : 10,318 searches – Another altcoin making a strong appearance in searches. RVN : 6,508 searches – Ravencoin shows persistent search interest. ZKJ : 5,716 searches – An intriguing entry, indicating specific community focus. ORBS : 5,377 searches – Orbs maintains a presence in search queries. TRUMP : 5,367 searches – Reflecting the growing trend of political meme coins, particularly relevant given global political events. The dominance of XRP in search volume is particularly striking. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are perennial favorites, the high search numbers for specific altcoins like ONDO, UXLINK, and ZKJ suggest active exploration of newer or less mainstream projects within the South Korean crypto landscape. Which Tokens Saw the Most Top Crypto Mentions Korea ? Mentions often reflect active discussion, trading activity, or reactions to events. While search is about seeking information, mentions are about sharing thoughts and engaging with others. The list of most mentioned tokens shows some overlap with searches but also key differences: BTC : 1,476 mentions – Bitcoin leads discussions, cementing its status as a primary topic. ETH : 829 mentions – Ethereum is also heavily discussed, mirroring its search volume. TRUMP : 370 mentions – The TRUMP token sees significant discussion volume, higher relative to its search rank. XRP : 294 mentions – Despite leading searches, XRP is fourth in mentions, suggesting more people are researching it than actively discussing it compared to BTC/ETH. SOL : 174 mentions – Solana remains a popular topic of conversation. ONDO : 75 mentions – ONDO is discussed, but its mention volume is considerably lower than its search volume. ORBS : 70 mentions – Similar to ONDO, ORBS sees fewer mentions relative to searches. DOGE : 51 mentions – Dogecoin appears in the mention list, indicating its continued presence in community chat. SUI : 38 mentions – SUI enters the top mentions, showing specific project interest. RVN : 36 mentions – Ravencoin rounds out the list of most mentioned tokens. Comparing the lists, Bitcoin and Ethereum are consistently high in both searches and mentions. XRP dominates searches but takes a lower spot in mentions. Conversely, TRUMP has a higher relative ranking in mentions compared to searches. This difference could indicate that while many are curious about XRP, the core trading and discussion activity revolves more around BTC, ETH, and tokens like TRUMP that might be experiencing recent volatility or news. What Do These Crypto Market Korea Trends Tell Us? The data provides valuable insights: Established Giants Remain Core: Bitcoin and Ethereum are fundamental to the K-Community’s interest, consistently appearing at the top of both lists. XRP’s Enduring Appeal: The massive search volume for XRP suggests ongoing speculation or hope regarding its future, perhaps tied to its legal status or potential developments. Altcoin Exploration is Active: Tokens like ONDO, UXLINK, RVN, ZKJ, ORBS, and SUI show that the community is actively researching and discussing a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies beyond the top few. Emerging Narratives Gain Traction: The high ranking of the TRUMP token in mentions highlights the influence of new, potentially volatile narratives like political meme coins within the community discussion. Search vs. Mention Dynamics: A high search volume coupled with a lower mention volume (like XRP, ONDO, ORBS) might indicate tokens that people are researching individually rather than discussing collectively, perhaps due to uncertainty or a focus on personal analysis. Conversely, tokens with relatively higher mention volume than search volume (like TRUMP, DOGE, SUI compared to some lower-ranked search tokens) could suggest topics driven more by communal hype or reaction to events. For anyone tracking the South Korean crypto market, these trends underscore the diverse interests and active engagement of the K-Community. It’s a market that pays attention to the majors but is also quick to explore new opportunities and react to unfolding narratives. Summary: Decoding K-Community Sentiment Last week’s data from the Bitcoin World K-Community provides a clear snapshot: the Korean crypto community remains deeply engaged with the market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum form the bedrock of their interest and discussion, altcoins like XRP, ONDO, SOL, and UXLINK are subject to significant research. Furthermore, emerging trends, exemplified by the TRUMP token’s prominence in discussions, show the dynamic and sometimes speculative nature of the crypto market Korea . Tracking these top searches and mentions offers a powerful way to gauge community sentiment and identify tokens gaining traction.

""We Are in a Critical Week!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/qcp-capital-shares-its-expectations-for-bitcoin-btc-in-the-shadow-of-us-iran-tension-we-are-in-a-critical-week/,"The US got involved in the tension between Israel and Iran and hit Iran. This situation negatively affected Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, with the BTC price falling below the psychological level of $100,000. While the downward anxiety continues in the markets and investors, Singapore-based analysis company QCP Capital evaluated the latest situation. At this point, QCP analysts first noted that the recent sell-off in BTC constituted its lowest print since breaking the psychological $100,000 level on May 8. The sell-off in Bitcoin and major altcoins was triggered by Iran’s threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, a move seen as damaging to global oil flows. However, Bitcoin returned above $100,000 this morning, suggesting that the pullback over the weekend was mainly due to macro factors. At this point, despite Iran's threats of retaliation against the US, the market believes that the possibility of a major conflict is limited and the US is pressuring Iran through diplomatic channels to surrender and stop. According to analysts, this played a role in stabilizing the market. QCP also said that traditional markets also reacted calmly to the developments between the US and Iran over the weekend, as US stock futures, oil and gold prices returned to Friday levels after initial fluctuations. This suggests that investors see this as a regional risk rather than a global crisis. Analysts say the Bitcoin market is at a critical turning point balancing risk appetite and safe-haven demand amid geopolitical uncertainty. “….Still, BTC is consolidating near the $100,000 level even after a surge in leveraged long positions. This makes the next few days particularly important. The market remains at a crossroads where digital assets are straddling a critical line between risk-on momentum and risk-off defensiveness amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty.” The analytics firm also listed the key events to watch this week as follows: “Tuesday (Jun 24): Fed Chair Powell's Speech Wednesday (Jun 25): Fed Chair Powell's Speech Thursday (Jun 26): US GDP and Unemployment Data Friday (Jun 27): US Core PCE” *This is not investment advice.

46623423,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753886,1750691924,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46623423.jpeg,ECB is keeping its stance steady as global pressure builds,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lagarde-ecb-is-good-to-tackle-uncertainty/,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is keeping its stance steady as global pressure builds. Christine Lagarde, speaking to lawmakers in Brussels on Monday, said the ECB is “in a good position to navigate the uncertain circumstances” created by today’s unstable economic and political climate. She said that inflation across the euro area is expected to stabilize around the 2% target, even though risks to growth remain clearly tilted to the downside. According to remarks reported by Bloomberg , Lagarde emphasized that interest rates, at their current level, give the ECB room to respond carefully. She added, “Especially in the current conditions of exceptional uncertainty, we will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance.” ECB officials unsure if the easing cycle is done The ECB has already cut rates eight times over the past year. Whether that streak continues is still up in the air. Lagarde said earlier this month that the bank may be nearing the end of its easing cycle. But inside the Governing Council, there’s still debate. Some policymakers believe more cuts may be needed to keep the 20-nation euro area afloat. The first quarter of 2025 came with a surprise 0.6% economic expansion, which analysts tie to exporters rushing to beat incoming US tariffs. That growth, however, hasn’t been sustained. Fresh data released Monday showed the euro zone’s private sector barely grew in June. With geopolitical tension and trade uncertainty rising, businesses are holding off on investment, and households are pulling back on spending. Most market watchers expect the ECB’s deposit rate to stay at 2% when officials meet on July 24, though expectations are building for one more 25 basis point cut before year-end. Lagarde, staying noncommittal, said, “We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.” Villeroy and Centeno call for more flexibility and stimulus Other central bankers are making their own cases. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a Governing Council member and head of the Bank of France, said last Thursday in Florence that if the ECB acts again in the next six months, the move will likely be another step toward easing. “Barring a major exogenous shock, including possible new military developments in the Middle East, if monetary policy were to move… it would be more in the direction of accommodation,” Francois said during a speech at the European University Institute. Even though inflation has cooled back to the 2% target, Francois warned that the job isn’t done. “This return to ‘2 and 2’ should not give way to complacency and passivity,” he said. His push is for the ECB to stay “agile” without being vague or chaotic. He wants the bank to be clear in how it thinks and predictable in what it does. He also mentioned risks from rising energy prices, which could spill over into broader inflation if they persist. At the same time, the euro’s recent rise against the dollar is helping to cool price pressures. “We need to remain alert and agile in all our next meetings,” Francois said. On the other side of the Governing Council, Mario Centeno is calling for more stimulus. Speaking to La Stampa, Mario said the eurozone still hasn’t reached a point where the economy can hold a stable 2% inflation on its own. “The level of rates must be compatible with an economy that generates stable inflation at 2%. Today, in my opinion, that economy does not yet exist in the euro area,” he said. He argued that both supply and demand remain weak, and GDP is below potential. That means the region is operating under capacity. If the neutral rate is at 2%, but the economy is still underperforming, then actual rates should be below neutral to help restore balance, Mario explained. The ECB’s next move will likely be decided on July 24, but Mario might not be around for it. His term ends earlier in the month, and the Portuguese government hasn’t confirmed if he’ll be reappointed.

Bitcoin was all there was to sell Bitcoin’s superpower of being able to be traded 24/7 and over every weekend can sometimes be prejudicial to the king of the cryptocurrencies. As the US joined the Israeli strikes on Saturday by dropping “bunker busting” bombs and launching Tomahawk cruise missiles, scared investors began to sell the only liquid and tradeable asset in their portfolios, which was Bitcoin. Then on Sunday, the Iranian parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for world trade. Bitcoin dropped further on the news. However, the final decision for whether to close the Strait rests with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, which would have to bear in mind that closure of the Strait of Hormuz would risk alienating oil-rich neighbours and could lead to an 80% spike in oil prices. Bitcoin price rally After being heavily oversold on Saturday and Sunday, the Bitcoin price has rallied on Monday morning, up 3% and $3,000 from Sunday’s low of $98,300, to currently trade at around $101,400. It now remains to be seen whether this rally can continue, or whether further events in the Middle East can stunt Monday’s price rise. $BTC moves through descending trendline Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC illustrates the beginning of a recovery. The price has moved up through the downtrend and is in the process of confirming and consolidating above. In addition, the price is taking advantage of flipping the $101,000 resistance into support. If the recovery is able to continue, this will likely depend on how the U.S. stock market performs over the rest of Monday. So far, the S&P 500 is up around 0.3%, which bodes well for the $BTC price going forward. Stochastic RSI indicators cross-up on daily time frame Source: TradingView The daily time frame for $BTC shows the strong overhead resistance levels, first at $104,000, and then at $106,000. If the U.S. stock market continues to make light of the weekend conflict developments, the $BTC price could get to the first of these big resistances at $104,000. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has just recorded a cross up of the blue fast line over the orange slow line. These indicator cross-overs on the daily have presaged some big moves in the past as can be seen in the chart above. Major concerns on weekly time frame Source: TradingView The weekly chart view for $BTC shows that the $104,000 support did not hold the price, and that it crashed through, eventually being held up by the strong support at $101,000. In order for the bulls to regain control, they will need to retake the $104,000 level and turn it back into support again. That said, the current support at $101,000 is going to have to hold firm. The bears will be exulting that not only did they manage to break the support, but they also caused the Stochastic RSI indicator lines to dip below the 80.00 level. This is critical, because if these indicator lines do not turn back up, there could be a long descent back down to the bottom, which is likely to drag the price down with it. This new week of price action could prove to be crucial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/anodos-co-founder-says-xrp-ledger-doesnt-care-about-xrp-price-heres-why/,"As the broader crypto market continues to fluctuate, certain voices within the industry are choosing to emphasize stability over speculation. Among them is Panos Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, who reaffirmed the importance of focusing on blockchain’s real-world applications rather than its investment hype. Panos’s latest comments come at a time when XRP, like other digital assets, has experienced price volatility. Yet according to Mekras, the price is ultimately irrelevant to the core mission of blockchain. “The XRP Ledger (as any other blockchain) doesn’t care about XRP or any other asset’s price,” Mekras stated, adding that the network runs smoothly like it was built to. The remark highlights an important but often overlooked point: the real-world utility of the underlying technology is more important than short-term price fluctuations. The XRP Ledger (as any other blockchain) doesn't care about XRP or any other asset's price. It just keeps running smooth like it was built to do. Days like this remind me why at @AnodosFinance we decided to move away from the crypto-native and investment use cases (which are just… — Panos {X} (@panosmek) June 22, 2025 Moving Past Speculation Mekras explained that Anodos Finance deliberately distanced itself from what he termed the “crypto-native and investment use cases,” focusing instead on delivering everyday tools that work without exposing the user to the complexities of blockchain. The goal, he noted, is to build services where the end-user doesn’t need to understand crypto, check charts, or worry about volatility. It’s a philosophy that aligns closely with the design and intent of the XRP Ledger. The network is optimized for utility, offering fast settlement, low-cost transactions, and efficient cross-border payments. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously stated that XRP’s success can only be sustained by utility , and the network’s features enable the kinds of user experiences Mekras describes, whether it’s sending money to family abroad in seconds or allowing businesses to accept instant payments without intermediaries. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Case for Real Utility While much of the crypto industry remains focused on price charts and speculative gains, Mekras argued that this approach is a barrier to mainstream adoption. As he put it, “mass adoption will not happen” if most participants continue to view the technology as a money-making vehicle. Ripple prioritizes utility and adoption over short-term price movements. This approach has made XRP one of the most useful assets in the crypto space. Ripple president Monica Long recently revealed that XRP is 120,000 times more energy-efficient than Bitcoin , and in a utility-driven ecosystem, it would be the dominant asset. A change in mindset is required, one that embraces real-world utility and de-emphasizes token price as a measure of success. Adopting assets for utility instead of speculation will put the most functional and useful assets at the forefront of the crypto market and help advance global finance.

The project said Glacier Drop is a novel process that allocates all NIGHT tokens to users across eight major blockchain ecosystems and rolls out in three sequential phases. The tokens will be available on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, Binance Chain, Brave, Ripple and Avalanche, the company said in a press release Monday. First, during a 60-day claim period starting in July, eligible wallets, those holding at least $100 in native tokens at the time of a pre-announced snapshot, can claim their full allocation. That is followed by a 30-day Scavenger Mine phase, which redistributes any unclaimed tokens to participants who complete computational tasks using a proof-of-work-like mechanism. After the network’s mainnet launch later this year, a four-year Lost-and-Found phase will allow original claimants who missed the initial window to recover part of their allocation through self-directed verification. To avoid supply shocks, NIGHT tokens will unlock in four randomized installments over a 360-day period. This ""thawing mechanism"" is intended to damp volatility and promote long-term engagement with the network.

The $100M TRON (TRX) PIPE deal and rebranding to 'Tron' turned SRM into a speculative proxy for the TRON blockchain. Valuing SRM is impossible with traditional metrics; the core business is worthless, and the TRON deal's real value is highly uncertain. This is an ultra-speculative play best avoided unless you have deep TRON knowledge—there's no rational fair value to anchor on right now. SRM Entertainment ( SRM ) has gone from a sub-$1 micro-cap facing a Nasdaq delisting notice to one of the hottest stocks over the past month. In fact, it's up an insane 2500% during this period. Let's unpack what it's all about, but know that this isn't your typical investment case. There's nothing fundamental here. It's all speculation and hype, so if you are looking for discounted cash flows or any form of ""value"", there's nothing here for you. SRM's Stock Price (Seeking Alpha) Who Is SRM Entertainment, Anyway? SRM Entertainment, based in Winter Park, Florida, has been in operation since 1981, quietly making souvenirs such as Mickey Mouse plushies and Universal Studios t-shirts for theme park giants like Walt Disney ( DIS ), Universal, Six Flags ( FUN ), and Merlin Entertainment. Its products are sold across the U.S., China, Japan, and Europe, and recently, SRM launched on Amazon, with sales reportedly spiking 400% in three months by December 2024. But don't get too eager. The numbers are well below those of your local mom-and-pop brick-and-mortar store. In Q1, SRM posted $1.09 million in revenue, a net loss of $646,586, and a grim EBITDA of negative $3.02 million. Cash on hand? A measly $895,930, barely covering liabilities of $828,046. SRM's Quarterly Revenues (Koyfin) No wonder the stock was going down the gutter if it weren't for a single press release that set shares on fire. The TRON Bombshell: A Crypto Curveball Last Monday, SRM dropped that very bombshell press release. A $100 million private investment in publi c equity ( PIPE ) deal funded entirely in TRON ( TRX-USD ) tokens, courtesy of an unnamed institutional investor, with Dominari Securities (a boutique investment bank linked to President Trump’s family) as the placement agent. The deal’s value is pegged to TRON’s closing price on June 15, and the tokens are locked in a custodian wallet controlled by SRM’s Board, with conversion limits pending shareholder approval. SRM also announced plans to rebrand as “Tron,” brought TRON founder Justin Sun on as an advisor, and unveiled a “TRON Treasury Strategy” to hoard TRX tokens and potentially pay dividends through a TRX staking program. So, in essence, SRM is morphing into a Nasdaq-listed proxy for TRON, a layer-1 blockchain with a $26 billion market cap, known for its high-throughput network optimized for decentralized applications and stablecoin settlements. The market has gone berserk since standing at $11.04 after Friday's closing bell. I have read through tons of comments online to see investors' reaction to the news and if there is any ""insight"" from those with deeper knowledge on the TRON network, so that I can get an idea of what the optimal scenario here is. Let me tell you, nobody has any idea what this is all about, or how it's going to play out. Even Bitcoin Treasury Companies, many of which I have covered lately, are much easier to understand what they are trying to achieve. But a ""Tron Company""? So naturally, many are treating this as meme stock on steroids while others are speculating about a crypto moonshot. Honestly, someone on X mistook SRM for a rare earth mining play, for reasons unknown, which I thought was funny. Valuing SRM Stock: Chasing a Crypto Unicorn So, how do you put a price on a case like SRM right now? Obviously, forget discounted cash flow models or P/E ratios. SRM’s negative earnings and tiny revenue make those irrelevant. This is a speculative bet, and I don't believe anyone has any idea how to value it. Clearly, the core toys business is worthless. Even if you value at 1x sales, and that's generous given it's losing money, the core business is worth like max $5 million. The real action is in the TRON deal. That $100 million in TRX tokens is a game-changer, boosting SRM’s cash reserves from under $1 million to a war chest that dwarfs its current operations. Investors might be looking at this as a balance sheet story. If SRM can convert those tokens to cash (without tanking TRX’s price) or use them strategically, it could unlock notable value. But some investors are valuing SRM as if that $100 million is already cash in the bank, justifying a market cap close to or above that figure. But then, at 17.24 million shares, $100 million translates to $5.80 per share, which is below the current price of $11.04, so already this looks like a bubble ready to burst. Now, the ""premium"" might be due to SRM’s rebranding as “Tron” and its treasury strategy, making it a backdoor play on TRON’s blockchain, which is pushing for dominance in cross-border stablecoin payments. Assuming they want to start accumulating TRX the same way Strategy ( MSTR ) accumulates BTC and achieve a ""Tron Yield"" the same way Bitcoin Treasury Companies try to generate BTC yield, then you can kind of justify a market cap premium for that ""future value"". MSTR, for instance, trades at a mNAV of 1.88 , in the same fashion, while smaller treasuries like The Smarter Web Company ( OTC:TSWCF ) trade at a mNAV of over 35 (since they just started their accumulation journey and can much faster produce ""BTC yield""). Final Thoughts Again, this is all speculative. This could 10x from here as investors get caught in some sort of ""First Tron Treasury"" company vibes before crushing, or crush as soon as next week, or actually lead to sustained gains, assuming whatever all parties involved in the deal actually know what they are doing and are able to leverage TRC to generate value. It's as speculative as it gets, and there is no way on Earth you can come even remotely close to a ""fair value,"" at least for now. So if you have some deeper knowledge tied to the Tron network and feel you can understand the mechanics of this trade, you are free to take a shot. But for the rest of us, I think it's safe to say SRM is to be avoided. And this is coming from someone who's a fan of BTC treasury companies and ""gets it"". A TRX treasury? I am not so sure about that.",SRM,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-23 15:30:24

Adding to the uncertainty is the lingering silence from Judge Analisa Torres on Ripple’s latest motion in its ongoing SEC lawsuit. The case, which could clear the path for U.S. institutional sales of XRP and possibly a spot ETF approval, remains unresolved. As XRP struggles to regain footing, the broader crypto market has also dipped, with altcoins suffering extra volatility thanks to legal headlines and geopolitical tensions. But amid the chaos, there’s one development that could quietly reshape XRP’s future. I spent much of the last week in the US with the Firelight team. This product is hugely innovative and has the potential to put BILLIONS if not 10’s of BILLIONS of XRP to work -> on Flare. — Hugo Philion (@HugoPhilion) June 22, 2025 Flare Network co-founder Hugo Philion revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Flare’s upcoming Firelight product could soon activate tens of billions of XRP. Philion hinted that after recent meetings in the U.S., this innovative solution is poised to bring billions of XRP into productive use on Flare’s ecosystem. XRP Price On Right Path? On-chain activity shows some resilience, with key wallets and escrow release schedules staying within expected ranges. Technical indicators also hint at a possible short-term bounce, with XRP’s RSI near oversold levels and key supports around $1.93 to $1.80 holding for now. Analyst Casi Trades said XRP is behaving just as expected. The price dropped close to a major support at $1.90, made a small bounce, and now looks set for a final dip to that level. This $1.90 mark is an important support zone and could signal a bottom if it holds and shows a bullish divergence. What’s even better is that Bitcoin is showing a similar pattern near $97,000. If both XRP and BTC touch these key levels together, it could trigger buying momentum and mark the start of a market rebound.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|FLR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 15:33:44

The company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq at the conclusion of the proposed business combination between my private company ProCap BTC, LLC and Columbus Circle… — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) June 23, 2025 American investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano stated that he has raised over $750 million for the initiative, the largest initial fundraising for a publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company. He revealed in the proposed deal that ProCap raised $516.5 million in equity, and ProCap Financial secured commitments for $235 million in convertible notes. According to the report, the entities intend for the convertible notes to have an associated 144A CUSIP number on the issue date. They believe the number will facilitate potential post-closing trading amongst QUBIS, but are not expected to be registered or tradeable. Columbus Circle Capital Corp noted that the convertible notes have a 130% conversion rate, a zero interest rate, and a maturity of up to 36 months. The firm said the convertible notes will be 2x collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, or a portion of the BTC purchased with the proceeds from the merger. U.S. Bank National Trust will serve as collateral agent and trustee for the convertible notes and other associated guarantee arrangements. Pompliano also highlighted that ProCap BTC agreed to purchase BTC using the funds raised in the Preferred Equity Raise within fifteen days of signing the agreements. He added that the BTC assets will be held in a custodial account until the completion of the deal, providing future shareholders of ProCap Financial with immediate exposure to Bitcoin rather than waiting until after the closing. “We are fortunate to have raised this capital from some of the leading institutional investors on Wall Street, along with many of the top crypto investors globally. ProCap Financial represents our solution to the increasing demand for bitcoin-native financial services among sophisticated investors.” – Anthony Pompliano , U.S. investor. According to the report, leading investors participating in the deal include Magnetar Capital, Woodline Partners LP, Anson Funds, RK Capital, Off the Chain Capital, Parafi, Blockchain.com, Arrington Capital, BSQ Capital Partners, and FalconX. He also acknowledged that industry veterans such as Mark Yusko, Jason Williams, Eric Semler, Tony Guoga, and Mattei Franceschetti participated as well. Pompliano said ProCap Financial will focus on acquiring BTC for its balance sheet. He also said it will develop products and services to generate revenue and profit from Bitcoin on the firm’s balance sheet. CEO of CCCM, Gary Quin, mentioned that Antony’s track record as an innovative investor, operator, and early advocate in the Bitcoin ecosystem drew him to the partnership. He said the firm believes in Pompliano’s deep expertise and hopes his relentless conviction will help continue transforming the crypto industry. Shareholders receive newly issued shares of ProCap Financial ProCap BTC revealed that former security holders of CCCM and former unitholders of ProCap BTC will receive newly-issued securities of ProCap Financial as consideration in the business deal. According to the company, the number of ProCap Financial shares issuable to the holders at closing will depend on the value of the BTC measured as of a day shortly before the closing. The number of shares will also include holders who are investors in the equity raise. The company said the holders will receive ProCap shares representing 1.25 times the number of preferred units delivered to them upon consummation of the equity raise. Before the merger, the agreement was approved by the board of directors of CCCM and by the board of managers of ProCap BTC. The terms of the deal include the proposal and its terms getting approved by the requisite CCCM shareholders and by the sole voting unit holder of ProCap BTC, an entity owned and controlled by Pompliano. Pompliano said the merger is expected to be finalized before the end of 2025, after the submission for review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of a registration of Form S-4. The registration is to register applicable securities by ProCap Financial upon finalizing the proposed business combination. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

What Do the Odds Show? After setting a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 a month ago on May 22, Bitcoin experienced a pullback with the top cryptocurrency presently experiencing a consolidation. At the time of this writing, BTC was trading at $103,498 per CoinGecko data . As a result, analysts are torn between painting a bullish or bearish picture as Bitcoin’s compression intensifies. Market analyst Daan Crypto Trades opined, “ BTC Still hanging around the $105K area which is the middle of the monthly range and right at the monthly open. Price has been compressing and it's clear that the market is waiting for a big move to occur.” Based on this analysis, Bitcoin’s destination might be at its monthly high of $110K or monthly low of $100K. If Bitcoin breaks down from the current range, on-chain metrics provider CryptoQuant speculates the leading cryptocurrency might nosedive to the $92K. What are the Chances of Bitcoin Making a Comeback? Crypto analyst Lingrid believes that Bitcoin might be experiencing the calm before the storm with the target being $112K. She noted, “BTC has printed three consecutive triangle continuation patterns with each breakout sending price higher into the $112K–$114K resistance zone. Now consolidating again within a descending wedge, the pair is testing the lower support band with potential for one more sweep. A rebound from this area may set up a textbook push into the same target zone. If structure holds, the breakout could be stronger than the last.” Similar sentiments were shared by Cas Abbe that on-chain metrics were showing a breakout to the upside. The market analyst stated, “ BTC price is consolidating, but On-Balance Volume (OBV) is still making higher highs. For those who don't know, rising OBV indicates buying pressure.If OBV continues to go up, BTC will eventually break out of its consolidation range. I'm still convinced that $130K-$135K BTC will happen in Q3 2025.” The OBV indicator is a technical analysis tool that measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator based on volume flow. Therefore, OBV helps confirm price trends because if the price is rising and OBV is rising, the trend is likely strong and supported by volume. This shows that a bullish picture is being painted in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue experiencing an uptick, given that they recently witnessed strong inflows of $388.3 million despite the ongoing geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. Will the Slashing of Interest Rates Reignite Bitcoin’s Fire? Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently signaled a possible interest rate cut as soon as next month, citing a cooling economy and downplaying the inflationary impact of new tariffs as minimal and short-lived. He stated , “I think we’ve got room to bring it down, and then we can kind of see what happens with inflation. We’ve been on pause for six months to wait and see, and so far the data has been fine.” Here’s why slashing interest rates is increasingly seen as a bullish signal for Bitcoin: 1. Lower Rates Diminish Bond Appeal, Drive Risk Appetite Historic Fed rate cuts reduce fixed-income yields, pushing investors toward riskier assets. As Meltem Demirors from CoinShares notes , “when real interest rates decline, [Bitcoin’s] appeal grows” The June 18 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held rates at 4.25–4.50%, yet projections shifted toward two cuts later in 2025. That pivot has lifted sentiment in crypto markets. 2. On‑Chain Indicators Point to Bullish Setups On‑chain data from CryptoQuant suggests stabilizing open interest and accumulating ask‑liquidity near $106K—signs of a potential short squeeze. Meanwhile, technicals remain constructive: Bitcoin continues respecting support at ~$103K–105K, with upside targets between $112K–118K, should bulls defend those levels. 3. Institutional Tailwinds Compound Macro Stimulus A dovish Fed enhances the case for Bitcoin adoption among institutions. Analysts from JPMorgan, CMC Markets, and CryptoQuant argue earlier-than-expected cuts could trigger another rally toward $112K–140K As major public firms and sovereign players continue accumulating Bitcoin, easier monetary policy amplifies their conviction. 4. Historical Precedent Confirms the Pattern Historically, Fed easing has coincided with crypto bull runs. For example, in September 2024, Bitcoin jumped ~2.5% ahead of anticipated cuts. Similar behavior is emerging in 2025: cooler inflation data, supportive Fed commentary, and easing expectations have fueled BTC’s break from the $105K range. Conclusion If the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates potentially starting in July 2025, there is a high likelihood that Bitcoin will surge. With macro conditions aligning, such as inflation cooling and institutional adoption rising, cumulative tailwinds may carry BTC toward $112K–140K in the months ahead. Nevertheless, the diverging on-chain signals should not be ignored based on the $92K dip warning, as well as the $135K breakout because Bitcoin currently finds itself in a ranging market.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-23 15:39:09

Bitcoin-related liquidations accounted for around $151 million, while Ethereum traders faced even larger losses, nearing $282 million. The selloff pushed Bitcoin to lows near $98,500 before it stabilized just below $100,000 and started growing again. Other crypto assets, including SOL, XRP, and DOGE also took the hit, losing over $22 million combined. Here you can check recent market developments on Coinglass' liquidation heatmap. Iran strike vs past geopolitical shocks Bitcoin’s reaction to geopolitical risk is not unprecedented. October’s Iran–Israel exchange wiped out about $495 million in crypto longs and shorts, sending the BTC price below $62K. In March 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered just over $242 million in crypto liquidations, as BTC tumbled from $45,000 to $35,000 in several days. However, after the markets absorbed the news, the number one cryptocurrency rebounded 65% within two months. These patterns both highlight Bitcoin’s volatility to global uncertainty and emphasize its long-term resilience to shocks. Do geopolitical turmoils provide investment opportunities? The current geopolitical turmoil coincides with ongoing regulatory developments, including the SEC’s recent policy roadmap and increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. These factors add complexity to the market outlook as investors balance risk with opportunities. The Iran strike has clearly demonstrated how geopolitical risk can rapidly impact crypto markets, triggering large-scale liquidations and a BTC price crash. However, historical trends and on-chain signals suggest that Bitcoin’s drops below $100,000 may offer a strategic entry point for long-term investors. Still, opportunities are short-lived.

With the next downside target now looming at $106—and even $74 on the radar—traders are reassessing their strategies. As the broader market stumbles, all eyes are on whether Solana can stabilize or if deeper losses are on the horizon. This breakdown analysis is brought to you by Outset PR —crypto’s precision-focused PR agency that helps projects weather volatility with timely storytelling, strategic placement, and analytics-driven media outreach. Solana Struggles to Maintain Momentum Amid Tumbling Crypto Market Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) has been hovering between $119 and $152, showing signs of weakness. The price has fallen recently by over 12% in a week, and more than 23% over the past month. The current neutral RSI suggests a lack of strong momentum either way. Bulls could face challenges as the price needs to break the nearest resistance point at $171 for growth. If successful, SOL could reach $204, potentially increasing its value by a third. Yet, breaching support levels might see SOL slide lower to $106 or even $74. Maintaining above the 10-day moving average near $134 is crucial for any short-term recovery.

Amid escalating global tensions, investors are increasingly embracing altcoins as robust alternatives to the volatile Dollar. XRP and Cardano (ADA) are showing resilience, but one crypto is gaining rapid attention: FloppyPepe (FPPE). With fresh utility and strong momentum, it is emerging as a hedge against economic instability caused by war, volatile oil prices, and broader market uncertainties. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Altcoin Ready to Outrun Inflation At an astonishingly low $0.00000035 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is currently in Stage 2 of its presale. With nearly $600,000 already secured, the momentum is driven by intensifying fears around oil shocks, war escalation, and Dollar volatility. Investors are betting on the meme token as a high-upside counter to a weakening Dollar. FloppyPepe (FPPE) blends fun with utility through Meme-o-Matic , FloppyX , and FloppyPepe.ai . Meme-o-Matic lets users turn text into viral memes in seconds, while FloppyX generates AI-powered video content. FloppyPepe.ai further amplifies the ecosystem by scanning market sentiment, providing real-time crypto insights. Its economic model, Floppynomics, allocates a 3% transaction fee with real-world impact. Every transaction fuels a unique 1% burn for scarcity, instantly distributes 1% to holders as passive income, and allocates 1% to support crucial wildlife conservation. The entire system has been audited by SolidProof, adding an extra layer of security for investors. The FLOPPY100 Bonus Hedge Against a Volatile Dollar With oil markets swinging wildly and war tensions driving further Dollar devaluation, the case for acting on FloppyPepe (FPPE) grows stronger. For a limited window, early buyers can claim an exclusive 100% bonus using code FLOPPY100 , giving them a substantial edge. The pressure from inflation and capital flight into cryptos adds urgency to this moment. Influencer Nass Crypto has endorsed the token, making it one of the smartest plays for anyone looking to multiply their gains before the next presale hike. With escalating war conflicts and oil volatility, this bonus could be the crucial edge needed. XRP: At the Crossroads of Oil Volatility and Financial Reform XRP is making moves again, climbing to $2.14 amid a sharp 28.2% increase in daily trading volume. Global war dynamics and inflation are placing greater emphasis on cross-border efficiency, which is where XRP shines. Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with governments on CBDC initiatives could serve as indirect catalysts for XRP utility and adoption. Bullish sentiment is building. Based on Santiment data, XRP is seeing a record on-chain activity, with daily active addresses surging to 295,000. Furthermore, over 2,700 whale wallets now hold 1 million XRP for the first time, reflecting rising confidence amid inflation, war, and a weakening Dollar. Cardano (ADA): Solid Footing in an Unstable World Cardano (ADA) , trading around $0.5847, is approaching a breakout after testing its lower trendline within a bullish wedge. With inflation continuing to cut into fiat purchasing power, Cardano’s (ADA) technical strength is drawing renewed investor interest. Analysts are bullish on Cardano (ADA), projecting a surge to $2.40, a staggering 550% gain from recent lows. With ETF approval odds now rated at 90% by Bloomberg analysts, institutional capital inflow could increase. As war shakes up economies and oil shocks fuel inflation, Cardano (ADA) remains a fundamentally strong crypto built for long-term relevance. Navigating Global Tensions with Crypto Resilience As global tensions continue to reshape geopolitics and oil-driven inflation undermines the Dollar, cryptos are proving themselves as viable financial lifeboats. XRP and Cardano (ADA) are trusted names, gaining traction through real use and strong communities. But it is FloppyPepe (FPPE) that may offer the most significant upside for early investors. With unique utility, smart token economics, and community support, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is leading the altcoin wave. The time to stake a claim in the future of crypto is now.

As of today, XRP trades at $2.02, marking a 2.65% decline in the last 24 hours and an 8.35% drop over the past seven days. Yet, an analyst warns that the broader setup may point to deeper structural weakness rather than a reversal.Analyst Flags Technical Weakness on XRP ChartA market analyst, Arthur, emphasized several structural concerns surrounding XRP’s recent price behavior. Despite optimism from some traders who viewed the move above the long-term downtrend as a breakout and a journey to a new all-time high, the analyst argued that the current formation lacks a solid technical base. https://twitter.com/XrpArthur/status/1936704462669680738According to this view, the $1.30 level, which previously acted as resistance ahead of XRP’s rally to $2.90 in December 2024, remains an important area of interest.Notably, the analyst identified $1.30 as a liquidity pool where the market could sweep late long positions before any genuine upward momentum returns. The analyst pointed to the absence of confirmation in the current move, noting that market makers tend to target such zones before allowing price to climb. Meanwhile, he identified a preferred re-entry point for a potential long position between $1.05 and $1.10, an area that could offer cleaner structural support.The analyst cautioned traders to mentally prepare for a potential drop, even if it doesn’t materialize, emphasizing a strategy focused on areas of maximum pain rather than following crowd-driven moves. According to him, he prefers targeting deeper price zones where others are less likely to act.Broader Macro Conditions Weigh on SentimentBeyond technical factors, the analyst also cited macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns as contributing to a bearish outlook. He mentioned uncertainties stemming from ongoing conflicts—including tensions between Iran and Israel, and the Russia–Ukraine war—as key risks. Additionally, he highlighted delays in regulatory clarity and the unresolved status of the Ripple case as deterrents for institutional capital inflows.Furthermore, he noted that summer market conditions boast historically low liquidity, making them more susceptible to manipulation. He listed these seasonal patterns alongside frozen ETF flows and overall market hesitancy among the reasons for traders to approach current XRP levels with caution.Teucrium CEO Highlights Long-Term Use Case for XRPDespite prevailing caution, Sal Gilbertie, CEO of Teucrium, pointed to continued demand for XRP-linked investment vehicles. During a recent interview, Sal Gilbertie highlighted increasing interest in investment products tied to XRP. He observed that several market participants believe XRP holds the potential to deliver stronger long-term returns than Bitcoin.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-23 15:45:20

Expert EGRAG Crypto shared Bitcoin’s clear pattern in a Monday tweet , as BTC continues to hold above $100,000. After a steep decline to $98,330, the leading cryptocurrency quickly rebounded by 2.76% to close at $101,049 on Sunday, continuing its recovery today.Bitcoin Shows Clear Growth PatternMeanwhile, EGRAG identified that Bitcoin has maintained a clear pattern of growth this cycle. Recall that BTC has been one of the standout cryptocurrencies during this bull market, outperforming most altcoins so far.The analyst shared that Bitcoin’s growth strategy includes a corrective phase where it drops below its bull market support band (BMSB), followed by a major rally to reclaim and trade above the BMSB, and then a slight correction.A first bounce follows the first retest, with another consolidation before the second bounce. After the second bounce, Bitcoin enters another corrective phase and repeats the same pattern.Interestingly, EGRAG identified two points where Bitcoin followed this pattern to the letter, as shown in an accompanying chart. Bitcoin Analysis | EGRAG Crypto For instance, Bitcoin fell into a correction in November 2022, dropping to $15,500 and slipping below the BMSB , a signal based on the 20-week SMA and 21-week EMA. It recovered in January 2023, climbing to $28,600. A bounce followed in early March after a weekly doji candle, pushing the price to $31,000. Another doji in mid-June sparked a second bounce to $31,830, before Bitcoin pulled back again into a new correction.Meanwhile, another complete pattern occurred between September 2023 and June 2024 before the current formation.What's Next for Bitcoin as Pattern FormsEGRAG’s chart shows that Bitcoin is currently developing in alignment with the pattern, breaking from a corrective phase in late April to bring prices above the BMSB and to its current all-time high of $112,000. Now, Bitcoin is in the first retest phase, which has seen it correct 8.6% from its May peak price.From here, the analyst predicts that Bitcoin would retrace further to fill a CME gap at $91,950. Following the 10% correction from the current market price, Bitcoin would rally extensively to a new all-time high between $140,000 and $160,000.Subsequently, BTC would enter the second retest phase before launching to its ultimate target of $175,000 this cycle. From the current price of $102,319, this represents a 71% uptick.Remarkably, EGRAG has persisted in his expectation that Bitcoin will target $175,000 , sharing in an earlier analysis that this would happen by September 2025. Meanwhile, targets of $200,000 and $250,000 still exist for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.",Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-23 15:46:00

The move comes as the BNB Chain, the blockchain tied to BNB, saw its daily transactions nearly double to 17.6 million since mid-May, according to data from DeFiLlama . Crypto markets have been jittery amid escalating geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies between major economies. One factor helping to buoy sentiment is the upcoming Maxwell hard fork , scheduled for June 30. If successful, it will reduce block times from 1.5 seconds to 0.75 seconds, potentially making the network more competitive with high-speed chains. If momentum continues, BNB may attempt to reclaim the $650 level and push toward $700. But much will depend on how users respond to the technical upgrades and how the geopolitical situation develops. Technical Analysis Overview BNB formed a strong uptrend, with notable volume support that helped establish a key support level at $616.55, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The most significant breakout came as the price surged through resistance at $624.59 and reached the session high of $627.85. After several hours consolidating between $620 and $625, BNB broke resistance at $625.24, signaling potential for further upside into the $630–$635 range. BNB rallied from $619.31 to $627.03, adding 1.25% in a sharp upward move that reinforced bullish momentum, before seeing a decline to now stand at $621.6.",Markets|BNB|AI Market Insights|Technical Analysis|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|FORKS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-23 15:47:01

I’m watching. You’re playing right into the hands of the enemy. Don’t do it,” the president wrote on Truth Social. Iran’s parliament had voted to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow maritime chokepoint through which about 20% of the world’s crude oil passes. BREAKING: President Trump says everyone should ""keep oil prices down"" and that he is ""watching."" Trump says, ""You're playing right into the hands of the enemy. Don't do it."" pic.twitter.com/XMPkRZwJej — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 23, 2025 West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures rose as much as 2.7% on Monday before settling around $74.68 per barrel, up 84 cents or 1.14%. Brent crude futures were trading at $77.86, marking an increase of 85 cents or 1.1% by late morning in London. “Iran may choose to target tanker traffic in the Strait as a form of retaliation,” said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen. “All eyes remain on the Strait of Hormuz and what happens next.” Trump, meanwhile, has directed the US Department of Energy to ramp up domestic production. “Drill, baby, drill. And I mean now,” he posted on social media, in line with his administration’s inflation-control strategy centered on keeping energy costs low. Tanker traffic spells disruption According to Yui Torikata, senior liquid market analyst at the firm, at least six vessels altered their routes between Sunday and Monday to avoid entering the Strait of Hormuz. These included two very large crude carriers, three chemical tankers, and one refined products carrier. “All vessels were in ballast, meaning they were either empty or carrying light loads,” Torikata said. Ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg showed that 44 oil carriers passed through the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday, evenly split between inbound and outbound traffic. She noted that three of the six ships, South Loyalty , COSWISDOM Lake , and Damsgaard , have since reversed course again and are now heading back toward the Strait. The remaining three are idling near Khor Fakkan and Muscat. “ This specific weekend event should be seen in a broader context ,” Torikata explained. “ The number of available empty crude carriers in the Gulf hit a record low, suggesting that shipowners were reluctant to enter the zone. But that trend began to reverse by the weekend .” She added that the number of crude tankers contemplating entering the region from the Gulf of Oman had recovered from its low point on June 16. Frontline collision and insurance could cause supply disruption Per a CNBC report , there was a collision near the Strait involving the Frontline-operated Front Eagle and a dark fleet tanker named Adalynn . The incident resulted in a fire aboard the Front Eagle , which was later extinguished. Market watchers believe that such incidents, along with ballooning insurance costs, could discourage more shipowners from operating in the area. “Some owners will simply avoid the area altogether,” said energy analyst Andy Lipow, asserting that Frontline has already suspended new contracts involving passage through the Strait of Hormuz. “ This causes a de facto partial supply disruption if there’s a lack of tankers to carry the oil that needs to be exported .” Lipow also mentioned geopolitical pressure from China, which purchases about 90% of Iran’s crude oil. “Some tanker owners may feel that China is pressuring Iran not to disrupt shipping. But if cornered, Iran might choose to inflict economic pain by targeting global oil supply,” he concluded. White House keeps diplomatic channels open Speaking in a Fox News interview on Monday, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump is open to diplomatic engagement with Iran despite the recent military action. According to Leavitt, Trump is not backing away from a diplomatic route but is “ raising a question that many people around the world are asking .” “ The president believes the Iranian people can control their own destiny, ” Leavitt reckoned. “If the Iranian regime refuses to come to a peaceful diplomatic solution, which the president is still pursuing, then why shouldn’t the Iranian people seek to take away the power of a violent regime that’s suppressed them for decades? ” She also revealed that the US military posture is unchanged and described Saturday evening’s airstrikes as “decisive precision strikes” that were “successful.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Fall or Rise? Analysts Comment!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/middle-east-crisis-hits-bitcoin-what-should-we-expect-next-for-btc-fall-or-rise-analysts-comment/,"Bitcoin price rose above $100,000 again in early May after a long correction. However, BTC fell below $100,000 for the first time since early May following the US-Iran developments over the weekend. While this decline is only temporary according to some analysts, according to others, the decline could deepen if critical levels are not maintained. At this point, experienced analyst 10x Research founder Markus Thielen said that Bitcoin's fall or rise depends on some levels. Explaining the critical levels for Bitcoin, the analyst said that as long as BTC remains above the short-term realized price of $98,000 and the trend support of $102,000, there is a chance for an increase and investors can continue to look for tactical bullish opportunities. However, the analyst warned investors against this situation and stated that a break below this range is very likely, especially in the absence of strong bullish catalysts. Stating that investors should manage their risks, the analyst said: “BTC has made three failed attempts to break above $110,000 due to short-term macroeconomic shocks, from tariff concerns in May to the escalation between Israel and Iran in June. At this point, Bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase for the last five weeks, and these events show that it is not behaving as a hedge in the current environment.” Stating that Bitcoin is too risky, Thielen said that the consolidation could last a few more months and said, “Our view is that we will consolidate throughout the summer.” Bitcoin's Uptrend Continues! While Thielen is not bullish on Bitcoin, Eugene Cheung, director of digital asset platform OSL, noted that despite Bitcoin briefly falling below $100,000, its resistance points to strong institutional support. “Even though Bitcoin has fallen below $100,000 due to increased geopolitical tensions following the US strike on Iran, it has remained resilient. This indicates strong institutional support and long-term optimism,” Cheung said, remaining bullish. Finally, LVRG Research analyst Nick Ruck argued that altcoins could outperform Bitcoin in the coming months. Ruck said that if macro conditions stabilize, catalysts for crypto could emerge and altcoins could outperform. *This is not investment advice.

46624544,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753899,1750693717,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46624544.jpeg,Fed leadership divided over timeline for rate cuts,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/feds-bowman-july-rate-cut-defying-powell/,"Michelle Bowman, a governor at the Federal Reserve, said on Monday she’s ready to vote for a rate cut at the next policy meeting in July… if inflation stays low. Speaking during a conference in Prague, she made it clear that the current data gives enough space for the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate. Bowman’s statement now aligns her with Christopher Waller, another Federal Reserve governor who publicly backed a possible rate cut last Friday. According to CNBC , Bowman told attendees, “Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting in order to bring it closer to its neutral setting and to sustain a healthy labor market.” She said she’ll keep tracking how White House policies, the broader economy, and the financial system evolve in the coming weeks. Waller, in his own interview with CNBC, had already said July should be an option. That now puts two voices from inside the Fed backing action next month, despite Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, still pushing for no rate cut until September. Fed leadership divided over timeline for rate cuts The Fed’s July meeting will happen on the 29th and 30th, but futures traders aren’t fully convinced that any change is coming that soon. As of now, the CME FedWatch tool puts the chances of a July rate cut at 23%, with 77% betting on September instead. Bowman’s position, though, shows that the internal debate is far from settled. Right now, the Fed’s key rate is between 4.25% and 4.5%, and it’s been sitting there since the last FOMC meeting. That meeting ended with a shift in tone. Powell said last week the Fed has room to be patient, because the job market remains strong and recent inflation numbers haven’t moved much. Many companies are still offloading inventory they stocked ahead of tariff deadlines, and people aren’t spending as freely, which has limited pricing pressure. Donald Trump, now back in the White House, has been publicly urging the Federal Reserve to cut rates sharply. He said they should go down by at least 2 percentage points to reduce borrowing costs as the national debt keeps rising. But neither Bowman nor Waller endorsed any number that aggressive. In fact, Waller flat-out said there’s “no need for such dramatic cuts.” Bowman also weighed in on Trump’s trade policies. She said, “I think it is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed, and have a smaller effect than initially expected, especially because many firms frontloaded their stocks of inventories.” Daly wants to wait, dot plot shows uncertainty inside Fed Not everyone on the Fed agrees with Bowman and Waller. Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, said during CNBC’s Closing Bell that she’s in favor of waiting until more data comes in. “We want to be thoughtful enough to collect the information,” she said. Daly also pointed out that “unless we saw a faltering in the labor market that was meaningful, and we thought it would be persistent, then I would say the fall looks more appropriate to me.” She won’t vote this year, but her views still highlight how split the Fed is right now. At the same time, Trump has dialed back the aggressive talk on tariffs and is now open to negotiating with trade partners. Economists had warned that these tariffs could spike inflation, but the data have shown very little movement. That shift in tone from Trump has taken some heat off the Fed, giving more flexibility on when and how to act. The Fed’s dot plot, which shows where each FOMC member thinks rates are headed, is all over the place. Out of 19 participants, seven want to hold rates steady through 2025. Two expect one cut, while ten see two or three cuts happening. The median projection still points to two cuts this year, but the disagreement shows there’s no single direction everyone agrees on. Bowman said she supports the new tone from the last post-meeting statement, where the Fed stopped focusing on external uncertainty and instead started looking more at potential weakness in the labor market. That change is important because it shows growing concerns that jobs might take a hit if the Fed stays too tight for too long.

Cryptocurrency gained 3.65% of its value. GRT coin gets buyers’ support at $0.0732. On June 23, 2025, The Graph price analysis revealed an increasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The altcoin value has recovered to $0.0753 in the past 24 hours, after following a steep downtrend for four consecutive days. At the same time, the currency gained 3.65% of its value today. Despite the downside even yesterday, today the market events remained favorable for the bulls. The Graph 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of The Graph confirmed a bullish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value has increased to $0.0753 over the last 24 hours. In addition, the higher volatility levels suggest a higher chance of reversal. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to heightened volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.102. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.0725. GRT/USD price chart. Image source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator confirms the recent upturn in price. Its value has increased to index 34.82 today, but this still suggests that sellers have room for a reversal. However, if the bullish momentum continues to grow, further stability in the market can be expected. The Graph 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of The Graph coin also referred to a bullish trend in the market. Buyers are now aiming for an increase above the current level on the GRT/USD price chart but have not succeeded yet. The Bollinger Bands are converging, resulting in decreasing volatility. This decrease in volatility signifies lower market unpredictability; however, the indicator’s arms are still far apart, suggesting heightened volatility. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.0850, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.0696, securing the support. GRT/USD price chart. Image source: TradingView The RSI indicator is moving in the upward direction within the neutral area for now. The indicator’s value has jumped to index 39.87 in the last four hours. The steep curve on the RSI graph represents a bullish momentum in the market. Further upside is possible pertaining to the bullish progression.

The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. If observed over the larger picture, the current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile market. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next? The Graph price analysis gives a relatively bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has increased to $0.0753 in the past 24 hours. A continuation of the current price action might bring more chances for investors. However, the increasing volatility on the daily chart shows that there is a high chance of a trend reversal, which, if it happens, can lead to a price below $0.0730. Why is GRT up? The increase in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Moreover, the past few days supported the bears, as the selling pressure remained substantially high, so the coin is recovering today after finding support. Will GRT reach $0.5? Yes, GRT should rise above $0.5 in 2029. In that year, the price will range between $0.490 and $0.547. Will GRT reach $1? Per the analysts’ price predictions, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $1 by 2031. Will GRT reach $10? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $10 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Hence, it is advised to do your own research and conduct in-depth investment advice before investing in the volatile market.

Although there was a recovery atmosphere in the cryptocurrency market in general today, the increase in the S price was recorded as 14% and left many altcoins behind. There was no sudden increase after the Coinbase listing news. In fact, there was a controversy between Sonic founder Andre Cronje and Coinbase in the past. Cronje claimed that Coinbase did not charge fees for listings, but the company demanded fees of $100 million or more for the priority of listings. Similarly, Tron founder Justin Sun previously claimed that Coinbase required an $80 million fee and $250 million in Bitcoin collateral to list TRX.

BTC, ETH, XRP, and Pi Network Bounce Back Strong appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a nerve-wracking weekend packed with geopolitical tension and market dips, the crypto market is showing fresh signs of life. The crypto market’s turnaround comes after Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000 amid fears surrounding U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The Middle East conflict sent shockwaves across financial markets, but Bitcoin managed to hold key support levels and has since climbed back above $101,000. The overall crypto market is showing signs of recovery, with the total market cap climbing to $3.12 trillion — up 2.42% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin continues to lead the market, trading above $101,400 with a 5.7% gain over the past week. Ethereum follows with a solid 14.6% weekly rise, while altcoins like XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano are posting double-digit weekly gains. Hyperliquid (HYPE) surged over 22% this week, cementing its spot among the top performers. Despite the bounce, Altcoin Season Index remains low at 15/100 — suggesting Bitcoin dominance still rules this rally for now. One of the biggest confidence boosters for Bitcoin was news that MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor purchased a staggering $1 billion worth of BTC, adding to institutional optimism. This heavyweight buyout set off a chain reaction, with altcoins like ETH, XRP, ADA, DOT, and Pi Network all catching a bid. With geopolitical fears cooling slightly and options expiries out of the way, crypto markets are stabilizing for now. But with macro risks still looming and ETF developments on the radar, traders are advised to stay alert while enjoying this bounce.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 15:54:06

The native exchange coin has a long track record as one of the blue-chip assets and is now joining the trend of altcoin treasuries. Former Coral Capital executives are launching a BNB coin strategy, with the goal of raising $100M for initial purchases. A group of crypto hedge fund experts, including Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger, and Johnathan Pasch, is behind the plan to create a BNB treasury company. The entity will be the first of its kind, offering mainstream exposure to BNB with the potential for future purchases financed by equity. To achieve that goal, the group aims for a reverse buyback of an unidentified Nasdaq-listed company. The company will then be renamed to Build&Build Corporation to reflect the Binance ecosystem ethos. After the acquisition, the company will seek a $100M financing round, repeating the model of Strategy and other public companies announcing the accumulation of BTC , SOL , ETH , or other assets. Binance’s Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, founder and former CEO of the top exchange, stated that Binance is not directly affiliated with the strategy plan. However, he sent out a generally favorable message on having a BNB ‘Strategy’, raising demand for the token. BNB ""microstrategy"" coming to a company near you! https://t.co/90FXknLtex — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) June 23, 2025 Zhao, however, stated that BNB is the token of a public blockchain and is not linked to Binance or controlled by the exchange. Following the news, BNB expanded by 2.4% to $624.46. The asset has been trading with relative stability for months, as it has encouraged long-term holding and staking. BNB is also among the assets shortlisted for a potential ETF, though still facing a long process of approval. Treasury companies have achieved short-term stock growth. This time, the buyers have not announced the Nasdaq-listed firm to serve as the shell company. Crypto purchases are also used as a pivot for companies with distressed stock, in a bid to renew their activity and tap growth from the crypto market. BNB grew in popularity with DEX activity BNB also became more attractive as Binance ended its long-running legal battle with US regulators. The exchange is still a key hub for both centralized and decentralized activity, airdrops, and token sales, boosting the value of BNB. BNB recovered from its recent lows, still holding onto its usual price range. | Source: Coingecko BNB Chain and BNB Smart Chain recently posted record activity levels, carrying over 42% of on-chain transactions compared to all other chains. The network is mostly reflecting the usage of Binance Wallet, a direct hub for decentralized swaps. The asset has already been used as a store of value and on-chain liquidity. BNB Smart Chain locks in over $5.7B, developing its own ecosystem of lending protocols, DAO, and other treasuries. Holding BNB also incurs staking rewards, as well as the potential to participate in additional token airdrops. BNB is a utility token, raising the potential that both ETF and treasuries will not just sit idly in a wallet, but could earn passive income. Around 21% of the BNB supply is currently staked, and treasuries may take a while before making a dent in circulating tokens. Up to 50% of BNB tokens are already held in whale or exchange wallets, as well as early ICO buyers. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

TRUMP remains down by 13% in a week and by 32% in the last 30 days, while the crypto market as a whole has suffered a 6.9% decline over the latter period. The coin’s losses over the past couple of days come after a wallet linked to its team sent 3.5 million TRUMP (or roughly $32.8 million) to Binance. The possibility of further escalation in the Middle East could send TRUMP lower in the near term, although the coin’s association with President Trump, who is no stranger to promoting the token, should help it recover in the medium and longer term. Official Trump Price Prediction As Whale Moves $32.8 Million in $TRUMP to Binance Posting on X, tracker Lookonchain revealed that the TRUMP team has sent just over $150 million in the token to various exchanges since April 28, with each transfer preceding a drop in the Official Trump price. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1936453591981850769 The previous large transfer, worth $47 million on June 4, saw the token drop from roughly $11.20 to $9.56 the next day, a 14.6% decline. Such transfers play into criticisms that TRUMP serves mainly to enrich the coin’s founders, accusations which became more heated in the buildup to a dinner for the token’s biggest holders. And if we look at TRUMP’s chart, we see that it has declined steeply since peaking in January, with the coin actually down by 88% since this peak. Yet because of recent declines, it has reached a strongly oversold and undervalued position, implying that it could bounce back in the near term. Source: TradingView For instance, its relative strength index (purple) has touched 30 and may be about to bottom out, while its MACD (orange, blue) also looks ready to recover. Of course, things will depend on the direction of the conflict in Iran, which could escalate further if the latter retaliates against US airstrikes, which is a distinct possibility. As of writing, it appears that oil tankers have performed u-turns in the Strait of Hormuz , which Iran may block, something that could plunge the global economy into further chaos. If so, the Official Trump price will likely drop further in the coming days, although the medium-term picture looks more encouraging, if only because of Donald Trump’s willingness to promote his meme token. It could therefore return to $10 by the end of July and $15 by the end of August, before ending the year at around $25. Layer-Two Network Solaxy Launches After Raising $58.5 Million in Presale: Biggest New Alt of 2025? If some traders remain a little uncertain as to the future trajectory of TRUMP, there are numerous promising alternatives to consider. The market has recently seen the arrival of a wave of new coins that not only show strong potential upside, but also come with solid fundamentals. Probably the most interesting of these is Solaxy (SOLX), a layer-two Solana network that has raised a whopping $58.5 million in its presale, which closed earlier today. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1937149071678222570 This is a hugely impressive figure, and it’s a testament to the excitement Solaxy has been able to generate via its roadmap As an L2, Solaxy will provide Solana users with faster confirmation times and much lower transaction fees, while also improving reliability and stability. It will enable instant bridging between itself and Solana, with the Solaxy team planning to widen compatibility to other chains over time. Solaxy will also deploy its own decentralized exchange and token launchpad not long after it goes live, helping it to become an important network for DeFi and meme token trading. Its native token, SOLX, will be necessary to pay for transaction fees, while holders will also be able to stake it. It could therefore experience huge demand, with traders now able to buy it via Raydium or Uniswap. Interested investors can check out its official website for further info.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol still in its early presale phase, is rapidly emerging as a potential game-changer and is already being watched by seasoned crypto investors looking for the next big cryptocurrency before it hits the mainstream radar. At present, Mutuum Finance has sold out over 40% of phase-5 of its presale. The project has already received more than 11 million and has drawn close to 12,300 investors. Ethereum Echoes Bitcoin’s 2017–2021 Consolidation as $4,000 Lurks Ethereum is now sitting at 2,553 and looks exactly like the classic pres-parabolic configuration in 2017-2021 on Bitcoin. According to renowned analyst Ted Pillows and others, what has now occurred is that ETH has wrapped into a small trade range and is being held at $2,400-2,600 as an initial support leading to possible breakout at higher values above the 2,800-2,775 range. An action through that level may trigger an imminent rise to the $4,000 ceiling, rejuvenating the altcoin market activity. Nonetheless, this bullish situation might be postponed by macro uncertainties, which cover both geopolitical and economic levels. Making this wait even more tense is a muttered, little known player: Mutuum Finance (MUTM), who has managed to attract new interest of early-stage investors. Mutuum Finance is Reinventing DeFi Lending, using a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance is set to establish a new standard in decentralized finance and introduce the next-generation lending protocol to offer the best of both worlds, combining the Profits of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Within the P2C system, lending pool and interest rate auto-update to reflect the current market trends through the intervention of automated smart contracts. This will offer a stable and predictable set of returns to lenders and consistent set of terms to borrowers, which is sorely lacking in DeFi lending. The P2P model, on the contrary, eliminates middlemen, which enables borrowers and lenders to access each other. The model is particularly beneficial in handling highly volatile assets and it gives its users more flexibility, control and risk management that suits their needs. Combining two effective solutions, Mutuum Finance offers an incomparable balance of efficiency, decentralization, and flexibility and will become a leader of the DeFi market in the future. Presale Phase 5 Accelerates Mutuum Finance presale is currently at Phase 5 and the momentum is gaining pace rapidly. Having over 12,300 investors who have joined already, and with almost 11 million already raised, the project is demonstrating that it is not just another DeFi experiment. Smart investors can’t miss a chance to purchase Mutuum Finance tokens with a price of just $0.03, which are set to increase and be $0.06 at launch, leading to a 2x yield on investments in the early phase. Mutuum Finance is designing an Ethereum-based fully collateralized USD stablecoin to complement its ecosystem even more. The asset is stable in volatile markets unlike algorithmic stablecoins that are vulnerable to depegging in volatile markets environments; therefore, making it a stable medium of exchange and store value institutionally and retail-wise. Ethereum’s march toward $4,000 has traders buzzing, but behind the scenes, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly setting the stage for even greater gains. With over 12,300 investors and $11 million raised so far in Phase 5, the token is priced at just $0.03, yet offers a 2x return by launch. Mutuum’s dual lending system, stablecoin integration, and real DeFi utility make it more than a presale hype. As ETH prepares for its next leg up, MUTM may be the real wealth builder for early backers looking to multiply their returns before 2026.

46624909,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72294,1750694587,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Trader Peter Brandt Issues Rare XRP Price Prediction As Epic Head and Shoulder Appears,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-peter-brandt-issues-rare-xrp-price-prediction-as-epic-head-and-shoulder-appears/,"Veteran trader and renowned chartist Peter Brandt has spotlighted what could be a defining moment for XRP, pointing to a possible Head and Shoulders (H&S) formation on the weekly chart. The development comes at a time of increased geopolitical tension, casting uncertainty over XRP’s next direction. XRP Under Pressure Following Global Tensions XRP is trading around $2.03 after a sharp drop triggered by global unrest . The broader cryptocurrency market recently reacted to news that the United States launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, further inflaming the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict. The impact was immediate, sending shockwaves through digital assets—XRP included. This recent price action has placed XRP at a technically sensitive point. Brandt, known for his deep understanding of chart patterns, noted that the asset is currently holding just above a crucial neckline level that could determine whether the market turns decisively bearish. Head and Shoulders Pattern Points to Possible Breakdown Brandt’s analysis centers on an H&S formation that began to take shape in late 2024. The left shoulder appeared in December, following XRP’s rally to $2.90 and its subsequent pullback. The head formed in January 2025 when the price surged to $3.40. The right shoulder developed in May as XRP climbed to $2.65. Treat the Apr 7 overshoot as an out-of-line movement and we have a possible H&S top in $XRP For the sake of the uneducated trolls among you, this chart need NOT be interpreted as bearish Price is at support right now I will review if price closes below 1.8xxxx pic.twitter.com/YlsqLi2SzN — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) June 23, 2025 The neckline of the structure lies at $1.875—a level XRP is now hovering just above. Interestingly, Brandt disregards the sharp April 7 drop to $1.61, calling it an outlier caused by extreme volatility. Without this anomaly, the pattern remains cleaner and more symmetrical. He emphasized that the H&S pattern would only be validated if XRP closes a weekly candle below $1.80. Should this occur, it could pave the way for a deeper correction. Until then, the setup remains technically plausible but unconfirmed. Indicators Reflect a Market in Limbo Beyond chart patterns, broader technical indicators paint a picture of indecision. The 8-week and 18-week exponential moving averages have flattened and now run closely together, often a sign that momentum is fading. Supporting this view, the Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures trend strength, is currently at 16.41—well below the threshold that indicates a strong trend. Meanwhile, the Average True Range (ATR) has contracted to 0.486, signaling reduced volatility. When both momentum and volatility decline, the stage is often set for a sudden and decisive move in either direction.

CryptoInsightsUK noted a significant liquidity build-up around the $1.87 mark and suggested that XRP could briefly dip below this level—possibly to $1.72—to shake out weak hands before rebounding. He also highlighted that liquidity pools exist above current prices, hinting that any upward breakout could trigger a sharp rally. Looking at $XRP 4HR liquidity. I would expect we take the liquidity around $1.87. Whether we get the $1.72 I don't know, I think that would be an absolute blessing entry. Important to now look up above us and see how dense that liquidity has become. We do go up and it will be… pic.twitter.com/Mtl3o7pK03 — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) June 23, 2025 Similarly, analyst EGRAG Crypto took a more bullish stance . He pointed out that XRP recently retested a critical support zone—what he calls the “white box”—and held firm. According to him, this successful retest is a bullish signal. EGRAG outlined two possible paths for XRP: either continued correction or a bounce toward new highs. However, he warned that XRP needs to reclaim the $2.08 level soon to preserve its upward momentum. If not, the asset risks dropping to $1.90 or $1.77, with $1.47 acting as a last-resort support level if selling pressure intensifies. Market Poised for XRP’s Next Major Move XRP now stands at a crossroads, with technical patterns, key support levels, and geopolitical events all converging. Whether Brandt’s bearish projection plays out or XRP defies expectations remains to be seen. One thing is certain—this is a critical juncture that demands sharp analysis and a strategic approach. As Peter Brandt hinted, this isn’t a moment for guesswork. Only those with a deep understanding of market dynamics will be prepared for what comes next.

As the US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday, joining the fight between Israel and Iran, China kept a low profile. According to CNBC, it hasn’t condemned the strikes outright, but it has publicly backed Tehran, its long-time partner. And while it’s talking about peace, Beijing could quietly stand to gain if oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz are cut. China and Iran signed a 25-year partnership deal in 2021. That agreement covers everything: economics, military cooperation, and security. Since then, the two countries have regularly carried out joint military drills. Iran’s population, around 91 million, gives it more manpower and internal market size than Israel, which has fewer than 10 million people. It also controls huge oil reserves. That made Iran a key part of China’s Belt and Road initiative, which state media like Global Times said was designed to challenge US global dominance. China has oil options if the US gets squeezed About 20 million barrels of oil pass through the Strait of Hormuz each day. That’s one-fifth of the world’s total consumption. Roughly half of China’s oil imports pass through the same narrow waterway. But even with that level of dependence, China has already been using alternative setups to avoid sanctions. It pays in yuan, skips Western banks, and uses shipping routes that aren’t tied to the US or Europe. Evercore ISI economist Neo Wang told CNBC that China likely won’t intervene to stop Iran. “China will likely keep its hands off Iran in any case,” he said. Wang added that China has little influence over Israel, and that more Middle East chaos could benefit Beijing by drawing attention away from the Pacific and the US-China trade war. “It’s a bigger distraction to Washington,” Wang said. On June 12, when Israel hit Iranian targets, China said the attack was a “violation of Iran’s sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.” But since that first reaction, the government’s tone has shifted. Foreign minister Wang Yi told Israel’s foreign minister that the strikes were “unacceptable,” but he didn’t go as far as condemning them outright. Analysts at Eurasia Group said China is trying to manage the conflict without getting its hands dirty. It hasn’t condemned Israel by name. It hasn’t broken off talks with anyone. Instead, it’s trying to stay in the middle, defending Iran on paper but still keeping enough distance to look like a neutral player. The analysts said that’s because Beijing wants to stop the war from spreading and messing with its economic interests. China could live with higher oil prices US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said over the weekend that China should help convince Iran not to close the Strait of Hormuz. But some policy analysts believe a shutdown might actually work in China’s favor. It could handle the oil supply shock better than the US or Europe. CNBC pointed out that China’s oil sources are already diverse, as it imports from Russia, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Iraq, and Oman. And much of what arrives from Malaysia is actually just Iranian oil with new paperwork. Robin Brooks from the Brookings Institution said, “China will be happy to see a big spike in oil prices if that destabilizes the US and Europe.” Andrew Bishop from Signum Global Advisors said, “China may not be that irate at paying more for oil from other sources, if it means the US suffers even more.” Iran’s parliament voted on Sunday to back closing the Strait, so it’s already temporarily closed, but the country’s national security council has the final say. In response, China’s foreign ministry said that keeping the Gulf stable is in everyone’s best interest, but didn’t pressure anyone to back down. China also weighed in at the United Nations. At a Security Council meeting on Sunday, its ambassador, Cong Fu, attacked the US directly. He said Beijing “strongly condemns” the strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. He also called out Israel and demanded a ceasefire. “The parties to the conflict, Israel in particular, should reach an immediate ceasefire to prevent a spiraling escalation,” Cong said, as reported in the official readout. That said, nobody expects Beijing to step in and fix the situation. Andy Rothman, founder of Sinology LLC, told CNBC that he doesn’t believe China will try to negotiate peace between the US and Iran. But he added that China may still be trying to calm Tehran behind closed doors. “Because that would destabilize the region and weaken the global economy, neither of which is in China’s interest,” Rothman said.

This article delves into a select group of coins that every savvy trader should consider. Uncover which digital currencies are set to skyrocket in the upcoming rebound and why these particular coins deserve a spot in any well-rounded crypto portfolio. PEPE Faces Downward Drift as Key Levels Shape Trading Outlook Over the past month and half-year, PEPE has experienced marked declines that reveal a strong downward trend. The token dropped approximately 36% in one month, deepening to almost 54% over the past six months. A one-week price fall of about 20% further emphasizes the rapid slide in value. These figures reflect a consistent bearish momentum over varying timeframes, making the recent price performance a clear story of persistent weakness and selling pressure. The current trading scenario sees PEPE oscillating within a defined price band of roughly $0.00000726 to $0.00001639. The nearest resistance at about $0.00002113 signals where upward moves may face stiff selling, while a support level at roughly $0.00000285 offers a potential entry point for buyers. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum readings tip into negative territory, and an RSI near 31.43 suggests oversold conditions. Although bears largely hold sway in the short term, the absence of a distinct trend leaves room for tactical moves. Traders might consider looking for buying opportunities when the price nears support or testing the resistance zone for short-term profit taking. The secondary resistance near $0.00003026 could become important if a reversal takes hold, making careful attention to these levels pivotal in the current volatile setup. Celestia Price Outlook: Bearish Past and Support-Resistance Dynamics Last month marked a steep decline of nearly 43%, while the past six months witnessed a drop of over 73%. TIA experienced significant selling pressure, with weekly losses reaching almost 20%. Price movement has been volatile, reflecting a market that rejected higher levels and pushed down toward critical areas. The downward momentum established a persistent bearish tone over recent periods. The current price sits between a low of $1.70 and a high of $3.05, testing a hard support level at $1.20 and facing near-term resistance at $3.91. Bearish signals dominate as the Relative Strength Index falls to 23.83 and momentum shows weak performance. The moving average indicates sustained downward pressure, with indicators reflecting an oversold condition. Trading ideas in this range include seeking a bounce from the support level with confirmation of strength before targeting the resistance area. A break above could lead to a target around $5.26, though caution is advised without a clear uptrend. Ethena Market Overview and Current Price Analysis Ethena has seen a steep decline of -33.76% in the past month and an even larger drop of -76.81% over the last six months. Weekly performance shows a further decrease of -19.24%, with prices fluctuating between $0.22 and $0.43. The sustained losses over half a year indicate a strong downward trend, characterized by minimal recovery in the short term. Price volatility and decreasing momentum suggest significant selling pressure, highlighted by technical indicators reflecting a bearish sentiment. Current prices are contained within a range of $0.22 to $0.43, sitting above a support level at $0.14 and below a key resistance level at $0.55. A secondary resistance point is located at $0.75, posing a barrier for upward movement. The RSI at 35.61 suggests an oversold situation, while the Awesome Oscillator at -0.07 and Momentum Indicator at -0.06 indicate continued downward pressure. A moving average recommendation of -0.8 contrasts with the oscillators' suggestion of 0.36, hinting at potential gains. Traders should consider short-term options or await a clear breakout while monitoring these crucial levels. Conclusion PEPE , TIA , and ENA are strong contenders for any crypto portfolio. These coins show potential for growth during the market rebound. Each has unique strengths that could lead to significant gains. Diversifying with these options may better position investors for future opportunities. Keeping an eye on such promising coins is advised.

Goolsbee said that attention should be paid to the moderate course of economic data during the transition period. Goolsbee, while evaluating the effects of the customs duties that have recently come back to the agenda, stated that these policies are “no different from oil shocks with a stagflationary effect.” However, he added that this effect is weaker compared to the past. He stated that lower customs duty rates and exemptions limit the reflection of customs duties on the economy. Related News: What Will Happen to XRP Amid Recent Declines? Here Are Two Possible Scenarios According to Analysts Goolsbee said it was still unclear how tariffs would drive inflation. “If we don’t see a spike in inflation from tariffs, then the economy is still on a golden path,” he said, adding that there has been no significant increase in inflation in the past three months. The Fed official argued that if the impact of trade policy is completely gone, interest rate cuts should continue. However, Goolsbee expressed concern about the possibility of stagflation and said it was not clear what policy to follow in this environment. Goolsbee said he did not believe a 1970s-style stagflation would hit the U.S., but noted that the Fed faces certain risks in its dual mandate of encompassing employment and price stability goals. *This is not investment advice.

The most recent one before this occurred on June 9, when Tether minted another $1 billion on the network. The move coincided with growing activity on Tron. According to CryptoOnchain , the 50-day and 100-day moving averages of active addresses reached their highest levels to date. At the same time, the network recorded 30% more transactions compared to February. While USDT mints have happened before, they suggest that Tether anticipates increased stablecoin demand on the Tron network.

The project recently announced a major leadership change, specifically the removal of its CEO, Ravindra Kumar. This decision comes amidst serious accusations that have cast a shadow over the project. What Triggered the Self Chain CEO Removal? The primary catalyst for the leadership transition at Self Chain was a series of grave allegations directed at former CEO Ravindra Kumar. Reports surfaced accusing him of involvement in a large-scale financial misconduct scheme within the cryptocurrency space. According to information reported by The Block, the accusations center around a alleged $50 million crypto fraud. This scheme reportedly involved over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, a common method for large volume trades that happen outside of public exchanges. However, the nature of the alleged activities raised serious concerns. Understanding the Alleged $50M Crypto Fraud The core of the allegations paints a picture of a sophisticated operation that allegedly defrauded investors out of a substantial amount of money. The reported figure of $50 million highlights the significant scale of the purported misconduct. Such large-scale financial issues can severely impact confidence in a project and the broader market. Details emerging about the scheme suggest it operated in a manner disturbingly similar to a Ponzi structure. In such schemes, returns promised to early investors are paid out using the capital from newer investors, rather than from actual profits. This requires a constant influx of new money to sustain the illusion of profitability, making the structure inherently unstable and destined to collapse. The Nature of the OTC Scheme and Ponzi Claims The use of an OTC scheme as the vehicle for the alleged crypto fraud is a key aspect of this case. OTC trading involves direct deals between two parties, often for large amounts of crypto, without the oversight and transparency of a centralized exchange. While legitimate OTC desks exist, the lack of public visibility can also make them susceptible to misuse for illicit activities. The specific claims suggest that funds from new deposits were allegedly used to fulfill obligations or promises made to earlier participants in the scheme. This circular flow of money, dependent on continuous recruitment of new investors, is the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme. If true, this would represent a severe breach of trust and financial malfeasance. Self Chain’s Response and Leadership Transition In response to the serious allegations against Ravindra Kumar, Self Chain has taken decisive action. The project officially announced the termination of Kumar’s employment as CEO. This move signals the project’s attempt to distance itself from the alleged misconduct and address the concerns raised by the community and investors. Alongside the termination, Self Chain communicated that a leadership transition is underway. While specific details about the new leadership structure or interim appointments may still be emerging, the announcement indicates the project is moving to establish new governance and direction following this upheaval. This period of transition will be critical for Self Chain as it navigates the fallout from these accusations. Former CEO Denies Allegations It is important to note that Ravindra Kumar has publicly denied the accusations leveled against him. He has reportedly described the claims as “completely false.” In cases involving serious financial allegations, denials are common, and the truth often emerges through further investigation or legal processes. The differing accounts highlight the need for clarity and due process. Implications for the Blockchain News and Community This incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks that can exist within the cryptocurrency space, particularly in less transparent areas like certain OTC dealings. It underscores the importance of: Due Diligence: Investors must conduct thorough research before committing funds, understanding who they are dealing with and the nature of the investments. Transparency: Projects should strive for high levels of transparency in their operations and leadership. Vigilance: The community needs to remain vigilant and question activities that seem too good to be true or lack clear explanations. The unfolding situation at Self Chain is a significant piece of blockchain news that the industry will be watching closely. The project’s ability to navigate this crisis, maintain trust, and move forward under new leadership will be crucial for its future. Conclusion The removal of Self Chain’s CEO, Ravindra Kumar, over severe $50 million crypto fraud allegations marks a challenging moment for the project. The claims, suggesting a Ponzi-like OTC scheme, highlight potential risks in the digital asset space. While the former CEO denies the accusations, Self Chain is undergoing a critical leadership transition. This event serves as a powerful cautionary tale for both projects and participants in the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing the perpetual need for integrity and caution.

This article uncovers the reasons behind significant investments in Ethereum and Bitcoin during this sell-off. Dive in to discover which digital assets are primed for growth and why these influential investors are betting big on these cryptocurrencies. Ethereum Market Snapshot: Recent Trends and Key Levels Ethereum 's price has slid over the past month by roughly 10.84% and dropped by 35.61% over the half-year period. The price has ranged between about $1923.57 and $2961.91, signaling consistent downward pressure over recent cycles. A week-long fall of 11.71% reflects the sustained bearish influence in the market. Volatility has been heightened by negative momentum measures. The Relative Strength Index sits at 35.03, suggesting weakening buying power and the presence of selling pressure over longer intervals. Price currently trades within a tight band with nearest support at $1318.71 and resistance at $3395.40. Price action remains unsettled without a clear upward trend, as bears currently dominate market sentiment. Trading strategies may include watching for price bounces near the support level before testing resistance. Cautious buying near support with proper risk management could be beneficial, while scalping or taking short-term positions within this range may prove effective until sustained momentum shifts and bulls gain control. Bitcoin Price Review and Trading Outlook Bitcoin experienced a varied performance over the past month and six months with a slight dip in the short term and modest gains over the longer period. The coin dropped by around 5.48% during the last month and showed a decline of approximately 3.91% over just one week, indicating some short-term pressure. In contrast, the six-month change moved up by roughly 2.82%, showing that Bitcoin has maintained ground and slowly gained momentum despite recent pullbacks. These numbers point to a period of consolidation with mixed signals in its price performance across different time frames. The current price range has Bitcoin trading between roughly $94,832 and $113,326.8, bounded by key levels that can shape future price moves. The nearest support level sits at about $84,880.08 while the nearest resistance hovers around $121,869.42. Technical indicators like the Awesome Oscillator at -3281.437 and Momentum Indicator at -4654.76 lean towards bearish sentiment, although the Relative Strength Index at 39.83 suggests the coin is nearing oversold territory. There is no clear trend at this point, leaving room for range-bound trading. Traders might consider entering positions near support levels while remaining cautious of resistance zones that could limit upward moves. Conclusion ETH and BTC remain top choices for large investors even during the sell-off. Whales likely see value in both coins due to their foundational roles in the market. These assets have shown resilience and potential for future growth. Buying during the dip could be a strategic move for long-term gains. This trend indicates continued confidence in the prospects of ETH and BTC. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin whale, just announced its latest move, further solidifying its position as the largest corporate holder of the digital asset. If you’re following the world of Bitcoin investment, especially institutional moves, this news is significant. Understanding MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy For years, MicroStrategy has been a pioneer among publicly traded companies adopting Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Led by its executive chairman, Michael Saylor, the company embarked on this journey with a clear vision: to acquire and hold Bitcoin for the long term, viewing it as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies. This MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy isn’t just about buying dips; it’s a fundamental shift in how a corporation manages its capital. Instead of holding cash that might depreciate due to inflation, MicroStrategy leverages various financing methods, including debt and equity offerings, to acquire more Bitcoin. The Latest Bitcoin Holdings Update On June 22, Michael Saylor took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the latest figures on MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings . The company added another 245 BTC to its stash. Here are the key takeaways from the announcement: Latest Purchase: 245 BTC Cost of Latest Purchase: Approximately $26 million Total Holdings: A staggering 592,345 BTC Average Acquisition Price: $70,681 per BTC Year-to-Date Return: 19.2% on their Bitcoin holdings This recent acquisition, though smaller than some previous buys, demonstrates MicroStrategy’s consistent approach to BTC accumulation, regardless of market volatility. They continue to buy whenever strategic opportunities arise. Michael Saylor’s Vision and BTC Accumulation At the heart of MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy is Michael Saylor himself. A staunch advocate for Bitcoin, Saylor views it as digital gold and a hedge against inflation. His conviction has not only shaped MicroStrategy’s treasury policy but has also inspired many other corporations and investors to consider Bitcoin. Saylor’s public commentary often focuses on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and its role in a global digital economy. His consistent messaging and the company’s actions provide a case study in corporate adoption of a non-sovereign, decentralized asset. This makes him a central figure when discussing corporate Michael Saylor and his influence on Bitcoin’s trajectory. Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy MicroStrategy’s bold Corporate Bitcoin Strategy has several significant impacts: Market Confidence: Large, public purchases signal confidence in Bitcoin to other institutional and retail investors. Validation: It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate treasuries. Price Influence: While not the sole driver, MicroStrategy’s consistent buying adds significant demand to the market. Setting a Precedent: They have paved the way and provided a blueprint for other companies considering similar moves. The fact that MicroStrategy continues to acquire Bitcoin, even at higher price levels, suggests a strong belief in its future appreciation and long-term value proposition. What Does This Mean for Investors? MicroStrategy’s actions offer insights for investors: Long-Term Perspective: The strategy emphasizes holding Bitcoin for the long haul, weathering market cycles. Conviction: It highlights the importance of conviction in your investment thesis. Macro View: The strategy is driven by a macro view of currency debasement and the need for sound money. While retail investors may not have the same capital structure as a corporation, the underlying philosophy of treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value resonates across different investor types. Looking Ahead With nearly 600,000 BTC under its belt, MicroStrategy’s balance sheet is now heavily tied to Bitcoin’s performance. Their success (or lack thereof) will continue to be closely watched as a barometer for corporate crypto adoption. As long as Michael Saylor remains at the helm and the company’s strategy holds, we can likely expect further announcements of BTC accumulation. The journey of MicroStrategy and its massive Bitcoin holdings is far from over. Each purchase adds another layer to this unfolding story of corporate conviction in the digital age.

Applicants must show detailed control systems, including asset security and AML compliance, and prove their ability to operate across jurisdictions. The HKMA references global regulatory frameworks, including FSB guidelines, to structure its supervisory approach. Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Chief Executive Eddie Yue outlined new expectations for stablecoin issuers under the city’s upcoming licensing regime, in a statement published on June 20. The ordinance establishing the framework, passed by the Legislative Council in May, takes effect on August 1. Yue said only a small number of issuers would be licensed initially, citing the need for “real-world use cases” and operational capacity. Hong Kong to Limit Stablecoin Licenses “Licensees must operate in a prudent and sustainable manner,” Yue said. “Building trust with market participants will be essential.” Applicants must prove they have strong controls for reserve management, price stability, asset protection, and anti-money-laundering, and that they are ready to follow the rules wherever their stablecoins are used. From a supervisory standpoint, Yue said the HKMA is aligning with international standards, referencing work led by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). He also noted that stablecoins carry features that raise cross-border and anonymity-related risks, requiring ongoing international coordination. “Given that stablecoins are an emerging product, the issuance business involves inherent risks, user protection considerations, and market capacity concerns. As such, the licensing regime will have a relatively high entry bar,” said Yue. “We anticipate issuing only a limited number of licences during the initial phase,” he said. The HKMA and PBoC are thrilled to announce the launch of Payment Connect, a collaborative initiative between HK’s FPS and Mainland’s IBPS, which enables a secure, efficient and convenient way for real-time cross-boundary remittances. pic.twitter.com/e6UgrZunxa — HKMA 香港金融管理局 (@hkmagovhk) June 20, 2025 Global Frameworks and Compliance Push Yue reiterated that stablecoins are not intended to function as investment tools. Instead, they are one of several emerging options for digital settlement, alongside central bank digital currencies and tokenized deposits. The statement also confirmed that participation in the HKMA’s sandbox is neither a requirement for applying nor a guarantee of license approval. All applicants will be evaluated under the same regulatory criteria. While the ordinance establishes Hong Kong’s initial oversight structure, Yue said future adjustments will consider market capacity and user protection needs. He added that the licensing regime would be enforced with “rigor and prudence.” How stablecoins will operate alongside CBDCs and bank-issued tokens remains unresolved. Authorities are still assessing legal status, interoperability, and potential risks across systems with different regulatory models. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could stablecoins be used for payments across different regulatory zones? Yes, but issuers must demonstrate compliance with local regulations wherever their tokens circulate, making legal and operational preparation essential. What are the common reserve models used by stablecoin issuers? Issuers may hold reserves in fiat currency, short-term government bonds, or other low-risk assets. The composition and custody of these reserves affect stability, transparency, and redemption reliability. How do redemption mechanisms impact stablecoin trust? Clear and timely redemption processes are central to user confidence. Delays or opaque procedures can lead to price instability or loss of peg, especially during periods of stress.

Volatility Shares launched two crypto-linked Solana ETFs (i.e., not spot Solana products) - the Solana ETF and the 2x Solana ETF - on March 20, 2025. Currently, eight issuers have filed S-1s for spot Solana ETFs: VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and CoinShares. The SEC has initiated its typical review process with issuers over their spot Solana ETFs filings, which means that approval of spot Solana ETFs is imminent - possibly within the next few weeks. General consensus among analysts and the broad public is optimistic on approval. Polymarket puts the possibility of Solana ETF approval at 91% in 2025 and at 68% by July 31. If approved, a spot Solana ETF would provide regulated access to Solana through brokerage platforms without the complexities of crypto wallets or crypto exchanges. It could also pave the way for broader institutional adoption and inclusion in diversified basket ETFs alongside bitcoin and ether. Here’s what advisors and investors need to know about the potential products and issuers involved. Solana Potentially the Next Spot Altcoin ETF Solana ( SOL-USD ) is a blockchain platform that is generally faster and cheaper than Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). According to CoinMarketCap, Solana is currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency, with around 2.4% market share in the overall cryptocurrency sector. Futures-Based Solana ETFs Have Relatively High Inflows Volatility Shares launched two crypto -linked Solana ETFs (i.e., not spot Solana products) - the Solana ETF ( SOLZ ) and the 2x Solana ETF ( SOLT ) - on March 20, 2025. SOLZ currently has almost $20 million in assets, while the leveraged SOLT has almost $45 million. While $20 million in the non-leveraged SOLZ product doesn’t seem like a lot, those assets are already in the same ballpark as the third and fourth-largest spot ether products: the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( ETH ) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund ( FETH ) which have just over $20 million each. And YTD, SOLZ actually has some of the highest net inflows relative to other altcoin products. 8 Issuers Have Filed S-1s for Spot Solana ETFs Currently, eight issuers have filed S-1s for spot Solana ETFs: VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and CoinShares. VanEck Solana ETF (VSOL) – link to S-1 21Shares Core Solana ETF (no ticker) – link to S-1 Canary Marinade Solana ETF (no ticker) – link to S-1 Bitwise Solana ETF (no ticker) – link to S-1 Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) – link to S-1 Franklin Solana Trust (SOEZ) – link to S-1 Fidelity Solana Fund (no ticker) – link to S-1 CoinShares Solana ETF (no ticker) – link to S-1 Out of the usual players, all issuers who currently have spot bitcoin and spot ether ETFs have filed for an S-1 except for BlackRock (iShares) and Invesco Galaxy. Invesco Galaxy has taken some early steps toward a Solana ETF, but has not yet officially filed an S-1. Simultaneous Product Launches Can Benefit Larger Issuers The SEC has traditionally launched similar crypto products simultaneously rather than on a rolling basis. In other words, all spot bitcoin ETFs were launched on the same day and all spot ether ETFs were launched on the same day despite different filing dates. Following this precedent, Solana products will likely be launched on the same day. The reason for the above has to do with several factors. First of all, it was assumed to “level the playing field” and provide opportunities to all issuers to start off on the same foot. It also simplifies the SEC’s internal review process, especially for novel asset classes like cryptocurrencies, where legal, technical , and compliance issues require ongoing dialogue across multiple filers. But this process has historically benefited larger, well-known issuers. During both bitcoin and ether launches, BlackRock and Fidelity products gained significantly more assets than smaller competitors. When faced with the choice of almost identical products with identical fees, advisors and investors are likely to choose by name recognition, which gives larger asset managers an edge over smaller or lesser-known issuers. Several Early Issuers Urge SEC to Reconsider “First to File” Model On June 5, several issuers including VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital submitted a joint letter to the SEC asking them to return to the “first to file” approval model. They argue that simultaneous launches take away incentive for early filers and, by default, take away motivation to innovate and develop new products. VanEck has traditionally been an early filer. They were the first ETF issuer to file for a bitcoin futures ETF and a spot Solana ETF. They were also one of the first issuers to launch a crypto equity ETF. In the case of Solana, Fidelity filed much later than most of the other issuers, but has the potential to gain the most assets due to its brand recognition and scale. While BlackRock has not yet filed for a Solana ETF, it is possible they could also throw their hat into the ring, which could further skew potential assets for the current issuers. Staking Will Potentially Be Included in Solana ETFs… & More Filings for Solana ETFs have included provisions for staking. Staking is an important part of Solana’s investment appeal. According to Coinbase, the yield on Solana is over 5%, while the APY of ether is closer to 2%. When spot ether ETFs were launched last year, they had to remove language about staking. Now they have filed again after the fact. The SEC seems more supportive of staking, according to a statement released on May 29. This shift in regulatory stance suggests that the SEC may approve staking provisions in both Ethereum and Solana ETFs simultaneously, potentially as early as this summer, which would align these ETFs more closely with their underlying crypto assets. Issuers Actively Filing for Several Other Altcoin ETFs Out of the eight issuers filing for Solana ETFs, Grayscale has the most active filings with the SEC (mostly conversions), followed by Canary Capital. Grayscale: Grayscale Litecoin Trust , Grayscale XRP Trust , Grayscale Dogecoin Trust , Grayscale Avalanche Trust , Grayscale Cardano Trust , Grayscale Polkadot Trust , Grayscale Hedera Trust , conversion for the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GLDC) Canary Capital: Canary XRP ETF , Canary HBAR ETF , Canary Litecoin ETF , Canary SUI ETF , Canary Staked TRX ETF , Canary Staked CRO ETF 21Shares: 21Shares Core XRP Trust , Polkadot , 21Shares Dogecoin ETF , 21Shares SUI ETF Bitwise: Bitwise XRP ETF , Bitwise Dogecoin ETF , conversion for the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ( BITW ) CoinShares: CoinShares XRP ETF , CoinShares Litecoin ETF VanEck: VanEck Avalanche ETF , VanEck BNB ETF Franklin: Franklin XRP ETF Fidelity: N/A Potential Spot Solana ETF Issuers Have Wide Range of Existing Crypto Assets For reference, here is the current standing of products for the eight issuers discussed. All of these issuers except for Canary Capital already have crypto ETFs (Canary has institutional funds available). Disclosure: © VettaFi LLC 2025. All rights reserved.

Investors Say Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) Audited Token Will Leave Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the Dust,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/best-cheap-tokens-this-summer-investors-say-ruvi-ais-ruvi-audited-token-will-leave-shiba-inu-shib-in-the-dust,"Shiba Inu has gained fame as one of the top meme coins in the crypto market. However, as more investors seek long-term gains and real-world utility, many are turning their attention to Ruvi AI (RUVI). This AI-powered blockchain project is catching headlines for its structured growth model, transparency, and the potential for an astonishing 66x ROI post-listing. Why Ruvi AI Is Outshining Shiba Inu Shiba Inu’s popularity largely stems from social media buzz and the backing of a passionate community. While this has driven market performance in the past, the coin lacks tangible utility and a clear roadmap for sustained growth. By contrast, Ruvi AI delivers real-world functionality, leveraging blockchain and AI technologies to address pressing needs across marketing, entertainment, and finance industries. One of Ruvi AI’s standout features is its predictable and structured growth plan. Investors can currently acquire RUVI tokens during the Phase 2 presale at just $0.015 per token. After the presale ends, the token price will lock in at $0.07, offering an almost 5x ROI before it even hits public trading. Analysts forecast that RUVI could reach a valuation of $1 post-listing, translating to a 66x ROI for early buyers. Presale Success Reflects Ruvi AI’s Potential The Ruvi AI presale marks a turning point in the project’s roadmap, demonstrating growing confidence and strong investor interest. To date, it boasts the following achievements: $1.9 million raised, indicating that investor enthusiasm is high. More than 160 million tokens sold, highlighting significant demand. A thriving holder community of over 1,600 investors, showing steady growth in support. The guaranteed post-presale price of $0.07 sets Ruvi AI apart, offering stability and transparency that attract both new and experienced investors. Unlock More Value Through Ruvi AI’s VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI provides structured opportunities for even greater returns through its VIP investment tiers, which reward higher contributions with generous bonuses. Here’s how the tiers work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000.

These VIP options offer an incredible opportunity for investors to secure exponential returns while supporting a project with proven growth potential. Security and Transparency Set Ruvi AI Apart One of the key reasons why Ruvi AI is leaving Shiba Inu in the dust is its commitment to security and transparency. The project has undergone a rigorous third-party audit conducted by CyberScope, ensuring that its ecosystem is secure and technically sound. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures post-presale liquidity. Investors can trade RUVI tokens as soon as they’re listed, providing fast and smooth access to potential gains. These measures give investors peace of mind and reduce the risks often associated with newer tokens. Practical Applications Boost Long-Term Utility Unlike meme coins such as Shiba Inu that rely on hype, Ruvi AI has clear use cases that create sustained demand for its tokens. Examples of these applications include: Marketing: Businesses utilize Ruvi AI’s AI-driven tools to refine their ad strategies, improve ROI, and better target their audiences. Entertainment: Content creators benefit from AI-powered personalization and blockchain-secured payments that enhance audience engagement and revenue streams. Finance: Ruvi AI supports financial institutions with fraud detection, operational scalability, and transparent blockchain-powered solutions, improving efficiency and reducing costs. These real-world applications provide unparalleled value, setting RUVI tokens apart as more than just a speculative asset. Why Ruvi AI Is the Best Cheap Token This Summer Meme coins like Shiba Inu may draw the spotlight, but Ruvi AI’s combination of utility, innovation, and structured growth provides an investment opportunity that’s hard to beat. With $1.9 million raised, over 160 million tokens sold, and partnerships with trusted entities like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange, Ruvi AI is rapidly becoming one of the most promising projects this summer. Priced at just $0.015 per token during its presale phase, Ruvi AI offers unparalleled potential. If you’re looking for a token that blends high growth with transparency and utility, Ruvi AI is the clear winner.

The Delaware court overseeing FTX’s bankruptcy gave 3AC’s liquidators permission to expand their claim earlier this year, bumping it up significantly from their original claim of $120 million. This came after 3AC’s lawyers allegedly discovered new evidence suggesting that FTX had liquidated $1.53 billion of 3AC’s assets two weeks before the hedge fund started its own liquidation proceedings in June 2022. FTX’s lawyers say the liquidation of 3AC’s assets on its platform was carried out to satisfy a loan to FTX — but 3AC’s lawyers pushed back, arguing that the loan to FTX wasn’t sufficiently documented or otherwise substantiated. The bankruptcy court sided with 3AC, finding insufficient evidence to support FTX’s claim of a loan. In the most recent filing, lawyers for FTX’s estate said that on June 12, 2022 the actual value of assets in 3AC’s accounts was only $284 million — $1.017 billion in digital assets and negative $733 million in US dollars. They also added that the “first and only” liquidation of 3AC’s assets ordered by FTX was on June 14, 2022, and swapped $82 million in crypto for cash — a move they argued “actually benefitted 3AC (not FTX).” “The Joint Liquidators grossly inflate the actual $284 million value of assets associated with the 3AC Accounts on June 12, 2022 by more than $1.2 billion, and they ignore that the entire loss in account value resulted from market price declines and 3AC’s own withdrawals, not any action taken by FTX,” the bankrupt exchange’s lawyers wrote. “The Joint Liquidators ask this Court to force other Exchange customers and creditors to foot the bill for 3AC’s failed strategy by asserting illogical and baseless claims for $1.53 billion… [T]his is a false premise that lacks any legal or factual merit, and, in fact, 3AC is owed nothing,” the lawyers added. FTX, which was at one time one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, filed for bankruptcy protection shortly after its collapse in November 2022 . The exchange's recovery trust started distributing $5 billion to FTX creditors in May . 3AC collapsed in June 2022, one month after the collapse of the Terra/LUNA ecosystem, starting a domino-like collapse of major crypto companies including Voyager, Celsius, BlockFi and Genesis. 3AC has until July 11 to file an objection before the hearing set for August 12.",Policy|US|FTX|Three Arrows Capital|News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-23 17:45:39

Yet, as the market evolves, serious investors are increasingly aligning with tokens that offer not only profitability but also pragmatic utility in real-world applications. Ruvi AI, known for its integration of AI and blockchain technology, presents such an opportunity. Introducing Ruvi AI - A Game Changer in Crypto Investment Ruvi AI is quickly becoming a beacon for investors focused on long-term value. This token, backed by solid technological advancements in AI, offers a robust roadmap for sustained growth and utility beyond mere speculation. Assessing the Potential: A Comparative Look at Shiba Inu and Ruvi AI Unlike Shiba Inu which soared to fame through a combination of community support and viral marketing, Ruvi AI is carving a niche by addressing key aspects of marketing, entertainment, and finance through decentralized solutions. This approach not only enhances the token’s practical value but also stabilizes its market position. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out in the Crypto Market Ruvi AI not only excels with its practical applications but also with its strategic presale phases that promise significant returns. During its Phase 2 presale, RUVI tokens were available for just $0.015 per token. Post-presale, this price is anticipated to jump to $0.07, marking nearly a fivefold increase prior to public trading. Moreover, projections suggest a leap to $1 per token post-listing, potentially yielding a 66x return on early investments. Security and Trust: Ruvi AI’s Commitment Ruvi AI’s dedication to security is demonstrated through its comprehensive audit by CyberScope and its partnership with WEEX Exchange for guaranteed liquidity post-presale. These measures ensure that Ruvi AI is not only a promising investment but also a secure one. Exclusive Investment Opportunities with Ruvi AI Ruvi AI also offers attractive investment tiers for those looking to maximize their investment. For instance, VIP Tier 2 investors who commit $750 receive a 40% bonus, dramatically increasing their potential earnings. Amplify Your Investment with VIP Tiers VIP investment tiers provide substantial bonuses propelling investor returns upwards: VIP Tier 2: Invest $750 to receive 70,000 tokens, which could equate to $70,000 if tokens reach $1. VIP Tier 3: With a $2,100 investment, receive 224,000 tokens. VIP Tier 5: For a higher stake of $9,600, investors receive double the tokens, potentially increasing returns to over $1 million as token prices ascend.

Posted yesterday, the analysis reaffirms the long-standing forecast shared within Dark Defender’s private analysis group, “the Chambers at the Dark’s Side.” According to the post , XRP’s $1.88 support level, which was highlighted in advance, has effectively held its ground, aligning with prior predictions and reinforcing the credibility of the analyst’s charting. The attached chart shows XRP maintaining a clear Elliott Wave pattern within a broader ascending channel. Notably, the “C Wave,” which had previously bounced at $2.08, remains a focal point. Dark Defender notes that this bounce occurred very close to the $2.07 Fibonacci support level, which is consistent with the projected technical indicators. However, despite the bounce, the analysis allows room for further downside. The chart explicitly outlines that the C Wave could decline as far as $1.95, representing a potential flash crash zone that remains within the expected correction framework. Nothing has changed on the #XRP side. $1.88 support I shared yesterday with you worked today. We knew this was coming and discussed it in detail in our Chambers at the Dark's Side. Again, the charts were ahead of the news! XRP still maintains the Monthly Wave 5 Structure.… pic.twitter.com/9KJlOgJbi1 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) June 22, 2025 C Wave Retracement Zone Remains Active The possibility of a decline to $1.95 is not presented as a sudden development but rather as an anticipated movement that aligns with Fibonacci retracement levels. As illustrated in the chart, the region between $1.926 and $2.07 comprises a strong confluence of historical support zones. Support Trend 2, which runs diagonally beneath the wave pattern, further confirms the strength of the current technical foundation, even in the event of a downward extension of the C Wave. This outlook is consistent with Dark Defender’s previous statements that the technical chart formations are often predictive and not reactive to news. The latest update continues to support that thesis, stating that “the charts were ahead of the news.” This stance reinforces the analyst’s long-held view that XRP’s market movements are strongly guided by established technical cycles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Monthly Wave 5 Structure Still Intact Despite short-term volatility, the analyst emphasizes that XRP’s larger structural integrity remains unaffected. The monthly Wave 5 pattern, which signifies the final leg in an extended upward Elliott Wave sequence, is reportedly still in place. This wave suggests the potential for a larger bullish move upon the completion of current corrections, especially if the $1.95 support ultimately proves to be the low of this retracement. The confirmation of the support holding at $1.88, in conjunction with the longer-term bullish structure, signals that no fundamental shift has occurred in the broader technical outlook. Dark Defender assures followers that the forecasted path remains valid, with no alteration to the previously identified targets or formation. Community Sentiment and Validation An X user, Jeff Gold, responded to the post with a personal note on the effort involved in aligning with these forecasts. Gold remarked on the discipline required to distinguish legitimate technical patterns, saying, “Don’t let people tell you it was luck. You worked for it so be proud.” This response highlights the commitment of many retail analysts and traders who closely monitor and apply technical models in real time. Dark Defender’s update continues to reinforce XRP’s bullish long-term structure while providing a cautionary outlook for probable near-term retracements. The $1.88 and $1.95 levels are framed as key zones within a healthy technical cycle, and the larger upward trend remains valid under the current wave model.

With forecasts of over 13,600% ROI, Ruvi AI offers a structured growth model, real-world utility, and a presale success record that demonstrates its strong foundation. Why Ruvi AI Is a Better Option Amid Bitcoin Volatility Bitcoin’s value often fluctuates due to macroeconomic factors and market sentiment, making it a risky choice for those seeking predictable returns. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, provides blockchain-integrated AI solutions for industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance, ensuring consistent demand for its token, RUVI. What truly sets Ruvi AI apart is its structured growth plan, which offers clear milestones and transparency. Investors can buy RUVI tokens for just $0.015 each during Phase 2 of the presale.

Some of the key achievements include: Over $1.9 million raised, showing strong investor interest. More than 160 million tokens sold, underlining robust demand. A growing community of over 1,600 holders, demonstrating widespread support. Thanks to the presale’s guaranteed $0.07 valuation, investors can feel assured about the token’s steady growth trajectory.

For those navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies and traditional markets alike, understanding these geopolitical shifts is crucial. The ongoing Israel Iran conflict is one such event, creating ripples that extend far beyond the immediate region and potentially influencing investor sentiment and market stability. Recent reports from sources like the WSJ indicate that Israel has continued its targeted actions against Iranian military sites. The stated aim from Israeli officials is to conclude this phase of the conflict relatively quickly, suggesting a desire to de-escalate while still addressing perceived threats. What’s the Latest on the Israel Iran Conflict? The situation remains fluid, but key developments paint a picture of targeted actions and international scrutiny. Here’s a breakdown: Targeted Strikes: Israel has reportedly focused on hitting specific military infrastructure within Iran. This approach appears aimed at limiting broader escalation while demonstrating capability and resolve. Swift Conclusion Sought: Officials have expressed a hope for a rapid end to the current exchange, indicating a potential window for de-escalation if conditions permit. International Concern: Global bodies and nations are closely monitoring the situation, urging restraint from all sides to prevent a wider regional conflict. These actions are part of a long-standing rivalry, but the recent direct exchanges have heightened concerns about the potential for a more significant confrontation, impacting global stability . Concerns Mount Over Iran Nuclear Program Facilities Adding another layer of complexity to the situation are concerns surrounding Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Rafael Grossi, the head of the U.N. atomic agency (IAEA), recently commented on the potential impact of recent actions on Iranian nuclear sites. Specifically, Grossi noted that strikes could have caused significant damage to facilities like the Fordow enrichment plant. Fordow is a particularly sensitive site due to its location deep underground, making it difficult to target and raising proliferation concerns. The status of the Iran nuclear program is a major point of tension internationally. Any damage or perceived threat to these facilities elevates the geopolitical risk assessment for the entire region and potentially globally. Monitoring the rhetoric and actions surrounding these sites is crucial for understanding the potential trajectory of the conflict. Why Does Middle East Tension Matter for Global Markets? For investors, including those in the crypto space, developments in the Middle East are not isolated events. Increased Middle East tension directly contributes to higher geopolitical risk . Here’s how this tension can ripple through markets: Impact Area Explanation Oil Prices The Middle East is a major oil-producing region. Conflict can disrupt supply or create fears of disruption, leading to price spikes. Higher energy costs impact global economies. Safe-Haven Assets Periods of uncertainty often see investors flock to traditional safe havens like gold or government bonds, sometimes drawing capital away from riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Investor Confidence Heightened tension and unpredictability erode investor confidence, potentially leading to increased volatility and sell-offs across various asset classes. Supply Chains Conflict can disrupt shipping lanes and trade routes, impacting global supply chains and contributing to inflation or economic slowdowns. While cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, they are not immune to macro-economic forces and shifts in global sentiment driven by events like the Israel Iran conflict . Increased fear or uncertainty can trigger risk-off sentiment, affecting crypto prices. Navigating Geopolitical Risk in Volatile Times Understanding geopolitical risk is a key part of navigating any market, especially one as dynamic as cryptocurrency. While you cannot predict geopolitical events, you can be aware of their potential impact. Actionable insights for navigating this environment: Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources covering international relations and their economic implications. Assess Your Portfolio: Consider how increased volatility might affect your specific holdings. Long-Term Perspective: For many investors, maintaining a long-term perspective through short-term geopolitical noise is key. Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your risk tolerance, taking into account potential external shocks. The situation involving the Iran nuclear program and the broader Middle East tension underscores the interconnectedness of global events and financial markets. Conclusion: Monitoring Global Stability Amidst Conflict The latest developments in the Israel Iran conflict highlight the fragility of global stability . While Israel expresses a desire for a swift resolution to the current exchange, concerns surrounding sensitive sites like the Fordow enrichment facility and the overall status of the Iran nuclear program persist. These factors contribute significantly to regional and global geopolitical risk . For participants in financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space, staying abreast of these tensions and understanding their potential ripple effects is vital. Geopolitical events can introduce unexpected volatility and influence broader market sentiment. As the situation unfolds, continued vigilance and informed decision-making remain paramount.

46630132,https://coinpaper.com/9672/solana-slips-below-135-as-oil-shock-spooks-crypto-traders,1750701237,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Solana Slips Below $135 as Oil Shock Spooks Crypto Traders,https://coinpaper.com/9672/solana-slips-below-135-as-oil-shock-spooks-crypto-traders,"The crypto market plunged as U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites sparked a wave of risk aversion. Will Solana’s Bull Flag Setup Materialize? According to market analyst Tektonic, “Solana is currently trading near $133.71 and testing the lower boundary of a descending channel — a structure often associated with bullish continuation patterns. After a sharp impulse move, the asset has been consolidating with lower highs, forming a classic bull flag setup.” The analyst added that a confirmation above the flag resistance would play an instrumental role in validating the bullish continuation with price action suggesting that the target was the $230 to $240 region. Meanwhile, Solana futures open interest recently hit $7.4 billion amid exchange-traded fund (ETF) rumors going through the roof. But how did Solana find itself below the psychological price of $135? Well, apart from the U.S. military strikes causing a sell off in the crypto market, traders became worried that even a temporary closure of the Strait of Hormuz could spike oil prices, fuel inflation, and delay Fed rate cuts—deepening the risk-off sentiment hammering crypto. Notably, direct waterway invasion might accelerate an altcoin sell-off because Bitcoin dominance typically surges in times of geopolitical unrest. Therefore, Solana will need to hold the $133 zone to avoid a drop to the $123 area with the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator already in bear territory. The CMF indicator shows the buying and selling pressure of an asset over a specific period, helping traders identify potential trend strength and reversals. A negative CMF illustrates selling pressure since bears are dominant, illustrating that Solana is not out of the woods yet. Why Solana Still Tops Blockchains in Active Addresses & Transactions Solana has firmly established itself as the most-used layer-1 blockchain globally in 2025, consistently surpassing competitors like Ethereum in both daily active addresses and transaction volume. Recent data shows Solana routinely reaching 2.7 to 5.6 million daily active addresses and processing an astonishing 85 to 109 million transactions per day—approximately 10× more active users and 80–100× more transactions than Ethereum mainnet.. One key driver? Blazing speed and ultra-low fees. Solana processes blocks in just 400–600 ms, with transaction costs as low as $0.00025—nearly free compared to Ethereum’s ~$0.05 per transaction . This combination makes it ideal for high-volume retail activity , including DeFi trading, NFT minting, and memecoin launches, where users can create and interact with smart contracts at minimal cost. Moreover, Solana’s ecosystem growth has fueled this surge. DeFi protocols on Solana host over $12 billion in total value locked (TVL), and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) regularly handle billions in daily trade volume—recently hitting nearly $3 billion over just 24 hours. Equally notable is social media traction: Solana sees around 45 million social engagements weekly, nearly double Ethereum’s tally. Network architecture also plays a major role. Unlike Ethereum’s monolithic proof‑of‑stake setup, Solana uses Proof‑of‑History + PBFT, enabling high throughput without sacrificing decentralization—the network supports over 1,400 mainnet validators and more than 5,000 nodes across 46 countries. The developer community—working in Rust and TypeScript—is further empowered by user‑friendly frameworks like Anchor and no‑code NFT tools, fostering rapid dApp deployment. Solana’s dominance is especially evident in comparative metrics: one weekly snapshot recorded 26.5 million active addresses in a single seven‑day window—outpacing chains like BNB, Tron, and Base by a landslide. And with monthly new addresses ranging from 100–150 million against Ethereum’s 3–5 million, it's clear that users are flocking to Solana. Of course, high activity doesn’t always equate to high value per address. Much of the volume stems from bot-driven interactions and micro-transactions. Yet this speculative energy—especially around memecoins—has catalyzed real adoption and thrilling on-chain commerce . Conclusion Solana’s combination of raw performance, low-cost access, developer momentum, and retail interest has propelled it to the top. It remains the go‑to blockchain for users seeking fast, cheap, and frictionless interaction—a clear leader in active addresses and transaction volume heading into the latter half of 2025. Nevertheless, Solana will need to dust itself off so that it builds notable momentum needed to reclaim the psychological prices of $150 and $200.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-23 17:53:57
46630280,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/best-crypto-to-buy-now-traders-predict-kaanch-will-outperform-xrp-and-avax-in-the-next-18-months,1750701282,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/46630280.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now? Traders Predict Kaanch Will Outperform XRP and AVAX in the Next 18 Months,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/best-crypto-to-buy-now-traders-predict-kaanch-will-outperform-xrp-and-avax-in-the-next-18-months,"Kaanch is quickly becoming the best crypto to invest in the current market with the leading traders predicting a phenomenal rise of up to 14,900 percent in the next 18 months. This remarkable forecast makes Kaanch an outstanding candidate, which will outperform the already existing cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and Avalanche (AVAX), which have demonstrated rather poor price performance in recent times. Don’t Miss Out: Kaanch Poised to Eclipse XRP and AVAX with 14,900% Gains! At the present stage 7 of its presale, Kaanch is selling at a very attractive price of 0.64 dollars per token. The project has already attracted more than 2.4 million dollars, which indicates the high level of investor trust. Kaanch has a limited supply of 58 million tokens and live staking with APY of up to 30%, making it an interesting investment prospect to early investors. Notably, the following listings on the large exchanges, including BitMart, LBank and xT , are set at the price of 30 dollars per token, which indicates a strong potential of the price surge after the listing. Kaanch’s Lightning Speed Crushes XRP and AVAX—Here’s Why You Should Care Kaanch is the fastest and most scalable blockchain with a throughput of 1.4 million transactions per second (TPS) and a near-instant finality of 0.8 seconds, which allows trade execution and smart contract flows without any disruptions. This performance outstrips the capacity of XRP and AVAX, whose lower transaction speed and network constraints have not favored their price growth. Also, Kaanch has low gas fees that are nearly zero, which is very economical in decentralized applications (dApps), microtransactions, and payments. The network is highly decentralized with 3,600 active validators, which makes the network secure and trustless. Kaanch also focuses on asset tokenization in the real world, enterprise-readiness, and developer-friendly integration, which makes it a universal blockchain platform that can be massively adopted. XRP and AVAX Are Stagnating—Why Kaanch Is the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now Although XRP is a leader in cross-border payments, and AVAX is a multi-chain with fast transaction processing, both have their problems. XRP is mostly priced in with little upside potential and AVAX faces intense competition with Ethereum and a high staking requirement to become a validator. Conversely, the scalability, low fees, and real-world utility of Kaanch provide a basis of explosive growth. The best traders forecast that the price movement of Kaanch will outperform the XRP and AVAX due to its better infrastructure and advantage of being at an early stage of pricing. The leadership of the project is transparent and audited by SpyWolf and VerifyLab, which brings credibility and trust of investors. Act Fast: Kaanch’s Presale Price Won’t Last Before $30 Listing on BitMart, xT, and LBank! Those investors who want to know what is the best crypto to buy should visit the official Kaanch presale site to join this quickly moving opportunity. It is possible to buy it with ETH and USDT, and staking is possible to gain up to 30% APY in the presale period. At the current price of 0.64 and a fixed listing price of 30 on major exchanges, Kaanch is a unique opportunity to get in before a possible huge price explosion. The long-term value of the project is also boosted by the fact that it is asset-focused and community-based, with the ability to tokenize real-world assets and govern via community.

The repurchases will be conducted through open market transactions, with repurchased shares being retired by the company. TMTG’s CEO and Chairman, Devin Nunes, said the board took a vote of confidence in the company’s stock, strategic plans, and about $3B on the balance sheet. However, the timing and amount of the repurchases would be at Trump Media’s discretion, in compliance with relevant U.S. SEC rules and regulations. Nunez also explained that, sitting on $3B, the company had the flexibility to support such strong shareholder returns, as it continued exploring opportunities. He emphasized that these financial activities aimed to supply the capital needed for the company’s expansion and strategic growth. TMTG uses separate funds for share buybacks and Bitcoin treasury strategy 🇺🇸 LATEST: Trump Media $DJT authorizes $400M stock buyback, fully separate from its $2.3B Bitcoin treasury strategy, which remains unchanged. pic.twitter.com/TnIPkh7t4B — MrRebel.eth (@rebelethpromos) June 23, 2025 According to Trump Media , the share repurchase authorization would be funded separately from, and would not alter, the company’s previously announced Bitcoin treasury strategy, which featured a private placement offering of roughly $2.3 billion. The company said it would use $1.5 billion of the Bitcoin treasury fund in equity and about $1 billion in convertible notes to buy Bitcoin, with custody provided by Anchorage Digital and Crypto.com. Nunez called Bitcoin “a crown jewel” and explained that the board’s $400M stock buyback was meant to shield the company against what he described as “discrimination by financial institutions” against conservative businesses. He added that the funds will also support the launch of Trump-branded exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other crypto products pending regulatory approval later this year. It was a strategy popularized by Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (now Strategy) in 2020—but now turbocharged by Trump’s political connections and crypto allies. David Bailey, a trusted crypto advisor to the Trump administration, described the play as “strategy squared.” “Our total focus is on increasing the Bitcoin per share.” – David Bailey , Trump’s Crypto Policy Advisor Additionally, the company disclosed that it may, without prior notice, seek to repurchase its outstanding convertible notes in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. It will also retain broad discretion over the terms, prices, and factors applicable to such repurchases, if any. Trump Media confirms convertible notes buybacks remain active The company emphasized that its financial position supports the dual strategies. It also suggested that more steps may be taken in the future, as it explored additional financial moves, including the possible buybacks of convertible notes. Trump Media previously clarified that the buybacks were independently funded and would not interfere with one another. As part of its broader capital strategy, Trump Media also filed to register nearly 56 million equity shares and approximately 29 million shares tied to convertible notes for resale by investors. The company disclosed that it secured an additional $2.3 billion through debt and equity agreements with about 50 investors. Last week, Trump Media secured $100 million from DRW, a Chicago-based trading firm. The funds are part of a larger strategy to support the $2.3 billion Bitcoin allocation. The company has not confirmed how much Bitcoin it has acquired so far, but said it will continue executing its crypto plans over time. In addition to the investment, Trump Media also filed to launch a dual Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. The company disclosed that the ETF would allocate 75% of its assets to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum if approved. However, the company announced that the launch of the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF was pending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and the approval of a Form 19b-4 filing with the U.S. SEC. Trump Media shares (DJT) also rose more than 3% during early Monday trading. The price increased to $18.39 by mid-morning Eastern Time. The rise came after weeks of volatility in the stock, which has dropped over 50% since January. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Pepe Coin (PEPE) did the same thing two years later, capitalizing on meme culture and viral trends to deliver huge profits. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is now in the spotlight as a new competitor. Crypto insiders are keeping a careful eye on him. LILPEPE isn't just another frog-themed token trying to ride on PEPE's coattails. It has the right mix of internet appeal, strategic innovation, and solid early support. It aims to change the narrative about meme coins, and an increasing number of analysts and investors believe this new green coin could be the next one to generate substantial profits. The Legacy of SHIB and PEPE It's essential to recall how SHIB and PEPE initially caught the attention of the crypto community before discussing what makes Little Pepe unique. SHIB soon became popular because of a viral community and an Ethereum-based infrastructure. It was called the ""Dogecoin killer."" SHIB's market cap has grown from almost nothing to billions of dollars, and early investors have turned a few hundred dollars into shares worth six or seven figures. Then there was PEPE, the frog-faced meme that many people thought was just a gimmick. But PEPE became a force of its own, thanks to perfect timing, clever branding, and a cult-like following. It climbed to the top of the meme coin rankings, demonstrating that there was still a massive demand for cultural coins that resonate with the internet generation. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): More Than Just a Meme Launched on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token, LILPEPE brings the same meme magic as its predecessors—but backs it with actual infrastructure. It’s a project building a dedicated Layer 2 chain for meme tokens, setting itself apart from the countless clones that rely purely on marketing. What makes this Layer 2 unique? It’s specifically designed for fast and cheap transactions, but most importantly, it’s resistant to sniper bots—a chronic problem that often plagues meme coin launches. This feature alone has gained LILPEPE respect among both degens and serious investors alike, as it ensures fairer access and stability for holders during volatile periods. LILPEPE’s vision includes a meme-centric Launchpad, enabling other meme projects to build within its ecosystem. It’s not just creating a coin—it’s constructing a home for the next generation of meme assets. That level of innovation simply didn’t exist during SHIB or PEPE’s rise. Presale Frenzy and Exchange Listings Already in stage 3 of its presale, Little Pepe has raised over $1.57 million, with 1.45 billion tokens sold at the current price of $0.0012. The presale is accelerating quickly, and judging by the performance of earlier stages—which sold out in record time—this phase could also close much sooner than expected. Adding fuel to the fire is the confirmed listing of LILPEPE on two top centralized exchanges at launch, with plans in motion to debut on the world’s biggest crypto exchange shortly after. These listings are critical not just for liquidity, but for visibility, and that visibility often sparks the kinds of waves SHIB and PEPE experienced during their runs. To further engage the community and amplify exposure, the team has launched a massive $777,000 giveaway, in which 10 winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. This bold move has helped supercharge the community and draw new attention to the project as the presale heats up. Behind LILPEPE is a team of anonymous yet well-connected crypto experts who have helped engineer the success of past meme sensations. This isn’t just luck—it’s strategic execution from veterans who understand what it takes to create and sustain momentum for meme coins. Final Thoughts: A New Frog With Familiar Explosive Potential Little Pepe is following in the footsteps of giants, but it’s not doing so blindly. Where SHIB was the first to claim a meme-based Ethereum identity, and PEPE proved that frogs still reign supreme in internet lore, LILPEPE is setting out to blend meme culture with real blockchain innovation. With its ongoing presale gaining traction, confirmed exchange listings, an ambitious roadmap, and a record-breaking giveaway fueling attention, all signs point toward LILPEPE becoming the next major memecoin to shock the market. SHIB and PEPE had their time. Now, it appears that Little Pepe is poised to make its mark in crypto history.

Markets Heat Up Following Recent Tweet,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-elon-musk-save-pepe-markets-heat-up-following-recent-tweet/,"Elon Musk shared an image of Pepe the Frog on X, showing the meme character lighting a cigarette and looking worn out. The post quickly gained traction across crypto communities. Holders of tokens like PEPE, BabyDoge, and WIF jumped in, sharing mascot replies. Some users also tied the post’s timing to SpaceX’s Starship explosion in Texas, though no direct link was confirmed. Whatever the reason, the tweet has brought renewed focus to PEPE, a meme token that’s been struggling to hold a key support level. PEPE Tests Support After 8% Drop PEPE is trading around $0.000008743 after dropping 9.1% in the last 24 hours. Market watchers believe the coin could retest the $0.0000101 level, with a possible move to $0.000012 if sentiment improves. Right now, price action is forming a bullish flag pattern on the 8-hour chart—a structure often seen before upward continuation. The lower end of this pattern is acting as support. If it holds, buyers may step back in. But if it breaks, the recent rally could lose steam. PEPE’s current structure has traders split, with some calling this a setup for a rebound, while others are watching for more volume confirmation before making moves. PEPETO Draws Buyers with Practical Tools As PEPE trades sideways, a fresh contender is making waves. PEPETO , a new meme coin project, has raised more than $5.45 million in presale. Its current price stands at $0.000000136, and interest is growing fast. Unlike many meme coins, Pepeto adds actual functionality, making it a top pick for those searching for the best meme coin to buy. The project includes a working cross-chain bridge, a zero-fee exchange, and audited smart contracts. It also offers up to 280% in staking rewards, a system meant to promote holding rather than early selling. This approach is helping Pepeto stand out from meme tokens driven solely by hype. Investor Focus Shifts Toward Utility and Structure With meme coin investors looking beyond short-term pumps, Pepeto’s roadmap is gaining attention. Several centralized exchange listings are expected soon, adding momentum. This shift shows a growing appetite for tokens that offer both community appeal and working features. Investors eyeing the best crypto to buy in 2025 are starting to take Pepeto seriously. With a working staking system, transparent code, and zero trading fees, it’s becoming a practical option for those thinking long-term. PEPE, on the other hand, is holding attention, but traders are waiting for a clear signal before making a move. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto combines meme appeal with practical blockchain features, focusing on real user tools instead of hype. It offers zero-fee trading, staking rewards, and cross-chain support. With a clear roadmap and strong early backing, Pepeto stands out as a serious contender for those looking at top crypto picks for 2025.

When giants like BlackRock make a move, the market pays attention. This time, it involves their spot BlackRock ETHA fund and a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) heading to Coinbase . Let’s unpack what this recent ETH transfer signifies and what it could mean for the broader Institutional Crypto landscape. Decoding the BlackRock ETHA Fund’s Recent Ethereum Transfer According to on-chain data highlighted by Lookonchain, BlackRock’s spot BlackRock ETHA fund recently deposited a substantial amount of Ethereum to Coinbase Prime. Specifically, 8,172 ETH, valued at approximately $18.4 million at the time of the transfer, was moved. This action is particularly noteworthy because it appears to mark the first instance of the fund distributing or selling ETH after a period of consistent accumulation that lasted over a month. Institutional activity, especially from a player as large and influential as BlackRock, is often seen as a bellwether for market sentiment and potential future trends. Their previous consistent buying was interpreted as a bullish signal for Ethereum and the potential for growing institutional interest in ETH-based products. Why is BlackRock’s Move to Coinbase Significant? The destination of the ETH transfer is as important as the transfer itself. Moving funds to an exchange like Coinbase Prime, which caters specifically to institutional clients, often precedes selling activity or distribution. Here’s why this move captured attention: End of Accumulation: It signals a potential pause or shift from the fund’s previous strategy of steady buying. Potential Selling Pressure: Deposits to exchanges are typically made with the intent to sell, which could add selling pressure, albeit minor relative to the total market cap, to the Ethereum market. Profit Taking or Rebalancing: The transfer could represent the fund taking profits after a period of price appreciation or simply rebalancing its portfolio allocation. Market Signal: For many market observers, this move is interpreted as a signal, prompting questions about BlackRock’s short-term outlook on ETH or broader market conditions. Understanding the nuances of Institutional Crypto movements helps provide context to market fluctuations. What Does This ETH Transfer Mean for Ethereum’s Price? While an $18.4 million ETH transfer is not massive in the context of Ethereum’s multi-billion dollar market capitalization and daily trading volumes, institutional moves are often watched closely for directional cues. A deposit to an exchange can be seen as a potential bearish signal in the short term, as it increases the supply available for sale. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective: Factors to Consider: Factor Potential Impact Context Amount Transferred Small relative to total market cap/volume Limits direct price impact Purpose of Transfer Could be selling, rebalancing, or internal management Selling has direct price impact; others less so Broader Market Conditions Overall sentiment (bullish/bearish) Amplifies or mitigates the effect of the transfer Other Institutional Activity Are others buying or selling? Provides a wider picture of Institutional Crypto sentiment This single ETH transfer from the BlackRock ETHA fund to Coinbase is unlikely to cause a drastic price crash on its own, but it adds another data point for analysts assessing market sentiment. Institutional Crypto vs. Retail Strategy: Different Goals? The strategies employed by large institutional players like BlackRock often differ significantly from those of retail investors. While a retail investor might panic sell based on short-term price movements, institutions typically operate with longer time horizons and complex portfolio management strategies. Scale: Institutions deal with much larger capital, requiring deeper liquidity venues like Coinbase Prime. Regulation: They operate under strict regulatory frameworks, influencing how and when they can buy or sell assets. Portfolio Management: Moves might be related to rebalancing asset allocations, managing risk, or meeting redemption requests, rather than purely speculative trading. Market Impact: Their large trades can, intentionally or unintentionally, influence market prices more than retail trades. Understanding these differences is key to interpreting news like the BlackRock ETHA fund’s deposit to Coinbase . It’s not just a simple ‘sell’ order; it’s part of a larger, more intricate financial operation within the Institutional Crypto space. Actionable Insights from the BlackRock ETHA Move For those tracking the Ethereum market and institutional participation, this ETH transfer offers a few insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain data and reports tracking institutional flows. Platforms like Lookonchain provide valuable transparency. Context is King: Don’t overreact to single transactions. Assess them within the broader market context, including overall volume, sentiment, and other news. Observe Patterns: Is this a one-off event, or does it signal a change in the fund’s strategy? Continued monitoring of the BlackRock ETHA fund’s activity is necessary. Consider Your Own Strategy: Institutional moves can be informative, but your investment decisions should align with your own risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals, not simply mimic large players. The world of Institutional Crypto is becoming increasingly transparent, and analyzing moves like this ETH transfer provides valuable clues, but they are just one piece of a complex puzzle. Concluding Thoughts on BlackRock ETHA and Ethereum BlackRock’s ETHA fund depositing $18.4 million worth of Ethereum to Coinbase marks a notable event, ending a period of accumulation. While the amount is relatively modest, the significance lies in it being the first potential distribution activity from a major institutional player’s dedicated ETH fund after a buying streak. This move prompts market participants to consider potential short-term selling pressure or portfolio adjustments within the Institutional Crypto realm. As institutional adoption continues to evolve, tracking these large transfers and understanding their potential implications becomes an essential part of navigating the dynamic Ethereum and broader crypto markets.

Still, tensions threaten to escalate. Major U.S. stock indices saw small gains despite the U.S. entry into Israel’s war with Iran.

Trump even talked about regime change , suggesting that Iranian Ayatollahs could be replaced with a democratic government. Still, it is not yet clear whether or not the U.S. is committed to a full-fledged war with Iran. The effectiveness of the U.S. strikes on Iran, which President Donald Trump called a “spectacular military success,” still has to be assessed. Independent agencies saw no signs of elevated radiation. The questionable effectiveness of the U.S. strikes, as well as Iran’s careful response, suggests that tensions may be de-escalating.

This rotation is driven by a mix of market dynamics, investor psychology, and the unique positioning of MAGACOIN FINANCE within the current altcoin landscape. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Emerging Contender Key Drivers Behind the Shift Early-Stage Asymmetric Upside: MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early growth phase, offering investors a chance to capture significant upside before mainstream adoption and major exchange listings. Analysts are projecting realistic returns of 35x, with some forecasts even suggesting a 100x ROI by year-end, making it an appealing target for those seeking outsized gains. Scarcity-Driven Supply Model: Unlike many altcoins that face dilution from venture capital unlocks, MAGACOIN FINANCE boasts a locked supply of 170 billion tokens, with no VC unlocks on the horizon. This scarcity narrative is resonating with both retail and crypto-native investors, who see it as a hedge against inflationary pressures common in other projects. Momentum and Community Backing: The project has rapidly raised over $10 million in its presale, with each entry round selling out quickly. This strong early demand is fueled by a growing, enthusiastic community and a series of promotional incentives, such as 100% token bonuses for early adopters. Strategic Narrative and Roadmap: MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just a speculative play; it’s positioned around a bold, politically charged brand and a clear roadmap. Upcoming milestones, such as the launch of staking features and public exchange listings, are creating urgency and anticipation among investors. Capital Rotation from Saturated Assets: As Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs and Solana faces resistance after a strong run, many investors are seeking undervalued alternatives with better risk/reward profiles. MAGACOIN FINANCE, still priced below key thresholds, is seen as a rare opportunity to enter early before a potential breakout. Why Not Aptos? While Aptos remains a technically advanced and innovative blockchain—recently shortlisted alongside Solana for Wyoming’s proposed state-backed stablecoin and boasting partnerships with Google Cloud and Franklin Templeton—its price action has been less compelling. Despite strong fundamentals, Aptos has faced a 16% monthly decline and a 35% drop over the past year, with market sentiment currently bearish. Even as it rolls out major upgrades like the migration to the Fungible Asset (FA) standard and continues to attract developers, the immediate upside appears limited compared to the explosive potential offered by MAGACOIN FINANCE . Aptos continues to expand its ecosystem, with over 1,000 active developers and significant adoption in Web3 gaming and DeFi, but these achievements have yet to translate into strong price momentum Conclusion The rapid migration of Bitcoin and Solana investors into MAGACOIN FINANCE over Aptos is rooted in the search for the next big asymmetric play. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity-driven supply, robust early-stage momentum, and compelling roadmap have made it the breakout altcoin of 2025 for those seeking high potential returns. Meanwhile, Aptos, despite its technical strengths and institutional partnerships, is currently viewed as a slower-growth asset in the eyes of capital-hungry traders.

Crypto analyst Finsends has commented on this development and how it could affect the altcoin season moving forward. What’s Next As Bitcoin Dominance Hits New High? In an X post, Finsends stated that the Bitcoin dominance has made a new high and that it feels like it can never go down again. However, he opined that there should be a bigger correction starting somewhere around the current levels. The analyst added that the potential target area for a top in this scenario goes up to 68.56%. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here’s Why His accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin dominance could hit this projected top of 68.56% in July, after which a decline would begin. Based on the chart, the BTC.D could drop to as low as 48% on this decline, paving the way for a potential altcoin season. If so, then altcoins could witness significant gains in the second half of the year and outperform BTC in the process. In an X post, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also commented on the rising Bitcoin dominance and a potential altcoin season. He noted that the altcoin season indicator has hit its lowest number in two years. The analyst added that the lows of this indicator over the last six years were in June or July. Based on this, he remarked that there seems to be a pattern since the indicator has hit a low again this June. Michaël van de Poppe didn’t predict when exactly altcoin season could begin or if the Bitcoin dominance would top anytime soon. However, before now, he had expressed confidence that the alt season would still happen. The analyst noted that the last cycle was also called a Bitcoin cycle until altcoins started to run and heavily outperformed. What Needs To Happen For Altcoins To Take Off In another X post, Michaël van de Poppe stated that altcoins are in need of an upward push from Ethereum, and that this needs to happen through a push of Bitcoin. He further remarked that once the BTC price bottoms out, that is a very likely moment for Ethereum to continue outperforming the flagship crypto, with the Bitcoin dominance declining. Related Reading: Analyst Calls Start Of Altcoin Season Amid Deviation Of Cyclical Lows – Details The analyst believes that altcoins would start “shining” when the next leg upwards for Ethereum takes place, possibly ushering in altcoin season. He declared that once altcoins start to shine, market participants can expect them to heavily outperform the markets. However, for now, Michaël van de Poppe believes investors need to have some more patience.

His debut tweet, a simple emoji, was enough to spark excitement across the crypto world. Reported by Subjective Views on X, the post marks Britto’s first public engagement in over 14 years. The Return of a Silent Pioneer Arthur Britto is one of the most influential yet mysterious figures in the history of blockchain. Alongside David Schwartz and Jed McCaleb, Britto helped develop the XRP Ledger in 2011, an innovative blockchain designed for fast, scalable, and energy-efficient payments. Arthur Britto @ahbritto , co-founder of Ripple Labs and a key architect of the XRP Ledger tweets for the very first time. $XRP pic.twitter.com/aEg02bJiSj — Subjective Views (@subjectiveviews) June 23, 2025 While other Ripple co-founders took on public roles, Britto chose a life away from the spotlight. He has not participated in interviews, events, or even social media, until now. That’s why his single emoji tweet has resonated so deeply. It wasn’t about what he said, but the fact that he spoke at all. A Moment That Resonates Britto’s tweet didn’t contain any commentary, announcements, or opinions. But for the XRP community, it didn’t need to. His silent re-entry into the conversation represents more than nostalgia, it’s a symbolic nod to the project he helped build, and a subtle affirmation of its continued relevance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Subjective Views, who first highlighted the post, captured the significance of the moment: this wasn’t just a tweet, it was the digital equivalent of a legendary founder stepping back onto the stage after years of absence. Reconnecting the Past with the Future As the XRP Ledger continues to evolve, with developments in DeFi, tokenization, and smart contracts, Britto’s reappearance feels well-timed. Whether or not he plans to actively re-engage with the project remains unknown. But even this small gesture has reignited a sense of connection between XRP’s early foundations and its present-day ambitions. For long-time supporters, Arthur Britto’s first tweet is more than a blip on the timeline, it’s a reminder of the vision, discipline, and quiet conviction that helped shape one of the most enduring platforms in crypto.

In a thread on the social media platform X, the pseudonymous sleuth details how a man named Christian Nieves – who goes by “Daytwo” and “PawsOnHips” online – allegedly stole $4 million from Coinbase users by impersonating employees at the crypto exchange. ZachXBT says that Nieves operates a small scam-call center group and also works as a caller. The group allegedly primarily coerces their victims into setting up a Coinbase wallet with an already compromised seed phrase on phishing sites. Other people in Nieves’ circle also allegedly helped in separate thefts, including a henchman named Justin going as “Paranoia” who executed a $240,000 heist of an elderly victim’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallet. According to ZachXBT, a portion of that $240,000 was deposited into crypto betting site Roobet, and the rest was converted into Monero ( XMR ). “I traced out his casino deposit address which links onchain to 30+ suspected thefts. I expect there’s many additional victims I am unable to directly link. While there’s potentially overlap between multiple threat actors the vast majority of activity pertains to Daytwo… Daytwo has a gambling problem and you’ll see onchain how casino deposits get smaller as he loses funds. Recently this escalated to the point where he started stealing cuts from accomplices.” At time of writing, Nieves and his alleged accomplices have not been charged with anything by law enforcement, but given the amount of digital and on-chain evidence, ZachXBT says it should be a “rather easy” case for authorities. However, most of the victims’ money is likely unrecoverable since it has been lost to gambling, the analyst says.

Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain flagged a massive transaction of 113,000 ETH—valued at approximately $313 million—deposited into crypto exchange Coinbase . The move was initiated from a single whale wallet amid heightened speculative trading activity and rising institutional accumulation of ETH. Whale Movement Triggers Market Concerns Whale deposits to centralized exchanges are often interpreted as a signal that large holders may be preparing to sell. Lookonchain reported the transaction on X, noting that the wallet had remained dormant for a considerable period before suddenly moving its entire holdings to Coinbase. Source: X While the motive behind the transfer remains unknown, such high-value movements often precede large sell orders, especially when combined with current market conditions. Leverage Hits Record High The timing of the whale deposit aligns with a new all-time high in Ethereum futures open interest. According to data from Coinglass, ETH futures open interest has surpassed $29 billion, driven by increasing speculative activity using stablecoin-backed, cash-margined contracts. This trend is also reflected in the growing presence of retail traders in Ethereum’s derivatives market. CryptoQuant reported that futures trading frequency among smaller investors has spiked above its 12-month average, contrasting with Bitcoin’s stagnant on-chain activity. Despite the potential for short-term volatility, institutional demand for ETH has remained steady. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, reportedly acquired $163.6 million in ETH across two consecutive weeks, according to blockchain data tracked by Lookonchain. ETH Price Outlook and Key Levels Ethereum is currently trading at $2,295, marking a slight 0.16% decline over the past 24 hours. Analysts have identified $2,800 as a critical resistance level. ETH/USDT Char t According to crypto traders such as Daan Crypto Trades and Duo Nine, a break above this threshold could lead to a push toward the $3,000 mark. However, with leverage peaking and large ETH volumes moving to exchanges, the market remains on alert for a possible correction. High open interest and excessive retail positioning have historically led to liquidations during sudden price swings. ETH/USDT Shorts on the Rise In contrast to bullish sentiment, some traders are beginning to open short positions on ETH. Lookonchain highlighted this divergence, suggesting that some market participants prepare for a downside move in response to the whale transfer and overheated derivatives activity. While Ethereum continues to enjoy institutional inflows and speculative momentum, the $313 million whale transfer to Coinbase has introduced a new layer of uncertainty.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-23 18:06:56

The memecoin's dramatic rise illustrates how geopolitical shock from the real world is driving a new generation of commodity-themed tokens—while also illustrating the unique risks of trading the newest crypto fads. From Oil Crisis to Crypto Mania The Strait of Hormuz, the chokepoint sea lane between international markets and the Persian Gulf, carries about 20% of global oil supply. News that Iran's Supreme National Security Council could okay a shutdown any day now drove markets and oil prices into a frenzy. But while Wall Street strategists pondered the fallout, crypto investors did something different—pouring into DigitalOil, a Solana-based memecoin that tracks the price and volatility of oil. The result? OIL shot up over 400% against the dollar, with decentralized exchange volumes such as those on Raydium jumping as investors searched for a speculation hedge against global turmoil. Social media frenzy only added to the FOMO, with influencers swearing OIL as ”the most geopolitically privileged memecoin” and even touting endorsement from notorious gold bug Peter Schiff. Liquidity Risks and Whale Games Despite the hype, DigitalOil is a thinly traded token with a market capitalization of a bit over $250,000 and 24-hour volume of $137,000. Like most memecoins, the price of OIL is highly volatile depending on large trades and concentrated ownership. Coin Metrics has a high-risk rating for memecoins, citing that a couple of ”whale” wallets can move the market with a single trade—amplifying the potential for spontaneous crashes or pump-and-dump schemes. Liquidity dries up rapidly in times of stress, and late movers can't conveniently sell out without suffering massive losses. The token price dropped 23% in the last 24 hours alone, indicating the volatility that comes with staying current with the new narrative. Investors be warned: it's quick to be yesterday's moonshot in the memecoin space, just to be tomorrow's rug pull. Are These Tokens Safe? Security is another important concern. Most commodity-themed tokens, like DigitalOil, launch with little smart-contract audits or reserve visibility and mechanics. With insufficient smart-contract reviews, these resources are open to bugs, exploits, or even outright scams. Unlike oil-backed stablecoins, where old-school reserves need to be audited and fall under regulatory oversight, memecoins operate with little or no regulation or consumer protection. Can Geopolitical Hedging Drive the Next Memecoin Frenzy? The DigitalOil rally is the latest sign that crypto traders are looking for new ways to bet on—and hedge against—real things. Social media platforms like X and Reddit spread these trends, as 71% of memecoin investors say their initial source of inspiration was trending posts. The FOMO, global headlines, and speculative mania cocktail can turn even the most obscure tokens into overnight supernovas. But history shows us that such rallies do not endure. Lacking in-world support, healthy audits, and substantial liquidity, commodity-themed memecoins are gambles with high risk—more casino than refugium. So long as markets are starved for new narratives, however, the next geopolitical shock may propel another improbable crypto phenomenon. Bottom Line DigitalOil's 400% climb is a wild ride that takes geopolitics and crypto mania together. While the token's bubble represents a new commodity-memecoin story, however, traders need to tread cautiously—liquidity risks, no audits, and social-media-driven volatility make the next moonride equally likely to turn into a crash.",News|Memecoins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-23 18:07:22

The company has entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling 51% stake in Diamond Lake Minerals , a publicly traded entity. This move isn’t just about acquiring a stake; it’s part of a broader plan to rebrand the acquired company as “DiamondLake” and fundamentally change its investment focus towards building a substantial altcoin treasury . This bold strategic maneuver comes at a critical time for Unicoin, which is currently facing legal challenges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently filed a SEC lawsuit against Unicoin and its executives, alleging securities fraud related to its previous token sales. The timing of this crypto acquisition and strategic pivot raises many questions about the company’s future direction and how it plans to navigate the regulatory environment. Why the Pivot to an Altcoin Treasury ? The decision to focus on an altcoin treasury represents a departure from Unicoin’s prior model. While the specific altcoins targeted haven’t been fully detailed, the general strategy likely involves accumulating a diversified portfolio of emerging cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Several factors could be driving this pivot: Potential for High Growth: Altcoins, particularly those in early stages or with strong use cases, can offer significantly higher growth potential compared to established assets, albeit with higher risk. Diversification: Building a treasury of various altcoins can help diversify risk compared to holding a single asset or focusing solely on traditional investments. Liquidity and Flexibility: A treasury of liquid crypto assets can provide flexibility for future investments, operations, or potential yield-generating activities. Regulatory Adaptation: While the SEC lawsuit targets Unicoin’s past activities, shifting towards holding publicly traded equity (via the Diamond Lake Minerals acquisition) and managing a diverse altcoin portfolio might be part of adapting to the evolving regulatory landscape, although the regulatory status of specific altcoins remains complex. The Diamond Lake Minerals Acquisition: A Strategic Vehicle? Acquiring a majority stake in Diamond Lake Minerals appears to be the chosen vehicle for this strategic pivot. By acquiring a publicly traded company, Unicoin effectively gains a potential pathway to public markets for its new strategy under the rebranded “DiamondLake” entity. This could offer: Increased Transparency: As a public company, DiamondLake will be subject to reporting requirements, potentially offering more transparency than a private crypto fund. Access to Capital Markets: Public listing could facilitate easier access to capital for future growth and altcoin acquisitions. Investor Familiarity: Operating under a public company structure might appeal to a broader range of investors, including those more comfortable with traditional equity markets. The acquisition of the 51% stake signifies Unicoin taking controlling interest, allowing them to steer the strategic direction of DiamondLake towards the planned altcoin treasury focus. Navigating the SEC Lawsuit Backdrop It’s impossible to discuss this development without acknowledging the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Unicoin and its executives. The lawsuit alleges that Unicoin’s previous offering constituted unregistered securities and involved fraudulent misrepresentations. The timing of the crypto acquisition of Diamond Lake Minerals raises questions: Is this move a way to separate future operations from the legal liabilities of the past? Does acquiring a public company and focusing on altcoin holdings represent a strategy to operate in a manner perceived as less directly tied to the activities scrutinized by the SEC in the lawsuit? How will the SEC lawsuit impact Unicoin’s ability to successfully integrate Diamond Lake Minerals and execute its altcoin treasury strategy? The outcome of the SEC lawsuit will undoubtedly have significant implications for Unicoin and the newly focused DiamondLake entity. Investors and market observers will be closely watching how these legal challenges unfold alongside the execution of the new business plan. Challenges and Opportunities of this Crypto Acquisition This strategic move presents both significant opportunities and considerable challenges: Opportunities: Tapping into the potential upside of the altcoin market. Gaining access to public markets via Diamond Lake Minerals. Creating a potentially more robust and diversified investment vehicle. Challenges: Volatility and risk inherent in altcoin investments. Integration challenges between Unicoin and Diamond Lake Minerals. Ongoing legal and regulatory uncertainties stemming from the SEC lawsuit. Market perception and investor confidence given the legal issues. Successfully navigating these challenges will be crucial for Unicoin and DiamondLake as they attempt to establish themselves with this new focus. What This Means for the Market and Investors This development is a fascinating case study in the evolving crypto landscape and how companies adapt to market dynamics and regulatory pressures. For investors interested in this space, key takeaways include: Monitor the progress of the DiamondLake integration and the specific altcoins included in the treasury. Pay close attention to developments in the SEC lawsuit against Unicoin, as it could impact the viability of the new venture. Understand the risks associated with altcoin investments and the complexities of combining traditional public company structures with crypto strategies. The move by Unicoin to acquire Diamond Lake Minerals and pivot to an altcoin treasury is a high-stakes play with the SEC lawsuit as a constant backdrop. Its success will depend on execution, market conditions, and the resolution of its legal challenges. Conclusion: A Bold, High-Stakes Transformation Unicoin’s acquisition of a controlling stake in Diamond Lake Minerals and the subsequent pivot towards building an altcoin treasury marks a significant and potentially transformative moment for the company. This strategic realignment, occurring amidst the complexities of an ongoing SEC lawsuit , highlights the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto investment world. While the focus on emerging altcoins offers potential for growth, it also brings considerable risk. The integration with Diamond Lake Minerals provides a new operational structure, potentially offering greater transparency and access to capital markets. However, the cloud of the SEC lawsuit looms large, presenting a critical challenge that could impact the venture’s trajectory. This crypto acquisition is a bold gamble, and the coming months will reveal whether this strategic pivot can successfully navigate the legal headwinds and capitalize on the opportunities in the altcoin market.

The flagship crypto slumped last week in response to escalating geopolitical fears. The cost of Metaplanet’s latest Bitcoin haul averaged $106,408 per coin. Bitcoin plummeted from around $108,000 on June 16 to under the $100,000 mark on Sunday after the United States bombed multiple nuclear sites in Iran. Metaplanet Races Toward Its Ambitious 100,000 BTC Goal For 2026 Metaplanet’s latest purchase has boosted the company’s total holdings to 11,111 BTC , bought for $1.07 billion at an average price of $95,869 per Bitcoin. According to BitcoinTreasuries, this stockpile positions Metaplanet as the world’s eighth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin after surpassing Bitcoin miner Hut 8’s treasury of 10,273 BTC. Metaplanet’s BTC stash is now within striking distance of Tesla’s current Bitcoin stash of 11,509 BTC — just 398 BTC more than Metaplanet. Given its accumulation track record, Metaplanet may surpass Tesla’s haul before the end of the month. The company has modelled its approach in Michael Saylor’s Strategy , positioning itself as a publicly traded proxy for Bitcoin exposure in Asia. Earlier this month, Metaplanet revised its earlier target to set a new goal. The Bitcoin-buying firm is now 11% away from its target to amass 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026. Moreover, it’s approximately 36% toward its nearer-term goal of 30,000 BTC by year-end. Metaplanet, which rebranded in 2024 from a hotel and technology firm to a committed Bitcoin treasury, hopes to accumulate 210,000 BTC, or roughly 1% of the crypto’s 21 million supply, by 2027. To reach 100,000 Bitcoin, Metaplanet will need to acquire roughly 89,000 additional coins over the next 18 months. Despite the Bitcoin accumulation spree, Metaplanet is reportedly among the most shorted stocks in Japan. Analysts at 10x Research said in May that the company’s valuation implied a BTC price of over $596,000 — more than five times current levels. “Apparently, Metaplanet is the most-shorted stock in Japan,” CEO Simon Gerovich said in apparent response to the claims. “Do they really think betting against Bitcoin is a winning strategy?”",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Tesla,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-23 18:11:44

The apex cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , has not been spared in the slightest. Notably, the asset briefly fell below the $104,000 price level before making a brief correction, indicating a rise in selling pressure. However, one market participant has remained bullish for a handful of reasons. Taking to X, the trader and crypto analyst with the pseudonymous X handle TradingShot highlights the many bullish scenarios that could play out for the big bull in the near term. The analyst first revealed that the current bull cycle is likely to be sustained until the last quarter of the year, at this point, Bitcoin could still skyrocket to a new all-time high. The analyst observed that Bitcoin has remained in a state of consolidation since hitting its $111,970 all-time high on May 22, 2025, adding that the trend has triggered anxiety amongst market players curious to know when the bull market cycle will arrive. He suggests ignoring the short-term bear trends and FUD building up due to the continuous selloff and heightened volatility, and instead “sticking to the long-term picture.” Further strengthening his bullish outlook, he points to the Bitcoin chart pattern displaying the 1-minute time frame, highlighting the symmetrical uptrend observed within each 4-year cycle. On the chart displayed, bear market trends appear to last 12-13 months, while bull markets last 35 months. The chart pattern highlights the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $240,000 in this cycle. The analyst, who sees the market cycle top arriving at a later time this year, wrote the following; “Based on that, this Cycle’s Top is expected to be priced by October 2025. This also matches the Sine Waves as implied by the 1M RSI, which has been trading within a Channel Down (diminishing returns) since Bitcoin’s inception.” At the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading for $102,975, with 7-day gains going above 3.57%.

A Comprehensive Trustworthiness Review,https://timestabloid.com/is-ricky-casino-legit-a-comprehensive-trustworthiness-review/,"When choosing an online casino, especially in Australia, the foremost question is always about legitimacy and trustworthiness. Ricky Casino has grown in popularity among Australian players, partly due to its user-friendly interface and attractive bonuses. However, popularity alone doesn’t guarantee safety. To ensure you’re playing at a legit site, you must evaluate official licensing, security protocols, and fairness of games. Licensing and Regulation Ricky Casino operates under multiple licenses, ensuring compliance with strict gambling regulations. Licensing is the foundation of casino legitimacy, guaranteeing that operators follow rules designed to protect players. Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) — one of the most respected regulators in the online gambling world. MGA licensing means the casino undergoes regular audits, player protection policies, and financial transparency requirements. Curacao eGaming License — a widely used license, particularly for online casinos targeting international markets. Although less strict than MGA, it still imposes important operational standards. Holding these licenses indicates Ricky Casino operates legally and is subject to oversight by recognised regulatory bodies. These authorities ensure that games are fair, player funds are protected, and complaints can be investigated. Regulatory Oversight and Player Protection Licensed casinos like Ricky Casino must adhere to regulations that enforce responsible gambling and player protection. Regulators monitor the casino’s operation, including payout percentages, anti-money laundering measures, and dispute resolution processes. Players can report issues to the regulatory bodies if the casino violates rules. This external control adds a layer of security absent in unlicensed or offshore-only casinos. Technological Security of the Platform Ensuring player safety extends beyond licenses; the technological backbone is critical.

Reputation and Player Reviews The reputation of Ricky Casino among Australian players is generally positive, which supports its legitimacy. Many users praise its fast payouts, reliable customer service, and a broad range of games. However, as with any casino, there are some negative reviews mostly related to delayed withdrawals or misunderstandings of bonus terms. These issues are not uncommon and are often resolved by the casino’s support team. Independent review platforms and gambling forums provide valuable insights into player experiences. Consistency in positive feedback from various sources indicates a trustworthy operator. Australian players appreciate Ricky Casino’s transparency and fairness, which is essential for maintaining a good reputation. Customer Support and Service Quality Customer support is a critical factor when judging an online casino’s trustworthiness.

Russian-language support is also available, which enhances accessibility for Russian-speaking players. Deposit and Withdrawal Conditions Ricky Casino supports a wide variety of payment methods suitable for Australian players, including credit/debit cards, e-wallets like Skrill and Neteller, and bank transfers. This variety ensures convenience and security when handling deposits and withdrawals. Withdrawal Times and Limits Withdrawal speed varies depending on the method but generally ranges from a few hours to a few days. Ricky Casino aims to process withdrawal requests within 24 hours, although delays can occur due to additional verification. Key Payment Features Description Deposit Options Credit cards, e-wallets, bank transfers Withdrawal Time Usually 24-72 hours depending on method Withdrawal Limits Minimum and maximum limits clearly stated Security Measures Strong encryption and fraud protection Responsible Gaming and Additional Safeguards Ricky Casino promotes responsible gambling by offering tools like deposit limits, self-exclusion, and reality checks.

Self-exclusion options allow players to block access temporarily or permanently. These features are backed by advice and support links to Australian gambling help organisations. Summary and Final Verdict Ricky Casino is a legit and trustworthy option for Australian players looking for a safe and enjoyable online gambling experience. Its valid licenses, strong security protocols, fair gaming practices, positive reputation, and quality customer support create a reliable environment. For players starting with a modest budget or those seeking a well-regulated platform, Ricky Casino ticks all the boxes.

Unlike Arizona and New Hampshire, which passed similar legislation, Texas did not just authorize the reserve but is actively funding it. The state will be appropriating $10 million in order to purchase bitcoin for the reserve. The news comes months after the Trump administration announced the creation of a national crypto reserve — though that vehicle is supposed to be funded in strictly budget-neutral ways, like through crypto asset seizures or by issuing crypto bonds . Abbott also signed bill HB 4488, a companion measure that protects the bitcoin reserve from routine ‘fund sweeps’ into the state’s general revenue.

With XRP trading at around $1.99, EGRAG believes the pause in momentum is not a sign of weakness but a strategic setup for the next major rally. XRP Consolidation: A Bullish Signal XRP has been consolidating just below the $2 mark, sparking mixed reactions among traders. While some interpret this stagnation as a loss of steam, EGRAG sees it differently. He argues that this consolidation is bullish, a necessary breather after sustained upward movement. Historically, XRP has shown strength during consolidation phases at key resistance levels. These periods often serve as foundations for explosive breakouts. EGRAG believes this current setup mirrors those moments, encouraging the XRP community to remain focused and patient. #XRP – Are You Afraid of This Bullish Consolidation? The #XRPCommunity has a unique DNA, they don’t fear the storms; they see opportunities, hope, and a bright future ahead! #COVID didn’t break us, it offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity #SEC … pic.twitter.com/4HjzsS3oMq — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 23, 2025 A Community Built on Resilience In his post, EGRAG highlights the XRP community’s ability to withstand adversity. He recalls how events that rattled global markets were seen as buying opportunities rather than reasons to panic. During the COVID-19 crash, while fear gripped the world, XRP holders viewed the crisis as a chance to accumulate. The SEC lawsuit in December 2020, perhaps the most defining challenge in XRP’s history, triggered massive uncertainty. Yet, rather than abandoning the project, the community held firm, seeing the legal battle as a temporary setback and a discounted entry point. The 2022 bear market also tested investor resolve. XRP dropped alongside the broader crypto market, but committed holders continued to accumulate, trusting in long-term value over short-term price action. Even economic challenges like tariffs, which weighed on global sentiment, were met with optimism, another chance to stack XRP at lower prices. October 7: A Defining Geopolitical Shift EGRAG’s message also touches on the significance of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. That day marked the beginning of the Gaza war, with over 1,000 Israeli civilians killed in a surprise assault. The attack triggered a broad regional conflict, drawing in Iran-backed militias and escalating tensions across the Middle East. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although Iran was not directly involved in the initial attack, its support for groups like Hamas and Hezbollah positioned it at the heart of the regional fallout. In the months since, the situation has evolved into a complex proxy conflict involving Israel, Iran, and their allies. Despite the uncertainty, EGRAG maintains that such geopolitical unrest presents an opportunity for disciplined investors. He frames it as another chance to dollar-cost average, a long-term strategy that benefits from market volatility. Eyes on the Future For EGRAG Crypto, XRP’s journey is about more than charts and headlines. It’s about conviction. The message is simple: XRP holders have weathered every storm, and this phase is no different. As legal clarity approaches and adoption increases, the stage may be set for XRP’s next chapter. And according to EGRAG, those who stay the course through this bullish consolidation will be ready when liftoff begins.

GTE is a new decentralized exchange that wants to rival big platforms like Binance and Coinbase. The platform can offer the same speed and trading experience as these big names, while keeping the core benefits of decentralization. Why Paradigm Believes in GTE GTE’s trading system uses a central limit order book (CLOB). This type of system matches buy and sell orders based on price and time. It works like traditional stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange. This differs from automated market makers (AMMs), which are often used in crypto trading. The platform is also built entirely on MegaETH, an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain. This allows it to maintain complete decentralization while offering faster speeds and lower costs. In a joint statement, Paradigm partners Charlie Noyes and Caitlin Pintavorn said they believe GTE has the right combination of a strong team and powerful technology. Paradigm, known for investing in crypto startups , sees GTE’s potential to compete with centralized exchanges and existing decentralized platforms like PancakeSwap. They believe the exchange can give users a faster and more flexible trading experience and expect it to become a major player in decentralized finance (DeFi). GTE Aims to Improve the Trading Experience GTE’s co-founders, Matteo Lunghi and Enzo Coglitore, shared that the exchange is focused on retail traders and liquidity providers. Lunghi said the exchange is built for traders who want to buy and sell anytime, from anywhere. It aims to avoid the slow speeds and high fees often on today’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The co-founder said one of GTE’s goals is to protect liquidity providers from bad trades that reduce their earnings. Another goal is to improve how prices are found and updated in real time. Earlier this year, GTE launched a test version of its platform. That testnet attracted about 700,000 users, showing strong early interest in the project. A Broader Industry Trend GTE raised $10 million earlier this year through three funding rounds. These included a $1.5 million pre-seed, a $7 million seed round, and $2.5 million from a community offering on Echo. With the new $15 million from Paradigm, GTE is better positioned to mainstream its platform. Fundraising is a common and essential trend in the startup and tech industry. Early-stage companies often raise money through investment rounds to support their growth. Reportedly, Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory led to a strong rise in crypto funding , giving the industry a big boost. In March, Haun Ventures revealed it aims to raise $1 billion within the next three months.

However, recent data paints a significantly different picture, suggesting a fundamental shift in the asset’s behavior. The once-unpredictable digital currency is demonstrating a newfound stability, with its volatility dropping below that of major U.S. stock indices. This development isn’t just a fleeting anomaly; it’s a strong indicator of growing crypto market maturity . Is Bitcoin Volatility Really Lower Than Stocks? Yes, that’s precisely what the data indicates. According to insights from Bitwise, cited by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin’s 60-day volatility has recently registered between 27% and 28%. This figure is notably lower than the volatility observed in prominent traditional markets like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s a significant divergence from Bitcoin’s historical price behavior, especially considering the backdrop of rising global geopolitical tensions, which typically send traditional markets into flux. Consider this comparison: Bitcoin (60-day volatility): ~27-28% S&P 500: Often higher than Bitcoin’s recent levels during periods of market stress. Nasdaq: Typically even more volatile than the S&P 500, consistently showing higher swings than Bitcoin currently. This inversion of the expected volatility dynamic is a key takeaway. It suggests that Bitcoin is reacting differently to macroeconomic and geopolitical events than it has in the past, behaving less like a purely speculative, fringe asset and more like an established market participant. What Does Falling Bitcoin Volatility Signify? The reduction in price swings points directly to increasing crypto market maturity . In its earlier years, the Bitcoin market was smaller, less liquid, and dominated by retail investors who could be easily swayed by news, speculation, or fear. This led to exaggerated price movements in both directions. Several factors contribute to this maturing landscape: Increased Institutional Participation: More large institutions, hedge funds, and corporations are entering the space, bringing larger capital pools and more sophisticated trading strategies that can absorb market shocks. Improved Market Infrastructure: The development of regulated exchanges, clearer custody solutions, and financial products like Bitcoin ETFs provides more stable and accessible avenues for investment. Wider Adoption and Understanding: As more people understand Bitcoin’s technology and potential value proposition, panic selling during dips becomes less prevalent among a growing segment of holders. Derivatives Markets: The growth of robust futures and options markets allows for better price discovery and hedging, which can help stabilize spot prices. This shift from a highly speculative, retail-driven market to one with broader participation and more established infrastructure is a natural progression for any asset class gaining mainstream acceptance. The reduced Bitcoin volatility is a direct consequence of this evolution. The Role of Long-Term Bitcoin Holders A crucial element underpinning Bitcoin’s current stability is the behavior of its most committed investors. Data indicates that long-term Bitcoin holders now control a record amount of BTC – specifically, a staggering 14.53 million BTC. These are wallets that haven’t moved their coins for a significant period, typically a year or more. Why is this important for stability? Reduced Selling Pressure: Long-term holders are less likely to sell during minor price drops or market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). Their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value removes a significant source of potential selling pressure. Supply Sink: By holding large amounts of Bitcoin off exchanges and out of active circulation, long-term holders effectively reduce the available supply for trading. With consistent demand, a lower available supply naturally supports price stability and can contribute to upward price pressure over time. Market Confidence: The growing number and holdings of long-term holders signal strong conviction within the market, which can encourage other investors to hold rather than sell. The accumulation by these steadfast holders acts as a bedrock for the Bitcoin price , providing resilience against volatility spikes driven by short-term trading or external events. What’s the Bitcoin Forecast Amidst This Stability? The combination of decreasing volatility and strong holder conviction is fueling optimistic predictions for the future Bitcoin price . Analysts are increasingly confident about Bitcoin’s trajectory. Key points from analyst forecasts: Staying Above $100,000: Many analysts view the $100,000 mark not as an ambitious peak, but as a sustainable level that Bitcoin is likely to trade above in the coming cycles. Potential to Surpass $150,000 by 2025: Some forecasts are even more bullish, projecting that the price could exceed $150,000 within the next year or two. These predictions are often based on supply-demand dynamics (like the halving), increasing adoption, and the macroeconomic environment. Factors Supporting the Forecast: Besides maturity and holder behavior, factors like the recent Bitcoin halving (reducing new supply) and the potential for increased global economic uncertainty driving interest in alternative assets like Bitcoin are cited as drivers for future price appreciation. While no forecast is guaranteed, the underlying market structure – characterized by lower volatility and strong holding – provides a more solid foundation for potential price growth compared to previous cycles driven purely by hype and speculation. Is Lower Volatility Good for Bitcoin? For many investors, particularly larger institutions and those looking at Bitcoin as a long-term store of value or digital gold, lower volatility is a significant positive. It makes the asset class more palatable and less risky from a portfolio management perspective. Benefits of Lower Volatility: Increased Investor Confidence: Reduces the risk of sudden, large drawdowns, making it easier for conservative investors to enter the market. Attracts Institutional Capital: Institutions prefer assets with predictable behavior and lower risk profiles. Supports Use Cases: Makes Bitcoin more viable for potential use cases beyond pure speculation, such as collateral or even a medium of exchange, although significant volatility still exists compared to fiat currencies. Potential Downsides (for some): Reduced Trading Opportunities: Short-term traders thrive on volatility. Lower swings mean fewer opportunities for quick, large profits. Less Media Hype: Extreme volatility often grabs headlines. A calmer market might receive less sensational media attention. Overall, the shift towards lower volatility is widely seen as a necessary step for Bitcoin to transition from a niche, high-risk asset to a globally recognized and accepted store of value and investment asset class. Key Takeaways for Investors What does this mean for you if you’re invested in Bitcoin or considering it? A More Mature Market: The days of unpredictable 30%+ swings in a day might be less frequent. The market is evolving. Long-Term View Supported: The dominance of long-term Bitcoin holders validates a buy-and-hold strategy for those who believe in Bitcoin’s future. Considered Against Traditional Assets: Bitcoin’s risk profile, at least in terms of short-term volatility, is beginning to compare more favorably to traditional equities during certain periods. Future Potential: Analyst forecasts, while speculative, are underpinned by tangible market structure changes like reduced volatility and strong holding patterns. This period of stability, relative to its history and compared to traditional markets, offers a different perspective on Bitcoin – one of an asset shedding its ‘wild west’ image and stepping onto the global financial stage with greater poise. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s New Era of Stability? Bitcoin’s recent performance, marked by volatility levels below major stock indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, signals a significant phase in its evolution. This isn’t just about price numbers; it’s a testament to the increasing maturity of the crypto market . Driven by factors like growing institutional adoption, improved infrastructure, and the unwavering conviction of long-term Bitcoin holders who control a record amount of supply, the asset is demonstrating resilience even in turbulent times. While the ride may still have its bumps, the dramatic, unpredictable swings of the past appear to be giving way to a more stable trajectory. With analysts forecasting a strong future Bitcoin price , potentially surpassing $100,000 and even reaching $150,000 by 2025, the current stability provides a more solid foundation for these optimistic predictions. Bitcoin is arguably entering a new era, one where its behavior increasingly reflects that of a serious, established asset class.

The Office of Cybersecurity said WhatsApp is high-risk to users due to its lack of transparency in protecting user data. The chief administrative officer recommended other messaging apps, including Microsoft Corp’s Teams platform, Amazon’s Wickr, Apple’s iMessage, and FaceTime. The ban comes as Congress is also taking steps to limit the use of AI programs it deems similarly risky. CAO urges staffers to use other messaging app options BREAKING: U.S. House of Representatives officially bans the use of WhatsApp on all official devices pic.twitter.com/J4KlbQyAT6 — Vaultedmag (@vaultedmag) June 23, 2025 The U.S. House’s chief administrative officer directed all congressional staffers not to download or keep the WhatsApp application on any House device, including any mobile, desktop, or web browser versions of its products. The official said that if any staffer has a WhatsApp application on their House-managed device, they will be contacted to remove it. Spokesperson for WhatsApp parent company META, Andy Stone, said the firm disagrees with the CAO’s characterization of the messaging app. Stone acknowledged that the company knows members and their staff regularly use WhatsApp, and they look forward to ensuring members of the House can join their Senate counterparts in doing so too. “Messages on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted by default, meaning only the recipients and not even WhatsApp can see them. This is a higher level of security than most of the apps on the CAO’s approved list that do not offer that protection.” -Andy Stone, Spokesperson for WhatsApp. The CAO argued that Microsoft Teams, Wickr, Signal, iMessage, and FaceTime are all acceptable alternatives to WhatsApp. The Chief Administrative Office also warned staffers to be wary of potential phishing scams and texts from unknown numbers. In January 2025, roughly 100 journalists and other members of civil society using WhatsApp were targeted by spyware owned by Paragon Solutions, an Israeli maker of hacking software. The victims were allegedly being alerted of a possible breach of their devices, and WhatsApp said around 90 users in question had been targeted and compromised. Government clients use Paragon’s hacking software, and WhatsApp said it could not identify the clients who ordered the alleged attacks. WhatsApp did not disclose where the journalists and members of civil society were based, including whether they were based in the U.S. Paragon’s software is known as Graphite and has features similar to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. Once a phone is infected with Graphite, the spyware operator has total access to the device, including reading messages sent via encrypted applications like WhatsApp. CAO bans other tech apps from congressional staffers The chamber’s representative has previously banned other tech companies, including Microsoft Copilot, DeepSeek, and ByteDance apps. In July 2024, the CAO banned staffers from using ByteDance, the Chinese-owned parent company of TikTok, on official congressional devices. The division’s cybersecurity team said TikTok’s ties to China represented a national security threat. They initiated blocking and removing all ByteDance products from all House-managed devices and app stores. The ban also included Capcut, Hypic, Lark, and Lemon8. In March 2024, the House also strictly banned congressional staffers’ use of Microsoft Copilot, the firm’s AI-based chatbot. The House’s Chief Administrative Officer, Catherine Szpindor, said the Office of Cybersecurity deemed the app a risk to users due to the threat of leaking House data to non-House-approved cloud services. The ban on AI tools followed similar steps by tech companies such as Samsung, which distanced itself from artificial intelligence software for employees in May 2023. The South Korean tech giant said it temporarily restricted the use of generative AI through the company’s personal computers. On April 7, 2025, the White House also released new policies on AI use in Federal agencies. Trump issued an executive order to remove barriers to American leadership in artificial intelligence by releasing two revised policies on Federal Agency Use of AI and Federal Procurement. Trump wants to maintain U.S. leadership in AI by championing the development of AI systems that are free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas. The agenda revoked the previous AI policies that acted as barriers to American AI innovation. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The company, known primarily as a leading ASIC miner manufacturer, has announced a major restructuring of its business operations. This bold move involves initiating pilot U.S. production capabilities and, notably, exiting its previously explored AI chip business to concentrate solely on its foundational cryptocurrency-related activities. This shift is more than just a change in manufacturing location; it represents a clear strategic direction aimed at enhancing resilience and capitalizing on the growth within the Bitcoin mining sector. Why the Strategic Pivot to Core Bitcoin Mining? Canaan’s decision to double down on Bitcoin mining hardware comes at a crucial time for the industry. As the cryptocurrency market matures and the competition among miners intensifies, the demand for efficient and reliable ASIC miner technology remains high. By focusing entirely on this sector, Canaan aims to leverage its established expertise and market position. The company sees the long-term growth potential in Bitcoin mining as a key driver for its future success. Exiting the AI chip business allows Canaan to allocate resources, research, and development efforts more effectively towards advancing its core competency: building powerful and energy-efficient mining machines. Boosting Resilience with U.S. Production Perhaps one of the most impactful aspects of Canaan’s announcement is the commencement of pilot U.S. production . This move is a strategic response to several global economic and geopolitical factors. Historically, much of the world’s electronics manufacturing, including ASIC miners, has been concentrated in specific regions, leading to potential vulnerabilities in supply chains. By establishing manufacturing capabilities in the United States, Canaan aims to: Improve Supply Chain Resilience: Diversifying production locations reduces dependence on single regions, mitigating risks associated with geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, or regional lockdowns. Reduce Tariff Exposure: Producing within the U.S. can help Canaan navigate complex international trade tariffs and reduce associated costs for products destined for the North American market. Strengthen Proximity to Key Markets: North America is a significant market for Bitcoin mining operations. Local production can potentially lead to faster delivery times, reduced logistics costs, and better responsiveness to customer needs in the region. Enhance Quality Control: Direct oversight of the manufacturing process closer to key operational centers can potentially lead to improved quality assurance. While the source material notes that U.S. production may involve higher costs compared to traditional manufacturing hubs, Canaan views this as a necessary and strategic investment for long-term stability and growth in the vital North American market for ASIC miner hardware. The Decision to Exit the AI Chip Business Canaan’s previous foray into the AI chip business represented an attempt to diversify its technology applications beyond cryptocurrency mining. However, the recent announcement confirms the company’s decision to divest from this sector entirely. This exit underscores a strategic decision to narrow focus and allocate resources exclusively to the area where Canaan has built its reputation and core technological advantage: the design and production of ASIC miner chips for Bitcoin mining . The competitive landscape in the AI chip market is vast and dominated by tech giants. By leaving this space, Canaan can dedicate its full attention to innovation and efficiency within the cryptocurrency hardware sector, aiming to maintain a competitive edge against other ASIC miner manufacturers. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Mining Landscape? Canaan’s strategic shift, particularly the emphasis on U.S. production , could have broader implications for the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. As more manufacturing capacity potentially comes online in North America, it could further decentralize the production of mining hardware, adding another layer of resilience to the global network. For mining operations based in the U.S. and surrounding regions, this could mean easier access to Canaan’s latest ASIC miner models and potentially improved support services. The move reinforces the growing importance of North America as a hub for both Bitcoin mining operations and, increasingly, the manufacturing infrastructure that supports it. Looking Ahead: Canaan’s Focused Future With its strategic direction now firmly set on Bitcoin mining and bolstered by the initiation of U.S. production , Canaan is positioning itself for a future centered on its core strengths. The exit from the AI chip business highlights a clear commitment to this specialized market. While challenges like managing potentially higher U.S. manufacturing costs remain, the long-term benefits of supply resilience, reduced tariff exposure, and proximity to key markets appear to outweigh them in Canaan’s strategic calculation. The industry will be watching closely to see how this pivot impacts Canaan’s market share and operational efficiency in the coming years as the Bitcoin mining sector continues to evolve.

This strategic rotation is driven by a mix of on-chain signals, market fundamentals, and the search for outsized returns as the bull cycle matures. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Accumulation and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly become one of the most talked-about low-cap cryptos of 2025 , with whales making record-breaking early-stage buys. On-chain data confirms that a single wallet recently executed the largest early-stage purchase of the year—nearly $133,000 in one transaction—signaling institutional-scale confidence in the project. Several fundamentals are fueling this bullishness: Hard Supply Cap: With a permanently capped supply of 170 billion tokens, inflation risk is minimized, making MAGACOIN FINANCE attractive for long-term holders. Audited Contracts: Fully audited smart contracts by HashEx provide security and passive income opportunities. Community and Branding: The project’s patriotic theme and viral branding echo the early days of DOGE and SHIBA, attracting both new and seasoned investors. Early Entry Opportunity: Programs like PATRIOTS100X incentivize early accumulation, giving whales and retail investors alike a strong reason to enter now. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns from current levels if capital rotation from Bitcoin and other large caps continues, making MAGACOIN FINANCE a prime candidate for explosive growth in this cycle. Kaspa: Strategic Whale Accumulation Amid Market Fear Kaspa (KAS) is also seeing significant whale accumulation, especially during recent price dips that have shaken retail confidence. On-chain evidence shows that the largest wallets are buying millions of KAS tokens as the price retests a historically critical support trendline. This behavior mirrors past cycles where similar accumulation preceded major rallies. Key reasons for bullishness on Kaspa include: Strong Technical Support: The current dip is seen by whales as a golden opportunity, not a capitulation event, with the long-term trendline acting as a magnet for big buyers. Positive Funding Rates: Despite the pullback, funding rates remain positive across major exchanges, signaling sustained bullish sentiment among professional traders. Growing Ecosystem: Kaspa’s proof-of-work network is gaining recognition, with analysts predicting a move towards $0.11 later this year if current trends hold. XRP and the Altcoin Rotation XRP whales are also accumulating at record levels, controlling over 12% of the circulating supply. Following Ripple’s legal victory and strong price action above $2.21, analysts are setting ambitious targets, with some speculating XRP could challenge Ethereum’s market cap if momentum persists. This broader whale activity in XRP and Bitcoin is fueling the search for high-upside alternatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Kaspa as the next phase of the bull market unfolds. Conclusion The sudden bullishness of Bitcoin and XRP whales on MAGACOIN FINANCE and Kaspa is rooted in a combination of early-stage fundamentals, on-chain accumulation, and the hunt for the next 100x opportunity. As legacy tokens face resistance and capital begins rotating into undervalued altcoins, these two projects stand out as prime targets for both institutional and retail investors seeking exponential returns in the second half of 2025.

The sharp drop came after news broke of US military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a move that significantly escalated the already volatile conflict between Israel and Iran. The geopolitical shock sent global markets into risk-off mode, with Bitcoin reacting quickly to the growing uncertainty.

Investors are now watching key technical levels closely to determine the next move. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, Bitcoin must hold the daily EMA-100 to avoid further downside pressure. A decisive close below this level could open the door for a deeper correction, especially if macroeconomic and geopolitical risks persist. As volatility spikes and fear grows, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain support at these levels may define whether the bull cycle continues or enters a prolonged consolidation phase.

After dipping below the psychological $100,000 level over the weekend amid growing geopolitical tensions, BTC quickly reclaimed this critical threshold, offering a glimmer of hope to market participants. Although bulls managed to push the price back up, the overall structure remains fragile, and technical indicators now carry more weight than ever. Ted Pillows noted in a recent update that Bitcoin must hold its daily EMA-100 to preserve bullish momentum. A daily close below $99,000 would confirm a break below this key support zone, likely triggering a retest of the $92,000–$94,000 region. Such a move could create significant downside pressure, particularly on altcoins, which are already lagging behind in performance. In Pillows’ words, “If Bitcoin loses this level, alts will be annihilated.” Despite the looming risks, fundamentals remain solid. Bitcoin dominance continues to hover near its highest levels of the year, reflecting growing investor preference for BTC over high-beta assets during uncertain times. On-chain metrics still indicate strong holder conviction, and macro narratives continue to favor Bitcoin as a hedge amid fiat instability and rising geopolitical uncertainty. If Bitcoin can hold the $100K level and reclaim momentum, it could lead to renewed strength and eventually a push toward the $109K resistance zone. For now, however, bulls are on the defensive. Price action over the next few days will likely define the trajectory for the remainder of Q3, with a close watch on EMA support, macro headlines, and risk sentiment across global markets.

After forming a symmetrical triangle throughout mid-June, BTC failed to break upward and instead reversed direction, confirming a downward breakout. This move triggered a sharp decline to $98,200 over the weekend, followed by a modest recovery to the current $101,250 level. The price is now trading below both the 50 and 100-period simple moving averages, which are beginning to curl downward, signaling a shift in momentum away from bulls. The 200-period SMA, currently near $95,600, stands as the next major support if downside pressure continues. Volume has picked up notably on the red candles, adding weight to the bearish case and confirming active selling during the recent drop. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom – All Eyes On Next Move Bitcoin must reclaim the $103,600 zone and hold above it to invalidate the bearish pattern and regain control. Failure to do so could result in further downside toward $95,000 and possibly even $92,000. As long as BTC remains below the broken triangle support and the $103K resistance, the path of least resistance remains downward. Bulls face an uphill battle, and confidence may erode quickly if the $100K psychological level is breached again.

As TIA dropped by 93%, a dramatic change proposal emerged within the community. Celestia co-founder John Adler proposed removing the current Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism entirely and replacing it with a new and experimental Proof of Governance (PoG) system. According to Adler’s statement on the Celestia governance forum, with the PoG system, the annual supply of the TIA coin will be reduced by 20 times. This means that the annual staking reward of approximately $ 127 million will be reduced to only $ 4 million. In the new system, token holders will be able to choose network operators directly without having to lock their tokens. Adler argues that this structure would eliminate unnecessary complexity, reduce costs, and maintain network security as effectively as PoS, and that it is a more sustainable value creation model that directly increases the network’s revenues from data accessibility services. Celestia’s current PoS system has long been criticized, with criticism centering on the idea that high staking rewards are disrupting the economic balance of the network by increasing TIA’s inflation. Currently, Celestia distributes approximately 8% of its circulating coin supply as staking rewards each year, which has the effect of reducing the value of coins in circulation. Related News: Cold Wallet Users Beware: Important Security Warning Issued In addition, some investors, especially large funds and early-stage investors, earn rewards by staking their locked investments and selling these rewards on the market, which is seen as one of the factors that undermine trust in the project. Adler argues that staking is simply a system that penalizes those who do not stake coins and actually creates an economically unnecessary step in the process of determining the operators of the network. In the new PoG model: Staking and staking rewards will be completely removed. Network operators will only be rewarded for good performance, making punishment methods such as slashing unnecessary. The threat of token holders to dismiss operators will be the most important element in ensuring the security of the system. Governance votes will be conducted off-chain as the Celestia chain does not support such voting. While some blockchain enthusiasts criticize off-chain systems, Adler says they are no different from on-chain systems in terms of security, and Celestia already has a similar off-chain management infrastructure in place. Adler’s proposal has received positive feedback from the community so far, and discussions are ongoing, but the move could mean a fundamental shift in Celestia’s value generation model. *This is not investment advice.

This development has sparked speculation about a potential new meme coin rally. Investors are eager to discover which digital tokens could be primed for substantial growth. The following analysis delves into the dynamics behind these shifts and what it could mean for the market. DOGE Price Trends and Key Levels Analysis DOGE experienced a notable price decline over recent periods, with a one-month drop of nearly 32% and a six-month decline surpassing 54%. The coin lost approximately 12.87% just within the last week. These movements highlight a consistent downtrend that has strained investors' sentiment. The price corrections and overall market weakness have been apparent as the coin’s value shifted between lower ranges, indicating challenges for bullish momentum in the recent past. At present, DOGE trades within a price range of about $0.15 to $0.25, with resistance at $0.30 and support near $0.11. Technical signals indicate bearish pressure, as both the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator show negative values, while the RSI is near oversold territory at 29.74. The second resistance at $0.40 and additional support at $0.01 outline the trading framework. While sellers remain active, a potential reversal around the support level could spur limited buying interest. Traders may target a bounce near $0.11 with stop orders to guard against further downturns, while a successful test of $0.30 might invite cautious buying. Shiba Inu: Recent Decline and Key Level Outlook SHIB experienced notable declines, with prices dropping around 24.74% over the last month and a severe 54.13% downturn over the past six months. A one-week fall of about 10.55% reflects persistent bearish pressure. Price movements during these periods have been marked by sharp downtrends and significant volatility. The coin has struggled to maintain upward momentum, reflecting waning investor interest and overall market weakness. Shiba Inu’s price action is currently trapped between defined levels that shape its trading landscape. The coin is trading within a narrow range of approximately $0.0000108 to $0.0000162. The immediate resistance is near $0.0000196, with a further obstacle at $0.000025. Nearest support sits at roughly $0.00000885, while a deeper support is at $0.00000348. Over this period, bearish signals have predominated, with the RSI close to oversold territory at 30. Sellers have taken charge, and a clear bullish trend is absent. Traders may find opportunities in this range, placing buy orders near support and targeting sell orders before resistance. Conclusion Dogecoin has seen a rise after significant price changes. At the same time, Shiba Inu experienced a huge increase in trading volume. These movements could indicate a new meme coin rally. Both coins are showing strong activity and attracting attention in the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The company announced Monday that it has officially shut down its AI semiconductor unit and completed a pilot production run of mining rigs in the United States. The move marks a shift in strategy for Canaan, which has struggled to gain traction outside of its mainstay Bitcoin mining business. Canaan Refocuses Strategy on Bitcoin Mining, Ends Costly AI Semiconductor Unit In a statement on Monday, Canaan confirmed that it is winding down its AI semiconductor division, citing misalignment with its long-term goals. “I believe that doubling down on our core strengths in crypto infrastructure and Bitcoin mining is the most strategic path forward for Canaan,” said Nangeng Zhang, the company’s chairman and CEO. The AI unit, which generated just $900,000 in revenue in 2024, represented a small fraction of the company’s total income but accounted for 15% of operating expenses. $CAN Canaan to discontinue non-core AI semiconductor business unit Canaan commenced a strategic realignment aimed at sharpening its focus on its core businesses of bitcoin mining machine sales, self-mining operations, and consumer mining products. As part of this initiative, the… — DonCorleone77 (@CorleoneDon77) June 23, 2025 Canaan said the mismatch between cost and output, along with poor alignment with long-term goals, drove the decision to phase it out. The firm had been exploring options for the unit since March 2022 and expects the wind-down to be completed in the coming months. As part of its strategic reorientation, Canaan has launched its first U.S.-based production run, replicating its Malaysian operations. Though it acknowledged that manufacturing in the U.S. comes with higher costs, the company sees the move as a long-term investment. “This initiative is not just a hedge against tariffs but a potential strategic investment in long-term resilience,” a Canaan representative said. By producing closer to the North American market, Canaan hopes to reduce delivery times, adapt to customer demand more quickly, and better manage potential regulatory shifts. The company added that imported mining equipment from Malaysia is currently subject to a 10% U.S. tariff, while costs for components and raw materials remain difficult to predict. “We’re actively working to optimize our U.S. cost structure with the goal of limiting production costs,” the spokesperson said. However, Canaan emphasized that any future scale-up in U.S. operations will depend on whether production becomes commercially viable. That includes a clearer tariff environment, sustainable demand, and manageable expenses. Canaan also addressed potential concerns regarding national security, stating that all devices shipped to the U.S. are made in Malaysia and approved by local regulators. If it expands U.S. manufacturing further, the company says it will comply with U.S. tech and security standards. Canaan Doubles Down on U.S. Bitcoin Mining as Rivals Localize Amid Tariff Pressures As Canaan exits the AI chip race, the company is ramping up its focus on U.S. Bitcoin mining, positioning itself to ride the momentum of the industry’s shifting center of gravity. Known for its Avalon series, Canaan has joined rivals Bitmain and MicroBT in expanding operations to the U.S., where over 38% of global Bitcoin mining now takes place. The three firms collectively dominate the global mining rig market, controlling over 90%. The move follows Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory, which has sparked a renewed push for “American-made” mining gear. Bitmain launched American production in December , shortly after Donald Trump’s re-election. MicroBT, meanwhile, has openly adopted a “localization strategy” to align with “American Made” expectations. Though Canaan’s shares have tumbled 71% year-to-date, underperforming both crypto and mining indexes, some analysts view the company’s growing self-mining operations in the U.S. as a potential growth driver. Meanwhile, the company is also targeting retail miners. In March, Canaan rolled out its new Avalon Q miner , a high-performance machine designed for home users, delivering up to 90 TH/s with adjustable power consumption. @canaanio has unveiled the Avalon Mini 3 and Nano 3S at CES 2025, merging Bitcoin mining with home heating. #Canaan #BitcoinMining https://t.co/O41SeV9Cz6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 8, 2025 This release brings professional-grade mining capabilities to retail users, compatible with standard 110V household outlets.

This isn’t just a big number; it’s a clear signal of the rapid integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial markets. The fact that this milestone was reached less than 18 months after their debut, specifically the spot versions that launched in January 2024, underscores the intense interest and liquidity these products have brought to the table. Data cited by Unfolded on X, drawing from Yahoo Finance figures, confirms this impressive feat. What Does $1 Trillion in US Spot Bitcoin ETF Volume Really Mean? Let’s break down what this massive figure signifies. The $1 trillion cumulative trading volume represents the total value of shares bought and sold across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs since they began trading. Think of it as the sheer amount of activity these investment vehicles have generated. For context, reaching this kind of volume so quickly is exceptionally fast compared to many other types of exchange-traded funds when they first launched. It highlights a significant demand and comfort level among investors – both retail and institutional – for gaining exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated, easily accessible product like an ETF. This milestone isn’t just about volume; it’s about validation. It shows that providing a familiar, traditional finance wrapper around a novel asset like Bitcoin can unlock substantial market participation. The rapid accumulation of this US spot Bitcoin ETF volume indicates strong market depth and liquidity, making it easier for large players to enter and exit positions without causing significant price disruption. It’s a sign of a maturing market infrastructure surrounding the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Why Are Bitcoin ETFs Attracting Such Massive Trading Volume? Several factors contribute to the extraordinary Bitcoin ETF trading volume we’re witnessing. Firstly, accessibility is key. These ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, meaning anyone with a brokerage account can buy and sell them just like they would shares of Apple or Google. This removes many of the technical hurdles associated with buying and storing actual Bitcoin, such as setting up digital wallets, managing private keys, or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges, which some investors find intimidating. Secondly, regulatory clarity plays a crucial role. While the path to approval for US spot Bitcoin ETFs was long and complex, their eventual listing by the SEC provides a level of legitimacy and regulatory oversight that appeals to a broad range of investors, particularly institutions. This perceived safety and compliance framework makes them a preferred route for large funds and asset managers who might be hesitant to directly hold the underlying asset. Furthermore, liquidity begets liquidity. As more volume flows into these ETFs, it becomes easier and more attractive for traders to participate, creating a virtuous cycle. The ability to trade in and out of positions efficiently on regulated markets with known participants is a major draw, contributing significantly to the high Bitcoin ETF trading volume. How Does This Reflect on Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The $1 trillion volume mark is perhaps one of the clearest indicators yet of growing Institutional Bitcoin adoption. While retail investors certainly contribute, the scale and speed of this volume suggest significant participation from larger players like asset management firms, hedge funds, and even potentially corporate treasuries. These entities often operate under strict mandates regarding where and how they can allocate capital, and a regulated ETF structure provides the necessary compliance and operational framework. Before the spot ETFs, institutions had limited options for gaining Bitcoin exposure within traditional finance structures. Futures-based ETFs existed but tracked derivatives, not the spot price directly. Direct investment involved navigating complex custody and regulatory landscapes. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs removed many of these barriers, opening the floodgates for institutional capital that was previously on the sidelines. The substantial inflows seen in some of the major ETFs, particularly those from established financial giants like BlackRock (IBIT) and Fidelity (FBTC), starkly illustrate this trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. While there have also been significant outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as it converted to an ETF (likely due to investors exiting a product that previously traded at a discount/premium and now has competing, lower-fee options), the net inflows into the new ETFs demonstrate a clear appetite for this asset class via the ETF structure from sophisticated investors. Exploring the Landscape: Key Players in Crypto ETFs While US spot Bitcoin ETFs are currently the stars of the show, they exist within a broader and evolving landscape of Crypto ETFs. Globally, various jurisdictions have had different forms of crypto-linked ETPs (Exchange Traded Products), including those tracking Bitcoin futures, baskets of cryptocurrencies, or even specific altcoins in some regions. However, the US market, being the largest and most influential, has seen the most significant impact from the spot Bitcoin ETF launches. Key players in the US market include: BlackRock (IBIT): Quickly became a leader in terms of inflows, demonstrating the asset management giant’s significant reach and investor confidence. Fidelity (FBTC): Another major financial institution that has seen substantial inflows into its Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale (GBTC): The largest existing fund that converted to a spot ETF, experiencing outflows but still holding a massive amount of Bitcoin. Other issuers like Ark Invest/21Shares (ARKB), Bitwise (BITB), VanEck (HODL), and Invesco (BTCO), among others, also contribute to the overall market volume and competition. The success of these US spot Bitcoin ETFs is also paving the way for potential future Crypto ETFs. Discussions and applications are already underway for spot Ethereum ETFs, and if approved, they could replicate the success seen with Bitcoin, further broadening the ways investors can access digital assets through regulated products. What’s Next for Bitcoin Investment Via ETFs? Reaching the $1 trillion cumulative volume mark is a significant milestone, but it’s likely just the beginning for Bitcoin investment through the ETF structure. Here’s what we might see next: Continued Inflows: As more financial advisors and institutional platforms gain comfort and approval to recommend or hold these products, inflows are likely to continue, albeit perhaps not always at the initial frenetic pace. Increased Competition and Fee Pressure: With multiple issuers vying for market share, we could see continued pressure on management fees, which benefits investors. Education and Awareness: More educational efforts will likely target both retail and institutional investors to explain how these products work and their role in a diversified portfolio. Global Impact: The success in the US market could encourage other major financial hubs to accelerate their own approval processes for spot Bitcoin ETFs or other crypto-linked ETPs. For individuals considering Bitcoin investment, the availability of spot ETFs provides another option alongside direct ownership or futures markets. Each method has its pros and cons regarding custody, fees, tax implications, and complexity. Actionable insight for investors is to understand these different avenues and choose the one that best aligns with their investment goals, risk tolerance, and technical comfort level. Consulting with a financial advisor who understands digital assets is also advisable. Benefits of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Accessibility: Easy to buy and sell through standard brokerage accounts. Liquidity: High trading volume means easier entry and exit points. Regulatory Clarity: Traded on regulated exchanges under SEC oversight (though Bitcoin itself remains largely unregulated). Custody Handled: Investors don’t need to worry about securing their own private keys; the ETF issuer handles the custody of the underlying Bitcoin. Integration: Fits seamlessly into traditional investment portfolios and retirement accounts. Potential Challenges: Volatility: The underlying asset, Bitcoin, is highly volatile, meaning the ETF’s price will also be volatile. Fees: ETFs charge management fees (Expense Ratios), which can eat into returns over time, unlike direct ownership. Tracking Error: While designed to track the spot price, minor deviations can occur due to fees, operational costs, or market dynamics. Market Hours: ETFs trade during traditional stock market hours, while the underlying Bitcoin market trades 24/7, potentially leading to price gaps. This rapid ascent to $1 trillion in cumulative volume is more than just a statistic; it’s a narrative of changing perceptions, increasing acceptance, and the growing bridge between the world of digital assets and traditional finance. It underscores the significant demand for Bitcoin exposure in familiar, regulated structures and sets a powerful precedent for the future evolution of crypto investment products.

After teasing below $100k over the weekend, BTC price recorded the lowest weekly close at around $101,339. Consequently, BTC price signaled further potential short-term weakness, with a midterm target of around $93k. Furthermore, BTC price in the weekly timeframe has formed a potential macro double-top coupled with bearish divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) , an established reversal pattern. If the support level around $93k fails to hold in the coming weeks, a capitulation towards $76k will be imminent in the subsequent months. Benjamin Cowen on Altseason 2025 Following the heightened crypto volatility, which has resulted in significant liquidations of leveraged long traders, fear of further capitulation remains palpable. The Bitcoin and Ethereum fear and greed indexes have dropped below 50 percent following the recent crypto selloff triggered by the U.S. attack on Iran. According to Benjamin Cowen, an established crypto analyst, the Bitcoin market will continue to gain more ground over altcoins in the coming months. With Bitcoin dominance having crossed Sunday above 65 percent, Cowen thinks the figure will rise further in the near future, potentially even hitting 70 percent. The altcoin market is an oscillator *at best* against #Bitcoin . Being mad at the influencers who convinced you alt season was coming is not going to help. This chart has always shown you the most likely outcome. Just many lost patience and decided this time was different. pic.twitter.com/49AxN44hLD — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) June 23, 2025 Consequently, the crypto analyst is of the opinion that altcoins will continue to bleed out to the Bitcoin market, thus further delaying the highly anticipated altseason 2025. Most importantly, Cowen highlighted that the wider crypto market, led by Bitcoin will establish a local low around August or September. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts expect the wider crypto market to record a parabolic rally during the fourth quarter of 2025 and potentially extend to the first quarter of 2026.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 19:41:00

The firm will be renamed Build & Build Corporation and hold BNB as a treasury asset. Binance continues to lead altcoin and stablecoin deposit activity on Ethereum and TRON. A team of hedge fund executives is seeking to raise $100 million to purchase BNB , the native token of Binance, through a publicly traded company, according to a June 23 report . The plan involves renaming the Nasdaq-listed company to Build & Build Corporation, and using it to acquire BNB as a treasury asset. Crypto hedge fund executives are reportedly aiming to raise $100M to accumulate $BNB https://t.co/BzPqAZm4oM — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) June 23, 2025 Build & Build to Hold $100 Million in BNB Investor materials reviewed by Bloomberg show the effort is being led by former Coral Capital Holdings executives Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger, and Johnathan Pasch. The BNB purchase would follow a model previously used by Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy), which began accumulating Bitcoin through its corporate balance sheet in 2020. Strategy also announced today that it will acquire $26 million in Bitcoin. Following Strategy’s business model, other listed companies have adopted similar strategies involving different tokens. SharpLink Gaming raised $425 million in May to purchase Ethereum, while DeFi Development Corp. disclosed plans to acquire Solana. BNB was created by Binance in 2017 during its initial coin offering. The token is used to reduce trading fees on the exchange and facilitate payments on BNB Smart Chain, which hosts various decentralized applications. It currently ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap with a total value of $87 billion, according to CoinMarketCap . The investor materials describe Build & Build as the first listed company to hold BNB on its balance sheet. The fundraising is expected to close before the end of June. Binance Activity Fuels Interest in Exchange Tokens Recent on-chain data from CryptoQuant demonstrates Binance’s continued dominance in altcoin deposit activity, far outpacing rival exchanges. During the height of the late 2024 altcoin rally, Binance saw up to 59,000 daily deposits, more than double that of Coinbase and ahead of all other exchanges combined. Even in quieter markets, Binance leads with an average of 13,000 daily altcoin inflow transactions. Binance also tops stablecoin inflows on Ethereum, particularly in USDT and USDC transfers. CryptoQuant data shows the exchange received 53,000 Ethereum-based stablecoin transactions over a recent period, compared to 42,000 for Coinbase. Some public companies are beginning to treat exchange-linked tokens not just as speculative assets, but as a structural part of their treasury strategy. The choice to accumulate BNB reflects growing interest in assets that offer direct utility within large trading ecosystems. This shift also introduces new variables for public markets. Investors will need to weigh the benefits of token-linked services against the volatility and regulatory scrutiny surrounding exchange-based assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How could BNB holdings affect Build & Build Corporation’s future financial reporting? Public companies holding volatile crypto assets must account for impairment losses but not unrealized gains, which may result in uneven quarterly reports depending on market conditions. What regulatory concerns might arise from holding BNB as a core asset? BNB’s close association with Binance, which has faced legal scrutiny, could raise compliance concerns, particularly if the SEC or other agencies classify the token as a security in future actions. Could other exchanges replicate Binance’s BNB model? While some platforms have native tokens, few have achieved the same scale of utility and liquidity as BNB. Replication may depend on ecosystem size and regulatory tolerance. What are the implications for institutional exposure to BNB through public markets? If successful, this approach could provide a regulated pathway for institutional investors to gain BNB exposure without directly interacting with crypto exchanges. How might token accumulation by firms influence governance or network dynamics? Large holders could become key stakeholders in token ecosystems, potentially influencing governance decisions if those tokens grant voting rights or protocol influence.

Analyst Weighs In,https://cryptopotato.com/in-exactly-how-much-trouble-is-the-ethereum-price-right-now-analyst-weighs-in/,"Ethereum (ETH) faced renewed downside over the weekend following a US airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities. The geopolitical tension rattled crypto markets, which pushed ETH briefly below the $2,200 mark. Although prices have since rebounded, the crypto asset has lost almost 15% over the past week, amid broader market unease as conflict escalates in the Middle East. New data suggest that Ethereum’s recent price drop may not be over. ETH Selloff Amid Weak Fundamentals According to Matrixport’s latest update , Ethereum remains vulnerable to further losses due to risky futures positioning, which suggests further downside risk for the world’s largest altcoin. While Bitcoin attempted to rally, Ethereum’s gains were largely fueled by leveraged traders rather than fundamental strength. This disconnect has made the asset especially vulnerable, with elevated leverage amplifying recent losses. Matrixport analyst Markus Theilen warned that the futures market continues to show signs of overcrowding, which essentially indicates that the unwinding process is not yet complete. The sharp decline over the past few days is likely a result of this positioning risk, and until leverage resets, Ethereum could face continued selling pressure in the near term. While leverage and macro risk weigh on ETH’s near-term outlook, its relative dominance on Binance has quietly strengthened. ETH Captures Larger Share of The Market Ethereum’s growing dominance on Binance is largely a result of declining interest and trading volume in other altcoins, rather than a surge in ETH trading itself. An analysis of Binance trading data from January 2023 to May 2025 shows that the altcoin’s trading volume has remained relatively stable, ranging between 300 trillion and 490 trillion. On the other hand, altcoin volume, which peaked in November 2024, dropped sharply by May 2025. This significant decline reflects a broader shift in investor sentiment. Traders appear to be pulling liquidity from smaller or riskier assets, particularly during periods of market uncertainty or when confidence in speculative projects declines. Some of this capital may be reallocating to Ethereum, which is viewed as a more reliable asset. In cautious market environments, the asset tends to retain its trading volume better than other assets. This trend highlights how ETH can benefit from risk-off behavior in the broader crypto market. The post In Exactly How Much Trouble is the Ethereum Price Right Now?

As strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities now turn the spotlight on the tools of modern warfare — particularly those of high-tech caliber — investors are moving into positions to leverage the opportunities from the escalating crisis. Defense tech investments and collaborations have exploded in recent days With the talk of World War III dominating headlines, defense tech companies have started attracting heavy investments as countries prepare for the worst. Shares in Palantir , a data-crunching US company linked to the Pentagon, have also gone up by more than 80% this year, and its $325 billion market capitalisation is quadruple that of traditional defense companies like BAE Systems. To keep up with the growing demand, companies in the sector will need to secure supply chains, close deals with prime contractors, and also get their hands dirty. One issue that could pose a threat to this happening is gutted supply chains, an issue complicated by the geopolitical tension across the globe. One company, Airo, known to deal in drones and avionics, has already highlighted “limited suppliers” in Europe and Canada for critical components and raw materials as an issue. To deal with this, companies like Helsing and Anduril have been investing in tie-ups. Helsing is reportedly buying composite aircraft manufacturer Grob Aircraft and has partnered with Sweden’s Saab. At the same time, US peer Anduril Industries has made several acquisitions, including Adranos, and has also joined forces with Rheinmetall to develop drones for Europe. Built with Europe, for Europe. Today we’re announcing a strategic partnership with @RheinmetallAG to co-develop & deliver Anduril’s Fury, Barracuda & solid rocket motors to European militaries. pic.twitter.com/FwZfEwF9AH — Anduril Industries (@anduriltech) June 18, 2025 Bavarian military software developer Blackned has also teamed up with the German defense prime, and the pair have secured a €1.2 billion contract from the German Bundeswehr. The EU is aiding the defense industry in the face of excess demand Despite the increased demand, access to finance, from equity to bank loans, is still tricky for the smaller players. Venture capital debt has been plugging some holes, but governments are also stepping in. This month, for example, the EU’s lending arm reportedly tripled its loan plan for defense industry SMEs to €3 billion. The initiative is part of the EIB’s Pan-European Security and Defence Lending Envelope, aimed at bolstering Europe’s defense capabilities amid heightened geopolitical tensions. The expanded €3 billion scheme will focus on providing intermediated financing to SMEs and mid-cap companies within the EU’s security and defense supply chain, as these businesses are recognized as critical suppliers to major defense manufacturers like Airbus, Thales, Rheinmetall, and Leonardo. Historically, wherever capital flows, advancements follow, even if only through trial and error. During the Second World War, many designs passed the check on the drawing board but failed in the field. With further escalation in sight, defense companies and their investors may see it as an opportunity to test, refine, push products, and make gains faster than during peacetime.

Hayes tells his 704,300 followers on the social media platform X that the Federal Reserve is primed to inject massive liquidity into the US economy, forcing investors to flood into BTC as a hedge against currency debasement. Bitcoin dipped to the $98,000 range over the weekend, but has reclaimed the $100,000 range at time of writing. Says Hayes, “Do you hear that? It’s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass and BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status.” In a new interview, Hayes also says that Bitcoin’s future bull and bear cycles will likely be determined largely by market liquidity. Hayes says he does not believe in a four-year cycle, which used to be widely accepted as the norm by many crypto investors. The four-year cycle is based on the idea that Bitcoin follows its halvings when BTC miners’ rewards are cut in half, which happen roughly every four years and tend to precede upward price movements. Says Hayes, “I don’t like to use the ‘number of years’ cycle dogma. The cycle is what the cycle is. All I care about is how much liquidity is being in the market, what’s the expectation of the market going forward, what’s the future discount rate of liquidity and how does that change versus where you think the market’s going to go… We will have a cycle and I think it will depend more and more on the expectations of fiat liquidity printing.” Hayes also predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2028.

As SHIB hype slows and its price stagnates at approximately $0.000012, starving investors awaiting the next crypto to moon are getting positions on Mutuum Finance as the month of June draws to a conclusion. Mutuum Finance remains in presale stage 5 which has already sold 40% of it due to huge demand. Over $11 million has been generated so far and over 12,300 investors have joined. Analysts have already labeled it one of the summer’s top tokens, with a potential 50x return being driven by its revolutionary lending protocol and early-market price. For those wondering what to buy before the end of June or looking for the best crypto to buy in 2025, Mutuum is being heralded as this summer’s breakout altcoin, as Shiba Inu holders are left chasing old highs. Presale Momentum Builds as Mutuum Finance Hits Phase 5, Token Priced at $0.03 Mutuum Finance is lighting up the DeFi sector, and the presale is currently in its Phase 5 with tokens trading at a mere $0.03. Valued at a launch price of $0.06, investors today can expect to enjoy a smooth 2x profit. But that’s not all, as the calculated profit post-launch is 12000%, this has the potential to be one of the biggest DeFi plays on the market today. Already, over $11 million has been raised and there are over 12,300 investors in the sidelines and ready to ride. To put icing on the cake, phase 6 of the presale will push the price to $0.035, which means whoever is purchasing now will have an instant 16.67% profit. The opportunity to benefit from these gains is rapidly decreasing, and smart money is already moving. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early momentum and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a huge $100,000 giveaway . A total of 10 fortunate early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard system the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be incentivized. As the users climb up the ranks they will be given bonus tokens token thus holding becomes fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and kick-starts ecosystem growth in high-gear. Long Term-built and Audited Mutuum Finance is building credibility from its hype. Certik has done a tight audit of its smart contracts which reassure investors that the code is secure and transparent. And to make its ecosystem even more robust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a fully collateralized, USD-pegged algorithmic stablecoin on Ethereum that will introduce long-term liquidity, stability, and reliability to institutional and retail customers. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) is losing its spotlight, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building serious momentum as the next crypto poised for explosive growth. With over $11 million already raised and 12,300+ investors already secured, the project is tearing through Phase 5 of presale at $0.03, providing purchasers with a clear chance to double their investment before public launch. Analysts are calling for a potential 120x to 300x upside by 2026 based on its audited smart contracts, real DeFi use case, and upcoming stablecoin launch.

While Tron has long been a significant player in the blockchain space, analysts now believe Ruvi AI represents a smarter investment thanks to its structured growth , real-world applications , and massive potential for returns. With over $1.9 million raised , more than 1,600 holders , and a bold 66x ROI prediction , Ruvi AI is garnering serious attention from investors. Why Ruvi AI Could Outshine Tron Tron is known for its blockchain capabilities and strong connections to the entertainment sector. However, its growth has often been tied to hype rather than sustained utility. Ruvi AI sets itself apart by pairing blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance. This utility ensures that RUVI tokens are not only functional but also indispensable across various industries. What truly separates Ruvi AI is its structured growth model. During its ongoing Phase 2 presale , RUVI tokens are priced at an accessible $0.015 each. The next milestone is a guaranteed $0.07 valuation post-presale, offering early investors an almost 5x ROI . Analysts are even more optimistic about Ruvi AI’s potential, forecasting a $1 post-listing valuation, which could deliver a staggering 66x ROI. While Tron relies heavily on maintaining market momentum, Ruvi AI offers a clear, transparent trajectory that appeals to both whales and retail investors. A Strong Presale Performance Builds Confidence Ruvi AI’s early presale success firmly establishes its credibility and market potential, with achievements that include: Over $1.9 million raised , demonstrating strong confidence from early investors. More than 160 million tokens sold , underlining increasing demand. A growing community of 1,600+ holders , showcasing widespread interest. The guaranteed post-presale price of $0.07 eliminates speculation and provides stability, making Ruvi AI highly attractive compared to many projects that lack a clear pricing strategy. Maximize Returns with Ruvi AI’s VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI further incentivizes early investors with an innovative VIP investment tier system designed to reward larger contributions with substantial bonuses. Here’s how they break down: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tailored tiers not only enhance the ROI for early supporters but also encourage significant contributions, boosting confidence in Ruvi AI’s long-term vision. Security and Transparency Reassure Investors Transparency and security are critical in the crypto space, and Ruvi AI excels in both areas. The platform has undergone a successful audit by CyberScope , a leading blockchain security firm, ensuring that its infrastructure is secure, reliable, and free from vulnerabilities. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity , allowing RUVI tokens to be traded immediately after listing. This seamless access further increases Ruvi AI’s appeal to both seasoned and first-time crypto investors. Practical Applications Drive Longevity Unlike the speculative basis of many tokens, Ruvi AI derives its value from practical, real-world applications. Here’s how RUVI is making an impact: Marketing: Businesses use Ruvi AI’s AI-powered insights to optimize ad targeting, refine campaigns, and maximize returns.

Imagine a Nasdaq-listed company making a substantial move into cryptocurrency, specifically targeting BNB. This isn’t just a rumor; it’s a plan being spearheaded by former executives from a notable investment firm, aiming to replicate a strategy that has already made waves in the market. A Major Step for BNB Investment Former Coral Capital executives Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger, and Johnathan Pasch are reportedly on the verge of completing a significant fundraising round. The goal? To amass $100 million. This substantial capital isn’t destined for traditional assets; instead, it’s earmarked for a large-scale BNB investment . This planned purchase signals a strong belief in the future prospects of the BNB token and the broader BNB Chain ecosystem. A $100 million acquisition of BNB tokens would be a notable event in the crypto market. It represents a considerable influx of capital specifically directed at BNB, potentially impacting its market dynamics. Such a large purchase, especially from an entity linked to traditional finance executives and operating through a public company structure, could be interpreted as a bullish signal by market participants. Introducing Build & Build Corporation: The Vehicle The mechanism for this ambitious plan is a Nasdaq-listed company currently under the control of these executives. Once the necessary fundraising is finalized, this company is set to undergo a transformation. It will be rebranded and renamed to Build & Build Corporation . This name change itself hints at the company’s future direction, aligning its identity closely with the asset it intends to hold in its treasury. The decision to use a publicly traded company as the vehicle for this crypto acquisition is a critical detail. It brings a level of transparency and regulatory oversight not always present in direct private crypto investments. For investors in Build & Build Corporation , this means their exposure to the crypto market, specifically BNB, will be through shares in a regulated entity. This structure might appeal to a different class of investors compared to direct token ownership. Why Nasdaq Crypto Exposure Matters The fact that this BNB investment is planned through a company listed on Nasdaq, a major global stock exchange, is highly significant. It provides another avenue for investors in traditional financial markets to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, albeit indirectly through corporate stock. While not the first public company to hold crypto, the focus on BNB through a newly renamed entity specifically for this purpose is noteworthy. Nasdaq listing requires adherence to specific reporting standards and regulatory frameworks. A company like Build & Build Corporation holding a substantial amount of crypto in its treasury will need to disclose its holdings and strategy to its shareholders and regulatory bodies. This increased transparency, while potentially adding administrative burden, can also build confidence among a wider range of investors who are more comfortable with traditional financial structures. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Investment This planned $100 million BNB investment is another clear indicator of a growing trend: the increasing involvement of institutions and traditional finance professionals in the cryptocurrency space. What started with pioneers like Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy exploring Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset is now expanding to other cryptocurrencies and attracting executives from established financial backgrounds. Why are we seeing more Institutional crypto investment ? Several factors are at play: Search for Yield and Growth: In a low-interest-rate environment, institutions are seeking alternative assets that offer potential for higher returns. Inflation Hedging Narrative: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin initially, gained traction as potential hedges against inflation, attracting treasury departments. Increased Legitimacy: The maturing crypto market, improved infrastructure (custody, trading platforms), and clearer regulatory discussions have made it more palatable for institutions. Diversification: Adding digital assets can offer diversification benefits to traditional portfolios due to their relatively low correlation with other asset classes at times. The move by the former Coral Capital executives fits squarely within this narrative of expanding Institutional crypto investment beyond just Bitcoin. Adopting the Crypto Treasury Strategy The inspiration behind the planned strategy for Build & Build Corporation is explicitly linked to Michael Saylor’s pioneering approach at MicroStrategy. Saylor’s firm became famous for accumulating vast amounts of Bitcoin, holding it on its balance sheet as a primary treasury reserve asset, rather than traditional cash or equivalents. This Crypto treasury strategy involves using corporate funds, and in some cases leveraging debt, to acquire and hold cryptocurrency long-term. The belief is that the potential appreciation of the crypto asset will outweigh the costs and risks associated with holding it, ultimately benefiting shareholders. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature MicroStrategy Model (Saylor) Build & Build Corporation Plan Target Asset Primarily Bitcoin (BTC) Primarily BNB Vehicle Existing Public Company (MSTR) Newly Renamed Public Company Strategy Inspiration Bitcoin as Treasury Reserve Michael Saylor’s Approach Initial Capital Started with existing treasury, later raised debt/equity Targeting $100M fundraising While inspired by Saylor, the key difference here is the target asset: BNB instead of Bitcoin. This suggests the executives see specific value or potential in the BNB ecosystem and its native token for their Crypto treasury strategy . Who are the Executives? Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger, and Johnathan Pasch are the former Coral Capital executives behind this initiative. Their background in traditional finance, particularly from a firm like Coral Capital which focuses on alternative investments, provides them with experience in navigating complex financial landscapes and raising significant capital. Their pivot towards a dedicated crypto treasury strategy through a public company is a notable career move. Why BNB Specifically? The choice of BNB as the primary asset for this substantial investment is intriguing. BNB is the native token of the BNB Chain ecosystem, which includes the BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain. It has multiple use cases, including: Utility within the Binance exchange (trading fee discounts). Participation in token sales on Binance Launchpad. Governance rights on the BNB Chain. Gas for transactions on BNB Smart Chain. Participation in staking and DeFi activities. The executives might be betting on the continued growth and adoption of the BNB Chain ecosystem, the utility of the token, or perhaps a belief that BNB is currently undervalued relative to its potential or compared to other large-cap cryptocurrencies. A large BNB investment suggests confidence in its long-term value proposition. Potential Benefits of This Strategy Shareholder Value: If BNB appreciates, the value of Build & Build Corporation’s treasury increases, potentially boosting the company’s stock price. Market Signal: A $100M BNB investment from a public company can lend further legitimacy to BNB and the broader altcoin market in the eyes of traditional investors. Ecosystem Support: While primarily a treasury play, a large holder could potentially engage with the BNB ecosystem, although the primary goal seems to be asset appreciation. Diversification (for the company): Adding a digital asset provides diversification away from purely traditional holdings. Potential Challenges and Risks Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for extreme price swings. A significant downturn in BNB’s price would directly impact the value of Build & Build Corporation’s treasury and potentially its stock price. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, including specific tokens like BNB, is still evolving globally. Changes could impact the viability or perception of this strategy. Execution Risk: Successfully raising $100 million and executing a large-scale token purchase requires careful planning and execution to minimize market impact. BNB Specific Risks: Risks related to the BNB Chain ecosystem, potential exploits, or issues specific to Binance (given BNB’s origins) could negatively affect the investment. What Does This Mean for the Market? This planned move highlights several key trends. Firstly, the Crypto treasury strategy popularized by MicroStrategy is gaining traction and being applied to assets beyond Bitcoin. Secondly, traditional finance professionals are increasingly comfortable not just investing in crypto funds, but actively managing corporate treasuries with digital assets. Finally, it puts a spotlight on BNB as an asset class attracting significant capital, suggesting growing institutional interest in major altcoins. For investors, this could mean watching Build & Build Corporation’s fundraising progress and subsequent BNB acquisition closely. It also reinforces the idea that the lines between traditional finance and crypto are continuing to blur, with public companies becoming direct holders of digital assets. Conclusion The reported plan by former Coral Capital executives to raise $100 million for a significant BNB investment through their Nasdaq-listed firm, soon to be Build & Build Corporation , marks a notable development in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Inspired by the successful Crypto treasury strategy seen with Bitcoin, this move specifically targets BNB, highlighting its growing prominence. As Institutional crypto investment continues to evolve, actions like these, bringing crypto exposure onto traditional platforms like Nasdaq crypto , pave new pathways for capital flow into the digital asset space, while also presenting unique opportunities and risks for investors to consider.

NEAR’s network activity remains strong, but price movement is limited. Solana has slipped into a narrow band between $143 and $152 after a sharp dip, and traders are on alert for the next breakout move. With both showing hesitation, many are looking toward the crypto with most potential as Q3 begins. BlockDAG appears to be filling that space. Its upcoming July miner launch could prove to be a major turning point. The phrase “How BlockDAG’s July Miner Rollout Creates the Strongest Post-Listing Floor We’ve Seen in Years” is more than just a headline. With $318.5 million already raised out of the $600 million target, and with the coin available at $0.0020 until June 24, the opportunity to join BlockDAG at this rate will not stay open for long. BlockDAG’s July Miner Rollout Signals Utility Before Listing BlockDAG is showing its capabilities before even hitting exchanges. Real mining units like the X10, X30, and X100 will start shipping in July, powering the network ahead of listing. This kind of early network activity is what sets BlockDAG apart and makes the July miner launch a major reason this project could create one of the most solid listing price floors in recent memory. On top of its hardware plan, BlockDAG has raised $318.5 million of its $600 million presale goal. This is not promotional capital, but actual funds aimed at ensuring stability, CEX depth, and post-launch volume. With 20 platforms confirmed, including 5 Tier-1 exchanges, BDAG is not showing up empty-handed. It is coming in prepared. For those scanning the market for the crypto with most potential that is still largely off the radar, BlockDAG stands out. Currently in Batch 29 out of 45, BlockDAG’s presale has surpassed $318.5 million and sold more than 23.2 billion coins. The current $0.0020 price is only available for a short time before it jumps to $0.0030 on June 24. It is the final low entry before the next batch pricing begins. With hardware shipping very soon, real user activity underway, and the $600M target nearing, BlockDAG is showing substance and structure, giving it a strong case as the crypto with most potential, without making empty promises. Near Protocol (NEAR) News: Strong User Base Despite Price Pullback The latest Near Protocol (NEAR) news shows a recent dip in price, though network usage remains solid. NEAR dropped to about $2.23 on June 14, down more than 10 percent in a day. Still, daily trading volume topped $250 million, indicating ongoing trader interest. Analysts see short-term resistance at $2.30 and support at $2.18, with charts pointing to potential rebounds toward $4.90 or even $8.00 later in the year. While price momentum is lacking now, the fundamentals are intact. NEAR is now the second-most active Layer-1 network, logging 46 million monthly users, more than Ethereum and Binance Chain. Recent Near Protocol (NEAR) news also notes technical expansion, such as tools for account abstraction and DeFi integration that are drawing attention from AI and Web3 developers. As macro issues like global instability add pressure to the sector, NEAR is holding steady. It may not lead in short-term charts, but it remains positioned for future gains. Solana (SOL) Price Action Stays Flat After Recent Slide The Solana (SOL) price action has remained in a tight pattern since June 13, when SOL dropped nearly 8 percent to $142, before rebounding slightly to $147. Buyers defended the $143 to $144 range quickly, and the price has since stayed between $145 and $152. Analysts are watching for a move beyond $158 to $161, which could push SOL toward $179 or $195. If it loses the $143 support, it may slip back to $127. Technicals remain balanced. Indicators like RSI and MACD point to mild upward momentum. The broader 200-week moving average is offering support. Resistance at $152 is the key short-term target. Binance expects SOL to remain around $146 to $147 for now. However, with ETF-related optimism gaining ground, a breakout could arrive unexpectedly. For now, the Solana (SOL) price action is stable, with strong core metrics holding the structure while traders wait for a move. Closing Thoughts The Near Protocol (NEAR) news reflects strong usage and a healthy network, though the price remains under $2.30. The Solana (SOL) price action continues to hover near $143 while facing resistance near $152. Both projects have potential over the long term, but at the moment, they are not moving quickly. This has led many market watchers to shift their attention to newer projects with more immediate movement. BlockDAG is one of those projects. Its miner delivery will start in July, and with the $600 million presale target nearing fast, it’s not starting from zero. The presale has now raised $318.5 million, and the $0.0020 offer remains available briefly before increasing to $0.0030 on June 24. Backed by working infrastructure and real capital, BlockDAG is proving it could be the crypto with most potential, and it is doing that even before listing. For those watching the top players while seeking entry into a high-potential opportunity, this might be the time.

Data from Cathiesark.com , which tracks the investment firm’s equity holdings and trades, shows that ARK Invest offloaded $238.2 million worth of CRCL between June 16th and June 20th. On June 20th alone, ARK Invest sold $111.6 million in the stablecoin issuer’s shares just as CRCL’s price erupted by more than 20% in just one day. The issuer of the second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC and the euro-pegged Euro Coin ( EURC ) made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 5th, four years after the firm initially announced plans to go public. On its first trading day, CRCL ripped from its debut price of $69 to $103 before giving up gains and closing at $83. Since then, CRCL has been in a strong uptrend, soaring to its current all-time high of $248 last week after the US Senate voted 68-30 with bipartisan support in favor of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act ( GENIUS Act ), which would establish a framework for stablecoin issuers. The bill aims to require stablecoin issuers with a $50 billion market capitalization to have full asset backing, monthly reserve disclosures and yearly audits. As of Friday’s close, CRCL is worth $240.28 per share.

Recent data shows that capital from Ethereum and Bitcoin whales is rotating into emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Injective Protocol . Analysts tracking blockchain flows confirm that this accumulation isn’t random—it’s strategic. Ethereum (ETH): Volatility Breeds Opportunity Ethereum is experiencing a wave of institutional interest despite recent price swings. The Pectra upgrade and approval of Ethereum spot ETFs have solidified ETH’s position as the foundational Layer 1 for smart contracts. SharpLink Gaming’s acquisition of over 176,000 ETH and stake of 95% of that amount reflects the kind of confidence whales currently have in Ethereum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Smart Money Is Entering Early Behind the scenes, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a magnet for early institutional-style capital. The token has already locked in its total supply at 170 billion, eliminating long-term inflation risks. Its smart contract has been independently audited by HashEx, and its staking feature is now live—transforming MAGACOIN FINANCE from a meme contender into a serious altcoin asset. The most telling signal? On-chain data shows large wallet purchases are not only growing—they’re being staked rather than flipped. That’s long-term behavior. Combined with the limited-time PATRIOTS100X bonus offer, which adds value to early entries, analysts say this setup could lead to one of the biggest altcoin revaluations of the year. Bitcoin (BTC): Stabilizing as a Store, Not a Strategy Bitcoin remains the gold standard, but growth-focused investors are watching it flatten out. While whales continue to accumulate BTC as a store of value, a quiet trend is unfolding: early BTC participants are reallocating a portion of their capital into smaller, faster-moving altcoins. This isn’t a bearish move on Bitcoin—it’s a bet that projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE can deliver asymmetric returns in a bullish environment. Injective Protocol (INJ): ETF Rumors and DeFi Growth Injective Protocol is gaining new ground thanks to rumors of a staked INJ ETF and rising ecosystem value. Its total value locked has surged 22% recently, and ETF filings in Delaware signal a potential mainstream listing. Traders view INJ as both a DeFi infrastructure bet and a technical breakout candidate. If the bullish momentum holds above the $13 mark, analysts predict a push to $15–$16 is within reach. Final Outlook: Smart Capital, Strategic Positioning Ethereum and Bitcoin holders aren’t abandoning their core positions—they’re diversifying into altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Injective Protocol that offer meaningful upside. With utility, scarcity, staking, and strong entry incentives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming one of 2025’s most strategic altcoin plays.

A recent statement from a senior official in Iran has sent ripples through news circles, suggesting the potential for a protracted conflict. This forecast of a lengthy Iran war raises significant questions about its potential effects, not only on regional stability but also on global financial markets, including the ever-sensitive cryptocurrency space. What Did the Iranian Official Say About the Iran War? According to a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X (formerly Twitter), a senior Iranian official conveyed a stark assessment to CNN. The official reportedly stated that the ongoing conflict could potentially extend for up to two years. Furthermore, the official indicated that Iran is fully prepared for such a prolonged duration of hostilities. This statement is particularly noteworthy because it comes from within Iran’s official circles and provides a specific, albeit lengthy, timeline expectation for the conflict. While the specific conflict being referenced wasn’t explicitly detailed in the brief report, it is widely understood to pertain to the broader regional tensions and proxy conflicts involving Iran, likely including the ongoing situation stemming from the Israel-Hamas war and related skirmishes. The readiness expressed by Iran for a two-year conflict suggests a deep-seated expectation of enduring tension and potential engagement, highlighting the entrenched nature of the current Middle East conflict . Understanding the Broader Geopolitical Risk Geopolitical risk is a critical factor that influences international relations, economic stability, and financial markets. It refers to the risk that political events, such as wars, terrorist attacks, or political instability, will negatively impact an investment or a market. Historically, periods of heightened geopolitical tension lead to increased market volatility. Investors often seek ‘safe haven’ assets during such times. Traditional safe havens include gold, certain government bonds (like US Treasuries), and sometimes reserve currencies like the US dollar. However, the role of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a safe haven is a subject of ongoing debate and varies depending on the specific crisis and market conditions. A potential two-year conflict forecast emanating from a key regional player like Iran amplifies this geopolitical risk significantly. It signals not a short-term skirmish, but a potentially enduring period of instability that could have far-reaching consequences. How Does Geopolitical Risk Impact the Crypto Market? The relationship between geopolitical events and the crypto market impact is complex and not always straightforward. Unlike traditional markets with centuries of historical data on crisis reactions, the crypto market is relatively young and influenced by a unique mix of factors, including: Investor Sentiment: Fear and uncertainty driven by conflict can lead to panic selling across all asset classes, including crypto. Conversely, some investors might turn to decentralized assets if they lose faith in traditional financial systems or fiat currencies during times of global instability . Safe Haven Narrative: Bitcoin was designed outside traditional financial systems, leading some to believe it acts as ‘digital gold’ during crises. However, its price often correlates with tech stocks and risk assets, meaning it can also fall sharply during sell-offs. Its safe haven status is not universally accepted or consistently demonstrated. Liquidity and Capital Flows: Major global conflicts can disrupt economic activity, supply chains, and international trade, potentially impacting global liquidity. Changes in how central banks and governments respond to economic fallout (e.g., through monetary policy) can indirectly affect crypto valuations. Regulatory Responses: Increased global instability might prompt governments to tighten regulations on cryptocurrencies, viewing them as potential tools for illicit finance or capital flight, which could negatively impact market sentiment and accessibility. Regional Specifics: While this statement comes from Iran, the broader Middle East conflict can affect regional crypto adoption and use cases. In areas experiencing currency devaluation or economic sanctions, crypto might see increased use, but this is often localized and doesn’t necessarily dictate global market trends. A prolonged Middle East conflict , as suggested by the Iranian official, could sustain or even increase volatility in the crypto market. While some might buy Bitcoin hoping it acts as a hedge against inflation or instability, others might sell crypto alongside traditional assets in a general flight to cash or more conventional safe havens. Analyzing Potential Scenarios for Crypto Market Impact: Given the forecast of a potentially two-year Iran war scenario, here are a few ways this could play out for crypto: Scenario 1: Sustained Volatility and Correlation with Risk Assets The most likely scenario where crypto continues to trade largely in line with other risk-on assets like technology stocks. Periods of escalating tension lead to sell-offs. Periods of de-escalation or perceived resolution lead to rallies. The prolonged nature means sustained periods of uncertainty and price swings. Scenario 2: Emergence of Bitcoin as a ‘Crisis Asset’ Less likely to be a dominant global trend, but possible in specific contexts. Could occur if the conflict leads to significant distrust in fiat currencies or traditional financial institutions in certain regions. Might see localized spikes in crypto adoption in affected areas, but global prices still heavily influenced by broader macro factors. Scenario 3: Negative Impact from Broader Economic Downturn A prolonged conflict could significantly harm the global economy through energy price shocks, supply chain disruptions, and reduced consumer confidence. A global recession or significant economic slowdown would likely weigh heavily on all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, regardless of their perceived safe haven properties. The crypto market impact here is a symptom of the larger economic fallout from global instability . What Does Iran’s Preparedness Mean? The statement that Iran is ‘prepared for that possibility’ adds another layer to the analysis. This preparedness could refer to various aspects: Military Readiness: Ensuring their armed forces and proxies are equipped and ready for sustained operations. Economic Resilience: Implementing strategies to mitigate the economic impact of a prolonged conflict, including potential sanctions or disruptions. Political Will: Signaling to both domestic and international audiences that they have the political resolve to endure a lengthy period of tension or conflict. Resource Allocation: Having the necessary resources (financial, material, human) earmarked or available for a prolonged engagement. This readiness suggests a calculated stance, implying that the potential for a two-year conflict is not just an offhand comment but a scenario that has been considered and planned for within Iran’s strategic thinking regarding the Middle East conflict . Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for extended global instability stemming from the forecast Iran war duration, what should crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Pay close attention to geopolitical developments, particularly those in the Middle East and how major global powers react. Understand that geopolitical news can cause sudden market movements. Assess Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical risk increases overall market volatility. Ensure your crypto investments align with your personal risk tolerance, especially if you are sensitive to large price swings. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, not just within crypto. Relying solely on crypto as a safe haven during a major global conflict is a high-risk strategy. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term geopolitical events, while impactful in the moment, may be less significant than the underlying fundamentals of the crypto projects or the broader adoption trends. However, a prolonged conflict could have long-term economic consequences that affect all markets. Avoid Emotional Decisions: During periods of high tension and market volatility, it’s crucial to avoid making impulsive trading decisions based on fear or panic. Stick to a pre-defined investment strategy. The crypto market impact of a prolonged geopolitical risk event like a potential two-year Iran war is multifaceted. It underscores the interconnectedness of global events and financial markets, reminding investors that even decentralized assets are not immune to the ripple effects of international conflict and global instability . Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in the Crypto Landscape The statement from a senior Iranian official forecasting a potential two-year conflict duration is a significant piece of information in the current volatile geopolitical climate. It highlights the potential for a prolonged Middle East conflict and sustained geopolitical risk . For the crypto market, this translates into the potential for continued volatility and uncertainty. While the narrative of crypto as a safe haven may gain traction in some corners, the dominant crypto market impact is likely to be tied to broader market reactions to global instability and the potential economic fallout of a protracted Iran war . Investors should remain vigilant, stay informed about geopolitical developments, and approach the market with caution, prioritizing risk management and a clear strategy over reactive decisions driven by headlines.

After weeks of choppy price action and a sharp pullback, SOL price has rebounded impressively from the $124 zone and is now trading around the $135 to $138 range. This bounce comes at a time when the broader crypto market is grappling with uncertainty, making Solana’s resilience all the more noteworthy. But what’s fueling this rebound? Is it just a technical bounce, or are there stronger fundamental forces at play, like ETF speculation and institutional adoption? Recent Pullback & Recovery: What Just Happened? Solana experienced a sharp drop below the $130 support level last week, briefly dipping to around $124. This move triggered panic among short-term holders, but it turned out to be a classic liquidity sweep—flushing out weak hands before a rebound. The bounce was quick and decisive, with SOL reclaiming the $135 level within days. This type of V-shaped recovery is often observed when there is strong underlying demand, which appears to be the case here. Solana Price Prediction: Where Will SOL Head Next? The SOL price has been maintaining a steep bearish trend but continues to remain within a bullish pattern. The token has rebounded from the lower support of the descending parallel channel, which hints towards a bullish continuation towards the resistance. But the question arises, will the SOL price rise above the pivotal resistance at $142? As seen in the above chart, the SOL price is attempting to rise to the neckline of the cup & handle pattern. A breakout from the range is expected to elevate the levels towards the highs above $220 initially and later above $250. As the RSI has displayed a bullish divergence, the price is expected to rise above $142 and reach the resistance at around $155. Otherwise, the handle could get extended, which may transform into a bearish trend. However, this appears to be unlikely, as the price is an inch away from the psychological barrier at $140. Therefore, if fundamentals continue to improve, Solana (SOL) price is expected to revisit above $300 in the next bullish wave.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 20:13:01

Following its last venture above $1 in February, the JUP token has maintained a relentless bearish trajectory, shedding over 33% in the past month alone and plummeting 82.73% from its post-launch peak of $2.04. Source: Cryptonews Currently, the token is valued at $0.3629. Holders who exited positions before this catastrophic decline are lucky to have done so before the massive crash. Jupiter Founder Suspends DAO Voting in a Desperate Move to Rescue JUP Token One trader who liquidated his substantial holdings around $0.70 expressed disbelief, stating that as Solana’s most recognizable token, nobody anticipated JUP’s descent toward “worthlessness.” Thank God I sold my last $JUP around $0.70. It was probably just luck, because being the most well-known token on Solana, you wouldn’t expect it to drop to zero… but still I guess no real utility + big unlocks is what drives the price. Phew, dodged a bullet. pic.twitter.com/egjVjBJwla — Roidz (@Deroidz) June 22, 2025 This investor attributed JUP’s deterioration to the token’s absence of genuine utility and large token releases from the development team. On June 19, Jupiter Exchange’s chief operating officer, Kash Dhanda, attempted to address mounting community frustrations regarding the lack of strategic planning to enhance Jupiter’s token utility. Kash announced that the Jupiter Foundation would suspend its DAO voting mechanism to concentrate efforts on strengthening the Jupiter and Jupiverse ecosystems. He emphasized that the Jupiter exchange is currently at a key juncture, requiring immediate action to shape DeFi’s future, as this window of opportunity won’t remain available indefinitely. A Solana maximalist endorsed this decision, describing the removal of DAO voting as a major step toward rehabilitating JUP’s trajectory.

His perspective is centered on “enabling stakers while avoiding deterrence of prospective investors.” Token Unlocks Massacre: Why JUP Became Solana’s Biggest Disappointment Another cryptocurrency supporter shared comparable views , expressing hope that JUP DAO would permanently abandon the voting mechanism. “ What an absurd energy drain for such a talented team to continuously debate trivial working group compensation controversies ,” he commented. He noted that billions in JUP market capitalization vanished over minor five-figure funding decisions. He proposed alternative value-creation models, such as buyback programs that benefit holders and enhance JUP token price performance. Despite deteriorating price action and diminishing investor trust, the Jupiter Foundation continues to deliver new products and achieve major milestones. On June 22, Jupiter Exchange announced that the DEX aggregator had surpassed $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume, processing over 1.7 billion swaps from 49 million unique traders. $1 trillion in volume 1.7 billion swaps 49 million traders Just use Jupiter pic.twitter.com/maaJOYqjDX — Jupiter ( , ) (@JupiterExchange) June 22, 2025 This achievement represents the highest volume among all Solana-based decentralized exchanges.

Bitcoin Trader Calls 174% JUP Rally, Tags “$0.3371” as the Death Line Within the past 24 hours alone, Jupiter accumulated over $3.8 million in transaction fees , surpassing even Uniswap, Ethereum’s largest DEX.

Jupiter RSI at 33: Is JUP’s Oversold Bounce About to Explode? The JUP/USDT daily analysis reveals the price maintaining a grip on key support at $0.3371, which bulls must successfully defend to prevent additional declines. After testing this support zone, the asset has shown modest recovery to approximately $0.3594, indicating renewed purchasing interest. Source: TradingView Nevertheless, the overall technical structure remains bearish following an extended downtrend and recent rejection near the $0.50 resistance level. The 9-day Simple Moving Average trades below current price levels, suggesting potential for near-term recovery momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI hovers around 33.54 , reflecting oversold market conditions and implying a possible technical rebound. Should the $0.3371 support level be maintained, price movement toward $0.3889 and potentially $0.4981 could materialize. However, a breach below this key support threshold would expose new downside targets and perpetuate bearish pressure. Bulls need to recapture the $0.3889 level to validate any sustainable recovery trajectory.
