Bitcoin has led the way with solid gains, and now attention is shifting to altcoins that may follow. As price movements become more active, some coins are starting to stand out. Web3 ai, XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana are among the projects drawing serious attention. Their rising activity suggests now could be a key moment to explore options. Finding the top crypto right now is not only about what’s trending. It is also about timing and seeing what’s next before momentum peaks. These four picks are beginning to look interesting to those who follow market signals. Web3 ai: AI-Driven Features Catch Early Interest Web3 ai is becoming a widely discussed project in today’s market. It is designed to offer smart crypto tools for better insights and actions. Rather than focusing on hype, the project is building features that aim to solve common challenges faced by users. Key tools include AI-supported risk detection, real-time portfolio monitoring, and systems that help spot scam activity. These options can assist users who want to make clearer decisions without heavy research. The platform is designed for use across experience levels. Right now, Web3 ai is in Stage 9 of its presale, with $WAI priced at $0.000443. So far, it has raised over $8.3 million. With its listing set at $0.005242, early supporters could see gains reaching 1747%. For those exploring early-stage options, this phase could offer one. XRP: Climb Supported by Regulation and Market Strength XRP is climbing again as it trades near $2.20, with a market cap of $130 billion. Ripple’s recent regulatory clarity has boosted trust in the coin, especially since it moved beyond the $0.50 resistance. This progress has sparked renewed interest from institutions closely tracking Ripple’s developments. XRP is gaining steady traction, supported by public endorsements. If it clears the $2.50 resistance level, the next target could be $3. That’s why some view it as the top crypto right now for those seeking a mix of stability and upside potential. DOGE: Chart Signals and Community Buzz Keep It Active Dogecoin is priced around $0.20, holding a $30 billion market cap. Its weekly chart reveals a bullish engulfing pattern, suggesting possible short-term movement. Though it started as a meme coin, DOGE remains relevant thanks to its liquidity and strong user support. Fueled by community engagement and regular attention online, DOGE remains in the spotlight. For those looking at the top crypto right now with fast-moving potential, Dogecoin continues to offer a familiar and reactive option. SOL: Builds Strength Through Ecosystem Expansion Solana trades near $160 and carries a market cap of around $83.49 billion. Its weekly chart features a bullish reversal pattern, hinting at a buyer-driven recovery. The Solana ecosystem of dApps and NFTs is steadily growing, adding strength to its position. Its scalable infrastructure helps it maintain momentum in the smart contract field. If SOL breaks its former resistance near $294, strong gains could follow. As interest grows in efficient platforms, many consider Solana a top crypto right now for its network growth and utility. Presale Contender: Exploring What’s Driving Attention in Crypto Let’s recap and examine which option holds the most potential in today’s dynamic market. XRP draws continued interest due to market backing and regulatory progress. Dogecoin benefits from strong community energy and technical signs of movement. Solana remains active, supported by its fast network and expanding ecosystem. Still, Web3 ai is catching attention in a different way. It is currently in its presale phase, offering an AI-focused platform with practical applications. With $WAI priced at $0.000443 and more than $8.3 million raised, it has strong early traction. A projected ROI of 1747% adds to its appeal. For those exploring the top crypto right now , Web3 ai may stand out as the option with the most long-term upside when entered early.

46569814,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72206,1750626045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Dogecoin’s (DOGE) $1 Dream Faces a New Challenger, Can Ruvi AI’s Audited Token Reach It First?",https://timestabloid.com/dogecoins-doge-1-dream-faces-a-new-challenger-can-ruvi/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the people’s cryptocurrency, entertaining dreams of a $1 valuation driven by its dedicated fanbase and strong community. However, a new challenger has entered the fray, and analysts believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) might outpace Dogecoin in the race to $1. With a structured growth plan, cutting-edge technology, and an impressive presale performance, Ruvi AI has fast become the focus of investors looking for major returns. Why Ruvi AI Might Win the $1 Race Dogecoin has leaned on its meme-inspired origins and celebrity support, while Ruvi AI sets itself apart with real-world utility . By integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI solves industry problems in marketing , entertainment , and finance , ensuring demand beyond speculation. This practical approach creates long-term value that Dogecoin, lacking utility, may struggle to match. Ruvi AI also offers a structured growth model that eliminates guesswork. During Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are available for just $0.015 each , allowing early investors to enter at a low price. Once the presale concludes, the token’s value is guaranteed to reach $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts predict RUVI could hit $1 once listed , representing a 66x ROI for those who buy in now. These figures mark Ruvi AI as a serious contender in the crypto space. Presale Performance Reflects Strong Investor Support Ruvi AI’s presale has been nothing short of exceptional, with numbers that underscore its potential. Here are the key achievements so far: $1.9 million raised , underscoring strong investor interest. Over 160 million tokens sold , demonstrating healthy demand. A community of more than 1,600 holders , showcasing a growing investor base dedicated to Ruvi AI. One major factor drawing investors is the guaranteed $0.07 valuation after the presale , which contrasts with Dogecoin’s highly volatile price movements. This clarity reduces uncertainty and makes Ruvi AI a safer, more predictable investment. Amplify Returns with Ruvi AI VIP Tiers Investors aiming to maximize their gains are flocking to Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers , which offer impressive bonuses at different contribution levels. Here’s how each tier stacks up: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers allow early backers to secure significant advantages, showcasing the scalability of Ruvi AI’s returns. Transparency and Security Reinforce Ruvi AI’s Strengths Ruvi AI is not just about growth; it prioritizes investor confidence. The project recently underwent a third-party audit by CyberScope , ensuring that its platform is technologically secure and reliable. Combined with its partnership with WEEX Exchange , which guarantees post-presale liquidity , RUVI tokens will be immediately tradable upon listing, unlike many new projects that leave investors waiting. Real-World Applications Ensure Longevity While Dogecoin depends on hype and social validation, Ruvi AI’s broad utility creates sustainable value over the long term. Its real-world applications include: Marketing: AI-powered tools that improve advertising ROI by optimizing ad targeting and execution. Entertainment: Blockchain-backed payments and AI-driven personalization, boosting creators’ revenues and engagement. Finance: Fraud detection solutions, scalable systems, and enhanced transparency to modernize financial operations. These innovations not only differentiate Ruvi AI but also ensure relevance across diverse markets, making RUVI a valuable token regardless of crypto market trends. Why Ruvi AI Could Beat Dogecoin to $1 Dogecoin’s path to $1 relies heavily on market sentiment and social media buzz, while Ruvi AI’s structured growth, utility, and scalability make it a more reliable bet . Starting at just $0.015 , with a guaranteed $0.07 valuation post-presale and a forecasted $1 price , Ruvi AI offers a clear and enticing roadmap for investors. With over $1.9 million raised , 160 million tokens sold , and its partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI has already taken significant steps toward becoming a leader in the crypto space.

Chainlink (LINK) is holding steady at the $13.40 mark, supported by rising whale activity. Traders are eyeing a possible 15% rebound from this level. NEAR Protocol is making waves with its plan to reach an incredible 1 million transactions per second (TPS) this year. Its tech upgrades, including adaptive resharding and advanced zero-knowledge proofs, are driving excitement. Meanwhile, Unstaked (UNSD) is capturing massive interest in its presale. The project has now raised over $10.4 million, with more than 1.1 billion tokens sold. With its AI-first approach, Proof of Intelligence (PoI) system, and a $1 million giveaway boosting visibility, Unstaked is fast becoming one of the most talked-about new projects for 2025. For buyers seeking promising altcoins in today’s crowded market, these three stand out for their potential and unique strengths. Chainlink Defends Key $13.40 Level Chainlink (LINK) is holding firm at the $13.40 support level, catching attention after four consecutive days of decline. Large holders appear to be accumulating, with 1.78 million LINK (valued at $25.53 million) moved from BitGet to a private wallet and another $4.49 million withdrawn from exchanges, signaling long-term confidence. Despite a 6% price dip in 24 hours, trading volume rose 7%, showing strong market interest. Holding $13.40 could trigger a rally to $15.40 (a 15% gain), while a breakdown risks an 18% fall to $10.40. Thanks to its essential role in delivering data to smart contracts, LINK remains a top contender among altcoins for 2025. NEAR Targets 1 Million TPS Milestone NEAR Protocol is setting its sights on an ambitious goal, achieving 1 million transactions per second (TPS) by the end of 2025. According to R&D lead Bowen Wang, this will be powered by adaptive resharding, which allows the network to dynamically scale as user demand increases. Its current Nightshade 2.0 already handles large volumes, but adaptive resharding will enable shards to split or merge based on traffic, improving speed and efficiency. The shift to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will further enhance security. With growing institutional support, including a key partnership with DWF Labs, and strong AI capabilities, NEAR remains one of the most promising altcoins heading into 2025. Unstaked Presale Raises $10.4M With AI-Powered Innovation Leading Growth Unstaked is quickly making its mark with one of the hottest presales of the year. It has already raised more than $10.4 million and sold over 1.1 billion tokens. The project is now in Stage 21, with the coin priced at $0.011739. What makes Unstaked different is its foundation in artificial intelligence. The project runs on a new system called Proof of Intelligence (PoI), which values knowledge and contributions rather than expensive hardware. This is catching on with buyers looking for projects that offer real purpose and not just copycat technology. A $1 million giveaway is also driving huge engagement, helping Unstaked reach more potential buyers ahead of exchange listings. Community members can win prizes and help promote the project across social media. Current presale buyers have already seen steady growth from lower stages, and many expect the price to hit $0.1819 or higher after launch, offering a possible 27x gain. Importantly, Unstaked has no private allocation, meaning everyone can participate equally. The project also has a strong governance model. Coin holders can vote on key decisions, receive performance-based rewards, and use AI tools to help guide development. Unstaked supports cross-chain interactions and will launch its AI-powered agents after the presale ends and the project officially goes live. With this clear vision and growing support, Unstaked is quickly becoming one of the top presales to watch in 2025. Final Verdict As traders move funds in anticipation of a possible summer rally, Chainlink’s strong technical support, NEAR Protocol’s scaling innovations, and Unstaked’s unique AI-first model all shine as great opportunities. LINK and NEAR are established projects adapting to new demands, while Unstaked brings a fresh approach with real utility. For those looking for altcoins with real growth potential in 2025, these three projects offer the key ingredients: useful technology, active communities, and clear paths to creating long-term value.

46570025,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72232,1750626282,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu Loses Steam Near $0.000010 While Analysts Project $MERK Could 50x Before Its First CEX Listing,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-loses-steam-near-0-000010-while-analysts-project-merk/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is holding just above $0.000010 , but despite its massive community and multi-billion dollar market cap, its momentum is weakening . After peaking in late 2024, SHIB has entered a prolonged consolidation phase. Daily volumes remain steady , but without new catalysts, investor attention is drifting, not away from memecoins, but toward newer formats with built-in utility and real-time engagement. Enter Meerkat ($MERK) , a memecoin born on Ethereum, but engineered for Telegram , the platform where crypto-native culture now thrives. With staking, missions, and a gamified miniapp already live during presale, $MERK is shaping up as the first memecoin that actually rewards user action before it even lists. While Shiba Inu holds the past, analysts are watching $MERK as a high-upside contender , projecting 25x–50x potential based on working mechanics, community traction, and transparent tokenomics. Market Snapshot: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Loses Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001050 , marking a decline of over 50% compared to the previous year. Despite maintaining a substantial market cap of $7.53 billion and a loyal base of 1.5 million holders, price action remains flat and lacks clear direction. Daily trading volume hovers around $142 million , indicating that SHIB continues to attract attention from traders, but without meaningful upward movement, that interest hasn’t translated into new momentum. After a short-lived rally in Q4 2024 , SHIB has been consolidating near key psychological levels, with no major catalysts in sight. Even with the launch of Shibarium, adoption has been slower than expected, and user incentives remain weak across the ecosystem. The takeaway: SHIB still holds powerful brand recognition in the memecoin space, but it lacks the mechanisms to activate or retain users in a dynamic way. Investors looking for more than passive holding are beginning to explore alternatives that offer real-time interaction and tangible rewards. A Changing Meta: From Holding to Playing The memecoin era is undergoing a fundamental shift. While early adopters were satisfied with holding tokens in hopes of long-term appreciation, today’s crypto users are demanding more, faster. What’s emerging is a new meta: less speculation, more interaction. Less waiting, more doing. From Passive to Participatory Holding used to be enough. But now, investors want to participate actively in the ecosystem, not just watch from the sidelines. They’re looking for: ● Staking opportunities that reward time and loyalty ● Daily missions and quests that provide utility beyond charts ● Leaderboards and gamified incentives that make engagement visible and valuable In short, they want skin in the game, not just exposure. Communities Want Function, Not Just Culture Memecoins like SHIB built massive communities based on culture and identity. But today, community by itself is not enough. Modern users expect: ● Rewards for activity, not just for holding ● User-centered mechanics that evolve and scale ● Frictionless platforms that don’t require deep technical knowledge This demand is pushing attention toward platforms that blur the lines between social, DeFi, and gaming. Telegram as the New Frontier With its 800M+ monthly users and built-in support for bots and miniapps, Telegram is becoming a natural home for this new wave of crypto engagement. Projects that launch directly inside Telegram, like $MERK, are meeting users where they already are, lowering the barrier to entry and increasing retention through seamless, chat-based experiences. Conclusion: The memecoin game is evolving. And tokens that reward interaction, not just attention, are taking the lead. Telegram Becomes the New Launchpad With over 800 million monthly active users, Telegram has rapidly evolved from a messaging platform into a full-fledged crypto ecosystem. What began with simple bots has grown into a space where miniapps, tokenized experiences, and DeFi tools operate natively inside chat. The key difference lies in the frictionless onboarding. Unlike browser-based dApps that require extensions, wallets, and multi-step setups, Telegram-native tools allow users to engage with tokens, stake assets, and complete tasks with just a few taps. No dashboards, no downloads, no learning curve. This simplicity is driving a new category of adoption, one based on interaction over speculation. Bots and memecoins like $MERK are leading this shift, transforming Telegram chats into action-based economies where every click, mission, or stake creates a loop of engagement and reward. As more users prioritize ease of access and tangible activity over passive holding, utility within messaging apps is quickly becoming the new benchmark for early-stage traction in crypto. Meerkat ($MERK): From Meme to Mechanism Meerkat ($MERK) is a memecoin built on Ethereum, but its real innovation lies in how users interact with it: directly through Telegram. Unlike typical ERC-20 tokens that remain idle in wallets, $MERK is designed for immediate use. From the presale stage, users can already access a fully functional miniapp with live staking, daily missions, XP systems and real-time leaderboards, all without leaving the chat interface. Behind its playful image, Meerkat is built on solid ground. All contracts have been audited by Cyberscope, ensuring transparency and security. Fifty percent of the total supply is permanently locked via UNCX, and the remaining is structured for community access. There are no allocations for VCs or insiders, reflecting a design philosophy focused entirely on fairness and decentralization. The token launched its presale at approximately $0.00018, with confirmed exchange listings on P2B and AscendEX, providing immediate post-launch liquidity. In a space crowded with promises and roadmaps, $MERK stands out for being operational before trading begins. It’s not just a concept, it’s a product. And it’s already rewarding users for showing up. SHIB built a legacy, but $MERK is building loops that actually pay users to participate. If you’re ready to move from passive to active, start today: Check out the live missions at meerkat.wtf or join the Telegram app directly at t.me/meerkatwtf. $MERK Launches Its Own zk-Rollup Layer 2 and AI-Driven Meme Engine $MERK isn’t just building utility inside Telegram, it’s launching an entirely new blockchain layer to support it. The project has announced the deployment of its own zk-rollup Layer 2 on Ethereum, specifically designed to scale meme trading and the tokenization of digital culture. Fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), this new network enables ultra-low fees, fast confirmations, and provides a tailor-made infrastructure for the creation and exchange of viral tokens. But the Layer 2 does more than boost performance, it becomes the core engine powering Meerkat’s ecosystem. It will host both the project’s native AI module and the official Telegram miniapp, enabling users to interact directly with smart contracts and token mechanics without ever leaving the chat. While other projects focus on tokenizing traditional finance, Meerkat presents an alternative vision: a decentralized environment where value is generated through creativity, digital identity, and community energy. With the infrastructure already deployed and aligned with Web3’s cultural evolution, $MERK is positioning itself as the new cultural epicenter of the crypto space. The Burrow: On-Chain Meme Creation at Scale Alongside the launch of its Layer 2, $MERK has activated The Burrow—a fully operational creative environment where users can mint tokenized memes using generative AI and a modular SDK. The Burrow supports: ● ERC-20 and SPL collections ● Automated image and narrative generation ● Integrated minting and publishing flows ● Composability-first design for cultural scaling In short, The Burrow turns meme creation into an on-chain pipeline, seamlessly blending AI, cultural expression, and token issuance into a platform that’s ready to scale with demand. Analyst View: 25x–50x Projections if Momentum Holds With a live product, transparent tokenomics, and measurable daily activity, $MERK is attracting the attention of early-stage analysts tracking utility-based memecoins. The project’s ability to combine Ethereum’s credibility with Telegram’s accessibility is positioning it as more than a trend, it’s becoming a use case. Why Analysts Are Paying Attention Unlike most memecoins that launch with vague roadmaps and speculative hype, $MERK enters the market with working mechanics already in place. Users are actively staking, completing missions, earning XP, and climbing leaderboards, all within Telegram’s native environment. This kind of real usage is rare at this stage. Combined with a presale entry point of approximately $0.00018, a fair launch structure, and listings already confirmed, analysts are forecasting 25x to 50x potential upside, especially if user momentum continues post-TGE. Telegram-native tokens with real-time engagement loops represent an asymmetric opportunity, and in this evolving memecoin cycle, $MERK is rewarding action now, not waiting for hype to do the work. Final Thought: SHIB Is a Legacy Meme, $MERK Is the Next Format Shiba Inu walked so Meerkat ($MERK) could run. SHIB helped define what memecoins could be, community-driven, culture-rich, and impossible to ignore. But the market has evolved, and so han sus expectativas. Today, engagement equals value. Investors and users alike are no longer content with holding for hope. They want to interact, earn, compete, and grow inside the ecosystem they support. While SHIB holds its status as a meme OG, $MERK is actively shaping the next generation of crypto-native attention economies. Built on Ethereum, operational within Telegram, and fully functional from the presale stage, $MERK is not just a token, it’s a living platform. With no VCs, no insider wallets, and contracts fully audited by Cyberscope, it’s also a model of transparency.

The pressure is coming from rising oil prices, triggered by military conflict in the Middle East. The US bombed three nuclear sites in Iran last Saturday night after Iran responded to earlier Israeli airstrikes. Now Iran is has shut down the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical oil route in the world. According to JP Morgan, if that happens, oil could surge to $130 per barrel, pushing US inflation to 5%. That’s the same level inflation hit in March 2023, when the Fed was hiking rates back-to-back. According to research reviewed by the Fed in 2010, a persistent oil shock leads to weaker consumption and investment, along with a hit to the dollar. In that study, they showed that countries importing oil, like the United States, get poorer as oil prices go up. The loss in national wealth leads to less spending, a weaker exchange rate, and a change in trade balances. People and businesses will try to cut down oil use, but it won’t be enough to avoid damage. The result is a worse oil trade balance and less import of other goods. The non-oil part of the trade balance improves, but only because the economy slows down. Iran warns of retaliation as US and Israel bomb nuclear sites Ten days ago, Israel carried out unprovoked airstrikes on Iranian territory. Tehran hit back. Then, over the weekend, the US joined the fight and dropped bombs on three nuclear facilities in Iran. In response, Iran’s foreign minister said the country “reserves all options to defend its sovereignty.” But since 2000, Iran has threatened over ten times to close off the Strait of Hormuz. If they actually go through with it this time, energy prices will definitely explode. The Strait is only 21 miles wide but carries one-fifth of the world’s oil every day. It also sees more traffic than both the Panama and Suez Canals. About 35% of all seaborne LNG also passes through it. The US Navy has kept forces in the area for decades because of how strategic it is. A map showing Iran, UAE, Oman, circling the Strait of Hormuz Hormuz is the only way out of the Persian Gulf by sea. If Iran closes it, the world loses access to a massive portion of oil supply overnight. That would almost guarantee a military response from Washington, Tel Aviv, or most likely both. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News on Sunday that China should intervene and talk Iran down. “I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil.” China is Iran’s biggest oil customer and maintains friendly diplomatic ties with Tehran, publicly condemning Israel’s actions. Trump demands rate cuts while Powell stays silent While global tension rises, President Donald Trump continues to push for interest rate cuts. Even before his reelection in 2024, Trump had been attacking Jerome Powell and demanding cheaper borrowing costs. Since returning to the White House, he’s kept up the heat. Trump has criticized the Fed Chair publicly nearly every week, insulting Powell both at press conferences and online. Powell, for his part, hasn’t said anything. He avoids reacting, never comments on the insults, and refuses to take the bait. But rate cuts right now are not realistic. With oil possibly hitting $130 and inflation climbing back toward 5%, cutting rates could add fuel to the fire. Instead, the Federal Reserve will likely raise them again, just like they did in 2023. The link between oil and inflation is well known. The Fed’s own modeling from the research we mentioned earlier shows how damaging oil shocks are, especially when financial markets can’t absorb the risk. The worse the shock, the harder it is to fight the resulting high inflation. With Trump pushing for cuts and Powell boxed in by rising costs, the Federal Reserve is once again facing political and economic pressure at the same time.

With this move, Texas has become the third state in the US to create an official Bitcoin reserve. According to the Bitcoin Laws platform, which tracks digital asset laws, 47 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced in 26 states so far, with 13 bills under active consideration at the federal level. This growing interest in digital asset reserves across the country parallels the policies of Donald Trump, who was re-elected in November 2024. Trump, who took office in January, has taken extensive steps to transform the U.S. into a more crypto-friendly environment, including reversing anti-crypto banking practices (debanking), appointing pro-crypto figures to key regulatory positions, and establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

The company believes crypto can help solve key problems in today’s financial system, such as rising debt, inflation, and growing distrust in banks. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are not just new forms of money. They are tools that can help build a stronger, fairer economy. Global Debt and Inflation Are Rising In a post on X, the Coinbase CEO highlighted serious problems in the global economy. Government debt is rising quickly, especially in the U.S., where the national debt has now reached over $36 trillion. At the same time, inflation makes money worth less and everyday costs higher. This makes it harder for people to save, invest, or plan. Armstrong said these issues are reducing economic freedom and trust in banks. Bitcoin and Digital Currencies Offer a New Option In response to these problems, more people are turning to digital assets like Bitcoin. Coinbase CEO says the rising price of the flagship crypto shows that people are looking for safer alternatives. These assets are becoming a place to protect wealth from inflation and government overspending. Unlike traditional money, crypto can be sent quickly and cheaply across borders. It does not rely on central banks or large financial firms. This gives people more control over their money, especially in places with weak banking systems or unstable currencies. Many crypto leaders have also suggested using Bitcoin to reduce the U.S. national debt. In February, a new report from VanEck, an investment management firm, shed light on whether this plan is feasible . Crypto Is Not Just About Investment The Coinbase leader explained that crypto is more than a way to make money. It is a technology that can improve the financial system. It can speed up payments, lower fees, and support new business ways. Artists and creators can earn income directly from their audience without giving a significant share to middlemen. Armstrong said Coinbase is building new tools to make this possible. These include simple business payment systems and a crypto card that rewards users in Bitcoin . Coinbase aims to make crypto valuable in everyday life, not just as an investment but as a practical solution for modern finance. Coinbase is Building A New Foundation for the Financial System According to Coinbase, the world needs to rebuild its financial system from the ground up. The company believes crypto can be the foundation for this change. Under the leadership of its CEO, Coinbase is expanding its role from a trading platform to a complete financial services provider. It now supports various digital tools and wants to help build the next generation of internet-based financial systems.

The launch is Tesla’s first real-world test of its plan to deploy fully autonomous vehicles that rely entirely on cameras and AI, not the sensors and LiDAR systems used by rivals like Waymo. Leading up to the launch, Elon had teased the rollout for months on X, and on Sunday, that promise turned real. Social media posts and videos from the area showed Tesla-branded Model Y robotaxis cruising through the city, officially marking the start of the new service. Tesla had earlier sent early access invites to a limited number of users, giving them the ability to download the Robotaxi app and hail rides starting that same day. Many of the first users posting online were already well-known Tesla supporters on X. Tesla begins with 10 vehicles and safety monitors in South Austin The service is starting out small. According to Tesla’s new Robotaxi info page, which went live on June 22, just 10 Model Y SUVs are being used within a small, specific part of South Austin. Rides are available daily from 6:00 a.m. to midnight, but may stop during bad weather. Every ride includes a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat, listed as a “safety monitor.” Tesla has not explained if this employee has control over the vehicle or access to a kill switch. Notably, these are not the futuristic Cybercabs that Elon unveiled in October 2024. Tesla instead chose to use updated 2025 versions of its Model Y, equipped with a new version of its Full Self-Driving software—what Elon describes as “unsupervised” autonomy. These vehicles are fully driverless but still include the safety monitor up front, breaking from what companies like Waymo and the now-paused Cruise used to do with human backup drivers. Ed Niedermeyer, author of Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors , confirmed the location of a Robotaxi depot near Oltorf Street. He reportedly observed branded robotaxis entering and exiting the parking lot in the days leading up to the launch. On Sunday morning, he spotted a Model Y robotaxi brake suddenly twice, once while crossing an intersection. In both cases, it was passing parked police cars. There were no riders inside during these events. Tesla restricts press access and blocks transparency efforts Most details about the Robotaxi rollout have come from Elon’s own posts or from early users sharing footage. Tesla hasn’t released key data and has actively tried to keep information from being made public. It allegedly blocked TechCrunch’s public records request with the Texas Department of Transportation, and also tried to stop the City of Austin from giving documents to Reuters. In April, Taylor White, Tesla’s senior counsel for infrastructure, wrote a letter to the Texas Attorney General’s office claiming that some of the requested documents included confidential information, trade secrets, or business data shared with TxDOT. On the safety side, in-cabin cameras won’t be on during rides by default. Tesla says the camera will only activate if there’s an emergency or if support is requested. It may also turn on after a trip ends to verify the car’s readiness for its next ride. Tesla’s new info page also lists several rider rules. Riders are banned from smoking, vaping, drinking, doing drugs, or using the vehicle for any criminal activity. The company says anyone who records and shares content that violates these rules can have their access suspended or terminated. After the launch, Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla’s head of Autopilot and self-driving, posted a photo from a Robotaxi launch party. Elon followed up on X, posting: “Super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!!

That token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a new DeFi project trading for mere cents yet gaining serious traction on social media and investor forums. The project is in phase 5 of its presale which has already sold out over 40%. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $10.9 million and attracted over 12,300 holders. For those wondering what to buy this summer this could be the next big cryptocurrency to generate generational wealth for those who move before the crowd catches on. Mutuum Finance Presale Enters Phase 5 As Investor Interest Skyrockets Mutuum Finance is gaining strong momentum in Phase 5 of its presale. Growing into a contender in DeFi the project stands out from its competitors by offering a scalable inflation-proof system of finance with real-world practical application. Investor interest is picking up speed with the project already having garnered more than $10.9 million and counting more than 12,300 token holders. Since the official listing price is $0.06 the existing investors are going to get a chance to 2x their investment once the token goes live. Not only is there a cool short-term return on investment but there is also long-term value potential. A New DeFi Lending Model with Full Asset Ownership Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol with users retaining their full ownership of assets while they participate in decentralized lending. The project uses a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending for enhanced flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system makes use of smart contracts to offer automated lending without any human intervention and in its place the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Through this auto mechanism, lenders’ and borrowers’ world becomes stabilized and predictable. Peer-to-Peer model on the other hand employs no intermediaries and thus offers a direct link among lenders and borrowers. This method is very dear to participants in dealing with volatile assets, where personalized conditions and flexibility are required. Such lending protocols provide start-to-end seamless DeFi experience that is perfectly tailored to the needs of the user and which is safer, transparent, and more customizable than other centralized lending products. Fully Collateralized Stablecoin and CertiK-Verified Security In addition to its lending innovation, Mutuum Finance is also developing the fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin has a competitive advantage over the algorithmic peers in that it is less prone to depegging. Mutuum Finance is based on trust and security. The project smart contracts are rigorously audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security companies. In addition to ensuring the integrity and transparency of the code base this audit also proves that the team is dedicated to building a secure DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance is quickly making waves in the crypto market with over $10.9 million raised and more than 12,300 early investors already on board. Still priced at just $0.03 in its current presale phase buyers stand to double their money at launch. Mutuum Finance is primed for a 21000% rally after launch which means early investors will turn $500 into $105,500 before the year ends. For anyone who feels they missed the boat on the last big DeFi breakout this could be the second chance you’ve been waiting for.

Solana (SOL) is heading toward a $258 target, showing signs of strong momentum. Ethereum Classic (ETC) also appears to be gaining traction, with charts pointing to a move toward $50. At the same time, BlockDAG is making quiet progress that’s getting noticed. With mining units being shipped, a US sponsorship secured, and exchange listings in the pipeline, BlockDAG’s presale has already hit $317 million on its way to a $600 million goal. Its steady rise is catching attention. Whether you’re following SOL, ETC, or BlockDAG (BDAG) , all three are making a case to be the best new crypto to buy right now. Solana Eyes Key Levels as $258 Target Comes Into View Solana (SOL) is now trading around $149.30, sitting inside the golden Fibonacci zone. This range is known for trend changes. A falling wedge pattern has formed, which often leads to a bullish breakout. If this happens, the next Solana (SOL) price target could hit $204.31, $229.01, and possibly $258.45. That would mean gains of 60% to 100%. Support levels between $128 and $140 add strength to the case for a breakout. Although the market remains unpredictable, current signs favor a move upward. For those tracking Solana (SOL), this setup is one to watch. ETC Builds Strength as Price Charts Signal a Breakout Ethereum Classic (ETC) is starting to draw interest from traders. Priced around $16.78, the ETC chart shows a symmetrical triangle and a recent breakout from a falling wedge. Both patterns are seen as positive signals. If this momentum stays, ETC could climb toward the $21 to $50 range. Key levels are important now. ETC needs to hold above $17.50 to stay on track. If it falls under $16.80, selling pressure may return. With high trading volume, active users, and a solid network, the Ethereum Classic (ETC) price chart could be setting up for a bigger move. BlockDAG Raises the Bar With Steady Progress and Delivery In a market full of hype and promises, BlockDAG is standing out by focusing on results. Instead of talking about what might happen, the project is already making moves, building out features, and growing a real community. Recently, BlockDAG shared shipping dates for its miners, something many projects do not deliver on. The X30 and X100 miners are set to ship starting July 7, and the X10 will follow in August. Over 2 million users are now using the X1 mobile miner, showing that BlockDAG’s tools are ready and working from day one. The pace continues to pick up. On June 20, BlockDAG plans to reveal a US-based sponsorship deal that could help bring it more attention before it begins trading. In the background, the launch looks well prepared. Exchange listings are already confirmed on 20 centralized platforms including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, and LBank. Wallet support is also ready, and the X1 Miner app is live, showing that BlockDAG’s features match what users want. So far, the project has raised $317 million and delivered a 2,660% return since its first batch. The current price of $0.0020 is still active for a short time. BlockDAG is showing that results count. For those looking at the best new crypto to buy for 2025, this one is getting serious attention. Final Thoughts on Where Things Stand Now To wrap things up, the Solana (SOL) price target remains solid, backed by strong momentum that keeps it on many watchlists. Ethereum Classic (ETC) also shows promise with bullish signs on its chart. But BlockDAG is standing out in a unique way. With miner shipments confirmed, a US sponsorship reveal coming soon, and exchange listings already set, the project is showing steady results rather than just plans. The presale has reached nearly $317 million as more interest grows. For those tracking the best new crypto to buy , BlockDAG is now leading the conversation.

This record reflects increasing network activity and points to the continued maturity of the XRP ecosystem. Built-In Burn Mechanism Continues to Shrink Supply Unlike other cryptocurrencies that rely on halving events or fixed supply caps, XRP features a built-in burn mechanism that destroys a small amount of XRP with every transaction. This design helps prevent spam and slowly reduces the total supply over time. According to the latest figures from XRPScan, 14,003,265 XRP have been burned to date. This not only marks a new all-time high but also reinforces the growing utility of the network. On-Chain Growth Accelerates Recent data from Santiment shows a significant surge in activity across the XRP Ledger. The number of daily active addresses has jumped to over 295,000 —up sharply from the 35,000 to 40,000 daily average seen over the last three months. This increase signals a rising demand for the ledger’s features, including fast settlement, low fees, and native tokenization support. In addition, the number of whale and shark wallets holding at least 1 million XRP has now exceeded 2,700, a historic high for the nearly 12-year-old asset. This trend reflects growing interest from high-value investors and long-term holders. Price Holds Steady Amid Profit-Taking Despite strong fundamentals, XRP’s price has yet to fully reflect the on-chain momentum. As of report time, XRP is trading at $1.97, according to CoinMarketCap. This marks a major increase from its pre-rally level before November 2024, giving early investors sizable gains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, data from Glassnode shows a wave of profit realization, with early holders cashing out at a rate of $68.8 million per day. This selling pressure could weigh on XRP in the short term. If the $2 support level fails to hold, a nalysts warn the price could retreat toward $1.61. Outlook Hinges on Key Technical Levels On the flip side, if buyers return and manage to push the price above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2.27, XRP could continue trading within its current range. A decisive break above $2.65 would likely confirm renewed bullish momentum and potentially trigger a fresh rally. While the current price action reflects mixed sentiment, XRP’s underlying metrics—rising network usage, deflationary tokenomics, and increased whale accumulation—paint a picture of long-term strength.

But today, analysts are turning their gaze toward Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a rising crypto powered by blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) . With a structured growth model and a fast-growing community, Ruvi AI is inching closer to becoming the next $1 project. Could it replicate Bitcoin’s meteoric rise? Why Ruvi AI Is Emerging as a $1 Contender While Bitcoin built its empire on its scarcity and decentralized technology, Ruvi AI offers pragmatic utility by solving pressing challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance. Combining AI and blockchain, Ruvi AI delivers real-world value rather than relying solely on market sentiment or speculative demand. Ruvi AI’s structured growth roadmap provides investors with clarity and confidence. Currently priced at just $0.015 in Phase 2 of its presale , Ruvi AI offers an accessible entry point. Once the presale ends, the token’s price will increase to $0.07 , representing an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts project that RUVI could go further, reaching $1 post-listing , a 66x ROI for those who invest early. This calculated growth puts Ruvi AI ahead of its competitors in terms of predictability and potential returns. A Presale That Signals Strong Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale performance has demonstrated remarkable momentum, confirming its appeal to investors. Key measurable highlights include: Over $1.9 million raised so far More than 160 million tokens sold , showing strong demand Over 1,600 token holders , underscoring a solid and growing community Importantly, the post-presale valuation of $0.07 is not speculative hype but rather a part of Ruvi AI’s structured pricing strategy. This planned progression provides transparency, differentiating Ruvi AI from many speculative and volatile crypto projects. Earn Bigger Returns with Ruvi AI VIP Tiers Investors looking to amplify their returns can benefit from Ruvi AI’s highly rewarding VIP investment tiers .

46574695,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753414,1750631160,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46574695.jpeg,"After $68M Win With Shiba Inu, This Crypto Investor is Bagging SHIB’s Newest Rival Priced lower Than $0.01",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/after-68m-win-with-shiba-inu-this-crypto-investor-is-bagging-shibs-newest-rival-priced-lower-than-0-01/,"One such tale that’s become legendary within crypto circles is that of an early Shiba Inu (SHIB) investor who turned a modest investment into a staggering $68 million. Now, with SHIB showing signs of maturing and fewer parabolic moves on the horizon, that same investor has set their sights on a new meme coin— Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . It’s a bold pivot, but not without reason. LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin hoping to replicate the viral success of Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Dogecoin. It’s been quietly building what many are calling the next big thing in meme coin evolution—combining culture, innovation, and infrastructure. And judging by the early numbers and community sentiment, it may be the only meme coin in 2025 worth watching this closely. Shiba Inu’s Rise and Plateau The story of Shiba Inu is legendary. SHIB defied expectations and delivered one of the most jaw-dropping ROI stories in crypto history. One investor reportedly turned just $8,000 into nearly $70 million in under two years. That kind of gain is rare—some would even say once-in-a-generation. But even fairytales have ceilings. After reaching its peak, SHIB has struggled to recapture that magic. While still boasting a passionate community and solid developments, such as its Layer 2 network, SHIB’s growth has become incremental. The low-cap volatility and overnight 100x possibilities that drew early investors are no longer present. That’s precisely why the investor who made millions from SHIB is shifting focus. The next opportunity, in their view, lies in something much earlier in its life cycle. Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—a token that combines meme energy with serious architecture. LILPEPE’s Presale Momentum Signals Something Big Still in its third presale stage, LILPEPE is priced at just $0.0012—a fraction of a cent. Despite being early in its rollout, the project has already raised over $1.3 million, surpassing early targets and selling out previous presale stages in a remarkably short time. Unlike most meme coins that launch and rely solely on virality, LILPEPE is building an ecosystem from the ground up. The token plans to evolve into a Layer 2 blockchain dedicated entirely to meme coins, offering fast and cheap transactions, and, more importantly, built-in resistance to sniper bots. This makes it one of the few meme projects that not only appeals to traders and degens but also to developers and serious builders. The platform will also feature a meme-focused launchpad, enabling new meme projects to launch within the LILPEPE ecosystem. It’s a meme coin with utility, infrastructure, and a vision that stretches beyond hype. Listings, Community, and a Massive Giveaway LILPEPE isn’t relying on just plans and promises—it’s actively expanding its visibility and reach. The project has confirmed two top-tier centralized exchange listings upon launch and has shared that plans are in place to debut on the world’s biggest crypto exchange. For a token in presale, these moves are exceptionally bullish and speak to the legitimacy of what’s being built. What’s more, the team has launched an ambitious $777,000 giveaway , with 10 lucky winners each set to receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. This is rapidly expanding the project’s footprint and increasing awareness. Backed by Anonymous Experts Who Know Meme Coins There’s also buzz about the team behind the project. While they’ve chosen to remain anonymous, insiders suggest that the project is being backed by individuals who have previously played pivotal roles in some of the most successful meme coins in history. Their strategic fingerprints—tight presale mechanics, community-first rollouts, sniper bot protections—are all over LILPEPE. This blend of stealth experience and public-facing energy is part of what’s drawn in larger investors, including the former SHIB whale. If these seasoned builders execute their roadmap, LILPEPE won’t just compete with SHIB—it could surpass it in both cultural and financial impact. Is History About to Repeat? Investors who missed out on SHIB in 2020 often ask, “When will the next opportunity like that come?” For those watching the meme coin space closely, that moment may be arriving again. And LILPEPE is shaping up to be the token that leads the charge. It has a low price, ambitious infrastructure, exchange plans, and viral momentum to transition from a microcap to a market giant. And if someone who turned $8k into $68 million with SHIB is now watching LILPEPE this closely, the rest of us should be too. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a chance for lightning to strike twice.

46574251,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/will-pepe-get-the-doge-treatment-elon-musk-shows-love-on-twitter,1750631290,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/46574251.jpeg,Will PEPE Get the Doge Treatment? Elon Musk Shows Love on Twitter,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/will-pepe-get-the-doge-treatment-elon-musk-shows-love-on-twitter,"Meme coins have consistently stirred up excitement in the crypto market. With Elon Musk once again giving attention to Pepe (PEPE) on Twitter, speculators are wondering if it could mirror Dogecoin’s historic surge. Musk’s influence on meme-based assets is well-documented, having previously propelled Dogecoin to record highs through a series of supportive tweets. In December 2024, AI-generated images featuring Pepe the Frog began appearing on his X (formerly Twitter) feed, sparking a new wave of speculation. Though no direct endorsement has been made, the association alone has historically been enough to trigger major price moves. Investors are now closely watching whether this renewed spotlight could inject fresh momentum into PEPE’s trajectory, despite its recent downturn. Meanwhile, a new contender, #Pepeto has emerged with a clear mission to address the core issues that held PEPE back. Unlike most meme coins fueled by internet virality, #Pepeto is presenting a structured and utility-driven roadmap that blends community culture with real technological infrastructure. How Pepeto Stacks Up Against Classic Meme Tokens Compared to established tokens like Dogecoin and PEPE, Pepeto enters with notable upgrades. Dogecoin rose on community strength and celebrity tweets, but lacked technological substance. PEPE, while gaining traction in early 2024, is currently showing signs of instability. Its price now hovers around $0.000009187 , a significant dip over the past week. In contrast, #Pepeto’s architecture centers on sustainability and optimization. It includes unique elements like token staking, a proprietary memecoin exchange, and a cross-chain bridge. These features add utility far beyond mere speculation. Hence, while Dogecoin and PEPE surfed waves of hype, Pepeto aims to establish long-term relevance. Pepeto’s Momentum: Presale, Price, and Potential As of press time, the price of $Pepeto is at $0.000000136 , and much of the presale has already been sold. The presale has generated $5,459,786.70 out of a target of $5.7 million, which indicates good early interest from investors. The staking model used in Pepeto is turning out to be a significant attraction in addition to the low entry barrier to buyers. It has an estimated yearly return rate of 276%, which makes it appealing to long-term investors. The project has already gained real traction with more than 30 trillion tokens staked. In addition, the ecosystem will introduce an exchange targeting meme tokens in particular. This addresses one of the gaps in the memecoin market by providing liquidity, security, and accessibility at the same time. Such usefulness, complemented by smooth interoperability via the bridge provided by Pepeto, will build a sound ecosystem in which meme assets could prosper. - Updates on $PEPETO exchange soon; once done, the day of judgement (Date of listing) would be days after - $PEPETO , The God of Frogs. pic.twitter.com/Aay4Tv5HCb — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 1, 2025 Why Pepeto Could Redefine the Meme Coin Landscape The pathway in the Pepeto roadmap does not dwell only on marketing but also draws stages on security, society, and technological rollout. The smart contracts have already been audited, and a staking platform has already been launched. Participation by the community via AMAs and strategic exchange listing presents credibility in the rollout. In Phase 3, the real-use applications come into operation with the launch of the bridge test and exchange test, and the completion of a full-scale marketing campaign in Phase 4. This plan guarantees that Pepeto is more than a meme; it is a movement founded on innovation. Moreover, it has sustainable tokenomics : 30% presale, 30% staking, 20% marketplace, 7.5% development, and 12.5% liquidity. These distributions guarantee environmental well-being and avoid abrupt discharges. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful, utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

Leading this charge are three altcoins with an unmistakable edge: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and the rising star FloppyPepe (FPPE) . As the first half of the year ends, investors are eyeing high-potential altcoins that could 100x by July, and these three are positioned to dominate. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI-Powered Meme Coin with Explosive Upside While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have long been staples in the world of altcoins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as the game-changer. This altcoin newcomer redefines the meme coin sector. It's secret? A shrinking supply model combined with zero transaction taxes makes it the ideal investment for those seeking maximum returns. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is far more than a traditional meme token. It blends artificial intelligence with decentralized finance, making it a powerhouse altcoin. Its AI agents, like the Meme‑o‑Matic and FloppyX Video AI, assist creators and influencers in generating compelling memes and captivating video content from text prompts. FloppyAI, a conversational AI bot trained to provide precise crypto insights based on user prompts. Start prompt here . This AI-based utility positions FloppyPepe (FPPE) at the center of a growing trend that will dominate the altcoin space in 2025. 100x - 550x For Early Investors With 80% Bonus With the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale in Stage 2, tokens are available at $0.00000035, and early adopters are offered an 80% bonus with code ""FLOPPY80."" Experts project this meme coin can rise 550x by July, making early entry a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Here’s how a modest investment could grow: Initial Investment Potential ROI at 550x Growth $1,000 $550,000 $5,000 $2,750,000 $10,000 $5,500,000 Unlike Ethereum (ETH), which carries high gas fees, this meme coin boasts no transaction taxes. Its deflationary mechanism burns 1% of every transaction, reducing supply and rewarding holders. Another 1% goes directly to holders, making the token an ideal long-term hold. With the presale in its second phase and liquidity pouring in, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining unstoppable momentum with increasing whale activity. Those joining now can secure life-changing returns. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart Contract King Ethereum (ETH) has long been the bedrock of decentralized finance and NFT ecosystems. The shift to proof-of-stake and scalability improvements solidifies Ethereum’s (ETH) role in the next wave of altcoins. Yet despite its dominance, Ethereum (ETH) is still weighed down by rising gas fees and network congestion. While Ethereum (ETH) may struggle to deliver the same level of returns as smaller, more agile projects. “Titan Of Crypto,” an analyst on X, is optimistic about a breakout that can fuel a potential Ethereum (ETH) 100x rally, which could spark a revival for other altcoins, making now the best time to accumulate. Solana (SOL): The High‑Speed Challenger Solana (SOL) shines with its blazing transaction speeds and low costs, making it one of the best-performing altcoins of the last cycle. Solana’s (SOL) strong developer base and expanding ecosystem continue to draw attention. Solana (SOL) has seen a decline in price lately, currently trading at $145, but its 1H chart is promising, and SOSA, a trader on X, confirms a push towards $154. However, unlike FloppyPepe’s curated burns, Solana’s (SOL) highly circulated supply and institutional focus limit its potential, making it ideal for more conservative allocations rather than breakout plays. The New Leader of the Altcoins Movement While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain cornerstones of the altcoin market , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to dominate as the breakout star of 2025. Its AI-driven meme generation, zero transaction tax, and deflationary supply model set it apart from traditional offerings. The ongoing presale, currently in its second stage, presents the chance to secure a stake in a project designed to deliver a 550x ROI. Act now and join the wave of early adopters who recognize FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) unique potential.

BNB & XLM Show Rally",https://thecoinrise.com/with-a-us-based-sponsorship-incoming-blockdags-presale-hits-317m-bnb-xlm-show-rally/,"The Binance Coin (BNB) price chart is climbing steadily with rising trading volume, suggesting that strong accumulation may be underway. At the same time, the Stellar (XLM) price surge has moved above resistance levels, signaling renewed focus on its role in cross-border payments. With both coins showing strength, attention is building, but where is the real potential? That brings us to BlockDAG (BDAG) , currently gaining serious attention as one of the top new cryptos before it officially lists. With over $317 million already secured, a completed audit, and 2 million users mining through its mobile X1 app, it’s working through a detailed six-week rollout strategy. As momentum continues through its US-based sponsorship and focused release roadmap, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a serious contender, potentially outshining some of the largest names in crypto. This presale period is becoming an important point to watch closely. Structured Launch Plan Shows BlockDAG’s Preparation BlockDAG isn’t just collecting funds, it’s putting them to work. The GO LIVE schedule outlines a clear six-week framework leading up to the exchange debut, with each week bringing key releases: presale wrap-up, mainnet setup, airdrops, DeFi tools, and launch of community apps. This structured planning shows BlockDAG as a rare project progressing on execution rather than speculation. Now halfway through its $600 million presale, BlockDAG has already deployed mainnet nodes, completed security checks via CertiK and Halborn, and activated its app with 2 million mobile users. With Batch 29 underway, those getting in now are still ahead of the launch. Early backers have already seen a 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. As the vesting contract prepares to release 40% of tokens, utility is coming online fast, even before trading begins. Plans for listing include appearances on over 20 exchanges, the launch of a DEX, lending system, launchpad, OTC desk, and cross-chain bridge. None of this is last-minute; it’s a calculated strategy for bringing usage and access from day one. The presale, currently offering a special limited-time price of $0.0020 (in Batch 29 priced at $0.0276), is drawing attention from new retail buyers daily. It will rise to $0.0030 in just 3 days. BlockDAG’s crypto presale now exceeds $317 million, showing strong momentum ahead of launch. BNB Price Chart Reflects Market Confidence The Binance Coin (BNB) price chart recently pushed beyond $700, peaking at $715 during the week before settling above $680. That level is holding strong, indicating support strength. Market watchers are tracking the $720 resistance mark, which could lead to another upward swing if buying interest continues. BNB’s chart behavior continues to respect critical technical levels during pullbacks. This has drawn consistent attention from retail and larger market participants alike. With its involvement in DeFi, staking, and launchpads, BNB serves as a central utility in the Binance network. Continued price strength could drive it past $720 and toward $750, putting it among the stronger large-cap options currently on the table. XLM Continues Rally After Breaking Resistance Stellar (XLM) has climbed back above $0.15, reaching its highest level in weeks. The bounce from just below $0.14 was met with strong buying, reinforcing that support zone. The upward trend has resumed with higher lows forming on the chart, suggesting a possible move toward the $0.17 mark. What’s fueling this rise? Interest in XLM’s use as a bridge between fiat and crypto has grown, especially around international payments. With real use cases gaining ground, the Stellar (XLM) price surge is more than a technical move; it reflects growing adoption. If adoption continues and new partnerships emerge, this strength could carry forward. XLM’s mix of short-term strength and practical use makes it worth watching. In a Nutshell! BNB has maintained a steady climb, holding support near $600 and possibly preparing for another push higher if key averages stay intact. Meanwhile, Stellar is pushing upward with confirmation above $0.15 and building momentum toward $0.17. For those following new projects closely, BNB and XLM stand out for both their chart patterns and practical roles in the crypto space. But BlockDAG deserves equal focus. Backed by $317 million in funding, a six-week GO LIVE strategy, and a limited-time $0.0020 offer, it’s already showing results long before listing. With 2 million users, early growth of 2,660% since Batch 1, and 20 exchange listings already revealed, BlockDAG is quickly turning early support into visible progress.

However, a new challenger has emerged, and analysts are starting to wonder if Ruvi AI (RUVI) could step up to the throne. Combining artificial intelligence and blockchain , Ruvi AI has captured attention with its structured growth strategy, real-world utility , and predictions of a 66x ROI . Thanks to a successful third-party audit and a presale that has raised significant funds, some believe Ruvi AI is a stronger bet than Avalanche for those seeking oversized gains. Why Analysts Say Ruvi AI Could Challenge Avalanche Avalanche established itself by solving blockchain scalability issues, drawing developers to its robust network. However, Ruvi AI builds on this scalability by integrating AI-powered applications that solve real-world problems across marketing , entertainment , and finance . While Avalanche focuses on its infrastructure, Ruvi AI’s versatility appeals to a broader user base, ensuring steady token demand. Ruvi AI also appeals to investors with its well-defined growth roadmap. During Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are priced at just $0.015 each , making early entry highly accessible. When the presale concludes, Ruvi AI will lock in a $0.07 price , providing early backers with an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts are already forecasting the token price to rise to $1 after listing , translating to an incredible 66x ROI for presale participants. Strong Presale Metrics Signal Investor Confidence Ruvi AI’s performance in the presale phase is paving the way for its future success. Here’s a snapshot of its achievements so far: $1.9 million raised , underscoring strong demand and market interest. Over 160 million tokens sold , proving that early adopters recognize its potential. More than 1,600 holders , forming a loyal and growing investor base. What sets Ruvi AI apart during its presale is the guaranteed post-presale valuation of $0.07 , offering a level of transparency uncommon in the volatile crypto market. This approach reduces the uncertainty often encountered in similar projects and makes Ruvi AI a safer bet. Enhance Returns with Ruvi AI’s VIP Levels Investors looking to maximize profits can take advantage of Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers , offering substantial bonuses depending on contribution levels. Here’s how they stack up: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for exponential growth, making Ruvi AI’s presale an attractive entry point for investors. Transparency and Security Solidify Ruvi AI’s Appeal Ruvi AI has already demonstrated its commitment to security and transparency, gaining investor trust through its successful third-party audit by CyberScope . This audit ensures that the platform is technologically sound and secure, alleviating concerns for potential backers. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity. Investors will be able to trade RUVI tokens as soon as they are listed on major exchanges, offering a seamless transition from presale involvement to open-market trading. Practical Applications Drive Demand for RUVI Tokens Unlike Avalanche, Ruvi AI doesn’t rely solely on its technical prowess. It actively solves problems across industries, ensuring long-term value for its users and token holders. Some standout applications include: Marketing: Businesses use Ruvi AI’s intelligent advertising solutions to optimize targeting, maximize ROI, and streamline campaign spend. Entertainment: Content creators enjoy blockchain-secured payments and AI-driven insights that enhance audience engagement and revenue. Finance: Institutions leverage Ruvi AI’s fraud detection capabilities, along with its scalable solutions for global financial systems, to boost transparency and efficiency. This diverse utility secures Ruvi AI’s relevance in multiple markets, making it a robust competitor to both Avalanche and other crypto giants. Is Ruvi AI Ready to Replace Avalanche? What makes Ruvi AI such a standout in the crypto world is its balanced focus on growth, innovation, and real-world problem-solving. From its $0.015 entry price to its forecasted $1 valuation , the token offers impressive returns while mitigating risk with a structured plan and transparent operations. Avalanche may have achieved great milestones, but Ruvi AI’s versatile approach and high ROI potential make it a game-changing contender. With $1.9 million raised , 160 million tokens sold , and partnerships with leaders like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is ready to leave a lasting mark on the cryptocurrency industry.

The duo used the USD-pegged stablecoin to smuggle funds raised from voice phishing scams overseas. USDT Money Laundering Ring: Defendants Jailed for Two Years The South Korean media outlet Financial News reported that the Criminal Division of the Seoul Eastern District Court’s Presiding Judge Lee Jeong-hyeong sentenced the duo to two years in prison each on June 22. The Seoul Eastern District Court, in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Pectus Solentis [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The defendants were identified as a college student surnamed Duong (23) and an unemployed individual surnamed Pham (also 23). The court found both individuals guilty of violating the Special Act on Prevention of Telecommunications and Financial Fraud and Refund of Damages. Prosecutors explained that Duong and Pham first made contact with the voice phishing scam ring in October last year. The ring recruited both via a Telegram open chat room. The ring’s organizers told Duong and Pham that they were to receive the proceeds of voice phishing scams in Korean won. The duo was then instructed to use this money to buy USDT, which they then sent to a crypto wallet held by a member of a voice phishing gang who was residing in Vietnam. The ring paid both Duong and Pham commission fees of 50,000 won ($36.44) to 100,000 won ($72.88) per 10 million won ($7,288) worth of USDT they sent. In a bold play to secure Korea’s position among the global AI elite, President Lee Jae Myung kicked off his term with a visit to the launch site of a mega-scale AI data center. #AIdatacenter https://t.co/gGHvfjNBvw — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) June 22, 2025 ‘Hash Sentence Inevitable,’ Judge Explains The court heard that the voice phishing ring succeeded in duping South Korea-based victims out of thousands of dollars’ worth of cash transfers. The ring’s employees called people pretending to be credit card delivery workers, insurance company employees, National Tax Service staffers, and even public prosecutors. They usually told potential victims that they were calling to check the safety of their bank accounts. The ring used a range of money laundering techniques, using other accomplices from Uzbekistan and Vietnam. The judge said that the court had not handed out a harsher sentence because neither of the defendants had criminal records in South Korea. But Lee added: “Even if the defendants did not orchestrate the crime, they must be severely punished. They played an essential role in the crime, acting as intermediaries. They have also not made any special efforts to help compensate the victims for the damages incurred.” USDT-related crime is on the rise in South Korea, as the coin’s popularity in the nation continues to grow. This year has seen a sharp rise in bogus USDT-themed over-the-counter deals and related thefts .

Now, a new contender, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is generating similar excitement among analysts and investors. Harnessing blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi AI aims to solve real-world problems while offering massive financial returns. Analysts forecast a potential 103x ROI in 2025 , positioning Ruvi AI as a possible successor to Binance Coin’s phenomenal rise. Why Ruvi AI Has the Potential to Rival Binance Coin Binance Coin achieved its meteoric rise through practical utility within the Binance ecosystem, driving consistent demand for the token. Ruvi AI takes a broader approach, creating AI-powered tools with applications in industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance. This focus on solving real-world challenges ensures long-term value and widespread adoption. Another standout factor is Ruvi AI’s structured growth plan. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are available for just $0.015 per token. Investors benefit from entering at this low price, with a guaranteed $0.07 valuation post-presale. This locks in an almost 5x ROI before the token is even listed on public exchanges. Analysts predict that RUVI could climb to $1 per token post-listing, delivering an impressive 103x ROI for early investors. Strong Presale Performance Sparks Enthusiasm Ruvi AI’s presale success highlights its growing traction among crypto investors. Here are some key milestones: Over $1.9 million raised , showcasing strong financial backing. More than 160 million tokens sold , reflecting robust investor demand. A growing community of 1,600+ holders , building a loyal base of early adopters. Ruvi AI’s commitment to transparency further sets it apart. Unlike speculative tokens, the presale guarantees a $0.07 valuation , offering clarity and reducing risk for early participants. Multiply Gains Through Ruvi AI’s VIP Investment Tiers Investors can further enhance their returns by leveraging Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers , which offer generous bonuses based on contribution levels. Take a look at the potential gains: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These opportunities underscore Ruvi AI’s long-term value, making investment at the presale stage highly lucrative. Security and Partnership Add Credibility Ruvi AI has gone to great lengths to ensure investor confidence. Its platform underwent a third-party audit by CyberScope, a trusted blockchain security firm. This confirmation of Ruvi AI’s secure infrastructure reassures investors of its reliability. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures post-presale liquidity. This means RUVI tokens will be immediately tradable upon listing, offering early investors easy access to their holdings and potential gains. Real-World Utility Drives Long-Term Success Unlike Binance Coin, which excels in its specific ecosystem, Ruvi AI delivers solutions across multiple industries. This scalability transforms RUVI from a niche token into a versatile one with real-world value. Key applications include: Marketing: Businesses use Ruvi AI’s tools to optimize campaign strategies, reduce costs, and maximize ROI with AI-driven insights. Entertainment: Content creators tap into blockchain-backed payments and AI personalization, fostering better audience engagement and increased revenue streams. Finance: Financial institutions rely on Ruvi AI for advanced fraud detection, streamlining operations, and modernizing their systems. This diverse applicability strengthens Ruvi AI’s long-term demand and positions it as a high-value asset in the crypto market. Why Ruvi AI Is Ready for a Binance Coin–Style Success Ruvi AI is proving itself to be more than just another token. With its low $0.015 presale price , locked-in $0.07 valuation , and market projections of $1 post-listing , the project offers a rare blend of affordability, transparency, and growth potential. With over $1.9 million raised , 160+ million tokens sold, and strategic partnerships with groups like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange, Ruvi AI has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike.

UNI is circling the $8 mark after a steady climb, and ETH is stuck below $2,750, waiting on momentum to break through. While these two settle into their ranges, a rising contender is pressing forward at full speed. BlockDAG isn’t in a test phase; it’s actively progressing. With over $317 million already secured, the limited-time offer is fueling daily presale demand. A 6-week launch plan is underway, with major events scheduled: a US-based sponsorship kicks off on June 20, X30/X100 miners begin shipping on July 7, and X10 shipments follow on August 15. Unlike many other projects, this rollout is fully structured, and all listings will happen only after the final presale batch is sold. BlockDAG (BDAG) is now ranked among the top crypto coins to grab before the window narrows. BlockDAG Locks $317M+ As Countdown and Deliverables Begin Rather than promising plans, BlockDAG has entered execution mode. A major rollout is happening, with miner deliveries confirmed and a high-visibility US-based sponsorship locked for June 20. Shipping of X30 and X100 units starts on July 7, while X10 units go out by August 15. What’s already driving attention is the $317 million raised so far, and the presale is now in its 29th batch. Currently priced at $0.0276, Batch 29 still offers a limited-time offer ahead of the $0.05 listing rate. Over 23.1 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, and early backers have seen their funds grow by 2,660% since batch 1. The roadmap confirms that only after all 45 batches are sold will the 20 exchange listings be triggered, including five Tier-1 platforms already secured. With this structure, demand builds naturally as urgency grows. This makes BlockDAG one of the strongest crypto coins to buy now, with real progress before listing. The smart vesting contract is active, 40% of presale coins unlock pre-launch, and with 2 million users mining via the X1 app, traction is solid. If you’ve waited for a project executing on every front, BlockDAG is matching that demand with delivery. This isn’t just another coin; it’s a full system moving toward its goals. Uniswap (UNI) Price Outlook: Can It Break $8? Uniswap (UNI) continues to draw attention, trading close to $7.15 with gains over the past week. Forecasts are now eyeing a move between $7.21 and $7.52, with many tracking the $7.52 resistance closely. Should that level be breached, UNI could see a rise toward $8.15, depending on how trading volume supports the push. Looking further ahead, July forecasts pin the average Uniswap (UNI) price target at around $8.93, with some models predicting $10.83 if strong sentiment holds. Projections into 2025 stretch as high as $11–$12. While Uniswap stays active in DeFi, focus is shifting as newer coins gain steam. For UNI to remain at the top of traders’ charts, it must break the range it’s been in and drive momentum. It’s currently seen as a cautious play with upside if momentum and volume align. Ethereum (ETH) Holds Support as Resistance Nears $2,750 ETH is staying within a narrow range between $2,490 and $2,550, showing some resilience as it defends this zone. Analysts continue to watch $2,750 as a key level; if cleared, it could point to a climb beyond $3,000. The current technical setup shows signs of a potential cup-and-handle formation, often associated with upward price action. Momentum tools like RSI show ETH has room to run, and long-term confidence is still growing. Big names like BlackRock and Fidelity are utilizing Ethereum for asset tokenization, and the DeFi sector remains active. The upcoming Pectra upgrade is set to reduce gas costs and increase speed, improving ETH’s position in the developer space. While not rallying yet, ETH appears poised for a potential upward breakout as it nears its next resistance test. Key Takeaways! UNI is sitting above $7, with near-term resistance at $7.52 and a potential July average price near $8.93. ETH is holding between $2,490 and $2,550, with a bullish breakout possible if $2,750 is surpassed. Meanwhile, BlockDAG has raised over $317M, is in Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, and has confirmed a June 20 US-based sponsorship plus July 7 miner shipments. Listings will begin only after the 45th batch is sold, and the project has already delivered 2,660% growth since batch 1.

In a post on the social media platform X, Aptos says that the state is looking to use either chain with Layer Zero infrastructure to deploy a potential stablecoin. “The Wyoming Stable Token Commission has placed Aptos as the highest-scoring blockchain candidate for WYST – the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US State – tying for 1st place with Solana. WYST will be deployed using Layer Zero… Aptos is making borderless, always-on finance a reality today with three native USD stablecoins & $30 billion+ in monthly stablecoin volume, supported by sub-second finality and near-zero transaction fees at [around] $0.00055. Following the recent passing of the GENIUS Act to establish the first regulatory framework for stablecoins and Aptos pushing further as the chain for stablecoins, the future of finance is here on Aptos.” Last year, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon said he would push for the adoption of a “transparent” stablecoin fully backed by the state’s short-term Treasury holdings. “One of the big things for me is to be able to bring back onshore a lot of our debt because if it’s bought by treasuries and supported by Treasurys, it will help to stabilize that market to a degree… [What] is clear to me is that digital assets are going to have a future. The United States has to address this issue. Washington’s being a little bit stodgy, which is why Wyoming, being a nimble and entrepreneurial state, can make a difference.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to reporting from Politico, both countries have been launching targeted cyberattacks in parallel with military action, and American officials are warning this digital warfare could soon hit the United States directly. The US military’s overnight airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites raised the risk of direct cyber retaliation against American infrastructure. Military and intelligence analysts say Iran’s next move could involve hacking into US electricity grids, water systems, or other critical networks. Alex Vatanka, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said bluntly that “cyber is one of the tools of Iran’s asymmetric warfare.” The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a public alert on Sunday warning that Iranian-affiliated hackers could target “poorly secured US networks and Internet-connected devices.” US officials say low-level pro-Iranian hacktivist attacks are likely, and more serious government-linked intrusions are possible. US defense and private sector on high alert for Iran-backed attacks General Dan Caine, who chairs the Joint Chiefs, confirmed to reporters on Sunday that US Cyber Command had supported the military strikes, though he didn’t provide further details. The Pentagon’s cyber branch gave no public comment, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also declined to respond when asked about its defensive posture. Behind the scenes, though, critical infrastructure groups last week warned American companies to get their defenses up fast. Jen Easterly, the former CISA Director, took to LinkedIn and posted that US infrastructure players should keep their “shields up” and expect “malicious cyber activity.” Jen reminded readers that Iran has a long history of cyber strikes on civilian targets, including water plants, financial systems, pipelines, and government websites. She didn’t confirm whether Israel’s recent airstrikes affected Iran’s cyber capacity, but she did say the threat remains serious. In 2023, an Iranian gang breached an Israeli hospital and leaked patient data. Not long after, an Israeli hacking group shut down large parts of Iran’s gas station network. Vatanka told reporters that Israel still holds the upper hand, saying , “The Iranians… are good, they are emerging, but I don’t think they’re at the level of the Israelis or Americans.” The Israeli-aligned hacking group Predatory Sparrow claimed responsibility for shutting down Iran’s Bank Sepah, which caused widespread customer problems. They later said they had drained $90 million from Nobitex, the country’s biggest crypto exchange. The group also dumped pieces of Nobitex’s source code on X, formerly Twitter. Iran responds with shutdowns, surveillance, and renewed espionage As cyberattacks hammered Iran’s digital infrastructure, its state broadcasters were also hijacked. Multiple videos showed anti-government messages popping up on Iranian state TV last week. That triggered a government-ordered internet blackout still in effect as of Sunday, aimed at blocking public access to the attacks. Vatanka said this showed Iran’s regime was trying to “gain control of the flow of information” and possibly prevent public unrest. Security officials inside Iran have started locking down their own tech use. Last week, senior Iranian personnel were told to ditch any internet-connected devices, especially phones, to limit exposure to more Israeli cyber disruptions. This came after reports that Israeli intelligence may have tracked down Hezbollah units in Lebanon using wireless signals from pager devices. Thousands of those pagers reportedly exploded, leaving many injured. One reason Israel’s cyberattacks worked so well is timing. Israeli forces launched the first blows—both in the air and online, giving them extra room to prep their defensive and offensive systems while Iran scrambled to catch up. Still, Iranian-backed groups aren’t done. Over the weekend, Israel’s National Cyber Directorate warned its citizens abroad not to fill out digital forms or click links on suspicious sites that may be harvesting personal data for intelligence. Gil Messing, chief of staff at Check Point Software, told reporters Saturday that cyber campaigns targeting Israel had recently “escalated a bit.” He didn’t mention any new damage but said there was a surge of disinformation on social media, including false texts about gas shortages and fake instructions telling people to avoid shelters. The Israeli civilian cyber defense agency also said Iran was trying again to break into internet-connected cameras for surveillance. That tactic is cheap, fast, and dangerous—and it’s hard to trace. Inside the US, the alarm bells are ringing again. John Hultquist, chief analyst for Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, posted on X that Iran’s cyber units often focus on “psychological purposes.” He added that his biggest fear right now is cyber espionage targeting US leaders. “I’m most concerned about cyber espionage against our leaders and surveillance aided by compromises in travel, hospitality, telecommunications, and other sectors where data could be used to identify and physically track persons of interest,” John wrote.

In a research note released Wednesday, FX strategists Oliver Levingston, Adarsh Sinha, and Janice Xue highlighted Australia’s fixed-income market as a likely hotspot for capital inflows amid ongoing global de-dollarization. “De-dollarization was a major theme on our trip to the United States and Canada, and we continue to highlight the significant impact small shifts in global fund managers’ asset allocations could have on the demand profile for AUD fixed income.” The note makes the case that Australia’s relatively small bond market could experience dramatic price swings if global investors keep fleeing U.S. dollar-denominated assets. Investors have been looking for more sound and undervalued alternatives as the greenback has lost its previously unassailable haven status, particularly after almost a year of political and economic tumult under President Donald Trump. Investors dump dollar amid Trump-era volatility The report directly attributes the trend to increasing global discomfort with U.S. financial stewardship. The re-emergence of Donald Trump on the political scene, along with a fresh wave of belligerent trade policies and what the bank calls “economic nationalism,” has only hastened investor diversification . Trump’s declaration of sweeping tariffs earlier this year, which markets dubbed “Liberation Day,” set off a global market selloff. Investors stampeded to pull out of U.S. markets, anxious about protracted uncertainty and trade isolationism. This “Sell America” movement was marked by heavy selling of Wall Street stocks, U.S. Treasurys, and even the dollar itself. The U.S. dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of leading currencies, has slid by about 9% year-to-date in 2025, its most significant decline in over 10 years. Investor conviction in the dollar is non-existent; as Bank of America’s June Global Fund Managers Survey showed, 86% of respondents believe the dollar will devalue in the coming 12 months , a new record low. The report found fund managers with less of a long-dollar bias than at any time in the past 20 years. Almost 20 percent of the 222 managers polled with $587 billion under management said that betting against the dollar was the most “crowded trade” globally. This loss of confidence has paved the way for other currencies, particularly those linked to stable economies rich in raw materials like Australia, to gain the favor of global reserve managers and institutional investors. Central banks boost demand for AUD bonds Now, Australia is feeling the consequences of that change in sentiment. Its 10-year government bond yield is about 4.24%, which is not that different from the U.S. equivalent of 4.43%. But Bank of America sees this gap widening in the years ahead. By late 2026, the bank predicts that Australian bonds will have a 75 basis point spread, which would entail stronger demand and higher prices. The note said that the demand outlook for AUD fixed-income assets appeared strong with support from Australia’s growing superannuation funds and the possibility of bank deregulation. One big reason is the rising demand for “peripheral dollar bloc assets,” consistently stable currencies in faraway lands from American politics, supported by strong local fundamentals. The proportion of official reserves in Australian dollars has doubled in the past ten years. The strategists estimate that a 1-percentage-point lift in global reserve demand would absorb 185% of the net supply of Australian sovereign bonds for the current fiscal year. Australia’s large pension funds have also been moving into the local bond market with increasing vigor. These superannuation funds are internationalizing their balance sheets, and the demand for AUD-denominated assets flows. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

As part of an industrial strategy for the decade 2025-2035, this move could benefit more than 7,000 businesses, according to the government. Britain will seek to slash the electricity bills of thousands of companies under a new industrial strategy to be published on Monday, June 23. This was after hearing calls from businesses to reduce high energy costs, which they argue hurt competitiveness and hinder growth. Britain’s new industrial strategy pledges massive development to the country’s economy Ramping up Britain’s sluggish growth has been a top priority for the government. However, lawmakers and business leaders had flagged the sky-high energy costs many companies already endure as a barrier to that ambition, with industry body Make UK urging the government to abandon climate levies placed on companies. To address this, Britain has been encouraged to do more to help its important industrial sectors. This will go a long way in improving its competitive edge as the United States and the European Union are also moving in that direction, in a trading world that the US President Donald Trump’s tariffs shook in recent months. Meanwhile, five sectoral strategies will be released alongside the plan, including advanced manufacturing, creative industries, and clean energy. The industrial strategy highlights eight key sectors where Britain excels, including defense and financial services. The government added that it would spare energy-intensive manufacturers from levies such as the renewables obligation to strengthen their international competitiveness . It also said that the energy measures would be paid for by transforming the energy system, not by ramping up household bills or taxes. Once they consult with stakeholders, they will fine-tune the details and eligibility of the program. Jonathan Reynolds, the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, commented on the topic of discussion. Reynolds highlighted that addressing energy costs and improving skills have been the top requests from businesses and their biggest challenge. Therefore, according to him, this government has taken note. Furthermore, Make UK described the industrial strategy as a “huge and necessary step forward,” addressing the skills gap in Britain’s workforce and access to funding. The Confederation of British Industry called it a “clear, positive message” that would lay a strong foundation for growth. This industrial strategy, Britain’s first in eight years, aims to increase the British Business Bank’s ability to invest in smaller companies and provide an additional 1.2 billion pounds, worth $1.61 billion annually, for skills development by 2028-2029. PM Sir Keir Starmer calls the new industrial strategy a “turning point” for the nation’s economy Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the industrial strategy is a “turning point” for Britain’s economy by backing key industries capable of growth. However, the Conservatives’ acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie, has criticized the strategy. According to Bowie, the UK needed a serious approach to energy policy that tackles the root cause of our high energy prices. He stated that it was amazing that “Labour” is finally recognizing that net-zero costs are so high that they need to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to help businesses pay their energy bills and prevent them from going bankrupt. Notably, UK manufacturers now face some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme would reduce costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027. In addition, around 500 energy-intensive companies, such as those in the steel industry, chemicals, and glassmaking, will see their network charges reduced. Interestingly, these companies are already receiving a 60% discount under the British Industry Supercharger scheme, which is set to rise to 90% after 2026. Monday’s announcement will also include moves to accelerate how long it can take to connect new factories and projects to the energy grid. The prime minister stated that the industrial strategy provides companies with the long-term certainty and direction they require to invest, innovate, and create good jobs that help people earn more money. It also seeks to help create over one million new well-paid jobs in the next ten years.

In a sea of sideways trading and bearish corrections, Mutuum Finance’s explosive presale momentum has placed it on the radar of crypto investors hunting for the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance, which cost only $0.03 in its presale, has already risen 200%, making it one of the hottest new crypto tokens this quarter. The project has already acquired over 12,300 investors who have chipped in $10.9 million while the presale is ongoing. Investors participating in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will enjoy a 100% return on investment when it goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance Changing the DeFi Lending Game Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing a new generation lending platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes lending simpler and trustless as borrowers can get lending through leveraging overcollateralized funds and lenders are rewarded through smart contracts. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools whose interest rates are floating. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. In the meantime, there are also the like of the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the user to agree on terms among themselves. That sort of setup of direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as those of meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Phase 5 of the Mutuum Finance Presale Is Underway, $10.9M+ Raised Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale became a record by raising over $10.9 million, attracting over 12,300 token holders. It is currently on Phase 5 investor confidence continues to grow as the platform distinguishes itself from short-term meme coins. Mutuum Finance Stablecoin and CertiK Audit In yet another step to further build its ecosystem Mutuum Finance is soon to launch a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins which have been challenged by price stability problems Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin is to be backed by real assets. The platform has also undergone a security audit by CertiK one of the most known names in blockchain security. Early Investors Benefit The project is also conducting a $100,000 giveaway where 10 people will be awarded a sum of $10,000 MUTM tokens. It is a huge incentive not only to the overall crypto community but also to the people who will be supporting the project in early phases. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) trends down toward $0.000010, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing major investor attention with a parabolic rise. Priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, MUTM has surged 200% since launch, raising over $10.9 million from more than 12,300 investors.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins the trading week, BTC is trading above $100,500 as the initial volatility from news over the weekend that the U.S. struck some of Iran's nuclear facilities begins to subside. While prices briefly dipped below six figures on Sunday in a risk-off reaction , markets have since stabilized. Equity futures are flat, and gold is up only marginally, suggesting that traders are not yet pricing in a broader escalation. The lack of follow-through in traditional markets may reflect expectations that Iran’s response will be contained or delayed, rather than immediate and destabilizing. Crude oil is holding its gains near $76 per barrel after spiking nearly 4% Sunday evening on fears that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a key chokepoint for global oil shipments. Still, commentary from U.S. officials and muted early-week trading suggest that investors remain in a wait-and-see mode. In crypto markets, altcoins that had mirrored BTC’s weekend drop, like ETH, XRP, and SOL, are also clawing back losses. For now, the market appears to be treating the U.S.-Iran clash as a geopolitical flashpoint, not a structural break. OKX Considering U.S. IPO: Report Crypto exchange OKX is considering a public listing in the U.S., according to a report from The Information . Earlier this year, the exchange announced a U.S. expansion after settling with the Department of Justice over accusations that it operated in the country without a money transmitter license. Among other crypto-linked companies, Bullish, a competitor to OKX and the parent company of CoinDesk, is also said to be considering an IPO given investors' appetite for companies with exposure to digital assets. OKX told CoinDesk it had no comment on the matter. Polymarket Bettors Less Certain About Second U.S. Strike on Iran Polymarket bettors are cooling to the idea that the U.S will hit Iran a second time before the end of the month. The 'yes' side of a contract asking if the U.S. will conduct another military action on Iran by June 30 is now trading at 54%, from 74% in the hours after the initial strike on Iranian nuclear sites. There appears to be a growing market belief that deconfliction – on both sides – is on the agenda, as evidenced by another contract asking bettors about the likelihood of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, which is currently trading at 49% down from 52% . Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin rebounded to $101,419 after a volatile 4.5% intraday swing, finding strong support at $99,000 amid geopolitical tensions and surging institutional buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. ETH: Ethereum fell 2.3% to $2,237 amid U.S.-Iran tensions, breaking a six-week consolidation pattern despite over $500 million in institutional accumulation. Gold: Bank of America analysts predict gold could hit $4,000 an ounce within a year, an 18% jump, driven less by geopolitical tensions and more by mounting U.S. fiscal debt and a global shift by central banks away from the dollar toward gold. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets fell Monday as the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites fueled oil price spikes and fears of broader Middle East escalation, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.56%.

Market conditions are moving quickly, but several projects are beginning to stand out. One is still in presale yet has over 2 million active users already. Others are gaining traction through protocol upgrades, market shifts, and new exchange activity. If you’re searching for the next highest-potential crypto, this guide highlights the top projects currently showing real progress. Each of these names has either recovered in price, revealed new features, or is preparing for a major update. These are not just temporary names getting attention, but projects backed by real use cases, growing adoption, or strong upcoming developments that could lift them in the near future. 1. BlockDAG: Rapid Presale Growth & Live User Activity BlockDAG is gaining momentum even before it launches on exchanges. The presale is now in Batch 29, priced at $0.0020 until June 24, with the next increase set at $0.0030. More than 23 billion BDAG coins have been sold so far, generating around $318 million. Early buyers have already seen returns of up to 2,670%, and the goal is a listing price of $0.05, offering close to a 25x rise. That has driven strong interest. A key differentiator for BlockDAG is the active user base, with over 2 million people already mining BDAG using the X1 mobile app. Physical mining devices are also in the rollout plan. The X30 and X100 units will be shipped in July, followed by the X10 in August. Listings are confirmed on major exchanges such as MEXC and BitMart once the presale ends. Halborn has completed its security audit, with CertiK still conducting reviews. Market-making and liquidity strategies are confirmed, meaning BDAG will enter with support in place. With the $600 million cap still open and a price jump locked in for June 24, BlockDAG clearly stands out as the next highest-potential crypto for those focused on real deployment and growth. 2. Cosmos: Ripple Collaboration and Steady Technical Support Cosmos (ATOM) has been under pressure this June, fluctuating between $3.74 and $4.00, facing resistance around $4.05. Despite market uncertainty, the project recently hosted its Sovereign EVM Day featuring Ripple, a move that may extend ATOM’s reach in DeFi. This opens the door to more users across different networks. On June 20, ATOM broke past $4.00 briefly before dipping, though it held above that mark. The platform completed a major software update earlier this month, which boosted its network reliability and improved cross-zone communication. Analysts now see the $4 area as an important support zone. If Cosmos climbs past $4.08, it may trigger further upside. Even though its recent movements are limited, ongoing improvements across the Cosmos ecosystem keep it listed among the next highest-potential crypto. 3. Render: Price Swings Create Breakout Setup Render (RNDR) experienced notable swings in June. After climbing to $8.45 on June 18 during a wave of interest in AI-linked projects, it dropped almost 14% shortly after. As of June 22, RNDR trades around $2.93. Though volatile, this range presents potential. Analysts are eyeing the $3.45–$3.65 region. A breakout from that area could lead to price targets at $4.19 and $5.70. Render is closely tied to AI stocks like Nvidia, which often drives parallel moves. On June 21, RNDR surged 8.3% to $10.25 in sync with a NASDAQ uptrend. However, on June 26, Coinbase will remove the Ethereum-based RNDR and switch to its Solana version. While this could reduce ETH-pair trading temporarily, it won’t affect the underlying project. If support levels hold after this transition, Render could be in a strong position to recover, making it a contender for the next highest-potential crypto. 4. Cronos: Recent Pullback and July Speed Upgrade Cronos (CRO) declined nearly 5% this past week, moving from $0.088 to about $0.0839 by June 22. However, this dip followed a breakout on June 18, when CRO briefly reached $0.0912. Experts see $0.084 as a key price level. If that area holds, another push toward the $0.094–$0.096 resistance band could follow. Cronos is preparing for a major update in July that will introduce sub-second transactions compatible with Ethereum. This would allow faster, cheaper dApp activity, which is attractive for developers. With expanding use in DeFi and GameFi and strong support from Crypto.com, Cronos may have more potential than is currently priced in. If the ongoing symmetrical triangle setup plays out, the price could revisit $0.13 or even rise to $0.26 in the months ahead. This retracement could turn out to be a smart entry point for those watching for the next highest-potential crypto. Choosing the Next Big Crypto Coin The crypto space is shifting again, but this time, attention is turning toward projects that are rolling out features, building communities, and planning real launches. BlockDAG leads this list with an active user base, audited security, and physical hardware already in motion. Cosmos and Cronos are showing signs of growth through integration and network upgrades, while Render offers recovery potential after its upcoming platform transition. These projects aren’t trending without cause. Each one is driven by important updates and real-world use cases. If you’re scanning the market for the next highest-potential crypto , these are the names that are not just showing movement but also setting up for the next major breakout.

That has triggered violent selloffs across every major market, from stocks to Bitcoin, from oil to the dollar and the euro. The world’s financial system is now reacting like it just got sucker punched. Its unlike anything we have ever seen. Oil was first to go wild. In the first trading session after the futures market opened, US crude rose $1.76, or 2.38%, to $75.60 per barrel. Brent crude climbed $1.80, or 2.34%, landing at $78.81. Brent even briefly touched $81, which was a 5.7% spike, before it slipped back. By press time, the price gains were gone. Oil was down 0.5%, which made no sense to anyone watching. Traders are now locked on Tehran, waiting to see what it does next. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, said Sunday that Iran reserves “ all options ” to defend its sovereignty. S&P Global Platts noted the price surge could reverse entirely if Iran chooses not to respond. Bitcoin dives, rebounds, then tanks again as ETF flows collapse The crypto market didn’t waste a second. Bitcoin had dropped to $98,000 on Sunday. That was its lowest point in over a month. Less than an hour later, it swung back above $102,000, before slipping again. At the time of writing, it sat at $100,879. The market was a disaster. More than $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in just 24 hours, and over 95% were long bets. Source: TradingView Things got uglier when inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs dried up. Between Monday and Wednesday, $1.04 billion had gone in, based on CoinGlass data. But by Thursday, that number was flat. On Friday, just $6.4 million came in. That was the same day President Donald Trump left the G7 early and announced a two-week review of US options on Iran. The assumption that Bitcoin would act like a safe haven collapsed. It started trading like a risky tech stock instead. Kaiko, a crypto data provider, said Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq had surged quite fast in recent weeks. Stock indexes bleed across Asia, Europe, and US futures Futures tied to US stocks also started dropping. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4%. Asian markets opened deep in the red too. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 0.56%, and the Topix fell 0.49%. The worst-hit companies were all in tech: Screen Holdings crashed 4.78%, Lasertec Corp sank 4.31%, and Disco Corp went down 3.38%. Big names like Advantest and Softbank didn’t escape either, falling 1.66% and 0.76%. It was the same story in South Korea. The Kospi index lost 1.05%. The Kosdaq, which includes smaller-cap companies, got hit even harder, down 1.78%. The country’s top automakers took the brunt. Hyundai Motor shares dropped 4.05%, and Kia Corp fell 4.15%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also took a dive, down 0.76%. In Hong Kong, futures for the Hang Seng Index pointed to more losses. They stood at 23,396, well below the index’s last close of 23,530.48, suggesting more downside ahead. Japanese carmakers had no luck either. As of press time, Nissan Motor dropped 2.22%, and Mazda Motor was down 2.17%. Mitsubishi Motors lost 1.87%, Honda Motor slid 1.55%, and Toyota dropped 1.36%. Over in Europe, markets weren’t much better. The IBEX 35 rose 0.77%, closing at 13,850.3, and Germany’s DAX jumped 1.27% to 23,350.55. But the FTSE in London dropped 0.2% to 8,774.65, and France’s CAC 40 was completely flat at 7,589.66. The STOXX600, a broader European index, barely moved, up just 0.13% to 536.53. And the euro was trading at $1.15 against the dollar after going as high as $1.8 just an hour ago.

It all started when a user named Altcoin Bale posted on X (formerly Twitter), claiming: “BREAKING: SEC v XRP final decision could be delayed until late 2026” The post quickly grabbed attention, but many XRP supporters in the comment section disagreed, calling it misleading. So, what’s the truth? Here’s what’s actually happening: As part of the ongoing case, both Ripple and the U.S. SEC recently requested the court to keep the appeals process on hold for now. The SEC has been asked to submit a status update by August 15, 2025 — but that doesn’t mean the final decision will take until 2026. Ripple also filed a supplemental letter supporting a legal request called a Motion for an Indicative Ruling . However, legal expert Marc Fagel commented that this latest letter doesn’t really add anything new. He said it seems like Ripple just wanted to reassure its supporters after some people on Crypto Twitter expressed doubts. Fagel added that predicting the judge’s next move is difficult, as this situation is quite unique. If the judge rejects the motion, Ripple will have to decide whether it wants to continue its appeal or settle. Legal expert Bill Morgan also weighed in and called it an ‘improbable outcome.’ He said, “This is not on the cards unless Judge Torres rules against the latest joint motion and rather that make the common sense decision to live with the summary judgement decision and the current penalty and permanent injunction, the settlement process breaks down completely and both parties run their appeals.” Conclusion: There’s no official information suggesting that the Ripple vs. SEC case will be delayed till 2026.

In a televised address , Sánchez argued that such a spending level would be “unnecessary and disproportionate.” Earlier on Sunday, diplomats said NATO’s 32 member states had agreed on a summit statement setting a 5% of GDP target for annual defense and security spending by 2035, despite Spain’s objections. Sanchez had informed NATO chief Mark Rutte of his country’s desire to opt out of a new 5% spending target in a letter sent Thursday, June 19. The letter expressed worries that Spain might disrupt the entire summit. According to Sanchez, they completely understand that other countries want to boost their defense spending, but they will not do that. This statement was made after he noted that Spain can fulfill all its NATO commitments for personnel or equipment by only spending 2.1% of its GDP. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Spain spent about 1.28% of its GDP on defense last year, which was the lowest amount in the alliance, according to NATO estimates. In April, Sanchez agreed to speed up efforts to reach NATO’s goal of 2% this year. NATO has not yet made the compromise summit text public. It will only be official once the leaders of NATO’s 32 member countries approve it at the summit. However, diplomats mentioned that changing the wording from “we commit” to “allies commit” helped Spain argue that the promise does not apply to every member. President Trump increases defense spending to 5% for NATO members US President Donald Trump demanded a big increase in NATO’s defense spending target of 5% of gross domestic product. This was after NATO chief Mark Rutte suggested the target be reached by increasing NATO’s key target for defense spending from 2% to 3.5% of GDP, while spending an additional 1.5% on related areas such as cyber security and modifying roads and bridges for military vehicles. NATO officials argue that substantial hikes in defense spending are needed to meet the increasing threat from Russia and permit Europe to assume more responsibility for its security, as the United States shifts its strategic focus to China. Sanchez maintains his decision despite Trump’s threats When Sanchez announced that Spain would not comply with the new defense spending target, he risked provoking Trump. Earlier, the president repeatedly emphasized that European countries fall short of their defense budget target. Trump said he would not defend them if they failed to reach this target. In addition, Trump warned Spain on Friday, June 20, that they must meet their target, pointing out that Madrid is notorious for its low defense spending. However, according to him, this would not apply to the US because it had paid a large amount of money over a long period. In 2024, NATO says that Washington devoted approximately 3.19% of its GDP to defense. Still, Sanchez said Spain did not have to achieve the new target and that trying to do so would result in drastic cuts in spending on social services such as state pensions or tax rises.

This decline, which saw the Bitcoin price drop approximately 4% to around $99,300, coincided with a broader market sell-off, with Ethereum (ETH) experiencing an even sharper decline of nearly 10%. Overall, the total cryptocurrency market took a significant hit, falling about 7% in just 24 hours. Geopolitical Unrest And Tariff Troubles The timing of this downturn was particularly notable, occurring just hours after the US targeted three key nuclear sites in Iran. Tensions had escalated following a United Nations report that indicated Iran was not adhering to international prohibitions against developing a military nuclear program. In response to these revelations, Israel conducted strikes against Iran, leading to further retaliation from the Islamic Republic. On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared on social media: This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU! Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure – Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 This recent plummet below the psychologically significant $100,000 threshold follows a year of substantial gains for Bitcoin. After Trump took office in January, Bitcoin reached all-time highs above $100,000 in February, buoyed by executive orders aimed at supporting the cryptocurrency sector. However, the cryptocurrency’s price soon mirrored the broader declines in financial markets, particularly after Trump announced severe tariffs in April, which saw Bitcoin fall to nearly $75,000, its lowest point in 2025. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin had seen a resurgence, particularly in May when it reached new highs as Wall Street investors returned to the cryptocurrency through US exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, by late Sunday, there were signs of recovery, with Bitcoin trading approximately at $101,300, down only 1% over the previous day, while ETH managed to pare its losses to around $2,200. Forced Liquidations Exacerbate Bitcoin Sell-Off According to CNBC, Iran has also threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping route responsible for approximately 20% of the global oil supply, further adding to the broader financial uncertainty. JPMorgan warned that such a blockade could drive oil prices up to $130 per barrel, which would have significant implications for US inflation, potentially pushing it back toward 5%—a level not seen since March 2023. While Bitcoin has often been promoted as an inflation hedge, its recent behavior aligns more closely with that of high-beta tech stocks. Data from crypto provider Kaiko indicates that Bitcoin’s correlation with the tech-heavy Nasdaq has increased sharply in recent weeks, particularly following the surge in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: $312M ETH Transfer Triggers Sell-Off Fears As Ethereum Price Crashes Below Support Institutional investment patterns have also shifted. More than $1.04 billion flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs from Monday to Wednesday last week, but this momentum dissipated as the weekend approached, with minimal net movement on Thursday and only $6.4 million on Friday. The technical aspects of the market further exacerbated the sell-off. Research from CoinGlass revealed that Bitcoin’s drop below $99,000 triggered forced liquidations across offshore derivatives platforms, including Binance and Bybit. During this period, over $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated within 24 hours, with more than 95% of these coming from long positions, highlighting the market’s overexposure.

The plans to go public come months after the firm reentered the US marketplace in April, underscoring a renewed dedication to global expansion and regulatory compliance. Crypto journalist Yueqi Yang revealed the news, which matches the broader trend of cryptocurrency companies indirectly venturing into traditional finance (TradiFi) – through stocks – as investor interest in digital current exposure increases. Yueqi Yang @Yueqi_Yang · Follow OKX, one of the top three global crypto exchanges, will consider an IPO in the U.S., after relaunching in the U.S. in April. From IPOs to crypto treasury stocks, crypto is booming right now, but the rally is playing out in the stock market, at valuations that even surprised 1:25 AM · Jun 23, 2025 77 Reply Copy link Read 12 replies OKX’s strategic reentry to the US The exchange had previously scaled back its operations in America due to regulatory hurdles. However, OKX relaunched in the US in April 2025 after key restructuring and alignment with compliance policies, which included paying $500 million in fines. The strategic return opens the gates to one of the largest cryptocurrency user bases globally. Moreover, a public listing positions OKX as a top competitor for institutional trust in the digital assets industry. The enhanced regulatory clarity under the Trump administration sets a lucrative environment for OKX’s public debut. The IPO speculation comes as crypto-related equities flourish. BlackRock has become one of the top Bitcoin holders, now owning over 3% of all BTC in circulation through ETFs. Also, public firms like Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Coinbase are experiencing tremendous crypto-linked growths. Stablecoin issuer Circle saw its shares gain over 400% after an IPO , while Animoca Brands is considering listing in the US due to Trump’s pro-crypto laws. These trends have flooded Wall Street with capital hunting crypto’s upside potential – without directly holding actual tokens. OKX looks to ride this momentum with its potential IPO to offer enthusiasts an equity-based and regulated opportunity to capitalize on the booming crypto market. The exchange’s deep liquidity, expanding product offerings, and massive user base position OKX as a top option for institutional portfolios. Most importantly, an IPO will likely enhance OKX’s governance, global legitimacy, and transparency, especially as CEXs witness increased scrutiny. Besides enriching OKX’s company profile, an IPO may change the market outlook on exchanges from speculative platforms to authentic financial institutions.

Analysts half-expect things to get worse today, according to a report from CNBC, warning that the entire global oil market and economy is at risks never seen before if Tehran responds militarily as promised. Iran’s foreign minister said the country has “all options” on the table to defend its sovereignty. As of early Asian trading hours, US WTI crude jumped more than 2% to $75.22 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent crude pushed nearly 2% higher to $78.53. Iran’s threat to shut Strait of Hormuz triggers new panic Lawmakers in Tehran have approved a proposal to shut the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway that carries almost 20% of global oil supply. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said, “This time feels different, given the barrage of missiles that have been fired for over a week and now the direct involvement of the USA.” Iran’s decision to respond militarily, or even just harass shipping in the strait, could send prices sharply higher. Saul Kavonic, senior energy analyst at MST Marquee, told CNBC that “even a degree of harassment” of tankers in that region could push oil to nearly $100 per barrel. A full closure that lasts several weeks would trigger Western military action to reopen the strait, he said. The real concern is that a prolonged event would take supply off the market, fast. Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, agreed that a military response by Iran could go far beyond just naval threats. If Iran targets energy facilities in the Gulf or directly hits LNG and oil infrastructure, prices won’t stop at $100. “A prolonged closure or destruction of key Gulf energy infrastructure could propel crude prices to above $100,” Bob said. He warned that if Iran used all its military options, the conflict could last “longer than the last two Gulf Wars.” Goldman Sachs expects brief oil surge if flows get hit Meanwhile analysts at Goldman Sachs also said the fallout from the US strikes on Iran has raised the chances of a serious energy supply crunch. In a note led by Daan Struyven, the analysts said if flows through the Strait of Hormuz drop by 50% for just a month, and stay down by 10% for nearly a year, Brent crude could briefly hit $110 per barrel. If Iran’s oil exports fall by 1.75 million barrels per day, prices could touch $90. That’s the bank’s projection, even though they still think full-on supply cuts are unlikely. Goldman said both the US and China would have strong incentives to prevent that kind of sustained disruption. But they admitted, “the downside risks to energy supply and the upside risk to our energy price forecasts have risen.” That’s Wall Street code for: be ready for higher prices. The impact wouldn’t be limited to oil either. European natural gas markets are also in danger. Goldman warned that TTF futures could jump to €74 per megawatt-hour, or around $25 per million BTUs. That’s close to the levels that crushed demand during the 2022 energy crisis. If the disruption drags on, prices could spike to €100. Vandana Hari, CEO of Vanda Insights, said most traders are still sitting on their hands, watching for the next move from Iran. “The picture is a little bit mixed, and I think traders will err on the side of caution, not panicking unless there is more real evidence to do,” Vandana said. But nobody’s ignoring what’s happening. The Strait of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, is one of the most important arteries in the global energy system. A real closure, or even the threat of one, means delays in shipments, panic buying, and a surge in volatility. The global oil market just entered a dangerous new phase, and the next move belongs to Iran. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The average purchase price was approximately $106,408 per Bitcoin. The leading cryptocurrency has dropped over 4% in the last week, now trading at just above $101,000. With this latest acquisition, the company now holds 11,111 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at over $1.07 billion. The average cost basis stands at $95,869 per coin. Metaplanet shares traded down 3.5% today. This marks a major milestone in Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which began mid-2024 and accelerated through early 2025. Metaplanet’s total stash has grown nearly 28-fold since December 2024. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,111 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 11,111 BTC* pic.twitter.com/7ceEeSh1X4 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Metaplanet Reports Quarter to Date BTC Yield of 107.9% Metaplanet reports a quarter-to-date BTC yield of 107.9%, up from 95.6% in Q1 and 309.8% in Q4 2024. The metric, which the firm uses as a key performance indicator, tracks Bitcoin per fully diluted share over time, excluding the effects of dilution. The firm also posted a BTC gain of 4,367 BTC for $451.2 million for the ongoing quarter, based on reference prices from Bitflyer. The company has funded its Bitcoin purchases through a series of capital market activities, including multiple zero-coupon bond issuances and equity-based instruments. Since January, Metaplanet has issued and redeemed more than a dozen series of ordinary bonds and stock acquisition rights, largely subscribed by EVO FUND . Over 210 million shares have been issued under its “210 Million Plan.” Metaplanet Wants to Buy 210,000 BTC by 2027 Often dubbed as Japan’s Strategy, the company aims to buy 210,000 Bitcoins by the end 2027. Between May and June 2025 alone, Metaplanet raised over $300 million through bonds and exercised stock rights, with proceeds explicitly allocated for Bitcoin accumulation. The company formalized Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business line in December 2024, a pivot from its hotel management business. Since then, it has disclosed regular updates on its BTC position, including total holdings, cost basis, and share dilution metrics. As of June 23, Metaplanet’s fully diluted share count stood at 759 million, with Bitcoin per 1,000 fully diluted shares reaching 0.0146 BTC. The company has not indicated a halt or slowdown in its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. It continues to use capital raised through financial instruments to increase exposure to the digital asset, in line with its stated goal of enhancing shareholder value through BTC accumulation.

Rising global tensions and economic worries have shaken the market, causing altcoins to tumble too. But while most coins are stuck in a quiet phase, a few altcoins are quietly preparing for a strong comeback. Here are top discounted altcoins to buy during the market crash: XRP (XRP) XRP is currently trading at $2.02, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours. The current trend is bearish, but XRP could bounce back in July, with prices expected to range between $1.91 and $2.22. While it dropped over 12% this month, July could bring a rebound as analysts see a possible 10% rise if prices rise as expected. Stellar (XLM) Stellar is currently trading at $0.2303, down 2.6%. Stellar has dropped nearly 20% in June, showing bearish sentiment. However, July looks promising, and it could see a rebound with prices ranging from $0.26 to $0.28, a 23% gain from current levels. The RSI has dropped to 27.8, showing XLM is oversold, often a sign of an upcoming bounce. While most moving averages still point down, some momentum indicators are starting to turn positive. Sui (SUI) Sui is currently trading at $2.49, down 2.5% in the past day. Technical indicators are mostly bearish, but we could see a bounce if buying interest returns. With strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential, this dip could offer an opportunity, if the momentum shifts. SUI has lost over 30% this month and could continue to dip towards $1.97. However, analysts expect a rebound in July with targets ranging from $1.84 to $2.02. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.1523, down 1.3% in the past day. Dogecoin dropped over 33% in June, with bearish sentiment still lingering. But analysts expect a rebound to around $0.17 in July, a 19% gain from current levels. Dogecoin’s 2025 outlook remains cautiously bullish. If the market picks up and utility grows, DOGE could climb back to $0.30–$0.40, and could also retest its all-time high near $0.70. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is currently trading at $0.5463. Cardano started June with a bounce from $0.51 but remains range-bound between $0.65 and $0.70. Holding above $0.60 could trigger a bullish breakout, with targets up to $1.43. But if it fails, a drop to $0.50 is likely. Over the next 12 days, a move above $0.72 could push ADA up 15–18%, particularly if market sentiment improves.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|DOGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 03:59:44

The move would mark a sharp turnaround for the Seychelles-registered exchange, which exited the US market after a series of regulatory violations. In February, OKX agreed to pay over $504m in penalties to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice. OKX, one of the top three global crypto exchanges, will consider an IPO in the U.S., after relaunching in the U.S. in April. From IPOs to crypto treasury stocks, crypto is booming right now, but the rally is playing out in the stock market, at valuations that even surprised… — Yueqi Yang (@Yueqi_Yang) June 22, 2025 OKX Makes a Big Return to US Markets Prosecutors said the company operated an unlicensed money-transmitting business and failed to implement basic anti-money laundering controls. Between 2017 and its exit, OKX allegedly processed more than $1 trillion in trades for US users despite policies suggesting otherwise. Just two months later, OKX announced its return to the US market. The company set up a regional headquarters in San Jose, California, and tapped Roshan Robert, a former executive at Morgan Stanley and Barclays, as its US CEO. At the time, Robert said the firm’s re-entry reflected “a commitment to responsible growth” and added that OKX was working closely with regulators to stay compliant. The exchange has been working to rebuild its reputation, particularly in the eyes of US regulators. Its leadership has framed the relaunch not as a relabeling effort, but as a strategic reset focused on transparency and adherence to evolving US crypto laws. IPO Plans Signal Ambition, but Regulatory Hurdles Still Loom A listing on a US stock exchange would mark a big shift for OKX, potentially opening the door to greater institutional trust and a broader investor base. The company has not yet filed paperwork with the SEC, and the timeline remains unclear. OKX is not alone in exploring a public offering. Bullish , backed by investor Peter Thiel, and Gemini , founded by the Winklevoss twins, have both confidentially filed for IPOs in recent months. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuer Circle recently closed an oversubscribed listing valuing it at nearly $8.1b on a fully diluted basis. However, regulatory scrutiny continues to shadow OKX. In May, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission said it planned to shut down certain exchanges, including OKX, for operating without a license. If OKX proceeds with a US IPO, it will gauge investor interest while also revealing how much leeway regulators are willing to give crypto firms after past violations.

This new cryptocurrency, now in phase 5 of its presale, has raised $10,900,000 and sold over 560 million tokens, attracting 12,300 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers 100% returns on the price of launching at $0.06, making it a solid lending protocol in the decentralized finance field. And is it possible to achieve the same astronomical growth of Ripple (XRP) that happened in 2017, when the XRP increased its value 18x, to 3.84 dollars? XRP’s Historic Surge Ripple’s XRP electrified the crypto market in 2017. Starting at a modest $0.006 in January, it climbed steadily. By April, XRP reached $0.05, gaining traction among crypto enthusiasts. May saw it hit $0.25, fueled by a booming market. The real fireworks came in December, when XRP skyrocketed to $3.84 by January 2018. This translated to a staggering 63,900% return from its yearly low. Such growth showcased XRP’s ability to capitalize on market fervor. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to harness similar momentum with its innovative lending model, positioning it as a top crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting investor interest in phase 5 of its 11-phase presale. Priced at $0.03, the token has surged 200% from its phase 1 price of $0.01. With over 40% of phase 5 filled, the window to secure tokens at this level is closing fast. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, reducing potential gains. Investors buying now are guaranteed a 100% return at the $0.06 launch price. Moreover, analysts project a $3 post-launch value, suggesting a 9,900% return. This makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout crypto investment. Innovative Lending Platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is breaking the charts of decentralized finance with dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract system allows one to deposit their stablecoins into smart-contract pools and earn interest passively in dynamically changing rates. The Peer-to-Peer model is associated with direct lending, which makes it more transparent and allows users to control it. The app is based on Ethereum and has a Layer- 2 implementation, which guarantees cheap and speedy transactions. The team recently completed a Certik audit, scoring an impressive 80.00 for security with no vulnerabilities found. Furthermore, active monitoring and strong social media engagement bolster its reliability. This robust setup positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to invest in. Community Rewards and Incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fostering community engagement with exciting initiatives. A $100,000 giveaway is underway, splitting $10,000 in MUTM tokens among 10 winners. Participation requires a $50 presale investment and completing simple tasks like submitting a wallet address. Additionally, the team launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, who will receive bonus tokens for maintaining their rankings. These efforts strengthen investor trust and drive demand. As the crypto market evolves, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for its practical utility and community focus, making it a compelling crypto investment for 2025. Chasing Ripple’s Legacy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to challenge Ripple’s 2017 success story. While XRP leveraged market enthusiasm, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines affordability with cutting-edge DeFi solutions. Its $0.03 presale price offers a low entry point, unlike XRP’s post-rally highs. Analysts predict a $3 valuation post-launch, driven by its lending platform and stablecoin integration. With a guaranteed 100% return at launch and potential for exponential growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a top crypto to buy now. Don’t miss this opportunity—join the presale and explore its potential in the crypto market today.

Many believe it could stage another 10,000% rally—but not anytime soon. While analysts suggest that SHIB could repeat its explosive growth by 2030, a new meme coin is emerging that could potentially disrupt that timeline. Welcome to Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —the meme coin that won’t wait for 2030 to make millionaires. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Sluggish Climb Ahead? SHIB’s June 2025 chart reveals a market in consolidation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 35.72, hinting at potential upside, but trading volume tells a different story. With just $153.4 million exchanged in the last 24 hours—a 33.2% drop—SHIB is showing signs of fatigue. The token dipped 1.44% recently to $0.00001170, weighed down by weak short-term sentiment and uninspiring burn activity. Only 19 million tokens were burned in a 24-hour period—insufficient to trigger meaningful deflationary momentum. That’s not to say SHIB lacks long-term potential. But that rally might take years, possibly unfolding slowly between now and 2030. The Meme Coin Set For Massive Rally While SHIB consolidates and plays the long game, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is engineering a high-speed shortcut to meme coin dominance. More than just a meme token, LILPEPE is a Layer 2 blockchain purpose-built for speed, ultra-low fees, and rock-solid security—all powered by the viral force of memes. In just its first two presale stages, Little Pepe raised $1,325,000. It has now moved into Stage 3, where tokens are available at just $0.0012—a price point that’s attracting savvy early adopters like a magnet. With 1 billion tokens allocated for this stage, the presale aims to raise another $1.2 million, and based on current momentum, it may sell out in record time. This early-stage surge confirms one thing: top crypto investors see in LILPEPE what they saw in SHIB back in its infancy—but with far less waiting. LILPEPE Could Rally 10,000% Before 2026 Where Shiba Inu may take five more years to revisit its peak, Little Pepe could achieve a 10,000% rally before the end of 2025. That prediction comes from seasoned analysts tracking emerging meme coins with real tech and tokenomics behind them. LILPEPE isn’t just a meme—it’s an ecosystem. Its tokenomics reflect a mature, forward-thinking design: 26.5% of the 100 billion total supply is allocated to the presale. 10% goes to liquidity to ensure smooth trading on decentralized exchanges. 30% is set aside as chain reserves for sustainability. 10% is allocated for decentralized exchange (DEX) listings. 10% is earmarked for aggressive marketing to fuel brand growth. 13.5% supports staking and community rewards. 0% tax, ensuring fairness and appeal for all investors.

One of the biggest losers in the recent slide was XRP, which is down over 7% in the past month. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is down over 8% in the past week. The main trigger for this decline in the crypto market is rising military tensions in the Middle East. Trump’s recent threat to escalate tensions with Iran into military conflict has also been a major contributing factor. However, Bitcoin has shown its resilience, remaining above $104,000 since the conflict began. Amid this depressed performance of XRP and ADA, investors are looking for new opportunities for growth. One of the most exciting prospects in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which could be one of the biggest gainers of 2025. On-chain data shows that whales are quietly shifting capital into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in anticipation of the coming surge once things cool down in the Middle East. So far, investors in the project’s presale have raised over $10.95 million in the ongoing presale. A major factor for the optimism in the market is the recent passing of the GENIUS Act in the US Senate. The bill will provide regulatory clarity in the crypto sector and is expected to spur massive growth in the coming years. It could also increase enterprise adoption, leading to a flood of institutional capital into the crypto sector. To position yourself for the expected flood of capital, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect option. A deep dive into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector that is built for utility and scalability. The project is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders or borrowers. As lenders, they can deposit their assets in the protocol’s pools to earn interest. The interest payments they receive are based on the pool utilization rate. To determine the pool utilization rate, the pool measures the amount of assets being actively borrowed from a pool compared to the total amount of assets in that pool. As the utilization rate rises, and thus the interest rate, it pushes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it encourages lenders to deposit more liquidity in the pools to benefit from the rising yields. The result is that liquidity in the pools increases, which lowers the interest rates, creating a self-sustaining loop that ensures optimal capital utilization. To protect liquidity in the pools, all loans must be overcollateralized. That means that a borrower deposits collateral that is worth more than the value of the assets they acquire. If a loan falls below a set level of collateralization, liquidators step in and acquire the debt at a discount. This discount can be adjusted upwards to ensure speed liquidations. An internal stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a stablecoin that will be based on the blockchain and pegged to the value of the USD. To mint stablecoins, users of the protocol will need to deposit collateral that is over-collateralized. The main difference between Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin and other decentralized stablecoins is that it will allow multi-asset collateralization. That means a user will be able to back a single position with a basket of assets. They will also be allowed to top up their collateral to ensure the position remains collateralized. Best of all, they will earn interest from assets used as collateral for the stablecoin. This interest will go towards the interest payments for their stablecoin position, lowering their rates. The MUTM token presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 per token. So far, investors in the presale have raised over $10.95 million, with the figures rising daily as new investors rush to secure their tokens. The current token price in phase is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. That will reduce the guaranteed ROI from the current 100% to 71.43%. Many investors understand this metric, which has led to a surge of interest in the presale. So far, 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, barely two weeks after they launched. Summary Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a CertiK-audited presale project that is built on utility. That means it will continue to deliver value for its community long after it launches. Unlike meme coins, which run purely on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will never run out of steam. At the current price of $0.03 per token, you are getting your tokens at a 50% discount to the planned listing price of $0.06. This could be a life-changing opportunity, with analysts forecasting that the price of MUTM tokens could rise 2,100% after the tokens go live.

Solana is hovering under $150 despite strong DeFi inflows and growing ETF hype. A breakout above this level would catapult it toward $160. However if the altcoin slips below $145, $120 could be in the cards. But for those feeling the FOMO heading into summer the real buzz is around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a new crypto coin under $1 that’s generating viral attention for its explosive potential and ticking momentum indicators. Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the fifth phase of its presale. Early price predictions show the token will reach $2 after launch and $10 ATH by 2026. Stage 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed profit of 100% ROI at launch. If you’re searching for what to buy before June ends both Solana and Mutuum Finance offer better plays blue-chip stability paired with high-conviction rocket fuel. Solana price holds below $150 as momentum builds Solana (SOL) has seen price back towards a level of $148, after a brief pullback off of a high of almost $160 made back in early June. It is in the wake of interest in altcoins that has structurally strengthened as major rallies approach towards such going forward. The amount of on-chain activity has been high and the DeFi ecosystem in Solana has continued to expand with the total value locked (TVL) going above 4.8 billion, its highest since 2022. The present tendency of SOL to retest previous resistance as support fits that pattern of breakouts in small cap assets. In this regard, although Solana is a high-liquidity rally participant, recently unveiled lower-price tokens with increased volatility and upside are born, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Presale frenzy peaks, Mutuum Finance hits $11 million raised Mutuum Finance is running wild in popularity. With its trailblazing two-way lending model, this DeFi behemoth has already attracted more than 12,300 investors and raised $11 million, and it’s not slowing down. The Mutuum Finance token price will jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, a 16.67% increase, so investors who come aboard here are in for massive gains. Early bird investors are locking profits. Mutuum Finance lending: smarter, simpler, decentralized Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, offering users stable returns from USDT pools via the P2C framework and full ownership of direct crypto transfer via the P2P framework. Mutuum Finance’s USD-pegged stablecoin Mutuum Finance’s upcoming overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability while avoiding flaws found in algorithmic stablecoins. While the project is already certified by CertiK, Mutuum Finance is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and investors who pay attention at this point might benefit the most in the future. On top of that, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will each receive $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens. Solana (SOL) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging as two of the most compelling sub‑$1 altcoin plays heading into the summer 2025 rally. But Mutuum Finance is where the real breakout energy lies, still just $0.03, up to $11 million raised, and over 12,300 early investors locked in. With a unique two-way lending system, a stablecoin launch, and a 100% ROI already baked in at listing, MUTM is positioned as the highest-upside DeFi coin to buy now before its next price jump.

By contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading under $0.05 in its presale, is standing out. The project has already raised over $11 million in presale and 12,300 early supporters have already joined the campaign. MUTM’s tokenomics and DeFi lending model are fueling forecasts of a potential leap to $5 post-launch, making it a rare new cryptocurrency worth close attention in today’s market. Cardano price action Cardano (ADA) is now priced around $0.60, slightly above a major support level of $0.588 to $0.615. The wider resistance is at the level of $0.65-$0.70 where several rejections have been witnessed though the MACD and RSI indicators show signs of bearish or neutral momentum. Analyst projections are now mixed. On the one hand there is the group that predicts ADA to range between $0.60-$0.77 in the summer months and on the other are those that predict bullish upsides of $0.95-$1.00 by December, but such a route would require a clear breakout price above $0.66-$0.70. It is on this backdrop that a crypto is crawling onto crypto talks, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance presale hits $11 million Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the most promising DeFi players with its presale shattering more than $11 million and welcoming over 12,300 investors before its time. The hype for the project is in top gear, and this is a super strong indicator of the project’s future. In the current stage, MUTM tokens are at $0.03, but that is for a short while. Stage 6 will drive the price to $0.035. Demand is growing exponentially and Mutuum Finance’s first-mover advantage in the decentralized lending market is worth even more as it will be one of the greatest early-stage DeFi investments for 2025. $100,000 MUTM giveaway: 10 participants to win $10K Mutuum Finance is a new protocol wanting to compensate the early backers it has on its platform and has created a $100,000 giveaway , during which 10 entrants will be chosen and given $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. It will be a reward for the fast-growing community in the project and appreciation to early investors. But the clock is ticking. Don’t miss this opportunity to be one of the winners and in the process, earning a position as one of the most discussed new DeFi projects. Built on trust and transparency Most DeFi protocols fail because they are not practicing their promises but Mutuum Finance is demonstrating resilience through exhibiting genuine credibility and infrastructure. The platform’s smart contracts have been completely audited by CertiK. This type of third-party audit stabilizes Mutuum Finance’s foundation. Cardano’s $0.95 price target feels modest as it struggles to break above key resistance levels, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing serious attention with much stronger growth potential. With a target price of $5 by 2025, MUTM has already raised more than 11 million dollars from 12300+ early investors and is priced under $0.05. The strong tokenomics and a $100K giveaway of its real DeFi use have landed it among the winners of emerging altcoins.

Solana SOL, XRP XRP, and Dogecoin DOGE, which were hardest-hit among the altcoins, are showing signs of recovery as leveraged bets reset and spot buying returns. Liquidations pause as market resets Over the last 24 hours, crypto markets absorbed another $642 million in liquidations, adding to the $595 million flushed on Saturday, bringing the two-day tally to over $1.2 billion. Bitcoin BTC led the bleeding, with $230 million in liquidated bets, followed by ether ETH at $188 million in long liquidations. While, SOL saw $28 million in liquidations, XRP took $21 million, and DOGE over $25 million. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open). A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. The sell-offs began late Saturday after former U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed coordinated strikes on Iran’s key uranium enrichment sites. However, by Monday, the worst appeared to be over. Bitcoin clawed back to $101,237. Ether hovered near $2,236, SOL edged up to $133. While, XRP traded above $2, and DOGE hovered just around 15 cents. Losses persisted on the daily chart, but the bounce suggested dip buyers were stepping in fast. Analysts say institutional flows and growing use cases are helping some tokens snap back faster than others. Altcoins display resilience “While Bitcoin's volatility has been the focus after the U.S.-Iran escalation, the altcoin market is showing signs of divergent strength,” said Eugene Cheung, Chief Commercial Officer at OSL, said in a Telegram message. “Ethereum continues to attract institutional interest amid growing ETF inflows, while Solana and other Layer 1 tokens benefit from improving network activity, developer adoption, and ETF approval speculation,” Cheung added. Others say the market’s quick rebound reflects a broader belief that the geopolitical fallout will remain localized, with limited macro spillover. “The market is fairly optimistic that the Iran-Israeli conflict will remain muted and its economic impact will be locally contained,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “We expect that Iran has to engage in some retaliatory measures to maintain its regime's legitimacy, but such measures will be limited to avoid pulling all parties into a protracted conflict,” Ruck added. Still, risks remain. The U.S. hinted at “far greater” military responses if Iran retaliates, and any disruption to oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz could shake broader markets. But the speed of recovery suggests crypto remains in a macro uptrend, and liquidations, can be viewed as entry points.",Markets|Markets|liquidation|SOL|XRP|DOGE|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-23 05:23:20

Bitcoin slipped below $99,000, with Ethereum and other major altcoins following suit. Pi Coin also plunged 11%, nearing its all-time low, before a slight 0.55% rebound today. June’s 263 million token unlock continues to weigh heavily on Pi’s price , fueling selling pressure and investor concerns. Why Is #PiNetwork Price Low Right Now? Will It Rise Again? Global crypto correction is hitting all major coins — not just Pi. #Bitcoin , #Ethereum & #Solana have dipped recently, dragging the market sentiment down. When these giants fall, the whole market feels it.… pic.twitter.com/8f48DaHzCV — Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis (@drnicolas_) June 22, 2025 However, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis , the founder of Pi Network, has responded to concerns about the falling Pi price, attributing it to the broader crypto market correction. He pointed out that major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have also seen notable declines, impacting the overall market mood. So, Pi’s dip isn’t an isolated event, but it could be a part of a global trend. Temporary Dip, Long-Term Vision According to him, despite the bloodbath, Pi Network stands out with a unique setup. The project is in its Enclosed Mainnet phase, meaning it isn’t yet publicly tradable. Despite that, Kokkalis emphasized strong fundamentals, including over 50 million users, a growing ecosystem of real-world applications , and steady development. He reassured the Pi community, known as Pioneers, that what’s happening isn’t a crash but a transitional phase. Kokkalis believes the token’s true value will emerge once the Open Mainnet launches and Pi is listed on major exchanges. He framed the current situation as an accumulation phase, often misunderstood as weakness. For now, he urges users to stay patient and focused, noting that utility-based growth is already underway. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Founder Slammed as ‘Scammer’ for Defending Price Crash; He Responds , Analyst says, Prices to Stay Low Pi is officially in the $0.4 range, and I expect it to remain there until the end of August.

He believes the upcoming Pi Day 2 event is unlikely to influence the price, signaling low expectations for short-term momentum despite community buzz. What next? Much of the hype surrounds June 28, which marks Pi Day 2 and the conclusion of the .pi domain auction. Over 123,000 active bids have sparked optimism about ecosystem growth. While the Core Team hasn’t confirmed any updates, the market is anticipating something. Historically, Pi has rallied around such events, as seen with its 175% jump in May. However, caution remains due to the July 1 unlock of 40 million PI tokens, which could weigh on prices. For now, Pi is showing signs of strength, briefly decoupling from Bitcoin’s broader decline, driven by technical support and event-driven momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

We remain bullish on Bitcoin and MSTR as a proxy, viewing both as hedges against fiat currency and global instability. The fund's strategy only outperforms within a limited price range for MSTR; outside this, plain MSTR ownership has historically delivered better returns. Given the limited incremental benefit and added risks, we rate MSTE as a hold until clearer value over direct MSTR ownership emerges. Introduction The Harvest MicroStrategy Enhanced High Income Shares ETF (MSTE:CA) is a Canadian fund that aims to invest its assets into Class A shares of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). This company formerly was a software and business intelligence focused firm, but nowadays is more well known for its Bitcoin dominated balance sheet, due to its large holdings in this cryptocurrency. This fund looks to both provide access to the upside of MSTR while also giving investors consistent income from distributions - paid out monthly. Total leverage of the fund goes up to 25% and its investable units are denominated in CAD. Below are some details of the fund from its prospectus . Distribution : $0.66 / month AUM : $179.3M Management Fee : 0.40% Being that the main holding of this ETF is MSTR, a company that we like due to it being a proxy for Bitcoin, we are inherently bullish on the underlying company. We will review some points above MSTR in the following section that dictate our thoughts about the company. MicroStrategy Company Review MSTR is known for buying and holding Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on its balance sheet. The company has announced a plan to continue buying this cryptocurrency, outlining a long-term plan to continually invest further in Bitcoin through its 42-42 plan by 2027. The firm reveals that the money to fund these purchases would occur through both equity and debt raises, as well as the current operating cash flows generated by the firm itself. This plan entails details such as goals of $42B in equity and $42B in fixed income capital raises by the end of 2027, which should continue to fund its investments in Bitcoin. Furthermore, the company is leveraging its continual offerings of preferred shares , which offer high rates, to attract investors to the company and therefore generate even more cash for them to exchange into Bitcoin. Essentially, MSTR is becoming more and more of a Bitcoin hedge fund in a sense, where investors can view their investments in MSTR as a bullish play on Bitcoin (and crypto markets in general). Currently, MSTR holds a total of 592,100 Bitcoins , with an average BTC cost of ~$70,666. In nominal values, they have spent roughly $42B on their Bitcoin purchases over the years. The following chart shows the buying cadence (every week) and amount bought for YTD 2025. MSTR Bitcoin Purchases ( MicroStrategy ) We view MSTR as a great hedge against fiat currencies and also as a stable hedge against chaos happening across the world today. For example, the firm recently bought more BTC during the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, betting that the conflict and funding for it might boost the price of BTC. Ultimately, an investment in MSTR means that you have faith and believe in the market changing dynamics of Bitcoin. It may be that you view it as a hedge, truly do not believe in the current traditional finance systems, or a bit of both. Either way, Bitcoin’s influence on global financial markets cannot be understated and should be respected as an asset with both utility (in terms of transactions) and a hedge (against fiat currencies and as a store of value). It should be mentioned, however, that MSTR as a holding company of BTC frequently trades at a premium in terms of performance compared to buying BTC outright. Look at the below chart, for example, comparing YTD returns on BTC and MSTR. MSTR vs BTC YTD Performance (Yahoo Finance) The top blue represents MSTR, and BTC is the red line. With nearly a ~19% delta in YTD performance, one has to consider whether MSTR is an overvalued way to gain exposure to the underlying BTC asset. Either way, it would appear that the market places a premium on the leader, Michael Saylor, and his vision of what MSTR can do with their vast BTC holdings. In summary, we are bullish on the future of BTC, and therefore, MSTR. With this ETF holding MSTR and providing stable, recurring income from it, we also are therefore bullish on the future of this fund. However, there are risks and considerations stemming from the leverage and covered call elements of the fund that we will cover in the next section. Covered Calls and Leverage MSTE utilizes both leveraged and covered calls in order to increase overall returns for investors. Their goal is to have the fund be up to 25% leveraged and write covered calls on up to 50% of the fund . Currently, the fund is 22.8% leveraged . For the purpose of this analysis, we assume the fund is split up like so: 25% is 2x leveraged. For now, we assume that there is no interest cost related to the leveraging 50% is not leveraged but has covered calls written against it 25% just owns MSTE directly Let’s explore a scenario: The fund owns 200 shares of MSTR that were bought at $100 per share. 50 additional shares were bought on leverage. The fund has sold covered calls on 100 shares at a strike price of $125 for total proceeds of $500 Scenario Description Gain/Loss on MSTR Gain/Loss on Option Total Gain/Loss Without Leverage/Options No movement MSTR does not move at all. $0 $500 $500 $0 Mildly Up MSTR ends up at a price of $110 $2,500 $500 $3,000 $2,000 Mildly Down MSTR ends up at a price of $90 -$2,500 $500 -$2,000 -$2,000 Very Up MSTR ends up at a price of $160 $11,500 ($2,500 on covered call shares, $9,000 on the rest) $500 $12,000 $12,000 Very Down MSTR ends up at a price of $50 -$12,500 $500 -$12,000 -$10,000 It’s hard to see exactly how the leverage and options impact returns, as they sometimes impact the returns in the same direction (positive or negative) and sometimes have an opposite (but not always equal) impact. A few rules of thumb: If the stock price remains at or below the strike price, then the covered call strategy will result in higher returns (compared to if you did not sell the calls). If the stock price goes above the strike price, then investors will see positive returns, but the returns would be higher if you had not sold the calls. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. So if the stock price increases, you make more profit but if the stock price decreases you make less profit (both relative to a non-leveraged scenario). Let’s talk about the “Very Up” strategy. In the above scenario, the returns from having the covered calls and leverage are the same as if you had not done either. This is because the covered calls are decreasing potential returns by $3,000 while the leverage is increasing potential returns by $3,000. To be clear, these impacts will not always be equal. If instead the scenario was that the stock increased to $170, the total returns would be $13,000 while returns without leverage/options would be $14,000. MSTE gains with and without leverage/options (Doodad Capital) Above is a chart that visualizes the overall scenario. There are 3 main sections: $0 - $90: Investors are better off without the calls + leverage $90 - $160: Investors are better off using the calls + leverage $160+: Investors are better off without the calls + leverage So why are $90 and $160 the two points where the outcome flips? These are both points where the red and blue lines are exactly the same. This is because the negative impacts of leveraging are exactly canceled out by positive impacts of the calls (for the $90 case) or the positive impacts of leveraging are exactly canceled out by negative impacts of the calls (for the $160 case). These intersection points will change depending on various factors such as the call strike price, premium and interest costs of the leverage. For example, if instead the premium from selling the call was $1000, the intersection points would instead be at $80 and $170 instead. The key takeaway here is that investors in this kind of strategy would ideally see the stock price stay between the 2 intersection points. Otherwise, they would have larger returns without the additional call options and leverage. Finally, let’s talk about leverage interest. Since leveraging is a kind of debt, there will be an additional interest cost related to it. In this scenario, we borrowed enough cash to buy 50 shares of MSTR at $100 per share, resulting in a total debt of $5,000. The easy way to think about impacts of interest is that it changes the width of the range between the 2 intersection points. More interest would mean a narrower range, while less interest would result in a wider range. For example, with additional interest of $500, the range narrows from $90 - $160 to $100 - $150. Risks A key risk is BTC volatility. Being a cryptocurrency, it can sometimes be very volatile, as we all know. Therefore, the price of MSTR could also be impacted by swings in the price of BTC, as they are now so tied together. With a beta of 3.76 , this is a name that moves significantly compared to the market. This would be a risk that investors should keep in mind regarding the stability of their portfolio, and could therefore be a trade for more risk-tolerant investors. Another risk to consider is the additional cost of owning this ETF. Investors pay additional management fees as well as indirectly the leverage interest fees. All of this is fine if the returns outweigh the costs, but investors need to weigh the additional cost/complexity against the additional potential return they could gain. As we discussed, investors in this kind of strategy only make a profit if the share price ends up within a certain range, which limits the overall benefit of the fund. As you can see below, since inception, MSTE has actually lagged behind MSTR in returns by ~2% (the below chart is dividend adjusted, so proceeds from the covered call strategy are included). Investors could have saved on fees and the additional complexity by just buying MSTR instead. MSTR vs MSTE Returns (Stock Rover) Finally, we should also mention that while this fund is not very highly levered, it does have some leverage which could pose an additional risk. With leveraged investments, your losses could quickly compound, leading to potentially very large losses. Conclusion We are bullish on the future of BTC as we view it as a hedge against the traditional financial markets and as a safe haven in the event of conflicts around the world. Despite the risks and volatility associated with BTC, long-term, we believe that the currency will rise. For MSTE, it is interesting to see dual-features of it, offering both upside potential via leverage and recurring income via covered calls. However, we are not convinced if this additional complexity is providing enough value back to investors given the maintenance fee. The additional returns from the strategy are limited to only a specific window of price movement for MSTR and, as we showed, so far, investors would have been better off just owning MSTR. Until we see more evidence of incremental benefit from MSTE, we rate it as a hold.",MSTR|BTC-USD|MSTE:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-23 05:25:27

The tactic mirrors a nearly identical exploit on CoinMarketCap two days earlier , where attackers embedded similar code to serve wallet phishing prompts. In both cases, the attack relied on hijacking trusted platforms to bypass user skepticism — turning news and data sites into unwitting vectors for wallet drainers.

HAI price chart (Source: CoinGecko ) The breach stemmed from the compromise of a private key associated with an account that held ”minter” privileges—allowing it to create new tokens at will. Hacken confirmed the exploit in a statement on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday, noting that the attacker managed to mint hundreds of millions of tokens and dumped them on decentralized exchanges on the BSC network. ”A private key of an account with a minter role (ETH & BNB) was compromised, leading to unauthorized HAI minting and a dump on BSC DEXs ,” Hacken wrote. While the attacker is believed to have made off with around $250,000 in illicit gains, the real damage came from the hyperinflationary impact of doubling the token’s total supply in a matter of minutes. A Price Collapse and Attempted Recovery The price of $HAI plummeted by as much as 97% in the immediate aftermath of the exploit, triggering panic among holders. The token saw a modest rebound on Sunday but remains well below its pre-exploit levels. The incident sent shockwaves through the cybersecurity and Web3 communities, not only because of the scale of the attack but because of the symbolic irony—Hacken is, after all, a firm that advises projects on how to avoid precisely this type of vulnerability. In an unusually candid admission, Hacken’s co-founder and CEO Dyma Budorin took full responsibility for the incident, blaming the breach on a long-standing failure to upgrade the firm’s infrastructure with multi-signature protection for sensitive accounts. ”Responsibility is on me,” Budorin wrote on X. ”I didn't implement multisig bridge [infrastructure] 5 years ago. I understood the risk, but delayed bridge restructuring due to not unimportant reasons.” The company has since regained control by using its deployer wallet—which was not compromised—to revoke minting permissions from the affected accounts. To address the damage, Hacken is now planning a potential token swap that could help affected users recover losses. On social media, the team hinted at a larger restructuring effort involving what it called a “big merge between $HAI and Hacken equity shareholders,” which it claims is valued at over $100 million. While the full details of the compensation plan have not yet been released, the company said a comprehensive post-mortem will follow once the internal investigation is complete. A Case Study in Web3 Security Failures The breach comes just weeks after Hacken’s own Q1 Web3 security report warned that human error and misconfigured access controls represent the most significant threat vectors in the decentralized ecosystem. The report cited $1.6 billion in damages caused by such vulnerabilities in Q1 alone, noting that while smart contract bugs still pose a risk, “most damage is now caused by failures in people, processes, or permission systems.” This incident painfully illustrates that point. Even firms dedicated to blockchain security can fall prey to the very weaknesses they warn others about. Florida Investor Alleges $860K Scam Involving Fake Crypto Exchange and Denver-Based Trading “School” Meanwhile, a Florida man says he was duped out of $860,000 by a crypto trading scam involving a Denver-based education firm and a fraudulent crypto exchange that promised—and simulated—life-changing profits, only to ultimately vanish his funds behind a so-called system error. In a lawsuit filed last week in a federal court, investor Brian Firestone alleged that the Alpha Stock Investment Training Center (ASITC) and a fraudulent crypto exchange called CoinBridge Partners orchestrated an elaborate scheme that led to devastating financial loss. The trading “school,” which operated out of downtown Denver, reportedly coordinated the scam using a now-defunct website and a fake exchange address in Cherry Creek, Colorado. Firestone lawsuit against Alpha Stock Investment Training Center (Source: Justia) The Pitch: Education, Signals, and a $500 Hook According to the suit, Firestone was first contacted in December 2024 by a man identifying himself as John Smith, a representative of ASITC. Smith offered to teach cryptocurrency trading and provided Firestone with a $500 “starter gift” to begin learning signal-based crypto strategies. Signal trading involves following precise, real-time instructions from experts, or “professors,” to make specific trades. Firestone said ASITC professors would send him messages with exact times and amounts to buy or sell crypto, and he would carry out these instructions using his account on CoinBridge. Initially, the results were astonishing. Firestone claims that his $500 quickly grew to $55,000, prompting him to invest $50,000 more in January. Within weeks, his CoinBridge account allegedly ballooned to $2 million. But the rapid gains soon turned into devastating losses. According to the lawsuit, a failed trade reduced Firestone’s balance to just $12,000, leading him to wire $470,000 more in cash and take out a $330,000 loan from ASITC to continue trading. Following this, his account reportedly surged to $24.5 million. However, things took a suspicious turn on March 9 when a trade in Tether (USDT) failed to execute. Firestone frantically messaged Smith saying: “I can’t close it... I ncant clpsoe it.” The response was that a “system error” had caused the glitch, and his entire balance vanished overnight. In a final desperate bid to recover, Firestone says he borrowed another $1 million from ASITC, raising his account balance to $6.6 million. But when he was unable to repay part of his loan, ASITC allegedly shut down his CoinBridge account on May 1, cutting off access to all funds. Allegations of Fraud and a Fake Exchange Firestone’s lawsuit accuses ASITC, CoinBridge, John Smith, and ASITC founder Raymond Torres of fraud, theft, and racketeering, alleging the entire operation was a coordinated scam. The suit describes CoinBridge as a completely fictitious crypto exchange with fabricated investor figures and no legitimate regulatory standing. Although a real entity named CoinBridge Partners exists in Wyoming, it has denied any connection to the accused parties or the operation in Denver. Firestone’s ordeal highlights a broader trend in crypto-related fraud. According to blockchain security firm CertiK, over $2.1 billion has already been stolen in 2025 through various crypto scams, with a significant portion stemming from social engineering, wallet mismanagement, and fake platforms rather than traditional smart contract vulnerabilities. CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu emphasized that the rise in human-centered attacks marks a shift in the threat landscape: “While code-based exploits still exist, most attackers are now focusing on user behavior—exploiting trust, confusion, and urgency.” In 2024, phishing attacks alone led to more than $1 billion in damages across nearly 300 incidents, making it the most damaging attack vector in crypto security. Many of these scams used fabricated trading dashboards, AI-generated support agents, and deepfake communications to fool users into making irreversible transfers. Questions Remain as Authorities Investigate The ASITC website and CoinBridge platform have since gone offline, and both appear to have scrubbed their digital footprints. The physical address listed on ASITC’s website—1660 Lincoln St., Denver—now leads to a co-working space with no visible connection to crypto training. The lawsuit is expected to move forward as federal authorities begin investigating the financial and digital paper trails behind the scheme.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-23 05:30:00

This is a significant milestone in its efforts to rebuild its reputation and gain a foothold in one of the world’s most heavily regulated financial markets . The move comes months after OKX reached a $505 million settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Department of the Treasury. OKX agreed to pay $84 million in penalties and return $421 million in profits to US-based users. The case was widely seen as a major regulatory crackdown and, for many, marked a turning point in how offshore crypto firms approach compliance with US laws. OKX expands US presence Instead of retreating from the US market, OKX is doubling down. The firm has released a consolidated crypto trading platform specially designed for US customers. It also launched its non-custodial OKX Wallet, which enables US users to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 services. The wallet supports various blockchains and allows users to own their keys, whether you’re a newcomer in crypto or an advanced trader. OKX has further demonstrated its dedication by launching a US regional office in San Jose, CA. It has brought in Roshan Robert as the CEO of OKX USA to lead the next step in its US strategy. Robert was previously a senior executive at Morgan Stanley and Barclays, and he brought deep Wall Street experience to a company that had long been centered on offshore productions. In a recent interview , Robert said the team is looking to build a “super app” in the US. “Our long-term vision, of course, is to become a category-defining super app. And we plan to slowly work towards that goal,” he said. OKX’s IPO ambition isn’t solely a business milestone — it’s a statement. Regulatory certainty has been an issue that has continued to trouble crypto exchanges in the US since their inception, and many international exchanges have even refused to operate in the country. OKX has volunteered to be investigated by the SEC and other “reputable” agencies by listing in the USA. Analysts say the IPO would most likely be issued by OKX’s United States subsidiary, which has moved to California. This could happen very soon if the company can clear regulatory hurdles and market conditions remain favorable. Exchange fights to regain investor confidence OKX’s past encounters with regulators were a little bit scandalous. But it now seems to be learning from its past mistakes. The exchange has now stated it is focusing on Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures and effective anti-money laundering (AML), owing to which data and funds of US customers will be stored separately from its worldwide business. The change reflects a broader shift in the crypto industry, as companies that used to work in the legal gray areas now hurry to fall in line to plug into traditional financial infrastructure. If successful, OKX would add its name to a short but growing list of crypto companies to go public in the US, alongside Coinbase and Robinhood. The platform boasts a global user base of over 50 million people, a solid trading engine, and a growing set of DeFi products that just might set OKX up for the next wave of mainstream crypto adoption.

After years of legal battle, XRP could now come out stronger than ever. This could be the moment it breaks free from legal uncertainty and steps into a new era of clarity, adoption, and market confidence. XRP Breakout in August? On June 16, Ripple and the SEC jointly agreed to pause their appeals, which indicated that a final resolution is likely just around the corner. As part of the motion, Ripple would see the injunction against it dissolved and its civil penalty reduced to just $50 million, with the rest of the proposed fine returned. This was a clear sign that Ripple won, and the institutions are also starting to take note. What Happens Next? With the next update due by August 15, XRP’s major rally may be on hold until then. Judge Torres is expected to give a final ruling, likely confirming that XRP is not a security. If that happens, institutions waiting on the sidelines will finally be free to enter. XRP To Takeoff as ETF Odds Hit 95% At the same time, spot XRP ETF is now in its public comment phase. With strong legal momentum and rising demand, the odds of Polymarket approval are now at 91%. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas now rate the odds of an XRP spot ETF being approved at 95%. With everything falling into place, XRP looks ready for a big bull run.

In this roadmap, nine research areas and 34 workstreams are covered. The goal of the upgrades is to make Cardano (ADA) the best blockchain for scalable dApps and post-quantum resilience. These upgrades aim to deliver breakthroughs in protocol design, security, scalability, and interoperability. One of the most massive upgrades planned for Cardano is the Ouroboros Mega upgrade. The upgrade comprises seven specialized work streams that will advance speed, resilience, and fairness on Cardano. Research on Ouroboros dates to 2015, and there are over 3,000 academic citations. While these upgrades could eventually have a long-term price impact on Cardano (ADA), the slow pace of development has both positives and negatives. The positive side is that each step of development is scientifically evaluated and peer reviewed. However, it has a major downside in that growth is limited due to the slow pace of development. Consequently, investors have been looking for growth elsewhere, including in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising utility-based project in the DeFi sector. Quantum resilience on Cardano One of the main areas of focus for Cardano is to make the network resilient to the Quantum computing future. There are some features that the capabilities of these computers could pose a risk to the future of blockchain technology. As such, Cardano (ADA) aims to ensure it is ready to deal with any eventuality. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting investors in droves. What Mutuum Finance offers Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to borrow or lend assets. As lenders, users deposit their assets to earn interest. The interest rates in the pools are dynamically set by the pool utilization rate, which is set by market forces. As demand for assets in a pool rises, the utilization rate rises, which increases the interest rate. The rising interest rate pushes borrowers to repay loans, while lenders deposit more assets to benefit from the rising yields. This process leads to optimal capital efficiency while also increasing the total liquidity in the pools over time. To defend liquidity in the pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) requires that all loans by borrowers be overcollateralized. That simply means that they have to deposit more than the value of the assets they borrow in the pools. Various other protections are in place in the protocol. One of these is a strict token vetting process. Before an asset can be allowed to participate in the protocol, it has to be checked for volatility and liquidity. Additionally, its price data oracle is checked to ensure it is not subject to price manipulation. Another check that the team performs is to check the centralization of the project. A project that is in the hands of a central entity could easily be shut down with ease, placing the protocol’s solvency at risk. When adding assets that have a high level of centralization, the team will weigh the benefits to the community against the actual danger it poses to the protocol’s stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also CertiK audited, which is in line with its security posture. The goal of the audit was to ensure that the code was secure and safe for users to deposit their assets. On CertiK, it has received a Token Scan Score of 80. This CertiK audit has helped to boost trust in the presale, which continues to break new milestones. Details of the MUTM token presale So far, over $10.95 million has been raised in the ongoing MUTM token presale from around 12,350 buyers. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. The token price is set to go up by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6, and the process is expected to continue until the final listing price of $0.06. For phase 5 buyers, one of the main benefits is that they will get their tokens at a 50% discount to the final listing price. That is a massive bargain that all buyers are working to secure. It is worth noting that so far, 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, barely two weeks after they went live. As such, there are only 55% of the tokens available for phase 5 left for buyers to benefit from this bargain. Summary According to the latest estimates, MUTM tokens are expected to rise 31x. That means a $1,300 purchase in the presale could grow to $40,300. This is a massive opportunity that seasoned investors are looking forward to capitalizing on. You too can be part of this life-changing opportunity, and make massive returns, with long-term stable growth to boot.

46596819,https://invezz.com/?p=2773215,1750657814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,MUTM quietly builds 25x momentum while XRP and ADA see sharp drops,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/23/mutm-quietly-builds-25x-momentum-while-xrp-and-ada-see-sharp-drops/,"The past few days have been rough for XRP and ADA. At the same time, most of the market has held up quite well. XRP is down over 8% in the past month. It has seen a markedly steep decline. However, it remains about the $2 market, where it has hovered for the past few weeks. The faltering performance of XRP comes amid a recent update from the SEC, after it was announced that the case against Ripple Labs had been put on pause. Meanwhile, most of the market had been hoping for an outright dismissal, as has happened with other companies in the crypto world. That would suggest there are behind-the-scenes negotiations, which have triggered some panic instead of confidence. Cardano (ADA) has also struggled recently, dipping over 7% in the past week. The token has fallen clean through various support levels. While there have been signs of a recovery, that momentum quickly petered out. The trend is in line with global risk-off behavior across the market, especially after Trump hinted the US might be headed into open conflict with Iran. Amid this downward trend for XRP and ADA, investors are seeking out opportunities for growth elsewhere. One of the main beneficiaries of this trend is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has seen a massive surge in presale participation. The Muuum Finance (MUTM) project is utility-based, which has proven to be a major puller in this season. As the market moves away from more unstable assets like meme coins, utility-based projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are the main beneficiary. According to analysts, this trend could lead to 25x or more gains for MUTM tokens when they go live. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has to offer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to deposit their assets to earn passive income in the form of interest payments. The interest rate in the protocol’s pools is based on a pool utilization rate. To determine the utilization rate in a pool, the protocol measures the value of assets that are being actively borrowed versus the total value of the pool. On the protocol, users can also participate as borrowers by depositing overcollateralized collateral to secure loans. As borrowers, they have the benefit of gaining access to high-value assets without having to spend their current holdings. That way, they can benefit from market opportunities in real time with these high-value assets. When they are ready, they can repay their loans and regain access to their assets. To protect the long-term stability of the ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) features various protocol parameters designed to deal with price volatility. For instance, there is the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which determines the maximum amount a given asset can borrow. Overall, assets with high volatility tend to have more conservative terms due to their potential to cause insolvency. The protocol also implements the liquidity threshold, which determines the level at which a loan is considered undercollateralized. When it approaches this level, a borrower has the option to top up their collateral to push the limit back up. If they do not, liquidators step in and purchase part of the debt, or all of it at a discount. Another protective measure used in the protocol is the reserve factor. This is where a portion of the interest payments by borrowers goes into a common pool. These funds are used to ensure the long-term stability of the ecosystem. For more unstable assets like meme coins, the reserve factor can be set as high as 35%. Meanwhile, more stable assets like meme coins can get a reserve factor of 10%. The MUTM token presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale. Tokens in this phase are going for $0.03 per token, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, over $10.95 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,350 buyers. At the current price of $0.03, buyers are getting their tokens at a 50% discount off the listing price of $0.06. 45% of the presale tokens set aside for phase 5 have already been sold, barely two weeks after it launched. That means the opportunity to make a 100% guaranteed ROI is quickly diminishing. To further sweeten the deal, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a $100,000 giveaway for presale buyers.

46596820,https://invezz.com/?p=2773216,1750657977,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Ethereum steady at $2,500, but could MUTM pull off a 28x before ETH hits $4K?",https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/23/ethereum-steady-at-2500-but-could-mutm-pull-off-a-28x-before-eth-hits-4k/,"The latest on-chain data shows that Ethereum (ETH) is holding strong at around $2,500. This stability is driven by various factors, including a recent uptick in network activity. Data shows that around 1 million new ETH addresses have been created a week since the middle of May 2025. That represents a massive increase from the approximately 670,000 new weekly addresses created in the same period last year. This metric indicates a strong underlying network potential for ETH, which has consolidated around $2,500. According to forecasts, the number of new weekly addresses could keep rising by over 30% annually. That signals growing network adoption and wide ecosystem utility. The number of new addresses is widely used in the crypto sector as a signal of long-term adoption and user growth. As a result, analysts are interpreting the data as a sign of bullish momentum for Ethereum. This suggests demand-side strength is quietly lurking below the surface, and could explode at any time. Amid this trend, investors are positioning themselves to benefit from this massive altcoin rally. One way they are doing this is by purchasing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising project that is currently in the presale phase. According to projections, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could rise by 2,850% when it goes live. ETH headed To $4K While the market has been rocked by uncertainty, data shows that ETH is doing better than Bitcoin (BTC). This is a rare occurrence as Ethereum (ETH) tends to be closely correlated to Bitcoin (BTC). Before the current Middle East conflict, Ethereum was outperforming Bitcoin, and has since remained steady, despite the massive market shocks. The resilience, coupled with the positive address data, shows that Ethereum could rise higher. As more capital shifts into Ethereum (ETH), analysts forecast that it could trigger a new altcoin rally. Big investors are already positioning themselves to be the main beneficiaries of this expected rally. For instance, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently seen an uptick in participation, with over $10.95 million raised in the ongoing presale. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect buy One reason why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become a favorite of investors amid the pending altcoin rally is its focus on utility. In the past, the forecast has been on meme coins as investors have tried to cash in on the quick gains they offer. However, investors have come to accept that the only way to reliably grow value in the crypto sector is through utility. A good example of this is Ethereum. Since it went live, the price of ETH has risen 89,000%. Best of all, it continues to rise and consolidate those gains because of utility. Additionally, it has high liquidity, which makes it easy for traders to duck in and out of positions to make a profit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to follow in those footsteps. The project is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders on the protocol, they can deposit assets in a pool to earn interest. The interest rate in pools is based on the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises and the interest rate rises, it pushes borrowers to repay their loans. At the same time, it pushes lenders to deposit more liquidity in the pools to benefit from the rising rates. That leads to a situation where optimal capital efficiency is achieved. Price discovery on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) For Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to achieve market efficiency, pricing needs to be reliable and always accurate. To achieve this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement Chainlink price data oracles, which are a trusted source of data in the DeFi world. Additionally, they plan to implement backup price oracles to ensure there is always a reliable source of data that is accurate when the primary data source is not working. As a redundancy measure, they will implement both oracles to run concurrently. Additionally, they plan to implement the use of time-weighted price averaging as a reference point when there is enough on-chain volume. This data will be sourced from popular DEXs. The goal is to ensure that price discovery on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fair while ensuring the highest uptime possible. MUTM token presale details The MUTM token presale is currently in phase 5, where over $10.95 million has been raised from over 12,350 unique buyers. The presale has been a massive success, even after the 200% increase in the token to $0.03 from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have been sold, barely two weeks after they launched. With less than 60% of the tokens remaining in phase 5, this is your last chance to get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at a massive 50% off the token listing price of $0.06. Act fast and position yourself to benefit from the upcoming altcoin rally.

Amid a flood of institutional capital into the crypto sector, the crypto market is experiencing massive capital movements. According to on-chain metrics, one of the beneficiaries of this capital movement is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is quietly making its way into the spotlight. These inflows have triggered speculation that this could be the next big winner of 2025. So far, analysts forecast massive gains for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with estimates of a 3,450% gain making their way through crypto circles. There is good reason to trust this forecast, and in this article, we explore why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised for massive gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): built with a purpose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is deep in the 5th phase of its presale and has raised over $10.95 million from around 12,350 investors so far. MUTM tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. Analysts forecast strong performance after the presale, with the price expected to rise by 3,450%. Based on that projection, a $1,400 investment in the presale could grow to $48,300. One notable fact about the current phase 5 of the presale is that tokens are selling at a 50% discount to the listing price of $0.06. That means those who purchase their tokens in the current phase stand to make double what those who wait until the listing price will make. The protocol design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not powered by hype but by real utility. It is designed around a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders or borrowers. As lenders, they can deposit assets in a pool to earn interest. The interest rate they receive in a pool is based on the pool’s utilization rate. A pool’s utilization rate is determined by measuring the value of assets being actively borrowed in a pool against the total amount of assets in that pool. As the utilization rate rises, so does the interest rate. This rising interest rate pushes the borrowers to pay back their loans, while at the same time, it causes the lenders to deposit more assets to benefit from the rising rates. Over time, the liquidity in the pools increases, which leads to overall protocol health. It also ensures that the demand and supply-based actions of the lenders and borrowers lead to optimal market efficiency. To protect lenders’ liquidity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will require that all loans be overcollateralized. That simply means that borrowers will have to deposit assets of a higher value than the loan they take. The actual level of collateralization is determined by the intrinsic characteristics of an asset. For instance, an asset that shows high levels of on-chain trading volume, coupled with low volatility, will get better terms than assets that have high volatility and low liquidity. Due to the changing nature of the crypto market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will actively adjust the parameters. For instance, if an asset grows from obscurity, and the on-chain volume rises, and volatility falls, its parameters can be adjusted to encourage its use as collateral. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also operate a liquidity rewards program. In this program, rewards in MUTM tokens will be given out to encourage lenders to deposit more assets. This will have the effect of lowering the utilization rate and thus the interest rate in a pool. As a result, it will make the protocol more attractive to users, which is important to the long-term success of the project. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to use protocol revenue to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market. These purchases will apply positive price pressure on the tokens, which will boost their profile online. As such, it could develop a media buzz, leading to a surge of users into the protocol. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already listed on CoinMarketCap, the improved price performance could push it up the charts, increasing its visibility. CoinMarketCap has over 350 million monthly visitors, and this could serve as an important source of growth for the project. Summary Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a CertiK audited project that has been garnering massive attention from the crypto market in recent weeks. Already, some on-chain whale activity shows that the crypto market is taking notice. In the coming weeks, capital will continue to flow into the presale, with the momentum expected to carry on after the tokens’ public listing. With listings expected on major public exchanges, MUTM tokens could go parabolic. At the current price of $0.03, MUTM tokens represent your best opportunity for massive returns in 2025.

Meanwhile, Blockstream CEO Adam Back defended the premium on Strategy stock by pointing to the firm's rapid BTC accumulation. BTC Prague also shed some light on Europe’s potential in Bitcoin adoption, as Jan3’s Samson Mow met with French lawmaker Sarah Knafo to discuss a national Bitcoin reserve. France’s recent crypto investments could mean that there is growing interest, though EU-wide adoption still faces regulatory hurdles. Saylor Sees Bitcoin at $21 Million Bitcoin bull and Strategy founder Michael Saylor delivered a strikingly optimistic forecast for Bitcoin during his keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event. He predicted that the leading cryptocurrency could reach a price of $21 million within 21 years. Saylor’s bold projection is a big increase from his previous forecast at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he envisioned Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045. This dramatic revision reflects what Saylor described as an extraordinary shift in the geopolitical and regulatory landscape surrounding Bitcoin over the past year. Saylor credited his bullishness to unprecedented developments that he claimed were unimaginable just 11 months ago. Chief among these was the White House’s apparent embrace of Bitcoin, which he said was a landmark moment in US political history. He pointed to Donald Trump’s election victory in November of 2024 as a pivotal moment that ushered in a new era of pro-Bitcoin politics. According to Saylor, the notion that the United States could establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve or proclaim itself a global Bitcoin superpower was once inconceivable but is now becoming reality. Michael Saylor speaking at the BTC Prague event In addition to political changes, Saylor pointed out major legislative advancements, including progress on three crypto-focused bills in the United States — the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Bitcoin Act. He also mentioned that individual US states are increasingly embracing Bitcoin, which helps solidify the asset’s place in the mainstream financial system. While Saylor is an advocate for Bitcoin, his views on custody have attracted some criticism. Although Strategy holds a massive Bitcoin treasury — now totaling 592,100 BTC — the company refused to disclose the exact storage details of these holdings. Saylor pointed to security concerns as the reason for withholding proof-of-reserves information. His previous opposition to self-custody also sparked backlash. However, he reversed this stance in October 2024 by stating his support for self-custody by those “willing and able.” The BTC Prague event itself saw strong support for self-custody and open-source Bitcoin tools. Danny Sanders, chief commercial officer at Trezor, reported that more than 5,000 attendees participated in the event. Adam Back Defends Strategy’s Stock Premium Blockstream CEO Adam Back defended the premium on Strategy stock by saying it is justified given how quickly the company doubles its Bitcoin per share. Back also spoke at BTC Prague in an interview with Bitcoin podcaster Stephan Livera, where he explained that Strategy’s track record of growing its Bitcoin per share every 16 to 18 months reduces risk for investors, making the 2x multiple seen in MSTR stock trading “not unreasonable.” He explained that this growth rate means that investors can reach parity with the market net asset value (mNAV) in about a year and a half, effectively de-risking their position. Back pointed out that Strategy’s stock premium—which is currently around 1.7x on a basic share basis and 1.9x on a diluted basis—is backed by a solid asset base. The company has aggressively used leverage through at-the-market equity offerings and convertible senior notes to build up its Bitcoin reserves, now valued at approximately $60.89 billion. Despite MSTR’s recent price decline of 7.45% over the past 30 days, Back held firm that evaluating the time required to “overcome the premium” is a useful lens for investors in Bitcoin treasury stocks. Strategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: Saylor Tracker ) He warned that while elevated mNAVs can be speculative, they also often come with high potential yields. Still, such positions can lead to volatility and investor unease. As an example, he pointed to Japanese firm Metaplanet, which has seen its mNAV fluctuate between 5 and 10. Back acknowledged that holding the stock during such swings could be nerve-wracking, but said the firm has consistently rebounded. Metaplanet recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC after a new purchase on June 16, which allowed it to surpass Coinbase to become the seventh-largest publicly listed Bitcoin holder. France Could Lead Europe’s Bitcoin Future Meanwhile, Jan3 founder Samson Mow is turning his attention to promoting Bitcoin adoption at the nation-state level in Europe, after a promising meeting with pro-Bitcoin French lawmaker and European Parliament member Sarah Knafo at BTC Prague. Mow shared on social media that the two discussed creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for France and pushing for more favorable regulations toward Bitcoin. He is optimistic about launching a wave of nation-state Bitcoin adoption starting in France and potentially spreading across Europe. Knafo said that France must take a leading role in the conversation around Bitcoin. She described her meeting with Mow as an “excellent discussion,” and called him a seasoned expert in national Bitcoin strategies, including his advisory role with El Salvador’s government. Mow resigned from Blockstream in 2022 to focus entirely on Bitcoin nation-state adoption through his company Jan3. He confirmed that his team has been invited to France for further discussions. Knafo also met with Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, and called him “visionary and ambitious.” He even suggested that more Bitcoin-related projects are on the horizon for France and the broader European region. France has recently shown increasing engagement with Bitcoin through both government and private initiatives. Earlier this month, Paris-based Blockchain Group purchased 624 Bitcoin for €60.2 million, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. Additionally, France’s state-owned bank Bpifrance announced in March that it would invest €25 million into purchasing cryptocurrencies to support local blockchain projects. Despite these developments, there are still concerns about the pace of crypto adoption across Europe. Some industry leaders argue that the region continues to lag behind other parts of the world due to regulatory hesitation and limited institutional participation. Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at European RWA tokenization platform Brickken, pointed to a lack of corporate engagement and structural barriers that prevented Bitcoin from being embraced as a reserve asset. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, while now fully in effect as of December 2024, has yet to fully resolve these issues or lead to widespread adoption across the continent.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-23 05:58:20

The pop-up message appeared to be part of a legitimate Cointelegraph promotion and told visitors they had been randomly selected to receive 50,000 “CTG” tokens, valued at over $5,000. The offer seemed polished and convincing, featuring the company’s branding and interface elements that mimicked real airdrop campaigns. It included a countdown timer and prompts to connect crypto wallets, standard elements in genuine token distribution efforts. However, the entire experience was fabricated by attackers. A similar front-end attack appeared on CoinMarketCap over the weekend. Security Firm Flags CoinTelegraph Frontend Hack Originating From Ad System Scam Sniffer, a blockchain security firm, flagged the breach and posted a public alert, warning that Cointelegraph’s frontend had been compromised. “Please be cautious,” the firm tweeted, alongside screenshots of the injected code and the fake airdrop interface. The scam was likely designed to trick users into granting wallet permissions, ultimately allowing hackers to drain all funds. Cointelegraph later confirmed the breach and issued a warning . The company urged users not to interact with the fraudulent pop-up and emphasized that it has never issued a “CTG” token or launched an initial coin offering. It also assured readers that a fix was underway. ALERT: We are aware of a fraudulent pop-up falsely claiming to offer “CoinTelegraph ICO Airdrops” or “CTG tokens” that are appearing on our site. DO NOT: – Click on these pop-ups – Connect your wallets – Enter any personal information We are actively working on a fix. — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 23, 2025 According to Scam Sniffer, the malicious JavaScript code came from the site’s advertising system rather than its core infrastructure. Hackers Shift From Emails to Embedded Ads as Scam Tactics Evolve The file, served via Cointelegraph’s ad partner, contained wallet-draining scripts disguised as standard ad delivery code. This technique has become more common in recent months as attackers seek to exploit vulnerabilities in trusted platforms’ third-party systems. CoinTelegraph's frontend has been compromised. Please be cautious. pic.twitter.com/sH025Zek8p — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) June 23, 2025 The scam interface showed a fake reward worth $5,490 and labeled the transaction process as “secure,” “instant,” and “verified.” Once users clicked to connect their wallet, the script triggered a function that could initiate approvals and transfers without the user’s informed consent. These types of attacks are particularly dangerous because they appear on well-known, trusted websites. Many users assume such platforms have adequate security measures and may let their guard down. This makes ad-based exploits far more effective than phishing links sent through email or social media. Fake CTG Token Never Existed on Major Exchanges or Blockchains The CTG token mentioned in the scam does not exist on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, or any legitimate exchange. Neither is there a record of it on Ethereum or other major blockchains. These red flags may be obvious to veteran users, but newer entrants to the space are often unaware of what to look for in a legitimate token offering. Similar breaches have been reported across the crypto space. CoinMarketCap too experienced a comparable incident this month, where attackers embedded a wallet-draining link into a front-facing promo box on the site. In that case too, the compromise stemmed from third-party code, not the core platform. As more crypto companies depend on external ad services, their surfaces for attack increase dramatically. Even if a platform is secure at the application level, malicious scripts delivered through external partners can easily bypass protections. The growing trend has prompted calls for stricter auditing of third-party integrations and more robust sandboxing of external content.

According to Wedson, Binance’s spot trading volume has once again reached a dominant position in the market, which historically means a bullish signal for Bitcoin. Joao Wedson said the following in a statement on his social media account: “Binance’s Spot volume is now equal to all other exchanges combined. Also, Binance’s Spot volume is 10 times larger than Coinbase. The gap between Binance and other exchanges in spot volume is about to turn positive, which has triggered bull periods for Bitcoin in the past. Therefore, it is important to follow this trend closely.” Wedson also called on investors to make data-based evaluations, saying, “Off-chain data does not lie. Be careful.” Related News: Caution: A New Type of Cryptocurrency Scam Has Emerged - Here Are the Precautions to Take The Alphractal team, on the other hand, announced in their analysis of on-chain data that old whales, the classic big investors of Bitcoin, have not yet taken action. Stating that BTC transaction volumes over $ 100,000 remain at 2020 levels, the analysis stated that such big movements are usually seen in bull markets, but there has been no significant increase since 2022. Joao Wedson also drew attention to the “Bitcoin Long Term Power Law” model that he uses for Bitcoin’s long-term price prediction. This special log-log scale chart reveals Bitcoin’s potential with trend lines drawn with linear regression. According to Wedson, according to this model, it seems unlikely that the BTC price will remain below $108,000 until 2033, as it would contradict Bitcoin's historical growth curve. *This is not investment advice.

Markets have been highly volatile over the past week amid geopolitical tensions and the US air strike on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. Those tensions escalated with Iran threatening to close the Straits of Hormuz, a key shipping channel, which would impact global oil prices. Russia has also reportedly stated that countries are ready to supply Iran with nuclear weapons.

Crypto Market Outlook Digital assets continued to weaken over the weekend following US military action in the Middle East and more rhetoric from Iran and Russia as the situation escalates. Markets lost 4% in a fall to $3.15 trillion but managed to recover slightly during early trading in Asia on Monday morning. Losses were led by Bitcoin, which fell to $98,500 briefly in its first sub-six-figure dip since May 8. However, BTC had reclaimed the $101,000 level at the time of writing. Ethereum dumped more than 7% in a fall to $2,135, its lowest level since it broke above $2,000 in early May. Nevertheless, it also made a minor recovery to trade around $2,240 on Monday morning. Altcoins were all in the red aside from Hyperliquid as markets continue to weaken again.

Bitcoin dropped below $99,000 for the first time since May, with Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin also falling sharply. Though prices slightly recovered by late Sunday, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum remained down, reflecting investor caution amid growing global uncertainty. The rising geopolitical tensions after Trump’s strike on Iran and the continuous debt pressure weigh on markets. Amid this unease, renowned author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has renewed his warning about what he calls the “biggest global debt bubble burst in history.” As digital assets and traditional markets fluctuate, Kiyosaki’s predictions are again sparking conversations across the financial world. GLOBAL MONETARY COLLAPSE COMING? Will you be richer or poorer when biggest debt bubble in history bursts. I recommend owning gold, silver, and BITCOIN if you want to be richer when the Global Debt Bubble bursts. BIGGEST LOSERS will be savers of fake fiat money and especially… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 Kiyosaki’s Call for Tangible Assets In a recent X post, Kiyosaki urged investors to move away from fiat currency savings and instead build positions in tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. His long-held belief is that these alternatives offer better protection against looming economic instability. He reiterated that the global economy is dangerously inflated with debt and that a collapse is not only possible but likely. Past Predictions Back in Focus I shouldn’t brag but in 2013 I published “Rich Dads Prophecy” predicting the world economy today. It still pisses-me -off that so many modern day “prophets” whose names I will not mention, due to “professional courtesy” are now claiming to have warned of this extreme crisis we… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 19, 2025 Kiyosaki’s views aren’t new. He previously discussed similar warnings in his book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, which he claims accurately forecasted today’s economic scenario. Lately, he’s expressed frustration over what he sees as newer voices gaining recognition for insights he believes he shared years ago. His prediction of a potential silver surge, possibly doubling in value by year-end, has also resurfaced in recent discussions, further strengthening his focus on commodities. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Biggest Market Crash in History Is Coming , Looking at the current scenario, he bets high on silver and believes it is the best investment right now, as of June 2025. He believes gold and Bitcoin are currently too expensive and is waiting for a price drop before buying more. Impact on Investor Sentiment Kiyosaki’s warning hits hard for many investors who are already nervous about the shaky state of the global economy. While some think he’s being overly dramatic, others agree with his advice to move money into things like gold, silver, and Bitcoin instead of relying too much on regular cash savings. With growing doubts about the strength of traditional currencies, his message is gaining attention. As markets face more uncertainty, voices like Kiyosaki’s, whether you agree with them or not, are pushing more people to think about where their money is safest during tough times. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The company is investigating a breach on its US network with characteristics consistent with the hacking collective known as the Scattered Spider, Reuters reports . The group, sometimes referred to as “UNC3944,” is believed to be mostly made up of young adults and based in the US and the UK. It’s known to have made several other high-profile breaches targeting Visa, Marks & Spencer, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and several others. An Aflac spokesperson says the firm is still in the early stages of reviewing the attack and that it is not yet ready to divulge information relating to the number of affected customers or how long the investigation will go on. Aflac, which offers accident and pet insurance plans in the US and Japan to its 50 million users, has now potentially exposed its customers’ personal information, including their Social Security numbers and health-related information. Steve Cagle, CEO at healthcare security firm Clearwater, says that Scattered Spider’s specialty seems to be social engineering techniques, such as tricking help desks into resetting credentials and bypassing multi-factor authentication. The group is also known to be expert SIM swappers, which is when a hacker takes control of a target’s mobile phone plan in order to receive their 2FA (two-factor authentication) codes and log in to their accounts. Noah Michael Urban, a member of the group, was recently ordered to pay back $13.2 million to 59 victims after being charged with masterminding a SIM swapping scheme, according to The Register . Urban is currently facing 20 years in federal prison on each wire fraud charge.

After U.S. airstrikes targeted three major Iranian nuclear sites, President Donald Trump declared the attacks a “success,” warning of intensified retaliation if provoked. These strikes come after a week of conflict between Israel and Iran, rattling global markets. Against this geopolitical backdrop, the market capitalisation of the industry dropped 1.50% to $3.1 trillion. Trading volume spiked 26.23% to $136.38 billion as volatility followed with full force. Bitcoin is down 1.27% at $101,497.55, Ethereum lost 1.99% to trade at $2,241.94, and XRP slipped 2.52% to $2.02. Talking about sentiments, the Fear & Greed Index dropped to 37, highlighting growing investor anxiety. Crypto Liquidations Today Surge to $647M In the past 24 hours, total crypto liquidations rose to $647.41 million, affecting over 185,000 traders. Of these, long positions accounted for a whopping $504.95 million, indicating that bullish traders were caught off guard by the swift price reversal. It is worth nothing that the largest liquidation was a $35.45 million BTC-USDT long on HTX. Source: CoinGlass Bybit led the exchanges with $252.46 million in liquidations, followed by Binance at $137.57M and Gate with $96.57M. The majority of liquidated positions were long, with ratios as high as 95.14% on Bitmex and over 90% on Bitfinex and CoinEx. Which signal a strong bias toward expecting upward price movement that ultimately collapsed. Crypto Market Cap Analysis The total crypto market cap currently sits at $3.09 trillion, recovering slightly from an intraday low of $3.04T. Technically, the price touched the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential oversold conditions. The RSI at 38.41 also hints at bearish exhaustion, with room for a short-term relief bounce. However, the market remains below the 20-day SMA of $3.23T, confirming ongoing downward pressure. With BTC dominance at a cycle-high of 64.9%, altcoins are underperforming. ETH dominance has slipped to 8.7%, reflecting broader weakness across major Layer 1s. While the market has witnessed the wrath of external influences, the business still has top gainers in this chaotic session. Which include Story IP with +11.35% intraday gains, Four with +10.39% price surge, and Sonic with +7.68% gains, showing that select microcaps are still attracting speculative interest. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs 1. Why are crypto liquidations so high right now? The $647M liquidation spike comes from a sharp market downturn triggered by geopolitical tensions and overly optimistic long positions getting wiped out. 2. What does a Fear & Greed Index of 37 mean? An index reading of 37 signals “Fear,” indicating investors are cautious. 3. Is the crypto market likely to recover soon? Technically, the RSI and Bollinger Band levels suggest a potential short-term rebound. However, recovery will heavily depend on geopolitical developments.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 07:05:03

This buying came amid the ongoing Iran-Israel war, which has caused the entire crypto market to drop 5% to 10%. Metaplanet Bought 1,100 Bitcoin According to the Metaplanet report , the latest Bitcoin was purchased at an average price of 15,535,502 yen per BTC, which is roughly $105,946 per Bitcoin. Despite the high price tag, MetaPlanet seems calm. What makes this move even more remarkable is the 306.7% year-to-date (YTD) return MetaPlanet has achieved in 2025 alone. This performance reflects not just Bitcoin’s strong rally this year, but also the firm’s strategic timing and belief in Bitcoin as a store of value. Metaplanet 1% Bitcoin Plan As of June 23, the Metaplanet holds a massive 11,111 BTC, acquired for around $1.07 billion, at an average cost basis of $95,869 per Bitcoin. Meanwhile, just last week, Metaplanet bought 1,112 more Bitcoins for about $117.2 million. But the company isn’t stopping there. Metaplanet has already announced plans to raise $5.4 billion, aiming to own 1% of all Bitcoin in existence, about 210,000 BTC, by the end of 2027. It’s one of the boldest Bitcoin strategies ever seen from a public company. Metaplanet Stock Price plummets by 8% The market has been watching Metaplanet’s Bitcoin moves closely. After the announcement, Metaplanet’s stock price showed some volatility. On June 23, 2025, Metaplanet shares closed at 1635 JYP, down 8.77% for the day, following a period of strong gains earlier in the month. The recent dip reflects broader market jitters, not just from the Bitcoin purchase but also due to the escalating conflict in the Middle East, which has rattled global stocks.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 07:08:31

But behind its classrooms and job-ready courses lies a big financial strategy few expected — a growing Bitcoin treasury inspired by none other than Michael Saylor, the Strategy CEO known for turning Bitcoin into a corporate asset. From Napster to Bitcoin: Jetking’s Early Bet on Decentralization In an exclusive interview with Coinpedia, Jetking’s CFO Siddarth Bharwani revealed the company’s long-standing interest in peer-to-peer systems since the Napster era. So, when Bitcoin emerged, its decentralized structure instantly clicked with Jetking’s tech-savvy leadership. By 2017, the company began exploring Bitcoin. But it was Saylor’s high-profile move to institutionalize Bitcoin at MicroStrategy that truly changed the game for Jetking, transforming their view of Bitcoin from a tech curiosity to a potential treasury asset. “It was Michael Saylor’s move to institutionalize Bitcoin on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet that catalysed our own shift in perspective — highlighting Bitcoin not just as a technology, but as a transformative treasury asset. This conviction led us to formally begin accumulating Bitcoin in March 2022.,” the CFO shared. COVID-19: The Crisis That Forced a Financial Rethink Jetking’s pivot to Bitcoin wasn’t just driven by curiosity, it was born out of survival. The pandemic devastated Jetking’s operations, wiping out 40 years of physical expansion in just 12 months. In March 2022, Jetking took its first steps, formally buying Bitcoin as a treasury asset. “We looked at Bitcoin and Bitcoin being the hardest money available on earth, we went ahead and bought Bitcoin on our Balance sheet,” he said. 18,000 Bitcoin by 2030: The Big Bet Jetking isn’t stopping at a few Bitcoins. The company has an ambitious roadmap to accumulate 210 BTC by 2025, and eventually reach 18,000 BTC by 2030. “Capital efficiency is maximized through Fundraises, cash flow recycling and market-hedged exposure — all while aligning dilution control with long-term Bitcoin appreciation and shareholder value creation.” The company is focusing on capital efficiency, market-hedged exposure, and disciplined fundraises, all while keeping shareholder dilution under control. They want to build Bitcoin exposure the smart way, not the reckless way. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This is commonly considered one of the symptoms of the long-range upward movement. The recent breakout of the consolidation range has strengthened this structure, with DOGE currently located inside a breakout system that can cause another increase. The technical analyst Javon Marks affirms that the upward structure is intact since DOGE trades above the necessary trend line support. Marks pointed out the possible price of $0.6533 in case of the continuation of bull pressure. This would constitute a nearly 260 percent gain in price as compared to the present cost of 0.1712. In the long term, should things play out, then the token may reach the region of 1.25, which is more than 600% higher than the current valuation. Nevertheless, these targets will be reached on the condition of sustained buying pressure and market support. Price Action Experiences Consolidation with Pamphlets of Accumulation Over the last 24 hours, Dogecoin has dropped by 1.60 percent, and it has lost 13.36 percent over a week. Although this temporary decrease has been witnessed, the price has been held in a more extensive upward trend. June 19 daily charts are associated with volatility, as the DOGE reached a maximum of $0.171250 around 1:00 AM and dropped to the bottom of $0.169600 by 7:30 AM. Such apprehension is shown in movements such as those of traders who have not yet found a determining point but who have regular volume patterns with phases of periods active in accumulating. Source: Yahoo Finance The current resistance zone stands at $0.170378, which DOGE has tested but not yet decisively breached. The ability to hold above the $0.165 level is considered crucial for maintaining the upward trajectory. A break above the near-term resistance, accompanied by rising volume, could strengthen bullish signals and drive price momentum toward the following resistance zones. New Competitor Enters Market With Bold Target As DOGE maintains its bullish posture, a new project called Little Pepe is gaining traction with aggressive market positioning. Operating as a Layer 2 blockchain, Little Pepe introduces the $LILPEPE token as the central utility asset of its network. The project aims to combine fast, low-fee blockchain performance with meme coin culture, positioning itself as the next significant evolution in the meme coin space. With ambitions of capturing market share from established tokens like Dogecoin, Little Pepe is reportedly targeting a return of up to 16,828% for early participants. Since its presale launch, $LILPEPE has rapidly gained traction. Stage 1 tokens were priced at $0.001, selling 500 million tokens and raising $500,000 within just 72 hours. Stage 2 followed at $0.0011, with over 1.16 billion tokens sold and $733,987 raised. Currently, Stage 3 is underway at $0.0012, having raised $1.53 million with more than 1.42 billion tokens sold, and aiming for a $2.525 million target. The next price stage will rise to $0.0013, rewarding early participants with the lowest entry price before the token hits major exchanges. As Dogecoin eyes a move toward $2 amid favorable technical signals, Little Pepe is capturing investor attention with its innovative blockchain technology and tiered presale model, adding a new dynamic to the meme coin market and giving traders exciting alternatives for significant short-term and long-term gains.

The firm currently has a total of 11,111 BTC holdings, valued at over $1.07 billion. Metalplanet bought the digital asset at an average purchase price of 15,535,502 yen ($106,408 million) per Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s stock (3350T) dropped slightly by 5.05% in the past 24 hours on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, reaching 1,690 Japanese yen. The firm’s stock has seen an uptick of more than 373% year-to-date.

(@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Metaplanet’s latest acquisition marks a major milestone in its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which commenced in mid-2024 and accelerated through early 2025. Since December 2024, the company has grown its stash nearly 28-fold since it formalized its Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business initiative, pivoting from its hotel management business. The investment company also reported a quarter-to-date BTC yield of 107.9%, up from 95.6% in Q1 and 309.8% in Q4 2024. The firm uses the metric as a key performance indicator to track Bitcoin per fully diluted share over time, excluding the effects of dilution. Metaplanet also posted a BTC gain of 4,367 BTC for $451.2 million for the ongoing quarter, based on reference prices from Bitflyer. The Tokyo-based firm has funded its Bitcoin purchases through a series of capital market activities, including multiple zero-coupon bond issuances and equity-based investments. Since January, Metaplanet has issued and redeemed more than a dozen series of ordinary bonds and stock acquisition rights, largely subscribed by EVO FUND. The company has issued over 210 million shares under its ‘210 Million Plan.’ The investment firm’s board of directors resolved on June 16 to issue $210 million via no-interest bonds and raised that figure to buy more BTC. Metaplanet revealed that it aims to purchase 210,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2027. According to Bitbo data, if successful, the acquisition would make the company the second-largest holder of Bitcoin among public companies, behind Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy. Previously, under the firm’s 21 million plan, it would hold 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026, with no concrete plan for more buys. Between May and June 2025 alone, the company raised over $300M through bonds and exercised stock rights, with proceeds explicitly allocated for Bitcoin accumulation. A June 3 report from Standard Chartered found that, the Bitcoin reserve strategy trend has led to 61 publicly listed firms out of a total of 124 now holding a combined 3.2% of all BTC that will ever exist. Bitcoin remains resilient amid ongoing global geopolitical tensions Metaplanet added to its Bitcoin reserves amid an escalation in the Middle East war and the looming uncertainty over global financial markets. Investors are watching to see how the financial system will react when markets open on Monday, following the involvement of the U.S. in the conflict over the weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Saturday evening that the United States had launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. He revealed that the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The price of Bitcoin has slid by roughly 1% in the last 24 hours and had dipped below the $100K mark on Sunday, before recovering and hovering at $101,800 at the time of publication.

46600014,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72243,1750663457,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Projected Timeline for $10,000 In XRP to Become $1 Million",https://timestabloid.com/projected-timeline-for-10000-in-xrp-to-become-1-million/,"The possibility of turning a $10,000 XRP investment into $1 million remains one of the more ambitious yet widely discussed goals among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. As XRP continues to build momentum, several analysts and platforms have offered forecasts on how and when this milestone could realistically be achieved. This article reviews the valuation milestones required to reach the million-dollar mark and evaluates predictions from industry figures and research platforms regarding the timelines involved. Understanding What It Takes to Reach $1 Million from $10K in XRP At the current trading price of approximately $2, a $10,000 investment would acquire 5,000 XRP tokens. For this amount to grow into a $1 million portfolio, XRP would need to rise by nearly 9,900% to reach $200 per coin. Reaching this price level would mark a historically significant leap for XRP, surpassing its all-time high of $3.84 recorded during the 2017–2018 bull cycle. Though XRP has delivered major gains in previous cycles, replicating such growth in today’s market conditions poses substantial challenges. At $200 per unit, XRP’s total market capitalization would exceed $12 trillion. This would place its value above the combined market caps of several of the world’s largest technology firms, including Apple and Google. As a result, while the math behind the $10,000-to-$1 million scenario is straightforward, its feasibility continues to be debated among analysts and investors. Forecasts Suggest Varied Timelines to the $210 Mark Analysts have outlined different scenarios and timelines for when XRP could reach the required $200 price level. Among the more optimistic voices is Javon Marks, who believes XRP could reach $200 as a result of what he describes as a breakout from its “largest coil pattern of all time.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He draws a comparison to XRP’s multi-year consolidation from 2014 to 2017, which preceded a major rally. Marks believes the 2017–2024 period resembles that earlier setup, stating he still holds a triple-digit outlook for XRP in the current market cycle. In line with this bullish perspective, some in the XRP community have projected even higher valuations, with certain estimates ranging up to $305. These expectations are built on confidence in XRP’s long-term positioning and its potential role in the evolving financial system. On the other hand, several research platforms present more conservative projections. According to Telegaon , XRP might not reach $236 until 2050. This places the $1 million outcome over two decades into the future. Similarly, Changelly’s forecast suggests a timeline between 2034 and 2040 for XRP to reach $200. These estimates reflect a cautious approach and assume a more gradual pace of adoption and market growth. Contrasting Views from the XRP Community and Analysts Within the XRP community, such long-term projections are often dismissed as overly cautious. Critics of the 2050 and 2040 timelines argue that these projections stem from analysts who are unwilling to consider XRP’s future potential. Some community members attribute these estimates to “Bitcoin maxis” who prioritize Bitcoin’s dominance over competing digital assets. A notable alternative view comes from BarriC, a respected voice within the XRP ecosystem. He has predicted that XRP could reach $200 between 2032 and 2033. This estimate, while still conservative compared to Marks’ outlook, is viewed by many as more reasonable and achievable. Additionally, Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer of CryptoGuard, has stated that XRP could reach $1,000 by 2035 , implying an earlier arrival at the $200 threshold. While the goal of turning a $10,000 investment in XRP into $1 million requires the token to reach $200, opinions differ widely on when such a price level might be reached. From as early as this cycle to as late as 2050, expert predictions span decades. Despite this range, interest in XRP’s long-term trajectory remains strong.

These figures earned Cardano first place on a weekly basis. While there was a 0.3% increase in the number of commits on a monthly basis, there was a 9.8% decrease in the number of developers. Cardano’s ecosystem-wide activity was on a downward trend, with 1173 commits (-25.26%) and 176 developers (-19.92%) showing a decline compared to previous months. Ethereum, while underperforming in terms of direct core contributions, stands out with its ecosystem scale. 1567 projects running on the Ethereum network were supported by a total of 1572 developers this week. Developers made 24,144 commits to these projects. However, there was a 24.68% decrease in the number of developers and an 18.04% decrease in the number of commits.

Everyone wants to be perfectly positioned to take full advantage of the coming altcoin season. The month has seen crypto markets pick up momentum, with an influx of institutional funds driving the surge. Bold investors understand that June represents the last real opportunity to make massive gains when the market goes parabolic. If you want to make a smart buy right now, one of your best options is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in the presale phase, which represents an opportunity for massive upside. According to analysts, the MUTM tokens could rise over 20x when they go live. Here is a deep dive into some of the projects that savvy investors are looking at in the month of June 2025, with a focus on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is under the radar. XRP XRP, created by Ripple Labs, has been at the center of a legal whirlwind in recent years. However, 2025 is panning out to be a great year for the project. The SEC lawsuit is in the process of winding up, and Ripple is expanding its solutions across the world in the Middle East and Asia. RippleNet has seen growing adoption in Japan and Singapore, where major institutions have added it to their services. As such, it is still growing into its role of being a better alternative to SWIFT and its legacy systems. Ripple Labs also recently upgraded the XRP ledger to allow native support for issuing assets. That could expand its role beyond remittances, making the network a complete layer 1 for tokenization and DeFi. While these developments are promising, XRP has a long way to go before it can gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for SWIFT. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a more promising prospect. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot (DOT) is a multi-chain powerhouse built for scalability using parachains. After a slow 2024, DOT is signaling some new momentum. In June, the network rolled out a new feature called Asynchronous Backing that makes parachains faster, boosting the throughput 10x. Additionally, community governance has been implemented and is executed faster. With a post to speed and more control to the community, DOT is a good project to consider. However, the improvements to the network have not had as much of an impact as expected. Considering this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be a better option for bigger gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) It began as a whisper in the corners of Crypto X and has now spread into a massive movement. On X alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a following of over 10.5k followers. The project is proving that it is not just another crypto project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the future of utility-based growth. Created by a team of committed developers, this project could deliver the most explosive gains of 2025. As a sign of the team’s commitment, they submitted the code for an audit to CertiK early on, and they got back positive results. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a Token Scan Score of 80 on CertiK, just one of its many accomplishments. Where the project truly shines is in the protocol design. It is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their funds into the protocol’s pools to earn interest. The interest that they receive is based on the pool utilization rate. As the number of loans taken by borrowers rises, in comparison to the total in a pool, the utilization rate rises. This causes the interest rates to rise, which encourages the borrowers to repay their loans. At the same time, it inspires more lenders to join the pools to benefit from the rising yields. Over time, this creates a positive feedback loop that ensures optimal capital efficiency. Lenders receive mtTokens when they deposit assets into the pools. These mtTokens represent the value of their deposit, plus any interest they accrued. As a result, this system makes it easy to keep track of the interest payments. Additionally, lenders do not need to actively claim or compound their interest.

Naturally, the financial markets have responded negatively to this news, and the crypto market has not been left out. Interestingly, the Bitcoin price had sat above the $100,000 psychological level for the longest. However, it was only a matter of time before it lost this support and crashed further, especially as the digital asset seems to only have major support in the 5-digit territory. Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $90,000 In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Master Ananda has revealed major bearish formations for the Bitcoin price. With the $100,000 support having held so far through the last week, it suggested there is still some buying going on for the cryptocurrency. However, the chart does not show enough strength to hold this level. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications Since the market has been rocked by over $1 billion in liquidations in the last week, it has transferred some weakness to the BTC price, putting the bears in charge once again. Pointing this out, Master Ananda explains that the weekly chart, in particular, is not showing any good signs. The current Bitcoin price action seems to only be a continuation of the bearish price action that began after it hit a peak of $111,900 back on May 19, 2025. Since then, the decline has been consistent, and the crypto analyst says the market looks “terrible” right now. Given the crash, the major support for Bitcoin is no longer above $100,000, but over 10% below it. As the price has previously broken below $100,000, the first support the market could see would be at $88,888. Failure to hold at this point would trigger another 5% decline toward $82,500 before bulls are able to put up any fight. What Happens If BTC Stays Above $100,000? While the bearish trend is the most dominant at this point, there is still the possibility that the Bitcoin price could stay back above $100,000 and hold the fort there. In this case, it is likely that the bullish trend would continue. The crypto analyst highlights this in another post, forecasting a very sharp upward move if this happens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again In the case of a recovery, then Bitcoin could retest the upper trendline that sits right above $108,000. And as for how long all of this could take to play out, the crypto analyst believes that the entire thing shouldn’t take more than two weeks to actually unfold and pick a direction. “Do not be afraid if the market shakes, Bitcoin is going up; Crypto will grow, regardless of the short-term,” the analyst said in closing.

Key Takeaways: FTX is seeking to fully reject 3AC’s $1.5B claim, calling it legally and factually unfounded. The exchange argues 3AC breached margin terms and ignored warnings before a necessary $82M liquidation. FTX says 3AC is shifting blame to recover losses from its own failed trading, at the expense of other creditors. In a recent court filing , lawyers representing FTX argued that 3AC’s request to recover funds from the bankrupt exchange’s estate should be “disallowed in its entirety.” The objection follows a November 2024 ruling by a Delaware bankruptcy judge permitting 3AC to increase its claim from $120 million to $1.5 billion , citing new evidence related to asset liquidations. 3AC Claims FTX Dumped $1.5B in Assets Weeks Before Its Collapse 3AC claims that FTX liquidated roughly $1.5 billion in its assets just weeks before the hedge fund itself collapsed. However, FTX attorneys dismissed the claim as resting on “an unreasonable and unsupportable starting premise,” citing “inaccurate figures” and a “blindness to the actual events.” The filing points to a June 2022 breach of margin requirements by 3AC following the fallout from Terra’s collapse. According to the objection, when 3AC’s account fell below the required $240 million balance, the firm failed to respond for over six hours. Instead of meeting the shortfall, it allegedly withdrew $18 million in ETH. FTX then moved to liquidate the account, recovering $82 million. The lawyers argue this move not only complied with credit and margin agreements but also protected the estate from further losses. FTX lawyers say 3AC’s $1.5 billion claim 'defies logic' and should be tossed -Lawyers for the FTX bankruptcy estate have objected to a $1.53 billion claim from collapsed trading firm Three Arrows Capital, urging the court to dismiss 3AC’s claim in full. -The lawyers say 3AC’s… https://t.co/YCMn4AwEs6 — Rukawa Kaede. (@show4653) June 23, 2025 Without the liquidation, they claim, 3AC’s account would have been $18 million underwater by the time FTX filed for bankruptcy. “Forced liquidation was not only permitted but necessary,” wrote Steven Coverick of Alvarez & Marsal, who conducted a forensic review of the transactions. His findings were submitted alongside the objection. British Virgin Islands King’s Counsel Stephen Atherton also weighed in, dismissing 3AC’s legal arguments under BVI law as flawed. FTX’s team maintains that 3AC is attempting to recoup losses from its own aggressive trading by targeting the exchange’s creditor pool. “FTX creditors should not and cannot serve as a backstop for 3AC’s failed trading strategy,” the filing states. 3AC has until July 11 to respond, with a non-evidentiary hearing scheduled for August 12. Sam Bankman-Fried’s Release Date Set for 2044 FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now projected to be released from federal prison on December 14, 2044 , after serving less than 21 years of his 25-year sentence for fraud tied to the FTX collapse. He was also fined over $11 billion. Federal records confirm that Bankman-Fried has been moved from New York to a transfer facility in Oklahoma following nearly two years behind bars. The move comes after Bankman-Fried was reportedly placed in solitary confinement earlier this month for giving an unauthorized interview to Tucker Carlson. His incarceration began in August 2023, after Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked his bail due to allegations of witness tampering involving leaked diary entries from former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, who was a key witness in the case.

The minting happened in two steps as the company made $1 billion earlier and later added another $1 billion, which CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed. Whale Alert posted on X , highlighting the latest $1 billion USDT mint at Tether’s Treasury address. Paolo Ardoino explained that the USDT is “authorized but not issued”. Tether holds it in reserve for future use, like customer redemptions or moving tokens between blockchains. Tether creates new USDT to meet future needs Tether’s recent decision to mint $2 billion worth of USDT on the Tron blockchain comes after another $1 billion USDT mint on Ethereum on June 18, just before the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC meeting . Tether has created a historic pattern in which it preemptively boosts stablecoin reserves ahead of possible liquidity surges. So many investors and analysts now assume the company expects the market conditions to change. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain said the company is preparing in advance for expected demand because it is issuing large amounts of USDT without putting it directly into circulation. Stablecoins like USDT also lack the volatility of regular cryptocurrencies. They are common in market trends that Tether’s minting behavior follows, such as when investors increase their activity or when trading volumes spike on major exchanges. Popular crypto investor and commentator Lark Davis described the minting as a sign that “dry powder” is entering the system. This means the capital exists and will be deployed once favorable market conditions arise. His comments show hope of an upcoming shift to a more risk-on investment environment if the Fed leans toward cutting interest rates or signaling continued support for financial markets. Tether builds up reserves to keep USDT stable Tether continues to grow its reserves to support the stability and trust behind its popular stablecoin tied to the value of the U.S. dollar, USDT. Minting more tokens and holding them in reserve gives users confidence that they can always redeem their USDT for dollars if needed because it proves each USDT in circulation is fully supported by assets of equal value. The most recent $2 billion minting happened on the Tron blockchain because Tron offers fast and low-cost transfers for users who need to move large amounts of money quickly and affordably. Tether is giving users more flexibility in how they use the token and allowing exchanges and crypto to choose the network that best suits their needs in terms of speed and transaction fees by spreading USDT across multiple blockchains like Tron, Ethereum, and others. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, said the newly minted USDT allows the company to respond faster to future demands from exchanges, institutional clients , or users who want to swap USDT between blockchains. This is because they are created in advance and held in Tether’s treasury as inventory. The company says it issues new tokens to ensure smooth service, not to influence or predict price movements, but some people in the crypto community think these large mints usually happen before Bitcoin and Ethereum prices rise and show incoming market rallies Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-quietly-thriving-in-japan-payment-sector-heres-the-latest/,"Mai, co-founder of the XRPL Japan Association, shared a video on X from the XRPL Japan Community Day after-party showing a person paying for beer and tacos using XRP. The transaction was completed through a mobile phone, visually demonstrating the token’s utility in a real-world setting. According to her caption, the payment was successfully executed with XRP, underscoring ongoing efforts to promote real-world use cases for the digital asset within Japan’s growing XRP community. XRP Payment in Action at Community Gathering The video depicted a casual but purposeful demonstration of XRP being used to settle a transaction for food and drinks. This simple but important moment was showcased as part of a larger effort to normalize digital payments through the XRP Ledger. The setting—a relaxed after-party following XRPL Japan Community Day—allowed attendees and followers to witness the practicality of XRP in informal, day-to-day scenarios. The visual of the person using their mobile device to pay underscored the token’s potential as a reliable medium of exchange. Paying for beer and tacos by XRP at the after party of @XRPLJapan Community Day pic.twitter.com/YaDp8eHUKC — Mai ＠Xaman/XRPL Japan (@Mai_XRPLJapan) June 21, 2025 Mixed Reactions from the XRP and Crypto Communities Responses to Mai’s post varied widely. Some users drew comparisons to early Bitcoin milestones. One such reaction came from Michael Gigliotti, who suggested that the moment might be remembered similarly to Bitcoin’s first commercial transaction—paying for pizza in 2010. In a related tone, a commenter named LFC Fan entertained the idea that this could one day be seen as “XRP Taco Day,” alluding to a potential tradition within the XRP community that commemorates its early real-world uses. Not all replies shared this optimistic view. A more critical response came from a user identified as Shine195, who expressed frustration with XRP’s lack of price movement and perceived it as underwhelming in comparison to Bitcoin. They criticized the continued positioning of XRP alongside BTC, asserting that XRP lags significantly in value and market performance. Such comments reflect a long-standing split within the community between those who focus on utility and those who prioritize asset appreciation. Local Utility as a Driver for Broader Adoption Mai’s video and the broader XRPL Japan Community Day serve as part of a larger strategy to advance the perception of XRP as more than just a speculative asset. By making it visible in ordinary, real-world contexts—such as buying tacos and drinks—advocates aim to underscore its transaction efficiency and simplicity. These grassroots applications help the public engage with the token outside the abstract discussions on blockchain or trading platforms. As more community events adopt similar practices, such demonstrations may serve as blueprints for broader adoption in retail and social settings.

This is how Robert Kiyosaki feels for the precious metal as of June 2025. In his most recent post from today on social media platform X, the famous author has touted silver as “ the best investment today, June 2025 ”. He’s currently waiting for gold and Bitcoin (BTC) to drop further before he can add more positions, but why the sudden shift to silver? The investor, who predicted the financial crash in 2008, believes that this is a prime time for accumulating silver. Part of his reasoning stems from the fact that gold and Bitcoin are near their all-time high levels, as of the moment of writing. He’s boldly stated that silver is currently a “ bargain” at these prices, and his predictions are that it could 2X, or even 3X this year. He has steadily been warning his followers of the next financial crash, which he thinks will be throughout the summer. FYI: Silver is the best investment today….june 2025.

He’s not shying away from the king crypto, as his predictions call for Bitcoin to reach $1M per coin, and he is not the only one who has made such high calls. Kiyosaki focuses more on the quantity of Bitcoin he has, and the number of ounces in gold/silver, as he has commented on a recent post of his. He has been accumulating since the price was $6000, and he “ wishes that he bought more ”. Kiyosaki has always been a Bitcoin bull, as he frequently discusses it across all of his social channels aimed financial literacy.

Cryptocurrency gains a nominal 0.48% of its value. UNI coin faces a resistance at $6.47. On June 23, 2025, Uniswap price analysis revealed an undecided trend that tilts towards the bullish side.

Overall, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.48% of its value. The bulls have been ruling the market today, which has resulted in stopping the strong correction that took place during the past three days. Uniswap price analysis on the daily time frame The one-day price chart of Uniswap coin confirmed an undecided trend in the market. The UNI/USD value has elevated to a $6.27 high for the day. Green candlesticks on the price chart signify a returning buying momentum. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility.

Whereby, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $5.52. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the neutral region. The indicator’s value has been recorded at index 43.09 today. The undecided trend is represented by a flattening curve on the RSI graph. Further stability in the market can be expected if the buying momentum continues. Uniswap price analysis on 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Uniswap coin shows a mixed volatility as bears defend the EMA trend lines. The coin value has corrected to $6.27 in the past few hours. However, the decreasing volatility signifies relatively lower chances of an upcoming reversal. The Bollinger bands are converging, leading to a decrease in volatility. This decrease in volatility signals a lower market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $7.86, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $5.75, securing the support. UNI/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 31.45 in the past few hours. This decrease shows the rising bearish threat around resistance channels on the 4-hour price chart.

Uniswap price analysis gives a neutral prediction regarding the ongoing market trends as the coin’s price is slowly increasing after a strong correction that was observed until yesterday. If buyers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might aim for a surge toward $6.5. On the other hand, a failure to meet further buying demand might trigger a rejection. In such a case, UNI’s price might drop below immediate support channels and head toward the $5.8 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $23.01 level by 2027 and above $45.41 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing a slow recovery phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining value, and so is UNI. As buyers gained ground around $6.24, positive sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $10.90, while the average price is expected to be around $9.08. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.8 and $7.5; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $47.22 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

46601891,https://cryptonews.com/?p=373851,1750665714,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/46601891.jpeg,XRP ETF Approval Odds Jump to 95% — Spot Rally Incoming?,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-etf-approval-odds-jump-to-95-is-a-spot-rally-incoming/,"Bloomberg analysts now place the odds of an XRP spot ETF approval at 95%, fueling renewed speculation around institutional capital inflows and a potential shift in crypto market dynamics. Key Takeaways: Bloomberg analysts place XRP ETF approval odds at 95%, citing increased SEC engagement. Major firms like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton are backing XRP. Delays in approval could hurt US competitiveness. The updated projection shared by ETF specialists James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas follows growing regulatory engagement with multiple crypto ETF filings. Seyffart noted on X that increasing interaction from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is “a very positive sign,” as applications from major asset managers move forward. XRP Joins Solana, Litecoin, and Others in ETF Review Spotlight XRP is among a slate of digital assets under review, alongside Solana, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, and others. The SEC has already acknowledged XRP’s 19b-4 filings, with a final decision expected by October 17, 2025. Seyffart cautioned that while approval feels inevitable, the timeline remains unclear: “Could be something we’re talking about in the next month or two. Or it could be something that waits until October or later.” Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares are among the firms backing XRP ETF applications, signaling strong institutional support. Along with Solana and Litecoin, XRP now leads the field in projected approval probability, with others like Cardano, Dogecoin, and Polkadot assigned 90% odds. The analysts’ outlook reflects a broader trend: the SEC appears increasingly willing to treat many of these assets as commodities, potentially easing their path to regulated products. Still, the slow pace of movement has raised concern. Industry observers warn that delays could erode the U.S.’ competitive position in digital asset innovation. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 Proponents argue that faster approvals, especially for high-profile assets like XRP, would address rising investor demand and solidify regulatory clarity. On June 11, VivoPower, a publicly listed firm, announced a partnership with the Flare blockchain to generate yield from its XRP holdings. The move could indicate that institutional players are looking for ways to leverage their crypto assets without liquidating them. In May, VivoPower also invested $121 million in XRP as a strategic reserve, making it the first company in the world with an XRP-focused treasury. XRP Shows Signs of Price Compression XRP is trading around $2.015 as of June 23, showing signs of price compression following a sharp drop from recent highs above $2.30. The Bollinger Bands across the daily and 30-minute charts are tightening, indicating reduced volatility and a potential breakout setup. On the 1-day chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 43.68, signaling mild bearish momentum, but not yet oversold. The MACD remains slightly below the signal line with negative histogram bars, suggesting that sellers remain in control. Price has dropped below both the middle Bollinger Band and the 20-day SMA, which may act as resistance near $2.03 and $2.11. Zooming into the 30-minute chart, RSI has bounced to 52.19 with a bullish MACD crossover, indicating short-term strength. Support was found near $1.996, and a mild recovery has followed. In the 1-minute chart, momentum is mixed, with RSI hovering near 41.74 and MACD flattening out after a brief bullish attempt. If XRP holds above the $2.00 psychological level, a retest of $2.03 resistance is likely. A break below $1.996 could expose lower supports near $1.93.

46602166,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753637,1750665726,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46602166.jpeg,Global markets are barely reacting after Iran's retaliation. Here is why,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/global-markets-largely-unfazed-by-iran/,"Global markets are barely reacting after US President Donald Trump confirmed on Saturday that American forces struck Iran’s nuclear sites and Iran promised in turn to make the country suffer “severely” with its retaliation today. Iran also shut down its Strait of Hormuz, the most important oil route in the world, where 20 million barrels pass through every day. That’s around a fifth of global oil trade. What should have been a massive geopolitical shock barely moved the needle for traders, and investors appear convinced the situation is contained. According to CNBC, many believe it won’t spread beyond the region, and some even view it as bullish for risk assets like crypto. By press time, the MSCI World Index, which tracks large and mid-sized firms across 23 developed markets, had only dipped 0.12%. That mild drop came alongside strange behavior in so-called “safe” assets. The Japanese yen fell 0.64% against the dollar. Gold edged down by 0.23%, now sitting at $3,360 per ounce. Meanwhile, the US dollar index rose 0.35%. The message? This isn’t being treated like a crisis. Traders ignore Iran’s warning to close oil chokepoint Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush, said Trump’s attack on Iran has actually eased concerns for investors. “The markets view the attack on Iran as a relief with the nuclear threat now gone for the region,” he told CNBC. He also said he sees little chance of the conflict spreading further, calling the situation “isolated.” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, told CNBC, “It all depends on how Iran responds. If they accept the end of their military nuclear desires … then this could be the end of the conflict and markets will be fine.” Boockvar added that he doesn’t believe Iran will actually disrupt the oil flow. Marko Papic, chief strategist at GeoMacro Strategy, spelled out the real danger. If Iran blocks the strait, oil will shoot over $100, stocks could drop 10%, and investors will run to safety. But, he said, this is highly unlikely. “Markets are subdued now given the limited tools Tehran has at its disposal to retaliate,” Papic said. Iran’s threat to shut the strait isn’t new. They said the same thing in 2018 when the US left the nuclear deal. Back in 2011 and 2012, then–Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi floated similar threats. Nothing came of them. Papic added, “Tehran understands that, if they were to close the Strait, the retaliation from the US would be swift, punitive, and brutal.” China’s dependence limits Iran’s options The other factor keeping things calm is China. Iran relies heavily on China to buy its oil, and Beijing has no interest in a disrupted Gulf. Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights, said on CNBC’s Squawk Box Asia that the chances of Iran actually closing the Strait of Hormuz are “absolutely minimalistic.” She warned that Iran would turn oil-rich neighbors into enemies and put its entire economy at risk. Andrew Bishop, head of policy research at Signum Global Advisors, agreed. He said Iran won’t want to provoke China and risk retaliation on its oil infrastructure. “Disrupting supplies will also put a target on the country’s own oil production, export infrastructure, and regime,” he said, noting that both the US and Israel are currently “trigger-happy.” Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explained that China depends not just on Iran but on oil from the whole region. “Its national security interest really would value stabilization of the situation and a de-escalation enabling safe flows of oil and gas through the strait,” he said. While there’s no sign yet of military de-escalation, there’s also no sign of a blockade. The Joint Maritime Information Center confirmed that “US-associated vessels have successfully transited the Strait of Hormuz without interruption.” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, doesn’t think any of this has hurt the US bull market. “Geopolitically, we think that Trump has just reestablished America’s military deterrence capabilities,” he said. He expects the S&P 500 to reach 6,500 by the end of 2025, and he believes the destruction of Iran’s nuclear sites could lead to “radical transformation” in the region. For now, investors are calling Iran’s bluff. Markets remain calm. Crypto is steady. Oil still flows. And unless Iran does something more than talk, that’s unlikely to change.

Legal Structure for Bitcoin Reserve Approved The new law empowers the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to manage a dedicated Bitcoin reserve fund, which will be maintained outside the state treasury. Legislative appropriations, dedicated fees, investment income, and voluntary donations of cryptocurrency will support the fund. It introduces formal guidelines for the acquisition, custody, and liquidation of digital assets under state supervision. A key provision in SB 21 limits investments to digital assets with a minimum average market capitalization of $500 billion over the preceding 12 months, a criterion currently met only by Bitcoin. This restriction is designed to mitigate exposure to volatile or thinly traded tokens, effectively making Bitcoin the sole eligible asset for the reserve. Additional Measures to Protect State Crypto Holdings SB 21 follows the earlier passage of House Bill 4488, a complementary measure enacted to protect the state's Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency reserves from being absorbed into Texas’s general revenue fund. Without this legal safeguard, funds allocated for digital asset holdings faced the risk of being liquidated in 2025 to cover budgetary shortfalls. Together, the two pieces of legislation form a comprehensive framework: HB 4488 secures the legal status of Bitcoin reserves under state law, while SB 21 provides the operational authority to purchase and manage those assets. Policy Adjustments and Oversight Provisions During its progression through the legislature, SB 21 underwent several revisions. Notably, the House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency introduced clearer operational protocols, risk management guidelines, and limits on speculative investments using public funds. These amendments were aimed at addressing concerns over Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility and the fiscal prudence of allocating government resources to such assets. Broader Implications and Industry Response The decision to formalize Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset marks a notable development in state-level digital asset policy. Supporters argue that this move could enhance Texas’s financial resilience, act as a hedge against inflation, and position the state as a leader in digital asset integration within public finance. However, critics have flagged the initiative’s exposure to risks, including market volatility, regulatory shifts, and cybersecurity threats. Questions remain about whether allocating taxpayer resources to inherently speculative assets aligns with sound fiscal governance.

In his words, “SEC v XRP final decision could be delayed until late 2026.” The tweet has drawn attention due to its bold projection, despite the lack of any official confirmation or judicial documentation to substantiate such a delay. BALE’s statement remains speculative and is currently regarded as an unverified rumor. BREAKING SEC v XRP final decision could be delayed until late 2026 Huge month in August — BALE (@AltcoinBale) June 22, 2025 Procedural Developments Undermine Claim of Delay Contrary to BALE’s claim, the current legal status surrounding the SEC v. Ripple case suggests a more immediate resolution could be approaching. According to a June 21 report by Times Tabloid , recent filings in the Southern District of New York indicate a significant procedural step toward concluding the matter. Specifically, both Ripple and the SEC jointly submitted a renewed motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60. The motion requests Judge Analisa Torres to amend the final judgment, including reducing Ripple’s civil penalty from $125 million to $50 million, returning $75 million to the company, and lifting the longstanding injunction that has prevented institutional sales of XRP. This latest motion replaces an earlier request filed in May, which Judge Torres denied due to insufficient justification and procedural flaws. However, the June filing appears to have been more carefully constructed, citing “exceptional circumstances” such as changes in regulatory frameworks and a mutual interest from both parties to conclude the litigation without further delay. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additional Court Actions Indicate Imminent Decision In addition to the motion to amend the final judgment, the SEC and Ripple filed a status report with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on June 16. In it, both parties requested that the ongoing appeals and cross-appeals be placed in abeyance while Judge Torres considers the revised motion. The report included an agreement that the SEC would provide another update by August 15 if the motion remains pending. Although there is no specific legal deadline for Judge Torres to issue a decision on the revised motion, legal professionals following the case believe a resolution could arrive soon. Notably, Australian lawyer Bill Morgan and U.S. attorney Fred Rispoli have both projected that a ruling may come within weeks. Potential Outcomes and Conclusion of the XRP Case Should Judge Torres approve the motion, it would effectively restructure the penalty imposed on Ripple, formally dismiss all pending appeals, and dissolve the injunction on XRP’s institutional sales. This would lead to a limited remand to the Second Circuit to finalize and officially conclude the case. While it remains technically possible for judicial timelines to extend, current legal filings and professional assessments suggest that a final decision is more likely to occur within the near term.

The buyer appeared after nearly $80M in long liquidations for ETH. Whale activity remains significant for Ethereum (ETH), as whales are buying the dip. One newly created wallet withdrew 50,256 ETH from the Binance hot wallet, in tranches of 3,000 ETH. The whale started filling up the new wallet in the past 24 hours, after being first funded by a known Binance hot wallet. The whale started buying during one of the periods of rapidly sliding prices for ETH, when the asset wiped out more than 12% of its price. Its average entry was at $2,265 per ETH, starting from the beginning of the price slide. The whale activity suggests a rebound may be on the way, with predictions of a 25% price rally. The whale held only ETH valued at $112.8M, with a minimal amount of WETH. Buying ETH often precedes various forms of staking or usage as collateral to tap the current value and unlock liquidity. Large-scale ETH owners are cautious about taking profits, instead increasing their position and moving liquidity into DeFi. | Source: CryptoQuant Whales have also switched from panic-selling and liquidation to ongoing slow accumulation with the expectation of long-term ETH growth. Overall, whales have switched to accumulation since the end of 2024, with relatively small profit-taking in the past weeks. ETH shows signs of local lows The buying activity sets up expectations that ETH may be done with its downward correction, after nearly $80M in long liquidations in the past 24 hours. ETH open interest fell over the weekend following market volatility and liquidatoins, sliding to $14B from a recent level of $16B. Long positions are still over 75% of open interest, suggesting more liquidations could be instore. ETH traded at $2,239.78, sliding under its recent range. However, even ETH price crashes have led to additional buying from whales, with the goal of achieving a lower average price. ETH also rebounded from its lows against Bitcoin, once again returning to 0.022 BTC. Ethereum holders flock to big DeFi protocols Ethereum is becoming the playground of whales, with liquidity flowing to the top protocols. Based on DeFiLlama data, the Ethereum chain now locks around $57B in total value, with $125.67M in stablecoins. However, DeFi protocols are dominated by the three big sources of ETH passive income. LidoDAO holds over $20B, while Aave returned above $19B TVL. EigenLayer holds over $10B in ETH. The other DeFi protocols holding over $5B in value include Ethena, Ether.Fi and Spark. Lending remains near its peak, leading to whale accumulation and deposits into major protocols. ETH accumulation also follows the recent Pectra upgrade , as whales prepared for running the new larger nodes requiring 2,048 ETH. At the current price range, DeFi remains relatively safe from liquidations. Whales have rebuild lending positions with a high accumulation of liquidable loans at around $1,600, and another significant accumulation just above $1,000. For ETH, the current price action suggests more dips are possible, with most of the liquidable long positions at around $2,100. Liquidating short positions could bring ETH back above $2,300. For now, the overwhelming attitude for ETH is bearish, though still allowing for the occasional whale accumulation.

Speaking with Bitcoin Podcast host Stephan Livera at the BTC Prague conference, Back noted that the firm has rapidly doubled the amount of Bitcoin per share, reducing risk for investors. “In the case of MicroStrategy, we see that duration being 16 to 18 months. The stock has traded at twice its net asset value (NAV) at times. In that context, the premium seems reasonable,” Back said. According to Back, the premium in the stock prices of companies holding Bitcoin treasury is not theoretical, but a natural result shaped by market conditions. He pointed out that companies' issuance of new shares at this premium and the purchase of Bitcoin increases the amount of BTC per share. “These companies buy more Bitcoin thanks to the premium, thus increasing the amount of Bitcoin falling to shareholders,” he said. Describing MicroStrategy’s strategy as “an arbitrage between the fiat world and the future of Bitcoin,” Back stated that this method does not put investors at risk in the long run because the company compensates for this premium with Bitcoin. Related News: Watch Out: In the Middle of a Busy Week, There Are Lots of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List However, Back noted that smaller companies trading at a higher premium pose a greater risk of volatility. Giving the example of MetaPlanet, Back said the company’s NAV multiple fluctuates between 5 and 10, which can stress investors. However, he emphasized that such companies can be more agile in accumulating Bitcoin due to their smaller size. He added that being located in regulatory advantageous regions such as Japan can also facilitate this process. Back, who also opposed Bitcoin's “diminishing returns” theory in his speech, drew attention to the anomalies experienced in previous cycles. Arguing that factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, China's mining ban and money supply expansion overshadowed the 2020-2021 cycle, Back said that historical data could be misleading for this reason. Stating that there could be an “S-curve”-like acceleration in Bitcoin adoption, Back suggested that this cycle could trigger widespread adoption, unlike in the past, and break previous patterns. Back, who also spoke about Blockstream’s new initiatives in the last part of the conference, explained that with the company’s new application, users will be able to buy Bitcoin directly to their own wallets. He also stated that they are trying to make self-storage more accessible with Jade and Jade Plus hardware wallets. “Self-custody is critical to the decentralization of the Bitcoin network. People holding their own keys is crucial to the security and control of the network,” Back said. *This is not investment advice.

Monthly volumes have surged from under $100 million in early 2023 to over $3 billion by 2025, representing a 30-fold increase in just two years. The study, drawing on data from 20 leading fintech companies including Reap , offers the most comprehensive insight to date into the global adoption of stablecoins for cross-border payments. Reap , Asia’s leading stablecoin-enabled financial technology provider, is proud to have contributed transaction-level insights for the B2B segment, one of the fastest-growing use cases for stablecoins. Reap observed a significant acceleration in stablecoin-funded card transactions during the latter half of 2024. This surge indicates that stablecoins have expanded their use case beyond the crypto ecosystem. “Stablecoins are no longer limited to the Web3 space, they’re becoming a credible alternative for global business finance,” said Daren Guo, Co-Founder of Reap. “We’re proud to contribute real-world transaction data to this pivotal report. From remittances across Asia to cross-border payments in Mexico, stablecoins are enabling faster, more efficient global flows and Reap is building the frictionless, stablecoin-enabled infrastructure to support them.” The report also identifies key geographic corridors driving stablecoin flows. The most active transactions originate from the USA, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Japan, and the UK. Notably, the Singapore-China corridor stands out as the most active route for stablecoin flows. Both Hong Kong SAR and Singapore frequently feature in these transactions, underscoring their significance as regional financial hubs. “As an early Venmo engineer who wrestled with mountains of payment code, seeing money transfer simplified to just a few lines with stablecoins is revolutionary. My years in fintech and crypto have convinced me: stablecoins are the future of payments, and Reap is leading this transformation by leaps and bounds.” Anthony Yim, Co-founder of Artemis. Reap’s regional growth closely mirrors the global trends outlined in the Artemis report. The company’s growing footprint across Asia and beyond reflects strong demand for stablecoin infrastructure in high-volume corridors. This alignment further validates the growth potential of stablecoins transactions within the markets Reap operates in. Download Stablecoin Payments from the Ground Up here .

46607116,https://invezz.com/?p=2773444,1750670450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,These 4 meme coins will outperform BTC once Fed starts cutting rates,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/23/these-4-meme-coins-will-outperform-btc-once-fed-starts-cutting-rates/,"If the Federal Reserve slows rate hikes and finally signals cuts, the crypto market could erupt—and meme coins might be leading the charge. Bitcoin is a slow-moving mothership. It moves billions, but the real fireworks often come from the meme coin trenches when markets shift to a risk-on stance. These tokens have rabid fan bases, cult-like communities, and social media buzz strong enough to move markets. And with the Fed hinting at a potential pivot, meme coins are entering full pre-pump mode. Here are four meme coins perfectly positioned to outrun Bitcoin in a rate-cut rally—and they’re not waiting around for the party to start. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A meme chain built to moon Stage 3 of its presale is live, and at just $0.0012 per token, it’s setting the pace for 2025’s biggest meme-driven breakout. This isn’t your typical frog-themed gamble. LILPEPE is launching its own dedicated Layer-2 blockchain, explicitly built for memes. It features anti-bot technology, ultra-low fees, and a launchpad allowing communities to create meme tokens in minutes. It’s like PEPE but with infrastructure. Presale momentum is electric. Over $1.4 million has been raised already in Stage 3, with 1.3 billion tokens sold in under 24 hours. And if that wasn’t enough, the team has just announced a jaw-dropping $777,000 giveaway, with 10 lucky winners each receiving $ 77,000 in $LILPEPE . You must complete a few social tasks and earn big while you share the word. With a starting price under a penny, upcoming exchange listings, and a real Layer-2 chain in the works, LILPEPE could dwarf Bitcoin’s upside in the short term. If BTC pulls a 2x on rate cuts, LILPEPE could pull a 200x. BONK: Solana’s wildcard with real volume What makes BONK special is its community. The project sits squarely inside Solana’s ecosystem, buzzing on Twitter and Discord, and already plays nice with Solana NFTs and DeFi. Its branding is sharp, the memes hit hard, and the growing social hype isn’t just smoke. OKX even praised Bonk’s “creative energy and active user base” as key drivers of growth. BONK still trades under a penny, but analysts are targeting late 2025 levels near $0.0000288, which represents a nearly 2x increase from current levels. If the Fed loosens up and the market swings to a risk-on stance, BONK could ride Solana’s wave straight to new highs. Think of it as Dogecoin’s younger, faster cousin—and one with way more left in the tank. FLOKI Inu: The veteran with the Viking Army Currently, FLOKI boasts a $730 million market capitalization and a daily trading volume of $37 million. However, what truly sets it apart is the ecosystem it’s built: a play-to-earn game (Valhalla), a DeFi suite (FlokiFi), a merchandise and NFT marketplace, and even a crypto education platform. The community has helped push FLOKI to multiple all-time highs, and with 20% of the supply staked, the loyalty runs deep. Stakers are even earning up to 20% APY—try getting that from your bank if the Fed cuts rates. Speculators believe FLOKI could easily double or triple from current levels in a bull run, and with Elon’s dog as its namesake, the meme fuel is limitless. FARTCOIN: The wildcard going full gas Born on Solana, driven by humor, and fueled by viral AI backstories, this coin exploded in late 2024 with a 370% pump from its lows—and it hasn’t slowed down since. And when word dropped that Coinbase might list FARTCOIN, the price rocketed past $1, pushing the market cap over $1 billion. FARTCOIN now has a passionate base, real volume, and the kind of chart setup meme traders live for (rounded bottom, clean breakout, and loads of liquidity). In a meme-fueled bull run, this could be 2025’s most ridiculous—and most profitable—ride. Final thought: Meme coins were built for Fed pivots Bitcoin might be the store of value, but meme coins are the store of velocity. If the Fed starts cutting rates, expect retail to go wild—and these four tokens are sitting at the intersection of utility, narrative, and sheer meme magic. If you’re waiting for a signal, this is it. LILPEPE, BONK, FLOKI, and FARTCOIN are warming up for liftoff.

Skeptical traders are dismantling the project’s pitch—calling out its anonymity, over-marketed presale mechanics, and lack of working products. For every glowing thread praising Ruvi AI’s “potential,” there’s a growing pile of posts warning it's a familiar setup: all hype, no proof. The project boasts big presale returns and a sleek whitepaper filled with buzzwords like “AI multi-tool,” “decentralized governance,” and “community-led growth.” But what Redditors are seeing behind the curtain doesn’t add up. There's no visible team, no GitHub code commits, and no evidence that the promised tech even exists beyond mockups and vague timelines. Investors are being asked to buy in early, without an audit report in hand or clarity around how their funds are being used. This article dives into the growing rift between perception and reality—from Ruvi’s risky tokenomics and delayed audit to its missing leadership—and shows why many in the crypto community are now looking toward safer, fully-audited projects like XYZVerse as a more transparent alternative. Ruvi AI’s Presale Hype Faces Harsh Reality Check Amid mounting optimism surrounding Ruvi AI’s presale and blockchain‑AI ambitions, a wave of skepticism is emerging on Reddit, particularly in r/CryptoScams. Users warn the project bears classic scam signals: anonymity, aggressive marketing, and questionable withdrawal mechanics. One Redditor bluntly wrote: Source: www.reddit.com Despite Ruvi AI’s marketing claims—highlighting community‑driven development and advanced tools—Reddit users remain unimpressed. One warned: Source: www.reddit.com These critiques highlight persistent concerns: No clear team or credentials – Users note the project’s leadership remains opaque. Hard‑sell tactics via WhatsApp/ads – Many view inbound WhatsApp messages and social ads as red flags. Withdrawal “fees” or “taxes” to unlock funds – Often seen among exit‑scam models to prevent cash‑outs. Tokenomics: Too Good to Be True? Ruvi AI’s tokenomics center around a fixed total supply of 5 billion $RUVI tokens, with 30% allocated to a multi-phase presale. The presale tiers feature aggressive bonuses — with big buyers receiving up to a 100% match and guaranteed post-sale price jumps from $0.015 to $0.07, suggesting a 366% instant upside. Beyond the presale, 25% of tokens are earmarked for user rewards, 15% for treasury, another 15% for partnerships and growth, and 10% dedicated to liquidity. The roadmap also promises staking perks and a decentralized governance model. On paper, it feels engineered for early investor gratification. However, the lack of any vesting for presale tokens raises immediate concerns. Early buyers get full control from day one — a mechanism that could invite instant sell-offs and volatility. A detailed critique from r/TheHolyCoins found the whitepaper “heavy on marketing polish” but light on fundamental safeguards like vested token release, raising suspicion that rapid gain structures may outpace genuine utility. Audit in Progress — But Delayed Amid mounting optimism from presale profits, Ruvi AI has reportedly secured a smart contract audit from well-regarded firm Cyberscope. The initial announcement says the audit is underway, aiming to bolster credibility and ensure contract safety. Still, the delay of the formal report until after the presale is a red flag: investors are asked to commit funds before any third-party validation occurs. Some promotional articles tout the Cyberscope audit as already “boosting credibility,” but those appeared before any independent audit report was published, raising the question: is Ruvi marketing its own press release as validation? Until the audit is fully released and independently verified, assurance remains theoretical at best. Why XYZVerse Feels Safer and More Transparent Than Ruvi AI In the crowded and often chaotic world of crypto presales, XYZVerse stands out as a rare example of a project actually delivering transparency, security, and real utility—qualities that Ruvi AI, despite its aggressive marketing and high presale numbers, still struggles to convincingly demonstrate. At the heart of this contrast is trust. XYZVerse has completed full KYC verification and undergone comprehensive smart contract audits by top-tier firms like SolidProof and Pessimistic—resulting in clean audit reports that explicitly confirm both the absence of critical vulnerabilities and the authenticity of the team behind the project. Ruvi AI, by comparison, has announced an audit from Cyberscope, a respectable blockchain security firm, but the full report remains pending until after presale completion. While this announcement marks progress, relying solely on a forthcoming report is a far cry from the documented assurance and immediate transparency that audit reports bring. Real-World Utility vs. Vaporware Utility is XYZVerse 's next trump card. It already powers a live, on-chain sportsbook (bookmaker.XYZ) that has processed over $100 million in bets and serves more than 20,000 active users—a concrete, working product. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is still operating in anticipation mode: there are no live decentralized applications, no beta testing, and no functional product visible beyond marketing materials and roadmap promises. Tokenomics: Structured vs. Suspicious When it comes to tokenomics, XYZVerse again shows greater discipline. Its total supply of 100 billion tokens is clearly allocated: 17.9% presale, 17.1% reserved for burns, 15% for liquidity and exchange listings, 10% for the team and development, and 10% dedicated to staking and ecosystem growth. Each allocation is tied to specific wallet addresses—transparent, on-chain, and verifiable. Ruvi AI, by contrast, has revealed only its total supply of 5 billion tokens with 30% reserved for presale, but offers no public supply breakdown, no vesting schedules, and no clarity on how presale funds are channelled. Fundraising transparency further differentiates the two. XYZVerse has publicly documented over $14 million raised in a multi-stage presale, complete with dashboard-tracked price tiers and verifiable transactions. Ruvi AI’s $1.6–1.8 million presale is impressive in headline terms, but lacks proof: no on-chain receipts, no wallet records, and no third-party validation to substantiate the claimed figures . Finally, the roadmap narrative is telling. XYZVerse marches toward a Token Generation Event (TGE) in the second half of 2025 and planned exchange listings at approximately $0.10 per token—with each milestone carefully laid out and progress regularly tracked. Ruvi AI’s roadmap, by contrast, has already seen major elements—like token release schedules and team visibility—pushed back or quietly removed without any accountability or updated timelines. Verdict: XYZVerse Sets the Standard, Ruvi AI Fails to Meet It While Ruvi AI continues to draw attention through aggressive marketing, its lack of team transparency, absence of a working product, delayed audit, and unverifiable fundraising leave investors with more questions than answers. In contrast, XYZVerse offers a model of presale accountability—featuring a fully KYC-verified team, independent audits from SolidProof and Pessimistic, on-chain sportsbook utility already live, and publicly traceable token allocations. It has raised over $14 million through a documented, milestone-driven process and continues to build with transparency at every level. Until Ruvi AI matches that level of visibility and delivery, it remains speculative at best—and a cautionary example of why serious investors are turning to projects like XYZVerse.

The crypto community on Reddit has voiced significant concerns, suggesting that the project might be more about speculative hype than genuine technological advancement. The Concerns Raised by the Crypto Community Reddit forums, particularly those dedicated to uncovering scams, have been vocal about Ruvi AI's approach, which includes aggressive marketing and a lack of transparency about the team and technology behind it. The absence of verifiable information has led many to question whether the project is trustworthy. Source: www.reddit.com Marketing vs. Material: Scrutinizing Ruvi AI's Claims Ruvi AI's marketing materials boast of a revolutionary blockchain-AI fusion, promising significant returns and technological breakthroughs. However, deeper inspection reveals numerous red flags: No transparent team disclosure. Over-reliance on buzzwords and conceptual promises without tangible output. Funding use remains unclear, with no audit reports or financial transparency. Source: www.reddit.com Comparative Analysis: XYZVerse's Approach to Transparency and Security Contrasting sharply with Ruvi AI, XYZVerse highlights how trust and reliability are built in the crypto space. With fully disclosed audits and a clear, KYC-verified team, XYZVerse showcases a commitment to transparency that Ruvi AI currently lacks. XYZVerse not only has a comprehensive audit trail but also offers immediate, tangible products to its users, marking a significant difference from Ruvi AI's yet-to-materialize promises. Tokenomics and Project Viability While Ruvi AI presents a tempting tokenomics model, it's important to critically assess the sustainability and real-world utility of such models. XYZVerse provides a more structured and feasible economic framework, with clear allocations and planned use of funds that enhance project viability and investor confidence. Conclusion: Navigating Hype vs. Substance in Crypto Investments The contrast between Ruvi AI and XYZVerse serves as a powerful example for investors in the crypto space. While flashy marketing and lofty promises can attract initial attention, the longevity and success of blockchain projects rely heavily on transparency, verified technology, and a responsible approach to user engagement and financial management.

46605620,https://finbold.com/?p=247595,1750670535,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,R. Kiyosaki warns of ‘global monetary collapse’,https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-warns-of-global-monetary-collapse/,"Robert Kiyosaki , the outspoken author of Rich Dad Poor Dad and longtime critic of fiat monetary systems, has reignited debate over the future of global finance with a bold new warning issued via X on June 23. Labeling the current environment as the “biggest debt bubble in history,” Kiyosaki cautioned that a global monetary collapse may be on the near horizon, and that only those holding tangible, hard assets will avoid being caught flat-footed. “GLOBAL MONETARY COLLAPSE COMING?” he wrote. “Will you be richer or poorer when the biggest debt bubble in history bursts? I recommend owning gold, silver, and BITCOIN… Biggest losers will be savers of fake fiat money and especially bonds.” While Kiyosaki has long been critical of fiat currency debasement and central bank interventionism, this most recent statement signals a sharpening of tone. Rather than positioning collapse as a long-tail risk, he now frames it as an imminent systemic event, raising the stakes for passive investors still parked in government paper or low-yielding cash. Gold and Bitcoin on hold, Silver takes center stage In a follow-up post later that day, Kiyosaki clarified his tactical allocation: “Silver is the best investment today… June 2025. Gold and Bitcoin are high and I am waiting for a correction before adding more.” FYI: Silver is the best investment today….june 2025. Gold and Bitcoin are high and I am waiting for gold and Bitcoin to crash before I add to my position. That’s what I think. Do your own research. Take care. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 This shift is notable. While Kiyosaki remains structurally bullish on both gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ), his current focus on silver suggests a conviction that the market is underpricing its monetary and industrial role. Silver remains significantly below its inflation-adjusted high of $50, and despite strong fundamentals, including tightening supply and surging demand for industrial applications, it continues to trade with elevated volatility and low institutional positioning.

33767162,[object Object],1750670761,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Recovers from Dip Under $100K After US Attack on Iran – Why BTC Bull Token Could Explode Next,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-remains-strong-as-btc-bull-token-soars/,"Bitcoin ($BTC) bounced back to $101K late Sunday, shaking off losses incurred after US and Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites early that morning. Amid the chaos, BitMEX’s Arther Hayes predicted that $BTC will rebound thanks to ‘its safe haven status.’ As $BTC looks to strengthen its position as a store of value, now could be a prime time to eye BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , one of the best long-term crypto to hold . $BTCBULL will distribute free $BTC when the #1 crypto reaches key targets. As such, you can capitalize on the success of the world’s largest crypto, now worth ~$102K , for less than a cent. $BTC Survives Geopolitical Shock, Holds Key Support Levels Over the weekend, $BTC briefly dipped below $98.5K following US and Israeli airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Dubbed ‘Operation Midnight Hammer,’ the strikes targeted key sites in Iran’s nuclear infrastructure – Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan – using more than 125 warplanes and bunker-buster munitions. The shockwaves rippled through the crypto market. Yesterday, $ETH plunged ~10% , and assets like $SOL, $XRP, and $DOGE fell to multi-month lows. $BTC, however, rebounded quickly. After dropping from a ~$103K high to a ~$98K low, it has since stabilized at ~$102K. Ahead of Bitcoin’s rebound, Hayes suggested that further money printing will prompt investors to turn to $BTC to protect against inflation. Additionally, 0x Research’s Markus Thielen said that as long as $BTC remains above the short-term realized price of $98K and the $100K trend support, ‘ traders can continue to look for tactical rally opportunities .’ Crypto trader DonAlt also noted that $BTC is mimicking gold’s 2024 breakout , consolidating below key resistance before a potential surge. If history repeats itself, it could be on the verge of a major move. As $BTC strengthens its position as digital gold, $BTCBULL offers a way to tap into the OG coin’s upside every time it climbs. $BTCBULL Raises $7.3M+ Ahead of Handing Out $BTC $BTCBULL is gaining significant traction, having already snagged over $7.3M on presale. It’s attracting hype over the real $BTC airdrops it offers when the crypto leader hits major milestones: $150K and $200K. Plus, when $BTC hits $250K, holders can claim a share of a massive 2.1B $BTCBULL airdrop. Since Hayes predicts $BTC could hit $250K by this year’s end, these rewards might be just around the corner. To qualify for the airdrops, you only need to hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet , a top non-custodial crypto wallet . To enjoy lower fees while using the wallet, purchase a bit of $BEST , its native token. To earn more passive income, you can stake $BTCBULL at a commendable 56% APY. $BTCBULL also has planned deflationary token burns at $125K, $175K, and $225K, aiming to reduce supply and potentially boost its value. With whales dropping $31.9K , $20K , and $14.3K into the presale recently, major industry players clearly see $BTCBULL as having serious upside potential. Win Free $BTC as It Solidifies Its Role as a Safe-Haven Asset $BTC’s swift recovery after a significant black swan event shows how resilient it is as a safe-haven asset. With Hayes, Thielen, and DonAlt all pointing to bullish $BTC signals, market momentum is building. If their predictions hold, the next big breakout could be moments away. As such, there’s no better time to grab some $BTCBULL and earn free $BTC when it hits new highs. You can buy $BTCBULL on presale for just $0.002575. If market conditions remain favorable, it could reach $0.06467 by year’s end , marking an ROI of 2,411%. This isn’t financial advice.

Changpeng Zhao (CZ) took to X to raise the alarm after CoinTelegraph and CoinMarketCap (CMC) were both hit by hackers. His message is simple: be careful with WalletConnect and think twice before trusting even familiar sites. Read on to know more. CMC and CoinTelegraph Compromised The warning follows a pair of security breaches that hit the crypto world hard. On June 21, the crypto security tracker @realScamSniffer reported that CoinTelegraph’s frontend had been compromised, with malicious code found in its ad system. CZ quickly responded, linking this to an earlier attack on CoinMarketCap which, importantly, is owned by Binance. “2 days ago CMC, now CT. Hackers are targeting information web sites now. Be careful when authorizing wallet connect,” CZ posted. According to his post, the CMC hack led to 39 victims and a total loss of $18,570. He also confirmed that CoinMarketCap will cover all losses. That’s a small sum by crypto standards, but the method of attack, targeting trusted info sources, is what really matters here. It’s not just wallets and exchanges anymore. Even crypto media isn’t safe. 2 days ago CMC, now CT. Hackers are targeting information web sites now. Be careful when authorizing wallet connect. For CMC, based on initial on-chain analysis, there are 39 victims with a combined loss of $18,570. @CoinMarketCap will cover all losses. https://t.co/egkekyjAYQ — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 23, 2025 CZ: “Everything Before an ATH Is a Dip” In a separate tweet, CZ turned to the market – offering a subtle take on where things might be headed next. He didn’t mention Bitcoin directly, but the message was clear: “Everything before a new all-time high is a dip.” That may sound bullish, but CZ added a catch. He said only a small number of strong coins are likely to reach new ATHs. His advice is to look for projects with long-term staying power and real growth potential. For context, Bitcoin’s last ATH was on May 22, when it hit $111,970. CZ Reacts to Elon’s Bold AI Plan CZ also weighed in on another big tech headline. Elon Musk’s announcement about the next version of Grok, his AI chatbot. Musk says Grok will try to rewrite all of human knowledge, correcting errors and adding what’s missing before retraining on the new data. CZ responded, “I look forward [to seeing] how this initiative will play out,” and noted that it’s a “highly debated issue.” He didn’t say more, but the tone suggests he’s watching closely and maybe a bit skeptical. All in All When CZ speaks up – especially on scams, market trends, or major tech moves – it’s worth paying attention. This time, his message is loud and clear: double check what you click, think long-term, and don’t blindly trust the platforms you’ve always used. The game is changing, and the risks are evolving.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-23 09:26:19

With this in mind, traders can look to the week's major events that could affect markets. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress is likely to be the main event. Powell will probably be grilled by Republican party members for not cutting interest rates and ""costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars,"" as President Donald Trump has repeatedly said in his Truth Social posts. Powell, however, is expected to reiterate the Fed's independence and the data-dependent path forward for rates. Traders will closely watch Powell's take on the interest-rate trajectory, given the backdrop of Trump-appointed Fed Governor Christopher Waller's recent comments that interest rates could be reduced in July. ""With the market's pricing of future inflation well anchored, early cracks emerging in the labor market and housing activity evidently weak, there are reasons for the Fed to consider adopting a dovish shift in the July FOMC meeting and guiding towards a cut in September — a path already priced into the U.S. swaps market,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said on X . Dovish hints could prompt more risk-taking in financial markets, boding well for BTC, which has held mainly above $100,000 throughout the recent escalation of conflict in the Middle East. Markets expect the Fed to deliver two 25 basis-point cuts this year, but the take is not unanimous/ ""We continue to think that clarity on the inflation story — whether tariffs are a one-off price shock or if they prompt more sustained inflation pressures — may not come before the December FOMC meeting, meaning we will see just one rate cut this year,"" analysts at ING said in a note to clients Friday. ""However, if the jobs market continues to weaken, that may well be a 50bp cut."" Core PCE On the data front, the core personal-consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, scheduled for release on Friday, is the marquee release. According to Pepperstone, the consensus is for the data to show a 0.1% month-on-month increase in May, resulting in an annualized growth rate of 2.6% and a three-month annualized rate of 1.6%. Expectations of a benign 0.1% increase support the Fed rate cut bets; however, according to ING, the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs is expected to kick in from July. Trump's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, announced in early April, is set to expire on July 9, following which the heavy 'Liberation Day' tariffs take effect. So far, the president has made a deal with the U.K. and announced a trade framework with China. Beijing is yet to sign the deal and the European Union remains quiet. Iran tensions are not over yet While the oil market is calm for now, Iran could inflict damage even without closing the Strait of Hormuz, a trade route that carries about a fifth of the world's oil. By constantly threatening the closure of the strait alone, Iran could push up shipping insurance costs, ultimately adding to oil prices. The cost to insure a vessel for the journey via the Strait of Hormuz has already risen from 20 cents a barrel to 80, a report by South China Morning Post said, quoting the Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers. ""By planting enough belief that they could disrupt this key logistical channel, maritime costs could rise to the point that it would have a significant impact on the supply of crude and gas,"" Weston noted.",Markets|Bitcoin|Powell|Markets|Inflation|US|Economy|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-23 09:28:45

Many of its critics called it an experiment that would fail. Those critical voices were vindicated when the FTX exchange shut down. It seemed like SOL was now a loss. However, what saved Solana (SOL) was that it was built on utility and practical solutions. Over time, it continued to rise and shot past $100. Since then, it has continued to grow, and in January 2025, it reached a new all-time high of $294. The gains of Solana (SOL) prove that utility always wins in the end. It is the reason why investors are looking at projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which are built on utility. The main difference between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Solana (SOL) is that MUTM tokens are still at their bargain-basement price. Investors are rushing to secure their tokens, expecting explosive growth that is driven by pure utility. If you are looking for your biggest score in the crypto world, MUTM tokens should be your go-to purchase. A Deep Dive into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project was conceived as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders on the protocol provide utility, while borrowers join pools to take loans. The interest rate in the pools is decided by market forces of demand and supply. As more borrowers join a pool and use up more assets relative to the total value of assets in the pool, the interest rate rises. A rising interest rate causes borrowers to repay loans, while also pushing more lenders to deposit liquidity in a pool. Consequently, the interest goes down. This self-sustaining loop ensures that the ecosystem achieves optimal capital efficiency. To protect the liquidity of the pools, all loans must be overcollateralized. That simply means that borrowers deposit assets of a higher value than the loans they take. The exact levels of collateralization are decided by protocol parameters. These parameters include the liquidation threshold and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Unstable assets like meme coins will usually get more conservative parameters. That ensures that there is enough of a buffer for liquidators to act in time and purchase the debt at a discount. To ensure that liquidators act as fast as possible, the incentive they receive will be variable. It can be adjusted upward as needed. The protocol will also use a reserve factor. This is where a portion of the interest paid by borrowers goes into a common pool. The reserve factor can be set as high as 35% for unstable assets, and as low as 10% for more stable assets. Funds in this reserve factor will be used to stabilize the ecosystem during periods of heightened market volatility. To ensure the long-term survival of the ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to engage in liquidity mining. This is a process where they offer rewards to liquidity providers. One of the immediate impacts of that program is that it will lower borrowing costs, helping to improve protocol participation. Additionally, they plan to implement a buyback-and-distribute program. In this program, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will purchase MUTM tokens off the open market. These purchases will help boost the price of MUTM tokens, helping to boost the project’s profile and boosting user participation. To have the most impact, these purchases will be limited to high-value assets that are in high demand. Low-value assets will not be added to the liquidity mining program due to their outsized impact on the stability of the ecosystem. The MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a massive success so far. It has raised around $10.95 million from around 12,350 unique investors. So far, about 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have been sold, barely two weeks after they went on sale. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03 each, a massive 50% discount to the listing price of $0.06. The token price is set to go up by 16.67% in the upcoming phase to $0.035 per token. One of the main reasons for the current pace of the presale is the planned beta version launch. This launch, which will occur on the token listing day, is expected to cause a flurry of new buying activity for MUTM tokens. As word spreads on the capabilities of the platform, it will interest buyers who were previously on the sidelines. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is The Future Like SOL, which has risen from less than $10 to over $290 at one point, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents the future of growth. Its utility-based design ensures these gains will be long-term and sustainable. At a 50% discount, this is the perfect opportunity for you to secure your crypto portfolio.

Only cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals are likely to reach new price peaks. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 37 signals cautious investor sentiment amid market volatility. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has described the current phase of the crypto market as a temporary dip preceding a new all-time high (ATH). His comments provide a long-term bullish perspective during a period of widespread investor caution, as reflected by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. In a recent post on the social media platform X, Zhao noted that any market movement before the next ATH should be viewed as a temporary decline. He emphasized that only a small number of cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals are likely to reach new highs. The obvious question is, will there be a next ATH? Only a small number of strong coins will do that. Look for long term staying power and growth potential. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 23, 2025 Related: Why Is The Crypto Market Going Down Today?

This move has sparked questions about the status of the high-profile partnership and the ambitious plans for new hardware. What Triggered the Removal of OpenAI Deal Promotions? The immediate cause for OpenAI pulling these materials appears to be a legal challenge. According to reports, the removal stems from a Trademark lawsuit filed by another company, IYO, which also operates in the AI device space. The lawsuit centers on the name ‘io’, which was apparently being used by the venture involving OpenAI and Jony Ive . A judge has reportedly issued a restraining order specifically targeting the use of this name in promotional materials, leading to their swift withdrawal from OpenAI’s website and YouTube channels. This situation highlights a growing challenge in the rapidly expanding AI sector: the crowded landscape of names and intellectual property. As more startups enter the fray, conflicts over branding and trademarks are becoming increasingly common. Is the Jony Ive Partnership and OpenAI Deal Still On Track? Despite the removal of promotional content, sources close to the matter suggest the underlying OpenAI deal with Jony Ive and the device venture remains active. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the partnership is ‘on track and has NOT dissolved or anything of the sort.’ This indicates that while the specific ‘io’ branding is facing legal hurdles, the core collaboration between Sam Altman’s OpenAI and Jony Ive’s design firm is intended to continue. The partnership between OpenAI and Jony Ive , announced with considerable fanfare, aims to bring Ive’s renowned design philosophy to the world of artificial intelligence hardware. The vision is reportedly to create consumer devices that offer novel ways for people to interact with AI, moving beyond traditional screens and interfaces. This legal snag, while potentially delaying promotional efforts, doesn’t necessarily signal the end of this ambitious project. Understanding the Trademark Lawsuit by IYO The Trademark lawsuit brought by IYO against OpenAI and its venture focuses on potential consumer confusion. IYO, an existing player in the AI device market, argues that the use of the ‘io’ name by the OpenAI/Ive venture is too similar to their own branding, potentially misleading customers about the origin or affiliation of the products. A report in Bloomberg Law indicated that the judge presiding over the case was receptive to IYO’s argument that OpenAI’s promotional video might already be causing this confusion. Key aspects of the lawsuit include: Plaintiff: IYO, an existing AI device maker. Defendants: OpenAI and the venture involving Jony Ive. Core Issue: Trademark infringement based on the name ‘io’. Legal Action: Request for a restraining order to prevent the use of the disputed name in promotions. Judge’s Stance: Indicated openness to the argument of consumer confusion based on existing promotional material. This legal challenge underscores the importance of thorough trademark searches and clearance in the early stages of launching new products or ventures, especially in crowded and rapidly evolving markets like AI hardware. Why is an OpenAI AI Device Significant? OpenAI’s potential foray into physical hardware with an AI device represents a strategic shift for the company, moving beyond its software and API offerings. Partnering with a design luminary like Jony Ive signals a serious intent to create consumer products that are not only technologically advanced but also intuitively designed and aesthetically appealing. The significance lies in several areas: New Interaction Paradigms: An OpenAI device could explore innovative ways users interact with AI, perhaps through voice, gesture, or other non-traditional interfaces, making AI more accessible and integrated into daily life. Hardware-Software Synergy: Bringing hardware and software development under one roof (or a close partnership) can lead to optimized performance and unique features not possible with software alone. Market Expansion: Entering the consumer hardware market opens up new revenue streams and allows OpenAI to compete in a different arena than its current enterprise and developer-focused models. Setting Design Standards: With Jony Ive’s involvement, the device could set new design benchmarks for the nascent AI hardware category. For the cryptocurrency and broader tech community, this move is interesting as it shows how core AI technology is expected to manifest in tangible products, potentially creating new ecosystems where digital assets or decentralized technologies could play a role in the future. Challenges and Opportunities in the AI Device Space While the prospect of an OpenAI AI device is exciting, the path is fraught with challenges. The current Trademark lawsuit is a prime example of the legal hurdles involved. Other challenges include: Hardware Development: Designing, manufacturing, and distributing hardware is complex, costly, and requires different expertise than software development. Market Competition: The AI device market, while young, is attracting significant interest from tech giants and startups alike. User Adoption: Convincing consumers to adopt new types of devices requires demonstrating clear value and ease of use. Privacy and Security: AI devices handling personal data raise significant privacy and security concerns that must be addressed rigorously. However, the opportunities are substantial. A successful AI device could tap into a massive potential market, redefine human-computer interaction, and solidify OpenAI’s position as a leader not just in AI models but also in their practical application in daily life. The involvement of Jony Ive specifically addresses the critical challenge of design and user experience, which is often a weak point for technology-first companies. Actionable Insights from the OpenAI Trademark Lawsuit For founders, investors, and observers in the tech and AI space, the situation offers several insights: Prioritize Legal Due Diligence: This case is a stark reminder that trademark and intellectual property checks are crucial early in the startup process, especially when choosing a name. Understand Market Crowding: The AI sector is booming, leading to potential name conflicts. Be prepared for potential legal challenges related to branding. Partnerships Add Complexity: High-profile partnerships like the OpenAI deal with Jony Ive bring significant attention, which can also magnify legal issues when they arise. Hardware is Hard: Moving into physical products involves manufacturing, supply chain, and new legal risks (like hardware-specific IP) distinct from software. Market Sentiment vs. Reality: The initial panic around the pulled videos contrasted with reports that the deal is still on track highlights the need to look beyond initial headlines and seek confirmation from reliable sources. While this specific legal issue pertains to a name, it serves as a cautionary tale about the complexities involved in bringing ambitious AI projects, particularly those involving hardware, to market. What’s Next for the OpenAI and Jony Ive Collaboration? With the Trademark lawsuit ongoing and a restraining order in place regarding the ‘io’ name, the venture will likely need to rebrand its device or project. This requires time, effort, and potentially new marketing materials. The focus will now shift to how quickly they can resolve the legal issue or pivot to a new name, and whether this setback impacts the planned timeline for the development and launch of their AI device . The partnership between OpenAI and Jony Ive remains a fascinating development to watch. It combines cutting-edge AI research with world-class design expertise, holding the potential to create truly innovative products. Navigating this legal challenge successfully will be a key test for the collaboration. Concluding Thoughts: A Minor Setback or a Sign of Deeper Issues? The removal of promotional materials due to a Trademark lawsuit is undoubtedly a setback for the OpenAI deal with Jony Ive and their planned AI device . It highlights the legal complexities inherent in a rapidly evolving market. However, if reports are accurate that the core partnership is intact, this may prove to be a temporary hurdle requiring a simple rebranding, rather than a fundamental issue with the collaboration or the product vision itself. The situation serves as a valuable case study on the intersection of innovation, high-profile partnerships, and the often-overlooked challenges of intellectual property in the tech industry.

Strategy’s founder and Bitcoin advocate, Michael Saylor, congratulated the move, replying to Cardone with, “Congratulations on acquiring 1000 BTC.” The American real estate mogul revealed that the $5B group currently had over 14.2K units to its name and was looking forward to adding 5K units this year, along with another purchase of about 3K BTC. The strategy combines cash-flowing real estate with Bitcoin’s long-term upside, creating a portfolio that Cardone described as “two best-in-class assets.” The Cardone Capital Group said it was ready to partner with Grant to invest in “cryptorized” real estate. Cardone Capital invests $15.6M in BTC to diversify beyond real estate On June 20th, the group revealed that it acquired 150 BTC worth around $15.6 million as part of its plan to diversify holdings beyond real estate. Grant had claimed almost a week earlier, on June 14th, that real estate market was broken and he was going to fix it using the real estate/BTC model. He said this as the group unveiled a $1.6 billion five-year dual-asset investment strategy that would increase Bitcoin investments and reduce focus on real estate. Grant further explained that this was the fifth fund this year, and the “Boca Deal” was almost filled. A summary infographic report showed that the group planned to reduce real estate allocations from 77% in year one to 45% in year five. It also showed that BTC allocations would increase from 33% to 66% within the same period. The data also revealed that the company had so far invested nearly $100 million in Bitcoin and over $1 billion in real estate, with plans to increase future investments by a minimum of $5 million. According to the Cardone Capital Group, its initial BTC position allocated $290 million to buy 2.914K BTC at an average price of $100K per BTC. The group claimed that additional BTC would be purchased using $140 million of monthly cash flow from real estate holdings within the next five years. The company added that it would invest in institutional-grade cold storage to ensure security and align its long-term BTC hold strategy with macro Bitcoin market cycles. Cardone joins a growing list of institutions adopting Bitcoin reserves A U.S. SEC filing earlier this month revealed that Hong Kong-based real estate and logistics company Reitar Logtech planned to purchase up to $1.5 billion in Bitcoin as part of its treasury diversification strategy. John Chan, Chairman and CEO of Reitar Logtech, said the treasury diversification initiative emphasized his company’s commitment to maintain a strong financial foundation while scaling its global logistics technology platform. DDC Enterprise also raised approximately $528 million to accelerate its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company’s founder, Chairwoman, and CEO, Norma Chu, said the funding was expected to propel DDC into one of the top global corporate Bitcoin holders. Prenetics also became the first healthcare firm to launch a Bitcoin treasury strategy with a $20 million BTC purchase. The company acquired 187.42 BTC at an average price of $106,712 and stated that its board had approved allocating the majority of its $117 million balance sheet to Bitcoin. Prenetics plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings through institutional capital partnerships and to implement advanced return strategies. It also plans to accept Bitcoin payments across its direct-to-consumer platforms, including IM8 Health and CircleDNA. Metaplanet , Strategy, Tesla, MARA, and others continued to acquire more BTC as two academic researchers, Murray Rudd and Dennis Porter, predicted that Bitcoin could soar to $4.3 million by 2036 if these institutional buying trends continued. Rudd and Porter employed pure mathematical modeling to analyze Bitcoin’s market dynamics.

Congratulations on acquiring 1000 BTC. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 21, 2025 Cardone Capital’s entry into Bitcoin comes as 132 publicly listed companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up from 89 in April. Their combined holdings exceed 800K BTC and are worth over $88 billion. The real estate titan’s decision to pursue 4,000 total Bitcoins represents over $400 million in digital asset exposure at current prices. Source: Cryptonews This institutional adoption wave has accelerated dramatically following Bitcoin’s rally to $111,965 in May, spurring companies across diverse industries to race for Bitcoin exposure while investor appetite remains strong. Institutional Bitcoin Buying Frenzy Reaches $1.5B Monthly Peak June 2025 has witnessed an extraordinary surge in corporate Bitcoin accumulation, with major institutional players deploying over $1.5 billion across multiple high-profile purchases. This represents the largest monthly corporate buying spree in Bitcoin’s history. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has emerged as the most aggressive buyer, adding 1,111 Bitcoin for $118.2 million just days ago , bringing their total holdings to 11,111 BTC valued at over $1.07 billion. The company’s ambitious 210,000 Bitcoin target by 2027 would represent approximately 1% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply, with CEO Simon Gerovich declaring this “Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy Bitcoin.” MicroStrategy continues leading the corporate adoption charge with multiple purchases throughout June, including 10,100 Bitcoin for $1.05 billion , bringing their total holdings to approximately 592,100 BTC worth over $60 billion. The company’s relentless accumulation strategy has inspired a global wave of imitators, with healthcare company Prenetics investing $20 million for 187.42 BTC , Norwegian firm K33 targeting 1,000 BTC through a $9 million share issue, and UK-listed Smarter Web Company adding 45.32 BTC to reach 168.08 total holdings. This buying wave is geographically diverse, spanning Japan’s capital markets to Europe’s regulated exchanges and North America’s public companies. Most notably, Metaplanet’s financing mechanisms include 555 million moving-strike warrants capable of raising $5.4 billion to facilitate massive Bitcoin accumulation strategies. The company’s quarter-to-date Bitcoin yield of 107.9% has attracted significant institutional attention, and its stock has surged over 408% year-to-date. Technical Analysis Reveals Critical Resistance Despite Institutional Support Despite the massive institutional buying pressure, Bitcoin’s technical structure reveals signs of weakness, suggesting the current rally may be losing momentum. Source: TehThomas on TradingView The hourly chart analysis shows Bitcoin experiencing a “fake-out” following an initial sweep higher that failed to sustain momentum. The asset is currently trading around $101,988 after breaking down from an ascending channel pattern. The breakdown of this technical structure occurred despite massive institutional capital injection, indicating that supply pressure from existing holders may be overwhelming the new institutional demand. The 15-minute timeframe provides even more granular evidence of supply-demand imbalance, with Bitcoin trapped within a distribution pattern where red supply zones are successfully containing rallies while demand zones around $98,500-99,500 represent the next major support confluence. The order flow data also reveals a telling pattern of aggressive selling activity at resistance levels above $100,800, with multiple red entries indicating that sellers are using any strength to distribute positions. This suggests that while institutional purchases provide temporary support, the prevailing market structure favors sellers capitalizing on institutional buying to exit positions. The detailed hourly analysis with order flow shows Bitcoin testing the critical $100,000 psychological barrier while facing resistance from the 65-period exponential moving average at $102,451 and the 200-period EMA at $104,109. The time and sales data reveal consistent selling pressure, with green buy entries quickly absorbed by red sell entries at higher price levels. This indicates that institutional buying may occur at technically disadvantageous levels. The combination of broken technical support around $103,000-104,000, bearish moving average configuration, and negative order flow dynamics suggests that Bitcoin could face continued downside pressure toward $98,000-99,000 despite the institutional capital injection.

A survey of 730 Gen Z and Millennial investors by financial advisory giant deVere Group found that 73% of respondents preferred Bitcoin. According to deVere CEO, Nigel Green, Bitcoin and gold are not rivals but “ radically different assets ” and solve different problems. “Gold is stability. Bitcoin is growth. If you want to build and protect wealth over the long term, you should be holding both.” The survey aligns with several other studies that imply a seismic shift from traditional investments toward Bitcoin’s dominance as a safe-haven asset. For instance, on-chain analytics company CryptoQuant revealed in January that over 60% of cryptocurrency investors are aged between 25 and 44 years old. “The momentum behind Bitcoin among younger investors is undeniable ,” says Green. “They see it as digital gold – borderless, accessible, and aligned with the future.” Bitcoin Enthusiasm is Growing Younger investors view Bitcoin as a “cornerstone of modern portfolios,” the survey noted . The younger cohort gets attracted to transparency, portability, and potential for exponential surge. Respondents also said that Bitcoin’s operation outside the traditional banking system is a notable advantage. “This generation is right to question the old models. But diversification is timeless,” said Green. Last week, the CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, Hunter Horsley, posted on X, comparing Bitcoin to US Treasuries, rather than gold. “I don’t think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being gold,” he wrote. “Rather, I think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being U.S. Treasuries and other governments’ bonds.” I don't think Bitcoin's competition is going to end up being gold.

He also stressed that Bitcoin is moving toward broader acceptance, particularly after spot ETFs and broader corporate adoption, adding legitimacy and fresh demand. “We’re living through a rare convergence,” Green added. “You have the old guard doubling down on gold, and the new guard surging into Bitcoin. Both are being driven by the same core fear: erosion of purchasing power.

In just two weeks, he lost over $35 million by trading Bitcoin. What’s surprising is that he was often right about market direction, but still walked away with huge losses. So, what exactly went wrong? And what can other traders learn from his mistakes? From $39M to $4M – The Shocking Slide It all began on June 8, when AguilaTrades created a new wallet and moved $39.18 million worth of USDC from Bybit to Hyperliquid, a trading platform used for perpetual BTC contracts. His strategy was bold: he went long on Bitcoin, betting that the price would keep rising. How did AguilaTrades( @AguilaTrades ) lose over $35M in just 2 weeks? 1/ Let's take a closer look at his trades — and see what lessons we can learn. https://t.co/LeSb2QO0PX pic.twitter.com/xt7nGnZJsu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 23, 2025 Initially, things looked good. On June 9, he opened a large long position on Bitcoin as the price started climbing. His unrealized profits soon reached a peak of $5.76 million. But instead of locking in those gains, he held on, waiting for more. That wait cost him dearly. Ignoring the Signs – And the Losses Pile Up As geopolitical tensions rose due to the Israel-Iran conflict , the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply. Aguila was forced to close his long position, this time with a $12.47 million loss. But he didn’t stop there. Just six days later, on June 15, he went long again. Once more, BTC climbed, and his gains hit $10 million. And once again, he didn’t sell. But, when the market turned, his profits vanished, and he walked away with another $2.95 million in losses. Then came June 20. Another long position. Another rally. Another chance to cash out, this time with $3.2 million in profits. But he didn’t take it. As Bitcoin dropped again , his losses deepened to a painful $17 million. Change in Strategy—But Too Late After three failed long trades, he finally flipped his strategy and went short, betting that Bitcoin would drop. Unfortunately, Bitcoin bounced, and his losses added another $2.33 million.

Key Takeaways: A new whale opened a $100M ETH long on Hyperliquid using 25x leverage. The position has $800K in unrealized gains but carries high risk due to full capital exposure and tight margin. Hyperliquid continues to attract bold traders like James Wynn. According to onchain data , the trader deposited 4.28 million USDC and immediately deployed the capital into a 25x leveraged long, amounting to 44,523 ETH. The entry price for the position was $2,247.22, with ETH currently trading around $2,266, resulting in unrealized gains of over $800,000. High-Stakes Ethereum Long Bet on Hyperliquid Faces Liquidation at $2,196 The high leverage bet comes with a liquidation level set at $2,196, a relatively narrow margin in current market conditions. The position appears under a cross-margin setting, allowing full capital exposure. The wallet shows no spot, vault, or staked assets beyond this single perpetual contract, underscoring the size and risk concentration of the trade. The funding rate on the trade currently stands at a minor loss of -$2,509.93, which indicates moderate market sentiment skew. A newcomer gambler, 0x916E, deposited 4.28M $USDC into #Hyperliquid and opened a 25x leveraged long on $ETH an hour ago. The position reached 44,523 $ETH ($100.4M), with a liquidation price of $2,196. https://t.co/8u5DW0D4Vj pic.twitter.com/NjrSPoWRM3 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 23, 2025 The activity suggests growing interest from high-net-worth participants willing to take directional bets on Ethereum’s short-term trajectory. Hyperliquid, a rising player in the perpetual DEX market, has increasingly become a hub for large leveraged positions. One trader who found fame through extravagant bets on the platform is James Wynn, who turned a $7,000 PEPE wager into more than $25 million. Riding that wave, he began trading perpetual futures on Hyperliquid in March, despite having no prior experience with derivatives. In less than a month, Wynn claimed to have grown a $3 million position into $100 million through high-leverage trades, attracting massive attention from the crypto community. However, the turning point came in May, when Wynn opened a $1.25 billion long position on Bitcoin using up to 40x leverage. A geopolitical tweet from former President Trump caused markets to turn, triggering Wynn’s liquidation. His massive bet was wiped out, leaving him with nearly nothing. Ethereum Staking Surges Despite Market Slump As reported, Ethereum staking has reached a new milestone , with more than 35 million ETH, over 28.3% of the total supply, now locked into the network’s proof-of-stake system. Over 500,000 ETH was staked in just the first half of June. The trend signals a shift in investor behavior, with many opting to earn yield rather than sell at current prices. Currently, more than 25% of all staked ETH is handled by liquid staking giant Lido, while Binance and Coinbase account for 7.5% and 7.4%, respectively. Coinbase has also emerged as Ethereum’s largest node operator, controlling over 11.4% of staked ETH via its validators. Notably, Ethereum is witnessing its most intense whale accumulation in seven years, with large wallets adding over 871,000 ETH in a single day on June 12. This marks the highest daily inflow in 2025 and has pushed total holdings in 1,000 to 10,000 ETH wallets past 14.3 million ETH, according to Glassnode.

""Whale Rush!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-falls-amid-us-iran-tensions-this-altcoin-soars-whale-rush/,"Following the US attack on Iran, tensions in the Middle East rose rapidly. Retaliation from Iran was immediate and the Iranian Parliament approved a bill to close the strategically important Strait of Hormuz. While these developments were taking place, there were significant declines in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins. While these declines were taking place, an altcoin attracted attention with its rise. According to data, blockchain-based open intellectual property project Story (IP) rose while Bitcoin and altcoins fell. Following this rise, the altcoin was announced by the X account. This announcement excited investors and also increased the price. Accordingly, Story (IP) increased investors’ expectations by showing a strong increase of over 10% amid the downtrend in the cryptocurrency market. “Notifications are on. Big things are coming. Soon.” Following this mysterious post and the rise, whales’ IP interest also increased. According to Lookonchain’s post, two whales have purchased $47.5 million worth of IP in recent days. Accordingly, one whale bought $17.8 million and the other bought $29.7 million. Story (IP) continues to trade at $3, up more than 10 percent in the last 24 hours. 2 whales have accumulated 16M $IP ($47.52M) recently. Whale 0x9921 accumulated 6M $IP ($17.82M).

According to portfolio disclosures dated 20 June, Cathie Wood’s investment firm sold 609,175 CRCL shares across three of its funds—ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). This latest move comes after a 20.4% spike in Circle’s stock price on the same day. Based on market value, the divestment was worth approximately $146.2 million, marking ARK’s largest single-day exit from the stablecoin issuer since its shares went public. The breakdown includes 490,549 shares from ARKK, 75,018 from ARKW, and 43,608 from ARKF.

Earlier in the week, the firm had sold $52 million worth of shares on 16 June and another $45 million on 17 June, both following price upticks. These transactions appear to be part of a broader strategy of profit-taking during CRCL’s volatile ascent in the public markets. Since its listing at $31 per share, CRCL has skyrocketed more than 400%, now trading near $240. Circle remains a top holding for ARK Invest Despite the significant sales, ARK Invest continues to be a major Circle shareholder. The firm initially acquired 4.5 million shares shortly after the company went public and still retains more than 3.2 million shares. At current prices, ARK’s remaining stake is worth about $779 million, placing it as the eighth-largest holder of CRCL stock. Circle now features prominently in ARK’s portfolio alongside other core positions, including Tesla (TSLA) and Robinhood (HOOD). This latest sale, while substantial, appears to be part of an ongoing portfolio rebalancing rather than a full exit. IDG-Accel China leads Circle’s shareholder base Circle’s shareholder registry is still topped by the Beijing-based IDG-Accel China Capital Fund II, which holds 23.3 million shares, making it the company’s largest shareholder by a wide margin. Compared to ARK’s holdings, IDG-Accel has maintained a long-term strategy, with no recent publicised sell-offs. The massive gains in CRCL stock have led to increasing scrutiny over investor behaviour, especially as more institutional players take profits in the wake of rallies. Yet the stock remains volatile and continues to draw speculative interest, with ARK’s trades serving as a bellwether for sentiment shifts among large-cap fund managers.

According to media reports , the decision was announced following its latest monthly meeting, with officials confirming that the launch will take place at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson. Executive Director Anthony Apollo described WYST as a “public good” and reiterated that all interest earned from the token’s reserves would be transferred quarterly to the state’s School Foundation Fund. WYST will be fully backed by a mix of U.S. dollars, Treasury securities, and repurchase agreements. The Commission has previously confirmed that WYST will be overcollateralized to maintain a stable 1:1 peg with the dollar. A multi-year journey First floated in 2022 by Wyoming lawmakers , the concept of a state-issued digital token has since transformed into a legislated and technically mature initiative. The idea was formalised in March 2023 with the passage of the Wyoming Stable Token Act, which established the legal framework and created the Wyoming Stable Token Commission to oversee the project. Initial test deployments of WYST began in early 2024 across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and scaling solutions such as Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. However, those test tokens held no monetary value and were used solely to validate the functionality and performance of the underlying infrastructure. WYST technical foundation Over the past months, the state has tapped a number of prominent blockchain firms to aid in its efforts. Back in May, the Commission partnered with Inca Digital Federal LLC to enhance risk monitoring and ensure compliance with federal and state standards. Under this agreement, Inca provides real-time analytics, threat detection tools, and market intelligence to help safeguard the token’s operations from fraud and other illicit activity. A month later, the Commission identified Solana and Aptos as the two leading blockchain platforms for hosting WYST after narrowing down an initial list of 11 candidates. Both networks met the state’s requirements around high throughput, low fees, and strong vendor support after the test phase . Solana was selected for its high-throughput, production-proven architecture capable of sub-second finality. Aptos was chosen for its modular upgrade capabilities and its use of the Move language, which enhances security through resource-oriented programming. LayerZero, the cross-chain messaging protocol, will also play a key role in facilitating WYST’s interoperability across supported blockchains. The platform allows tokens to move securely between networks without the need for traditional centralized bridges, reducing exposure to common vulnerabilities and improving user experience. In his latest comments, Apollo said WYST may be deployed across multiple blockchain networks via LayerZero.

Recently, a development caught attention when OpenAI pulled promotional content related to its much-discussed partnership involving a new device io startup . While this might initially suggest issues with the collaboration, the reality points to a specific legal hurdle. Why the Promotional Video Disappeared: A Trademark Dispute The reason behind OpenAI removing a video highlighting the friendship between Sam Altman and Jony Ive , alongside their planned device venture, stems from a legal issue. According to reports, a judge issued a restraining order specifically concerning the use of the name ‘io’. This court action was triggered by a trademark dispute . The complaint was filed by a company named ‘iyO’. This entity originated from Alphabet X, Google’s ‘moonshot factory’. ‘iyO’ is developing its own product: generative AI-powered earbuds. The core of the trademark dispute is the potential for consumer confusion between ‘io’ and ‘iyO’, particularly given the promotional activities by OpenAI that used the ‘io’ name. What This Means for the Jony Ive Partnership and io Startup Despite the legal action and the removal of promotional materials, the significant partnership between OpenAI , Sam Altman , and Jony Ive involving the io startup remains intact. Reports indicate that the deal is still progressing as planned and has not been dissolved. OpenAI itself confirmed this, stating that the court order relates only to the use of the ‘io’ name in certain materials. OpenAI has publicly acknowledged the situation, updating their original announcement page with a note about the temporary takedown due to the court order following the trademark complaint from ‘iyO’. While they comply with the order, OpenAI has also stated they do not agree with the complaint and are reviewing their legal options. This indicates a potential ongoing legal battle over the naming rights. For now, the focus is on resolving the naming issue, allowing the collaboration between OpenAI , Sam Altman , and Jony Ive to continue developing the planned device under the io startup umbrella, even if the final product name needs adjustment or the legal challenge is fought. Navigating Legal Challenges in Tech Ventures This incident highlights a common challenge faced by new ventures in the tech space: intellectual property and naming rights. As companies develop products and brands, ensuring unique and legally defensible names is crucial. A trademark dispute can disrupt marketing, branding, and even product launches, requiring significant time and resources to resolve. While the specific video is no longer on OpenAI ‘s official platforms, it reportedly remains accessible on other sites, such as X (formerly Twitter), illustrating the difficulty of completely removing information once it’s public. The situation underscores the importance of thorough legal checks during the early stages of naming and branding a new company or product, especially when high-profile figures like Sam Altman and Jony Ive are involved, drawing significant public attention. Conclusion: A Minor Setback for a Major Partnership The removal of promotional content due to a trademark dispute over the ‘io’ name is a temporary setback for OpenAI and the venture with Jony Ive and the io startup . Importantly, the core deal and the collaboration between these influential figures remain on track. While OpenAI navigates this legal challenge, the focus on developing innovative hardware continues. This event serves as a reminder that even major tech initiatives can face unexpected hurdles related to intellectual property.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level.

The decline marked a significant reaction to heightened geopolitical tensions, with risk assets broadly under pressure. However, the sub-$100,000 level proved short-lived. BTC recovered during early Monday trading in Asia, rebounding to around $101,871 at the time of writing. The swift recovery underscores ongoing market sensitivity to geopolitical developments, while also highlighting the strength of near-term technical support. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and other major altcoins extended last week’s losses. Bitcoin now hovers near a key support level at $100,000. A decisive close below this threshold could signal a deeper correction, with the next downside target near Sunday’s intraday low of $98,200. Market participants remain cautious, with geopolitical risk continuing to drive volatility across both crypto and traditional asset classes. In this volatile environment, one early-stage project that has consistently garnered investor interest is Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale continued to see strong inflows even in this risk-off environment. Middle East tensions weigh on sentiments The Israel-Iran conflict entered its 11th day on Monday, June 23, with Israel’s military confirming strikes on surface-to-surface missile launch sites in western Iran. The development follows a significant escalation on June 13, when Israel carried out large-scale attacks targeting Iranian missile infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and senior military officials. Aerial assaults continued into Monday, intensifying after the US launched bunker-buster bomb strikes over the weekend on three of Iran’s nuclear sites. The Trump administration has described the strikes as a targeted effort to degrade Tehran’s nuclear capabilities. President Donald Trump declared that the US operation had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, though senior officials noted that it remains too early to fully assess the extent of the damage. Iran has sharply condemned the US involvement, accusing Washington of crossing “a very big red line.” Tehran responded with a warning that it would retaliate against what it sees as direct American aggression. Despite the military escalation, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the administration “does not seek war” and reiterated an interest in returning to diplomatic engagement. Bitcoin Pepe shows strength The crypto market has experienced heightened volatility in recent months, marked by sharp rallies, steep corrections, and fluctuating investor sentiment. Amid this backdrop, the Bitcoin Pepe presale has remained resilient, continuing to draw consistent capital inflows. The sustained interest suggests the project may be well-positioned to navigate current market conditions. Billed as the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe aims to redefine meme tokens by combining Bitcoin’s base-layer security with the scalability features more commonly associated with chains like Solana. This integration of infrastructure strength with cultural relevance sets it apart from many meme tokens that lack underlying technical substance. To support the growth of its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has formed strategic partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. The project’s dual approach—merging functional utility with meme-driven momentum—is gaining market traction. The development team has also shared visuals of ongoing infrastructure progress to enhance transparency and build trust. The presale has already raised over $15.3 million, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0416. The token is set to be listed on MEXC and BitMart, a move expected to boost liquidity, increase visibility, and reinforce market credibility. An additional listing announcement is anticipated on June 30, adding to investor interest as the presale nears completion.

46607079,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=171230,1750672213,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46607079.jpeg,Shocking Crypto Market Dip: Geopolitical Events Trigger $1B Liquidations & Bitcoin Price Fall,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-market-dip-liquidations/,"BitcoinWorld Shocking Crypto Market Dip: Geopolitical Events Trigger $1B Liquidations & Bitcoin Price Fall The cryptocurrency market experienced a sudden and significant downturn, sending ripples of concern through the investment community. This latest crypto market dip appears closely linked to escalating global tensions, specifically following reports of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The swift reaction across digital asset prices highlighted the market’s sensitivity to external geopolitical factors, leading to substantial losses for many holders. Geopolitical Events Trigger Market Turmoil While often touted as a decentralized and uncorrelated asset class, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have shown increasing sensitivity to macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. The recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites served as a stark reminder of this connection. Such events typically trigger a ‘risk-off’ sentiment across global financial markets, where investors tend to move away from perceived higher-risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies towards safer havens like gold or government bonds. The news broke, and the immediate reaction in the crypto space was a sharp price decline across the board. This rapid sell-off demonstrated how quickly external, non-crypto-specific events can influence market dynamics and investor behavior. Massive Crypto Liquidations Exceed $1 Billion One of the most dramatic consequences of the sudden price drop was a cascade of crypto liquidations . According to data reported by The Block, citing CoinGlass figures, daily liquidations surged past the $1 billion mark. Liquidations occur in the leveraged trading market. Traders use borrowed funds to increase their position size. If the market moves against their position significantly, their collateral is insufficient to cover potential losses, and the exchange automatically closes their position. The scale of over $1 billion in liquidations within a 24-hour period underscores the severity and speed of the market correction. This event primarily impacted traders holding long positions (betting on prices going up), who were caught off guard by the sharp downturn. Mass liquidations can also exacerbate price falls, as the forced selling adds further downward pressure on the market. Understanding liquidations is crucial for anyone involved in leveraged crypto trading. It highlights the inherent risks associated with using borrowed capital in such a volatile environment. The $1 billion figure serves as a powerful illustration of the financial leverage present in the market and the potential consequences of sudden price swings. Bitcoin Price Fall: A Brief Dip Below $100k As the market reacted to the geopolitical news and subsequent liquidations, the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), experienced a notable Bitcoin price fall . According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin briefly dipped below the significant psychological and technical level of $100,000. This marked the first time BTC had traded below this threshold in approximately 45 days, causing concern among investors who had grown accustomed to its recent stability above this level. While the drop was sharp, Bitcoin showed some resilience, quickly rebounding to trade around $100,735.18 shortly after. This relatively swift recovery from the sub-$100k level suggests underlying buying interest remains, or that the initial panic selling subsided relatively quickly. However, the breach of this key level, even if brief, signals increased volatility and potential uncertainty in the near term. Bitcoin’s ability to hold relatively steadier compared to other assets during such downturns is often attributed to its larger market capitalization and deeper liquidity. However, even the market leader is not immune to significant price movements triggered by major external events. The Altcoin Market Reaction: Bigger Losses While Bitcoin saw a significant price fall, the impact on the broader altcoin market reaction was even more pronounced. Altcoins, which are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, generally experienced larger percentage losses during this downturn. This is a common pattern observed during crypto market corrections. Why do altcoins often suffer more? Higher Volatility: Altcoins, especially smaller-cap ones, are typically more volatile than Bitcoin. Their prices can swing more dramatically in either direction. Lower Liquidity: Many altcoins have lower trading volumes and less liquidity than Bitcoin. This means that relatively smaller sell orders can have a larger impact on their price. Risk Perception: In a ‘risk-off’ environment, investors tend to flee towards perceived safer assets. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is often seen as the least risky asset compared to the vast and diverse altcoin market. Leverage: High leverage in altcoin perpetual futures markets can lead to cascading liquidations that accelerate price declines. The recent dip highlighted this disparity, with many altcoins seeing double-digit percentage losses while Bitcoin’s drop was comparatively less severe. This reinforces the idea that while altcoins offer potential for higher returns, they also come with significantly higher risk, particularly during periods of market stress. Impact on Bitcoin ETF Inflows The market dip also coincided with a change in the trend for Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). After a notable nine-day streak of positive inflows, June 20 saw a dip in inflows. Coupled with the subsequent price fall, this suggests the inflow streak may come to an end on June 23, depending on the day’s activity. Consistent ETF inflows have been a significant bullish factor for Bitcoin in recent months, indicating growing institutional and traditional investor interest. A pause or reversal in this trend, even if temporary, could signal a shift in short-term sentiment or a reaction from institutional players to the increased market volatility and the broader geopolitical impact crypto is experiencing. Monitoring ETF flows remains a key indicator for gauging institutional participation and sentiment in the Bitcoin market. Understanding the Geopolitical Impact on Crypto The notion that cryptocurrencies are entirely detached from traditional finance and global politics is increasingly being challenged. While their underlying technology is decentralized, their price is determined by supply and demand within a market that is populated by participants who are also affected by global events. Here’s how geopolitical events can influence crypto: Impact Factor Explanation Risk-Off Sentiment Global instability causes investors to reduce exposure to perceived risky assets, including crypto. Safe-Haven Narrative Conversely, some view Bitcoin as a potential safe haven during times of currency devaluation or political instability, although this narrative is debated and not always reflected in price action during global crises. Sanctions & Regulations Geopolitical conflicts can lead to discussions or implementations of stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies to prevent their use in illicit activities or circumventing sanctions. Economic Uncertainty Events impacting global trade, energy prices, or economic stability can influence overall market liquidity and investor confidence, affecting crypto demand. The recent dip underscores the importance of considering the broader global landscape when analyzing cryptocurrency market movements. While internal factors like technological developments and adoption rates are crucial, external forces can trigger significant and rapid price changes. Conclusion: Navigating Volatility in the Crypto Market The recent crypto market dip , triggered by geopolitical tensions and resulting in over $1 billion in liquidations and a temporary Bitcoin price fall below $100k, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the digital asset space. The amplified altcoin market reaction further highlights the varying risk profiles within the ecosystem. While painful for those caught off guard, such events are not uncommon in this relatively young and rapidly evolving market. Investors should understand that external factors, including geopolitical impact crypto , can significantly influence prices. Managing risk, avoiding excessive leverage, and maintaining a long-term perspective are often cited as prudent strategies when navigating these turbulent periods. As the market digests the impact of recent events, vigilance and informed decision-making remain paramount.

Honeypot v2 boasts Permissionless Refereed Tournaments (PRT), an intriguingly-named fraud-proof system. It’s designed to ensure rollup resistance to Sybil attacks without forcing networks to rely on permissioned validators or heavy hardware. And it’s not the only innovation that can be found under the hood of the Honeypot dapp. Cartesi Sweetens Honeypot When Cartesi first launched Honeypot on Ethereum two years ago, the dapp effectively gamified security testing, transforming a laborious process into something more rewarding. It achieved this by implementing a community-incentivized audit and hacker battlefield. Despite these flourishes, there’s serious business being taken care of in the background. In the time that’s elapsed since Honeypot’s release, rollups have come to play an increasingly important role in onchain activity and the economic value that passes through them has soared. By processing transactions away from the main Ethereum chain, rollups allow network users to take advantage of greater throughput and lower costs. But security on these Layer-2 solutions is paramount, particularly when they’re obliged to “roll up” multiple transactions into a single batch and submit them to Ethereum. As for where Honeypot comes into all this, the app is designed to challenge the security of Cartesi rollups. Can anyone hack the application to obtain the funds locked in the rollup contract? So long as those funds remain untouched, Honeypot – and by extension Cartesi – is working as expected. The Canary in the Coalmine Honeypot is essentially the canary in the coalmine: an early warning system designed to alert blockchain users should a Cartesi rollup run into a problem. Since any project can spin up its own Cartesi rollup, the benefits of Honeypot extend far beyond Cartesi itself. As Cartesi Founder Erick de Moura explains, “Honeypots allow projects to commit their own funds to validate the integrity of their fault proofs before asking others to rely on them. It’s a gradual, transparent path toward trustless security that reflects the values this ecosystem was built on.” If Ethereum is to scale further – which by Vitalik Buterin’s admission it desperately needs to – it will fall to rollups to do a lot of the heavy lifting. Honeypot thus has a major role to play in giving projects confidence that their rollups are working as intended by allowing them to test their inviolability.

Filed in a Delaware bankruptcy court, the objection argues that the massive claim has no merit and should be thrown out entirely. FTX Calls Out 3AC’s Risky Bets 3️⃣ What really melted Over 13th – 14th June 2022 the account fell by $282M because: • Crypto prices tanked (‑$222M) • 3AC themselves yanked out another (‑$60M) FTX didn’t “seize” anything. — MBottjer (@Mbottjer) June 22, 2025 In a new court filing, FTX lawyers slammed 3AC’s claim as “illogical and baseless,” arguing the hedge fund knowingly made high-stakes bets on rising crypto prices. When the market crashed in 2022, those leveraged positions imploded, but FTX says that doesn’t mean other creditors should cover 3AC’s losses. 3AC’s claim is based on its account balances as of June 12, 2022, alleging that FTX held and then liquidated $1.53 billion in assets. But FTX disputes those numbers, saying the real crypto balance was only $1.02 billion and that 3AC had $733 million in liabilities. After market downturns and 3AC’s own $60 million in withdrawals, FTX claims only $284 million remained, far from the billion-dollar claim. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance’s CZ Issues Urgent Scam Alert: Is Crypto Media at Risk? , Liquidation Was Legal — and Beneficial? FTX also clarified that it only liquidated $82 million in 3AC’s assets, which was allowed under existing credit and margin agreements.

Moreover, 3AC now has until July 11 to respond to FTX’s objection, with a hearing set for August 12. Meanwhile, both firms continue battling in courtrooms around the globe, 3AC is chasing a $1.3 billion claim against Terraform Labs, while FTX is on a mission to claw back funds through a wave of lawsuits.

That contender is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a meme coin rewriting the rulebook and gaining momentum at a speed that’s now impossible to ignore. While ADA and TRX continue to build on their legacy frameworks, LILPEPE is attracting new waves of investors with a potent combination of price potential, infrastructure innovation, and cultural appeal. And if early metrics are any indication, this meme coin isn’t content with short-term hype—it’s aiming for dominance. Cardano and Tron: Slowing Giants? Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) have spent years trying to solve the blockchain trilemma of scalability, decentralization, and security. Cardano trades at $0.61 as of this writing. 4.45 million addresses holding ADA, but user growth has plateaued over the past year, with minimal increases in active addresses. Tron, on the other hand, trades at $0.27. Tron’s high TVL is primarily driven by USDT ($62 billion in 2024), with 28% of transactions originating from small retail holders. This dependence on stablecoin activity, rather than diverse dApp ecosystems, limits organic growth in other areas. Both projects are showing signs of maturity—and that’s not necessarily a good thing for investors hunting for 10x, 50x, or even 100x returns. ADA, while improving its smart contract ecosystem through recent upgrades, remains sluggish in terms of adoption. TRX has performed better in terms of transaction volumes, but regulatory uncertainty and a centralized perception have limited its upside. That’s why newer, more agile tokens like LILPEPE are capturing attention, especially from investors willing to take calculated risks for massive upside. LILPEPE: The Meme Coin Built for Utility and Speed Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is not just another meme coin riding on viral energy. It’s one of the rare projects in the space that combines a humorous, community-driven brand with real technological ambition. Deployed on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, LILPEPE has already raised over $1.3 million during its presale, having quickly sold out both of its first two stages. It’s now in Stage 3, priced at just $0.0012, and the momentum continues to build. What separates LILPEPE from traditional meme tokens—and even some utility-focused altcoins—is its plans to launch a dedicated Layer 2 blockchain solely for meme coins. This L2 network is designed to be the fastest and most cost-effective chain on the market, featuring native sniper bot protection —a much-needed innovation in a space where bot front-running has become a significant problem for retail investors. It doesn’t stop there. LILPEPE’s blockchain will also feature a meme coin launchpad, making it the go-to ecosystem for emerging projects in the same space. In effect, it’s not just creating a token—it’s building the foundation for the next generation of meme-driven blockchains, with LILPEPE at the center of it all. Major Exchange Listings and Viral Growth Another key differentiator is LILPEPE’s exchange strategy. While ADA and TRX already trade on most major platforms, they’re no longer considered fresh news. LILPEPE, meanwhile, has confirmed two centralized exchange listings upon launch, with plans to expand further by listing on the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. This move could instantly thrust it into mainstream visibility and significantly increase its market capitalization. Add to that the project’s $777,000 giveaway campaign—where 10 winners will receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens—and you have a recipe for mass adoption. This campaign alone has dramatically expanded the community, driving thousands of new users to the presale and rapidly increasing wallet count. The energy is growing by the hour, not by the week. Final Thoughts Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) are solid, established names—but that’s also their weakness in a market that thrives on disruption. Little Pepe is that disruption. It’s a token designed for virality, built for scale, and backed by a roadmap that could leave traditional altcoins behind. While ADA and TRX continue their slow and steady climb, LILPEPE is launching with the kind of force that topples giants. And if the early signs hold, it won’t be long before the meme coin that started at less than a penny overtakes them both.

In a recent post, crypto analyst Bale suggested that a final resolution might be delayed until late 2026. However, seasoned legal expert and XRP advocate Bill Morgan swiftly dismissed that possibility, calling it highly unlikely unless an unexpected turn occurs in court. Bill Morgan: A 2026 Delay Is Improbable According to Bill Morgan , a delay extending into 2026 is “not on the cards” unless Judge Analisa Torres rejects the most recent joint motion filed by Ripple and the SEC. If that were to happen, it could derail the settlement process entirely and force both parties to pursue full appeals, likely stretching the case through higher courts and over an extended timeline. Morgan considers this outcome improbable, as it would disregard the practical progress already made. He noted that the most sensible outcome remains for both sides to accept the 2023 summary judgment, which found Ripple’s institutional XRP sales to violate securities laws but cleared programmatic and other distributions. The remedies being considered, such as financial penalties and dissolution of the permanent injunction against Ripple, are aligned with that ruling, and continuing the process through mutual agreement is the most efficient path forward. This is not on the cards unless Judge Torres rules against the latest joint motion and rather that make the common sense decision to live with the summary judgement decision and the current penalty and permanent injunction, the settlement process breaks down completely and both… https://t.co/K6iU3OfQ4y — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 23, 2025 Where the Case Currently Stands The SEC first filed suit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that the company raised over $1 billion through unregistered XRP sales. In July 2023, Judge Torres delivered a landmark ruling that partially favored Ripple. While she sided with the SEC regarding institutional sales, she determined that XRP itself is not a security and that programmatic sales and other distributions did not violate securities laws. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Since then, legal proceedings have focused on determining penalties and final remedies. In May 2025, both parties submitted a joint proposal for remedies, indicating progress toward resolution. Although Judge Torres denied an initial sealing request on procedural grounds, the court instructed the parties to refile , seen largely as a technical issue rather than a sign of discord. Legal Experts See Closure on the Horizon John Deaton, who represented more than 75,000 XRP holders during the proceedings, also expressed optimism that the Judge will grant the motion . Former SEC enforcement attorney Marc Fagel noted that, barring unforeseen developments, the court’s pace and the collaborative posture of both parties suggest a resolution is within reach. Meanwhile, Fred Rispoli predicts the judge will issue a decision within weeks. This growing consensus among legal experts reinforces the notion that the long-running dispute may finally be coming to a close. Looking Ahead Unless Judge Torres takes the unexpected step of rejecting the joint motion and triggering a full appeal process, the Ripple-SEC case appears to be approaching its final chapter. All indications suggest that both parties are working toward closure rather than preparing for a renewed courtroom battle. As of today, the ultimate decision lies with Judge Torres. With procedural hurdles nearly cleared, a resolution could soon bring an end to one of the most closely watched legal battles in crypto history.

Get ready for a significant update that underscores the growing influence of traditional finance in the digital asset space. We’re talking about Spot Bitcoin ETFs , and their holdings have just hit a massive milestone that’s turning heads across the Crypto Market . According to data compiled by @hildobby_ on Dune Analytics, Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States now collectively control a substantial portion of the total BTC supply . This isn’t just a small percentage; it’s a figure that highlights the rapid pace of Institutional Bitcoin adoption since these products launched earlier this year. Understanding the Massive Spot Bitcoin ETF Holdings Let’s break down the numbers that are making waves: Percentage of Total BTC Supply: 6.13% Combined On-Chain Holdings: 1,218,000 BTC Approximate Value: $121.2 billion (based on market prices at the time of data collection) These figures, derived from on-chain data tracked by reliable sources like Dune Analytics, demonstrate a clear trend: institutions and large-scale investors are using the Spot Bitcoin ETF structure to gain exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated and familiar way. The fact that over 6% of the entire BTC supply is now held within these wrappers is a powerful indicator of institutional appetite. What Does This Massive Influx of Institutional Bitcoin Signify? The accumulation of 1.218 million BTC by Spot Bitcoin ETFs is far more than just a statistic; it’s a strong signal for the entire Crypto Market . Here’s what this surge in Institutional Bitcoin holdings tells us: Validation as an Asset Class: Large institutions, pension funds, and asset managers are increasingly comfortable treating Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset, worthy of significant allocation. Increased Liquidity and Accessibility: ETFs provide an easy way for investors who cannot or prefer not to hold physical Bitcoin directly to participate in its price movements. This expands the pool of potential investors dramatically. Maturing Market Infrastructure: The success and growth of these ETFs reflect the maturing infrastructure around Bitcoin, including regulated custodians, trading platforms, and data providers. This level of commitment from traditional finance players via Spot Bitcoin ETFs adds a layer of stability and legitimacy that was less apparent in earlier cycles of the Crypto Market . It signifies a deeper integration of Bitcoin into the global financial system. How Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Reshaping the BTC Supply Landscape One of the most direct impacts of these massive holdings is on the available BTC supply . Bitcoin has a finite supply capped at 21 million coins. When large amounts are held in long-term investment vehicles like ETFs, it reduces the amount of Bitcoin actively trading on exchanges or held by short-term speculators. Think of it this way: the 1.218 million BTC held by Spot Bitcoin ETFs are essentially locked away for the investors in those funds. While ETF shares trade, the underlying Bitcoin is typically held by a custodian and not readily available for sale on the open market by the ETF manager unless inflows reverse significantly. This dynamic can lead to a supply squeeze, especially if demand continues to grow. With a significant portion of the circulating BTC supply moving into these institutional vaults, any sustained buying pressure could have a more pronounced effect on price than it would in a market where supply is more fragmented and readily available. The Ripple Effect on the Wider Crypto Market The success of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the resulting surge in Institutional Bitcoin holdings have broader implications for the entire Crypto Market : Increased Awareness and Confidence: The prominent presence of Bitcoin ETFs managed by household names like BlackRock and Fidelity brings Bitcoin into mainstream financial conversations, increasing awareness and potentially confidence among retail investors. Paving the Way for Other Crypto Assets: The regulatory approval and market success of Bitcoin ETFs could set a precedent for ETFs tracking other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, potentially opening up new avenues for institutional and retail investment in the future. Shift in Market Structure: While retail investors remain crucial, the increasing dominance of institutional holdings could influence market volatility patterns and trading strategies. This shift indicates a maturation of the Crypto Market , moving beyond its early, primarily retail-driven phase into one where institutional capital plays a significant role. Navigating the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Bitcoin The accumulation of over 6% of the BTC supply by Spot Bitcoin ETFs is undoubtedly a bullish signal, highlighting strong demand for Institutional Bitcoin products. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges and future dynamics: Continued Inflows: Will the pace of accumulation continue? This depends on market performance, regulatory environment, and broader economic conditions. Concentration Risk: While diversification is inherent within the ETF structure, the concentration of a significant portion of BTC supply in a few large funds could introduce new systemic risks, although this is mitigated by the distributed nature of Bitcoin itself. Regulatory Landscape: Future regulatory decisions could impact the operation and growth of these funds. For investors, this development reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a major asset class attracting serious capital. It suggests that the trend of institutional adoption is likely to continue, potentially providing a strong foundation for future price appreciation, though market volatility remains a factor. In Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Bitcoin The fact that Spot Bitcoin ETFs now command over 6% of the total BTC supply is a landmark moment. It underscores the rapid and significant adoption of Bitcoin by institutional players, validating its role in modern investment portfolios. With over 1.2 million BTC under management, valued at over $121 billion, these ETFs are not just a new product; they are reshaping the dynamics of the BTC supply and signaling a new era for the entire Crypto Market driven by increasing Institutional Bitcoin participation. This growth story is far from over, and its implications will continue to unfold.

This emerging protocol is built for decentralized lending and borrowing through both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With a presale price of just $0.03 and over $11 million already raised, Mutuum has gained attention from over 12,300 holders anticipating its beta platform launch. A $2,000 investment at the current price can grow to $70,000 at a 35x return—showing clear upside potential for early adopters. Unlike speculative tokens with no backing, MUTM is supported by an infrastructure designed for scale, compliance, and real yield. Ten early believers will also be rewarded in a $100,000 giveaway , each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Layer-2 Scalability and CertiK-Audited Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed with Layer-2 integration to ensure faster transactions and drastically lower fees. This technical upgrade will reduce the burden of congestion and make high-frequency borrowing, lending, and collateral interactions more efficient. Users will interact directly with non-custodial smart contracts, improving both speed and affordability compared to Layer-1 limitations. Security has already been validated through a CertiK audit, with a Token Scan score of 80.00 and a Skynet rating of 75.56. The audit included both static analysis and manual review, demonstrating that Mutuum’s smart contracts meet rigorous safety standards. This makes it one of the few small-cap projects with institutional-grade review prior to launch. Passive Income, Stablecoin Utility, and Lending Freedom Earning on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will take two distinct forms. In the P2C model, users will supply assets like ETH, BTC, BNB, AVAX, USDT, or USDC into protocol-controlled pools. These pools will generate interest based on demand. As more borrowing occurs, interest rates rise, and depositors earn more. Each deposit will be represented by mtTokens, which automatically accrue interest and can be transferred or used in other parts of the protocol. In the P2P model, users can lend directly to others under fully customizable terms. This includes support for meme coins and non-traditional tokens like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB—giving lenders the chance to earn in areas most platforms ignore. Alongside lending, Mutuum will launch its own decentralized stablecoin. This asset will maintain a $1 peg, minted only when users borrow against collateral and burned when debt is repaid or liquidated. Governance will adjust the interest rate to manage supply. For example, if the price of the stablecoin rises above $1, interest rates can be lowered to encourage minting. If it drops below $1, rates can be raised to reduce supply. All minting will be permissioned and capped, reducing risk across the system. Interest generated from stablecoin borrowing will be directed to Mutuum’s treasury and used to execute MUTM token buybacks. Those tokens will be redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the platform’s designated contracts. This creates a sustainable, revenue-backed dividend model that rewards long-term participants while increasing demand for the token itself. As the project nears its beta launch, all core systems—from stablecoin mechanics to interest rate logic—are being prepared for full on-chain deployment. With CertiK verification, Layer-2 performance, customizable lending, and a protocol-first dividend strategy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a structure designed to reward early conviction and provide real utility in DeFi.

This follows a successful Stage 1 at $0.001 (raising $500,000) and Stage 2 at $0.0011 (raising $733,987).

The project advertises itself as the first Layer 2 blockchain to focus on meme tokens. Its point of sale is its low fee and rapid speed which are geared towards viral meme culture and crypto trading. The Little Pepe model incorporates humor, scalability, and token utility to diversify meme projects in a safe Layer 2 environment. The token is not taxed and has specific liquidity, which may enhance the outcomes of service provision after the launch. Tokenomics and Roadmap Raise Expectations for Breakout Potential The LILPEPE tokenomics reserve 26.5 percent of tokens for presale and 30 percent in chains to sustain long-term performance and development. The other 13.5 percent will be used as staking rewards to encourage long-term holding behavior among the community members. With liquidity, DEX listings, and marketing at 10% each, the ecosystem seems designed for robust circulation and adoption. There are no buy and sell taxes, which attract traders who want to transact without any friction and those who would like to enter or exit the market quickly. The purpose of marketing funds is to spur growth in the community. $LILPEPE is expanding the ecosystem and integrating with Layer 2 which helps to drive scalability and token value up higher. The presale terms reflect a phased release model since tokens can only be claimed when all release phases are closed. Investors anticipate the listing will be at elevated prices, and any delays may impact sentiments. Little Pepe also launched a massive $777,000 token giveaway . A total of 10 winners will each receive $77,000 worth of $LILPEPE tokens. Dogecoin Remains Flat Despite Broader Meme Coin Activity Dogecoin (DOGE) currently trades at $0.1707 without significant fluctuation over the last 24 hours. Despite its market cap of $25.57 billion, its volume has declined by more than 44%. Investors appear to be wary of DOGE regardless of its record-breaking performance and its mentions on social media. DOGE has not received an update or upgrade with any utility to attract new retailers. Its popularity relies largely on social activity and the infrequent interest of influencers. The newer tokens, such as LILPEPE, however, are applying real applications and governance features to appeal to long-term users.

This strategic move helps it tap into a region responsible for nearly 20% of global crypto trading volume. This strategic move positions Solana as a pivotal infrastructure layer in one of crypto’s fastest-growing markets. The news has sparked interest among investors, who are now keenly watching Solana’s price moves for short-term trade insights. While the MoU provides a long-term tailwind, the immediate question on traders’ minds is: Can SOL build momentum to bounce back from current lows? In this Sol price analysis, I take you through Solana’s network health and how it could perform on the charts. On-Chain Metrics Fuel Solana? According to data from Artemis , Solana maintains a leading position in both daily active addresses and transaction volume. Solana network averages over 1 million daily active users, significantly outpacing Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon. On the transaction front, Solana logs 100–120 million daily transactions, showing scalability and usage consistency. This high throughput reflects sustained developer and user activity across DeFi, NFTs, and new consumer-facing apps. It also builds a compelling case for Kazakhstan’s decision to select Solana as its blockchain of choice. Solana Price Analysis: Solana, at the time of press, is trading at $134.49, down 0.67%, but rising volume suggests growing buying interest. The RSI has rebounded from oversold levels of 33.01 to 40.73, signaling a possible trend reversal. SOL has bounced from strong support at $129, while the 20 SMA at $137.46 remains the next key hurdle. Successively, a breakout could push prices toward $148, $152, and $156.88, respectively. On the downside, $129 remains the critical support to watch. With fundamentals strengthened by the Kazakhstan MoU and on-chain activity strong, SOL appears poised for a short-term rally, provided the momentum holds.

Elon Musk's X plans in-app trading and payments but makes no mention of Dogecoin integration despite his historical support. Bitcoin Pepe smashes $15.2m presale as world's first Bitcoin meme ICO builds ""Solana on Bitcoin"" toward June 30th exchange announcement. The meme coin space is far more diverse than anyone could have predicted a few years ago. Among the flagship meme projects, Dogecoin—the OG that started it all—has evolved into something resembling a vast ecosystem with real institutional interest, ETF speculation, and integration into major platforms like Coinbase's Base network. What began essentially as a joke has become a $25B market cap phenomenon that's weathered practically every storm in crypto. Dogecoin's recent performance indicates its status as a maturing asset. Recording yearly gains of 35% to date, and much higher in its early spring peak, DOGE has shown remarkable resilience despite volatility across traditional markets. Recent speculation about a potential DOGE ETF has intensified, with prediction markets giving it around a 50-50 chance of SEC approval by the end of 2025. But there's something entirely different happening on the other side of the meme coin universe. Bitcoin Pepe might belong superficially to the ""Pepe"" category of meme coins, but only on the surface. Underneath the familiar branding lies something unprecedented—the world's first meme coin ICO launched directly on Bitcoin, building infrastructure that could fundamentally change how the oldest blockchain functions. Bitcoin Pepe chose Bitcoin specifically to solve its seven-transaction-per-second limitation while building on crypto's most trusted foundation. The core innovation is the PEP-20 token standard, which promises to deliver thousands of transactions per second to Bitcoin's ecosystem, essentially creating ""Solana on Bitcoin"" functionality. With an incredible $15.2m raised and confirmed tier 1 exchange listings ahead of June 30th announcements, the market is clearly taking this seriously. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): Building the future of Bitcoin infrastructure Bitcoin Pepe is attempting something that sounds impossible—making Bitcoin fast while keeping it secure. Departing from the traditional meme coin formula, the team wanted to solve the biggest problem holding Bitcoin back from modern applications. It’s ambitious, but the market is backing it sincerely. For example, every staking pool sold out completely, with participants locking tokens for yields ranging from 75% up to a vast 10,000% APY. An astonishing $15.2m has so far been raised in the ongoing presale. The team is now in the process of onboarding additional tier 1 exchange partnerships, with MEXC and BitMart already secured, triggering $300K in immediate buying activity. June 30th will reveal which other major exchanges are joining and could see the price rocket as the presale sails past $15M. We've just seen ANOTHER major pump! $BPEP just hit $15 MILLION raised. 💪Since dropping our listing announcements, $BPEP has gone parabolic. BitMart ✅ Uniswap ✅ Tier 1 announcement coming June 30th ✅The window’s still open… but not for long. Buy $BPEP now ➡️… pic.twitter.com/f9tDkYbwSs — Bitcoin Pepe (@BitcoinPepe_) June 18, 2025 In the meantime, they’ve been locking in some great partnerships that are already creating utility across multiple sectors: Mobile Finance: Plena Finance integrating BPEP into their app serving millions of users Bitcoin Gaming: GETE Network building gaming infrastructure that runs on Bitcoin Content Creation: BETV developing platforms where creators earn BPEP Casual Gaming: GemuPlay adding BPEP rewards across 200+ game titles Development transparency has increased with leaked screenshots showing the Bitcoin bridge, native DEX, and dedicated block explorer in various completion stages. This team is building comprehensive infrastructure rather than pinning hopes on a viral price rush. With positioning available at $0.0416 in the current stage, this might be the last chance to get in before Bitcoin Pepe hits public markets and the real price discovery begins. The window is closing fast to get involved with the best crypto to buy now, both for short-term price action and long-term utility play. Dogecoin (DOGE): The institutional meme coin Dogecoin has earned its status as crypto's most beloved success story. Created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, DOGE has survived multiple bear markets, regulatory uncertainty, and countless predictions of its demise. The current technical setup has traders watching closely. After finding support near $0.167, DOGE is consolidating around $0.17 while showing signs of accumulation. Companies accept DOGE for payments, fans use it for tips and small transactions, and the community remains one of crypto's most engaged. Elon Musk's influence remains a wildcard factor. While his recent X payment announcements didn't specifically mention Dogecoin, his historical support has proven capable of moving markets. For crypto veterans, Dogecoin represents authenticity in a space increasingly dominated by complex protocols and venture capital. It exists because someone thought putting a dog meme on a blockchain would be fun, an origin story that resonates through every grassroots crypto project like Bitcoin Pepe itself. Bitcoin is set to evolve Dogecoin and Bitcoin Pepe represent completely different philosophies. DOGE offers the stability of a proven community with growing institutional recognition. Bitcoin Pepe bets on being the first to crack Bitcoin's utility problem while introducing meme culture appeal. Bitcoin Pepe's announcements about exchanges on June 30th could trigger the kind of coordinated launch that transforms presale projects into market phenomena. Ranking among the best crypto to buy now, it’s totally unexposed to the masses—for now, at least. Bitcoin Pepe's window is closing fast, though. With confirmed MEXC and Bitmart listings and rumors about bigger exchanges joining June 30th announcements, positioning at $0.0416 might be the last chance before this hits public markets. Once those exchange partnerships get announced, presale access ends forever. Bitcoin Pepe's presale window is rapidly closing. With confirmed MEXC and Bitmart listings and rumors of larger exchanges joining by June 30th, current positioning at $0.0416 may be the last opportunity before public market entry. Once these exchange partnerships are announced, presale access will conclude permanently. To learn more and to buy Bitcoin Pepe, check out the official website .

46608152,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753692,1750673412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46608152.jpeg,FTX lawyers reject 3AC’s $1.53B claim,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ftx-dismisses-3acs-1-53b-claim/,"Collapsed crypto exchange FTX lawyers have rejected a $1.53 billion recovery claim from Three Arrows Capital’s liquidators. The firm’s lawyers argued that the losses resulted from a risky trading strategy that should not be paid for by creditors. 3AC liquidators initially filed a $120 million claim in FTX’s bankruptcy case in June 2023 and expanded it to $1.53 billion in November 2024. The company alleged claims including breach of contract, fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. FTX accuses 3AC of risky leveraged strategy The hedge fund alleged FTX held $1.53 billion in its assets that were liquidated to settle liabilities in 2022, contributing to 3AC’s collapse. The firm argued that the transactions were avoidable and the defunct crypto exchange’s debtors had delayed providing the information that would have uncovered the liquidations. Chief Judge John Dorsey sided with 3AC and granted the motion in March. FTX filed an objection on Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, its lawyers maintaining that the claims were illogical and baseless. They also argued that the hedge fund “bet big” that crypto prices would increase, and when they instead dropped, the company became a victim of its “own risky strategy.” “The Joint Liquidators ask this Court to force other Exchange customers and creditors to foot the bill for 3AC’s failed strategy by asserting illogical and baseless claims for $1.53 billion.” -FTX Lawyers. The lawyers also disputed the account balance and how 3AC arrived at the $1.53 billion figure. They believe the firm relied on inaccurate account balances from June 12, 2022, when the company’s crypto balance was $1.02 billion, not $1.59 billion, and the negative U.S. dollar amount was $733 million, not $1.3 billion. The theory of lost assets, which FTX believes is the crux of 3AC’s argument, is based on the crypto balance on June 12, 2022, and asks to recover all of the balance lost in subsequent days. The lawyers said it’s a false premise and lacks any legal or factual merit, and that 3AC is owed nothing. The collapsed crypto exchange maintains that 3AC only had an available balance of $284 million, which was further chipped away by crypto market price declines and withdrawals by 3AC of $60 million. FTX also revealed that the Singapore-based firm had a negative USD balance and a positive digital asset balance at the end of the day on June 12, 2022. Lawyers acting for FTX noted in the objection that the only liquidation against 3AC was for $82 million in crypto. They argued that the amount was contractually permitted under the credit and margin agreements to ensure the firm complied with account balance requirements. The lawyers also claimed in the objection that the liquidation did not reduce the overall account balance because the value was added to the fiat 3AC account in USD. FTX said the $82 million liquidation benefited 3AC by preserving the value of its accounts. The Singapore-based hedge fund has until July 11 to file a reply to FTX’s objection. A non-evidentiary hearing is also set for August 12 before Chief Judge Karen Owens in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. 3AC files $1.3B claim against Terraform Labs In August last year, 3AC also pursued claims against collapsed crypto firm Terraform Labs through a $1.3 billion claim in Terra’s bankruptcy case. The hedge fund’s liquidators alleged that Terraform Labs misled 3AC about the stability of tokens in the Terra ecosystem, including Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), and the UST-tied token Luna (LUNA). The liquidators, represented by Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer of Teneo Holding, argued that Terraform Labs advertised the tokens in a manner that inflated the price of the assets. Those misrepresentations induced 3AC to invest heavily in Terra just a few months after UST depegged from the dollar, causing a massive crash in the Terra ecosystem, and implicating several companies. 3AC liquidators were seeking damages caused by its direct purchases of UST and LUNA and associated damages from the complete loss of value of its crypto investments caused by the collapse of LUNA and UST. On March 30, Terraform opened a claims portal for investors affected by its collapse. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Let’s dive into the latest market movements that have caught everyone’s eye. According to fresh data from CoinGecko, the global crypto market cap has experienced a dip, currently standing at $3.21 trillion . This figure reflects a 3.1% change over the past 24 hours. While daily fluctuations are common in the volatile world of digital assets, understanding the context behind these numbers is crucial for any participant in the space. Understanding the Global Crypto Market Cap What exactly is the global crypto market cap , and why does this number matter? Think of it as the total estimated value of all cryptocurrencies currently in existence. It’s calculated by multiplying the current price of each cryptocurrency by its circulating supply and then summing up all these values. It provides a snapshot of the overall size and health of the cryptocurrency market at any given moment. Here’s a quick breakdown: It’s a key metric for tracking market growth or contraction. A higher market cap generally indicates broader adoption and investor confidence. Fluctuations are normal and influenced by various factors. A 3.1% dip within 24 hours, while not catastrophic, signifies a notable movement. It suggests that selling pressure has temporarily outweighed buying activity across the board. Analyzing Bitcoin Dominance and Ethereum Dominance Beyond the total market cap, two other figures provided by CoinGecko are equally insightful: Bitcoin dominance and Ethereum dominance . Market dominance refers to the percentage of the total market cap that a specific cryptocurrency holds. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, so their dominance figures are closely watched. According to the data: Bitcoin’s market dominance is currently 62.7% . Ethereum’s market dominance is currently 8.39% . What does this tell us? Bitcoin continues to hold the lion’s share of the market’s total value. Its movements often dictate the overall market trend. Ethereum, while significantly smaller in dominance than Bitcoin, is the second-largest player and the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems, giving its dominance figure considerable weight. Changes in dominance can signal shifts in investor sentiment. For instance, if Bitcoin dominance rises during a dip, it might suggest investors are moving towards the perceived safety of BTC. Conversely, if altcoin dominance (the collective dominance of all other coins) rises, it could signal a period where investors are taking on more risk, often referred to as an ‘altcoin season’. The current figures show BTC firmly in the lead, which is typical during periods of market uncertainty or after a significant run-up. Why the Dip? Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Prices Understanding the reasons behind a dip in the global crypto market cap requires looking at a confluence of factors that influence cryptocurrency prices . While the exact cause for any specific 24-hour movement is often complex and multifaceted, here are some common drivers: Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news, inflation data, interest rate changes by central banks, and global political events can significantly impact risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors about new regulations in major economies can create uncertainty and lead to selling pressure. Investor Sentiment and News Events: Major hacks, exchange issues, or even influential figures making positive or negative comments can sway market sentiment rapidly. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, investors may sell assets to realize profits, leading to temporary dips. Technical Indicators: Traders often make decisions based on chart patterns and technical analysis, which can lead to concentrated buying or selling activity around certain price levels. Liquidation Events: In derivatives markets, large price swings can trigger cascading liquidations of leveraged positions, exacerbating downward movements. Pinpointing the precise catalyst for this 3.1% dip would require detailed analysis of market news and trading activity over the specific 24-hour period. However, it’s likely a combination of these factors contributing to the overall shift. The Impact of a Market Dip: Challenges and Opportunities A dip in the global crypto market cap presents both challenges and potential opportunities for market participants. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Dips can be sharp and unpredictable, making it difficult for short-term traders. Investor Psychology: Seeing portfolio values decrease can lead to panic selling, locking in losses. Uncertainty: It can be hard to determine if a dip is a temporary correction or the start of a longer downturn. Opportunities: Potential Buying Opportunities: For long-term investors, dips can offer a chance to buy assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum at lower prices. Learning Experience: Market volatility provides valuable lessons in risk management and emotional control. Re-evaluation: Dips encourage investors to revisit their portfolios and investment strategies. It’s important to approach market dips with a clear head and a well-defined strategy rather than reacting impulsively to short-term price movements. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Volatility Given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency prices , especially during market dips, what can investors do? Here are some actionable insights: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the projects you invest in. A temporary market dip doesn’t necessarily mean a good project has failed. Focus on fundamentals. 2. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market dip perfectly, invest a fixed amount at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly). This averages out your purchase price over time and reduces the risk of buying only at peaks. 3. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Bitcoin and Ethereum hold significant dominance, exploring other promising projects can spread risk. However, ensure you understand each asset. 4. Have a Long-Term Perspective: The crypto market has historically experienced significant volatility but has shown resilience and long-term growth. Focusing on the long game can help weather short-term downturns. 5. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For traders, using stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the market moves against your position. 6. Stay Informed, But Avoid Constant Monitoring: Keep up with major news impacting the market, but avoid checking prices every five minutes, which can fuel anxiety. Navigating dips requires discipline and a focus on your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Looking Ahead: What Could Influence the Market Next? While the 3.1% dip is the current focus, the market is constantly looking for the next catalyst. Factors that could influence the global crypto market cap and cryptocurrency prices in the near future include: Further macroeconomic data releases (inflation, jobs reports). Regulatory developments in key regions (US, EU, Asia). Technological advancements and upgrades within major networks (like Ethereum’s ongoing development). Increased institutional adoption or investment. Significant movements in the stock market, particularly tech stocks, which crypto often correlates with. Keeping an eye on these potential influencers can help provide context for future market movements, whether they lead to recovery or further dips. Conclusion: A Snapshot of Market Dynamics The recent 3.1% dip in the global crypto market cap to $3.21 trillion, as reported by CoinGecko, serves as a fresh reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin dominance remains strong at 62.7% and Ethereum dominance at 8.39%, the overall market valuation saw a notable contraction in 24 hours. Understanding these key metrics – market cap, dominance, and the factors influencing cryptocurrency prices – is vital for making informed decisions. Market dips are a normal part of the cycle, presenting challenges related to volatility and sentiment but also potential opportunities for those with a clear strategy and a long-term perspective. As the market continues to evolve, staying informed and disciplined remains key to navigating its unpredictable waters.

In 2025, however, the crypto landscape has dramatically evolved. Investors now demand more substantial infrastructure, authentic blockchain utility, and active community-driven governance. As a result, Pepe Coin faces significant headwinds, navigating an environment where memes alone aren't enough to sustain long-term success. The early success of Pepe Coin relied heavily on cultural resonance and speculative trading frenzies. Yet as the cryptocurrency market matures, a new breed of investors—savvier and more discerning—are seeking genuine, sustainable value. Pepe Coin’s inability to evolve with comprehensive decentralized governance, practical real-world applications, and transparent operational frameworks now clearly limits its potential. Simultaneously, intensified regulatory oversight and heightened market competition add further pressure. Meme coins that once thrived solely on humorous branding and speculation now face stringent scrutiny, both from investors and regulators alike. Without significant innovations or governance adaptations, Pepe Coin risks obsolescence, overshadowed by more versatile, utility-rich competitors. Investors Are Jumping Ship—PEPE’s Failure to Adapt Pepe Coin’s declining momentum symbolizes a broader industry shift where meme tokens increasingly must justify their existence beyond entertainment. The crypto ecosystem has steadily transitioned from purely speculative assets toward tokens with proven, enduring utility and active community governance. Today's crypto investors, both retail and institutional, prioritize projects that provide clear long-term benefits, sustainable tokenomics, and robust governance. Meme coins lacking these features face dwindling investor confidence. While PEPE remains culturally iconic, its failure to integrate essential utilities—such as transparent governance structures, substantial real-world use-cases, and genuine blockchain mechanisms—dramatically undermines its appeal. The market’s evolution towards utility-driven meme coins reflects broader societal shifts prioritizing transparency, decentralization, and actionable crypto use-cases. Meme tokens that empower their communities and support robust decentralized governance structures are now favored. PEPE’s stagnation in meeting these criteria severely curtails its growth prospects, leading investors to more innovative and practical alternatives. Neo Pepe Coin Takes Crypto World by Storm—Beyond the Memetrix While Pepe Coin struggles to adapt, Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) rapidly emerges as a revolutionary meme token, skillfully combining meme-driven culture with advanced blockchain functionality. Leveraging Ethereum’s secure and scalable infrastructure alongside sophisticated open-source smart contracts, Neo Pepe Coin decisively redefines the meme coin narrative. Neo Pepe Coin’s groundbreaking presale has dramatically exceeded market expectations. Now confidently progressing towards Stage 4, the presale has already attracted investments cumulatively raising over $2 million across all stages. Analysts and crypto commentators recognize Neo Pepe Coin’s presale as one of the standout successes of the year, highlighting strong investor confidence and substantial market enthusiasm. Industry recognition has firmly positioned Neo Pepe Coin as one of the most promising crypto presale opportunities currently available. Its distinct blend of meme appeal and sophisticated blockchain functionality garners significant attention, clearly marking it as both culturally impactful and technologically advanced. How Neo Pepe Coin Delivers Real Blockchain Utility Unlike typical meme tokens, Neo Pepe Coin offers genuine blockchain-based solutions. At its core lies an advanced decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), powered by the innovative NEOPGovernor smart contract. This structure empowers token holders with at least 1 million $NEOP to directly influence project governance, including critical decisions on treasury management, liquidity enhancement, and broader ecosystem development. Complementing its governance strengths, Neo Pepe Coin implements a sophisticated auto-liquidity mechanism through Uniswap, automatically applying a 2.5% fee on every transaction to strengthen liquidity pools. This innovative approach permanently burns liquidity provider (LP) tokens, guaranteeing lasting market stability and investor confidence. Defying Centralization—Neo Pepe’s Crusade for Decentralized Freedom In a crypto climate increasingly threatened by centralization and regulatory pressures, Neo Pepe Coin symbolizes genuine decentralized resistance and autonomy. Through transparent governance, immutable smart contracts, and the absence of hidden wallets, Neo Pepe Coin embodies true blockchain values—transparency, autonomy, and collective control. Neo Pepe Coin resonates deeply with decentralization advocates and crypto enthusiasts, positioning itself as a robust counter-narrative against centralized crypto entities. It proudly upholds the foundational blockchain principles of transparency and community empowerment, attracting a dedicated following committed to genuine decentralization. 4 Explosive Reasons $NEOP Is This Year’s Meme Crypto to Watch Unmatched DAO Governance Transparent, structured proposal and voting mechanisms. Defined timelines ensure democratic participation and robust community engagement. Next-Level Auto-Liquidity Continuous liquidity boosts via automatic transaction fees. Permanent burning of LP tokens fortifies market integrity and trust. Dynamic 16-Stage Presale Clearly staged presale phases with incremental price increases, rewarding early investors.
