Bitcoin has led the way with solid gains, and now attention is shifting to altcoins that may follow. As price movements become more active, some coins are starting to stand out. Web3 ai, XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana are among the projects drawing serious attention. Their rising activity suggests now could be a key moment to explore options. Finding the top crypto right now is not only about what’s trending. It is also about timing and seeing what’s next before momentum peaks. These four picks are beginning to look interesting to those who follow market signals. Web3 ai: AI-Driven Features Catch Early Interest Web3 ai is becoming a widely discussed project in today’s market. It is designed to offer smart crypto tools for better insights and actions. Rather than focusing on hype, the project is building features that aim to solve common challenges faced by users. Key tools include AI-supported risk detection, real-time portfolio monitoring, and systems that help spot scam activity. These options can assist users who want to make clearer decisions without heavy research. The platform is designed for use across experience levels. Right now, Web3 ai is in Stage 9 of its presale, with $WAI priced at $0.000443. So far, it has raised over $8.3 million. With its listing set at $0.005242, early supporters could see gains reaching 1747%. For those exploring early-stage options, this phase could offer one. XRP: Climb Supported by Regulation and Market Strength XRP is climbing again as it trades near $2.20, with a market cap of $130 billion. Ripple’s recent regulatory clarity has boosted trust in the coin, especially since it moved beyond the $0.50 resistance. This progress has sparked renewed interest from institutions closely tracking Ripple’s developments. XRP is gaining steady traction, supported by public endorsements. If it clears the $2.50 resistance level, the next target could be $3. That’s why some view it as the top crypto right now for those seeking a mix of stability and upside potential. DOGE: Chart Signals and Community Buzz Keep It Active Dogecoin is priced around $0.20, holding a $30 billion market cap. Its weekly chart reveals a bullish engulfing pattern, suggesting possible short-term movement. Though it started as a meme coin, DOGE remains relevant thanks to its liquidity and strong user support. Fueled by community engagement and regular attention online, DOGE remains in the spotlight. For those looking at the top crypto right now with fast-moving potential, Dogecoin continues to offer a familiar and reactive option. SOL: Builds Strength Through Ecosystem Expansion Solana trades near $160 and carries a market cap of around $83.49 billion. Its weekly chart features a bullish reversal pattern, hinting at a buyer-driven recovery. The Solana ecosystem of dApps and NFTs is steadily growing, adding strength to its position. Its scalable infrastructure helps it maintain momentum in the smart contract field. If SOL breaks its former resistance near $294, strong gains could follow. As interest grows in efficient platforms, many consider Solana a top crypto right now for its network growth and utility. Presale Contender: Exploring What’s Driving Attention in Crypto Let’s recap and examine which option holds the most potential in today’s dynamic market. XRP draws continued interest due to market backing and regulatory progress. Dogecoin benefits from strong community energy and technical signs of movement. Solana remains active, supported by its fast network and expanding ecosystem. Still, Web3 ai is catching attention in a different way. It is currently in its presale phase, offering an AI-focused platform with practical applications. With $WAI priced at $0.000443 and more than $8.3 million raised, it has strong early traction. A projected ROI of 1747% adds to its appeal. For those exploring the top crypto right now , Web3 ai may stand out as the option with the most long-term upside when entered early.

46569814,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72206,1750626045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Dogecoin’s (DOGE) $1 Dream Faces a New Challenger, Can Ruvi AI’s Audited Token Reach It First?",https://timestabloid.com/dogecoins-doge-1-dream-faces-a-new-challenger-can-ruvi/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the people’s cryptocurrency, entertaining dreams of a $1 valuation driven by its dedicated fanbase and strong community. However, a new challenger has entered the fray, and analysts believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) might outpace Dogecoin in the race to $1. With a structured growth plan, cutting-edge technology, and an impressive presale performance, Ruvi AI has fast become the focus of investors looking for major returns. Why Ruvi AI Might Win the $1 Race Dogecoin has leaned on its meme-inspired origins and celebrity support, while Ruvi AI sets itself apart with real-world utility . By integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI solves industry problems in marketing , entertainment , and finance , ensuring demand beyond speculation. This practical approach creates long-term value that Dogecoin, lacking utility, may struggle to match. Ruvi AI also offers a structured growth model that eliminates guesswork. During Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are available for just $0.015 each , allowing early investors to enter at a low price. Once the presale concludes, the token’s value is guaranteed to reach $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts predict RUVI could hit $1 once listed , representing a 66x ROI for those who buy in now. These figures mark Ruvi AI as a serious contender in the crypto space. Presale Performance Reflects Strong Investor Support Ruvi AI’s presale has been nothing short of exceptional, with numbers that underscore its potential. Here are the key achievements so far: $1.9 million raised , underscoring strong investor interest. Over 160 million tokens sold , demonstrating healthy demand. A community of more than 1,600 holders , showcasing a growing investor base dedicated to Ruvi AI. One major factor drawing investors is the guaranteed $0.07 valuation after the presale , which contrasts with Dogecoin’s highly volatile price movements. This clarity reduces uncertainty and makes Ruvi AI a safer, more predictable investment. Amplify Returns with Ruvi AI VIP Tiers Investors aiming to maximize their gains are flocking to Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers , which offer impressive bonuses at different contribution levels. Here’s how each tier stacks up: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers allow early backers to secure significant advantages, showcasing the scalability of Ruvi AI’s returns. Transparency and Security Reinforce Ruvi AI’s Strengths Ruvi AI is not just about growth; it prioritizes investor confidence. The project recently underwent a third-party audit by CyberScope , ensuring that its platform is technologically secure and reliable. Combined with its partnership with WEEX Exchange , which guarantees post-presale liquidity , RUVI tokens will be immediately tradable upon listing, unlike many new projects that leave investors waiting. Real-World Applications Ensure Longevity While Dogecoin depends on hype and social validation, Ruvi AI’s broad utility creates sustainable value over the long term. Its real-world applications include: Marketing: AI-powered tools that improve advertising ROI by optimizing ad targeting and execution. Entertainment: Blockchain-backed payments and AI-driven personalization, boosting creators’ revenues and engagement. Finance: Fraud detection solutions, scalable systems, and enhanced transparency to modernize financial operations. These innovations not only differentiate Ruvi AI but also ensure relevance across diverse markets, making RUVI a valuable token regardless of crypto market trends. Why Ruvi AI Could Beat Dogecoin to $1 Dogecoin’s path to $1 relies heavily on market sentiment and social media buzz, while Ruvi AI’s structured growth, utility, and scalability make it a more reliable bet . Starting at just $0.015 , with a guaranteed $0.07 valuation post-presale and a forecasted $1 price , Ruvi AI offers a clear and enticing roadmap for investors. With over $1.9 million raised , 160 million tokens sold , and its partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI has already taken significant steps toward becoming a leader in the crypto space.

Chainlink (LINK) is holding steady at the $13.40 mark, supported by rising whale activity. Traders are eyeing a possible 15% rebound from this level. NEAR Protocol is making waves with its plan to reach an incredible 1 million transactions per second (TPS) this year. Its tech upgrades, including adaptive resharding and advanced zero-knowledge proofs, are driving excitement. Meanwhile, Unstaked (UNSD) is capturing massive interest in its presale. The project has now raised over $10.4 million, with more than 1.1 billion tokens sold. With its AI-first approach, Proof of Intelligence (PoI) system, and a $1 million giveaway boosting visibility, Unstaked is fast becoming one of the most talked-about new projects for 2025. For buyers seeking promising altcoins in today’s crowded market, these three stand out for their potential and unique strengths. Chainlink Defends Key $13.40 Level Chainlink (LINK) is holding firm at the $13.40 support level, catching attention after four consecutive days of decline. Large holders appear to be accumulating, with 1.78 million LINK (valued at $25.53 million) moved from BitGet to a private wallet and another $4.49 million withdrawn from exchanges, signaling long-term confidence. Despite a 6% price dip in 24 hours, trading volume rose 7%, showing strong market interest. Holding $13.40 could trigger a rally to $15.40 (a 15% gain), while a breakdown risks an 18% fall to $10.40. Thanks to its essential role in delivering data to smart contracts, LINK remains a top contender among altcoins for 2025. NEAR Targets 1 Million TPS Milestone NEAR Protocol is setting its sights on an ambitious goal, achieving 1 million transactions per second (TPS) by the end of 2025. According to R&D lead Bowen Wang, this will be powered by adaptive resharding, which allows the network to dynamically scale as user demand increases. Its current Nightshade 2.0 already handles large volumes, but adaptive resharding will enable shards to split or merge based on traffic, improving speed and efficiency. The shift to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will further enhance security. With growing institutional support, including a key partnership with DWF Labs, and strong AI capabilities, NEAR remains one of the most promising altcoins heading into 2025. Unstaked Presale Raises $10.4M With AI-Powered Innovation Leading Growth Unstaked is quickly making its mark with one of the hottest presales of the year. It has already raised more than $10.4 million and sold over 1.1 billion tokens. The project is now in Stage 21, with the coin priced at $0.011739. What makes Unstaked different is its foundation in artificial intelligence. The project runs on a new system called Proof of Intelligence (PoI), which values knowledge and contributions rather than expensive hardware. This is catching on with buyers looking for projects that offer real purpose and not just copycat technology. A $1 million giveaway is also driving huge engagement, helping Unstaked reach more potential buyers ahead of exchange listings. Community members can win prizes and help promote the project across social media. Current presale buyers have already seen steady growth from lower stages, and many expect the price to hit $0.1819 or higher after launch, offering a possible 27x gain. Importantly, Unstaked has no private allocation, meaning everyone can participate equally. The project also has a strong governance model. Coin holders can vote on key decisions, receive performance-based rewards, and use AI tools to help guide development. Unstaked supports cross-chain interactions and will launch its AI-powered agents after the presale ends and the project officially goes live. With this clear vision and growing support, Unstaked is quickly becoming one of the top presales to watch in 2025. Final Verdict As traders move funds in anticipation of a possible summer rally, Chainlink’s strong technical support, NEAR Protocol’s scaling innovations, and Unstaked’s unique AI-first model all shine as great opportunities. LINK and NEAR are established projects adapting to new demands, while Unstaked brings a fresh approach with real utility. For those looking for altcoins with real growth potential in 2025, these three projects offer the key ingredients: useful technology, active communities, and clear paths to creating long-term value.

46570025,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72232,1750626282,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu Loses Steam Near $0.000010 While Analysts Project $MERK Could 50x Before Its First CEX Listing,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-loses-steam-near-0-000010-while-analysts-project-merk/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is holding just above $0.000010 , but despite its massive community and multi-billion dollar market cap, its momentum is weakening . After peaking in late 2024, SHIB has entered a prolonged consolidation phase. Daily volumes remain steady , but without new catalysts, investor attention is drifting, not away from memecoins, but toward newer formats with built-in utility and real-time engagement. Enter Meerkat ($MERK) , a memecoin born on Ethereum, but engineered for Telegram , the platform where crypto-native culture now thrives. With staking, missions, and a gamified miniapp already live during presale, $MERK is shaping up as the first memecoin that actually rewards user action before it even lists. While Shiba Inu holds the past, analysts are watching $MERK as a high-upside contender , projecting 25x–50x potential based on working mechanics, community traction, and transparent tokenomics. Market Snapshot: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Loses Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001050 , marking a decline of over 50% compared to the previous year. Despite maintaining a substantial market cap of $7.53 billion and a loyal base of 1.5 million holders, price action remains flat and lacks clear direction. Daily trading volume hovers around $142 million , indicating that SHIB continues to attract attention from traders, but without meaningful upward movement, that interest hasn’t translated into new momentum. After a short-lived rally in Q4 2024 , SHIB has been consolidating near key psychological levels, with no major catalysts in sight. Even with the launch of Shibarium, adoption has been slower than expected, and user incentives remain weak across the ecosystem. The takeaway: SHIB still holds powerful brand recognition in the memecoin space, but it lacks the mechanisms to activate or retain users in a dynamic way. Investors looking for more than passive holding are beginning to explore alternatives that offer real-time interaction and tangible rewards. A Changing Meta: From Holding to Playing The memecoin era is undergoing a fundamental shift. While early adopters were satisfied with holding tokens in hopes of long-term appreciation, today’s crypto users are demanding more, faster. What’s emerging is a new meta: less speculation, more interaction. Less waiting, more doing. From Passive to Participatory Holding used to be enough. But now, investors want to participate actively in the ecosystem, not just watch from the sidelines. They’re looking for: ● Staking opportunities that reward time and loyalty ● Daily missions and quests that provide utility beyond charts ● Leaderboards and gamified incentives that make engagement visible and valuable In short, they want skin in the game, not just exposure. Communities Want Function, Not Just Culture Memecoins like SHIB built massive communities based on culture and identity. But today, community by itself is not enough. Modern users expect: ● Rewards for activity, not just for holding ● User-centered mechanics that evolve and scale ● Frictionless platforms that don’t require deep technical knowledge This demand is pushing attention toward platforms that blur the lines between social, DeFi, and gaming. Telegram as the New Frontier With its 800M+ monthly users and built-in support for bots and miniapps, Telegram is becoming a natural home for this new wave of crypto engagement. Projects that launch directly inside Telegram, like $MERK, are meeting users where they already are, lowering the barrier to entry and increasing retention through seamless, chat-based experiences. Conclusion: The memecoin game is evolving. And tokens that reward interaction, not just attention, are taking the lead. Telegram Becomes the New Launchpad With over 800 million monthly active users, Telegram has rapidly evolved from a messaging platform into a full-fledged crypto ecosystem. What began with simple bots has grown into a space where miniapps, tokenized experiences, and DeFi tools operate natively inside chat. The key difference lies in the frictionless onboarding. Unlike browser-based dApps that require extensions, wallets, and multi-step setups, Telegram-native tools allow users to engage with tokens, stake assets, and complete tasks with just a few taps. No dashboards, no downloads, no learning curve. This simplicity is driving a new category of adoption, one based on interaction over speculation. Bots and memecoins like $MERK are leading this shift, transforming Telegram chats into action-based economies where every click, mission, or stake creates a loop of engagement and reward. As more users prioritize ease of access and tangible activity over passive holding, utility within messaging apps is quickly becoming the new benchmark for early-stage traction in crypto. Meerkat ($MERK): From Meme to Mechanism Meerkat ($MERK) is a memecoin built on Ethereum, but its real innovation lies in how users interact with it: directly through Telegram. Unlike typical ERC-20 tokens that remain idle in wallets, $MERK is designed for immediate use. From the presale stage, users can already access a fully functional miniapp with live staking, daily missions, XP systems and real-time leaderboards, all without leaving the chat interface. Behind its playful image, Meerkat is built on solid ground. All contracts have been audited by Cyberscope, ensuring transparency and security. Fifty percent of the total supply is permanently locked via UNCX, and the remaining is structured for community access. There are no allocations for VCs or insiders, reflecting a design philosophy focused entirely on fairness and decentralization. The token launched its presale at approximately $0.00018, with confirmed exchange listings on P2B and AscendEX, providing immediate post-launch liquidity. In a space crowded with promises and roadmaps, $MERK stands out for being operational before trading begins. It’s not just a concept, it’s a product. And it’s already rewarding users for showing up. SHIB built a legacy, but $MERK is building loops that actually pay users to participate. If you’re ready to move from passive to active, start today: Check out the live missions at meerkat.wtf or join the Telegram app directly at t.me/meerkatwtf. $MERK Launches Its Own zk-Rollup Layer 2 and AI-Driven Meme Engine $MERK isn’t just building utility inside Telegram, it’s launching an entirely new blockchain layer to support it. The project has announced the deployment of its own zk-rollup Layer 2 on Ethereum, specifically designed to scale meme trading and the tokenization of digital culture. Fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), this new network enables ultra-low fees, fast confirmations, and provides a tailor-made infrastructure for the creation and exchange of viral tokens. But the Layer 2 does more than boost performance, it becomes the core engine powering Meerkat’s ecosystem. It will host both the project’s native AI module and the official Telegram miniapp, enabling users to interact directly with smart contracts and token mechanics without ever leaving the chat. While other projects focus on tokenizing traditional finance, Meerkat presents an alternative vision: a decentralized environment where value is generated through creativity, digital identity, and community energy. With the infrastructure already deployed and aligned with Web3’s cultural evolution, $MERK is positioning itself as the new cultural epicenter of the crypto space. The Burrow: On-Chain Meme Creation at Scale Alongside the launch of its Layer 2, $MERK has activated The Burrow—a fully operational creative environment where users can mint tokenized memes using generative AI and a modular SDK. The Burrow supports: ● ERC-20 and SPL collections ● Automated image and narrative generation ● Integrated minting and publishing flows ● Composability-first design for cultural scaling In short, The Burrow turns meme creation into an on-chain pipeline, seamlessly blending AI, cultural expression, and token issuance into a platform that’s ready to scale with demand. Analyst View: 25x–50x Projections if Momentum Holds With a live product, transparent tokenomics, and measurable daily activity, $MERK is attracting the attention of early-stage analysts tracking utility-based memecoins. The project’s ability to combine Ethereum’s credibility with Telegram’s accessibility is positioning it as more than a trend, it’s becoming a use case. Why Analysts Are Paying Attention Unlike most memecoins that launch with vague roadmaps and speculative hype, $MERK enters the market with working mechanics already in place. Users are actively staking, completing missions, earning XP, and climbing leaderboards, all within Telegram’s native environment. This kind of real usage is rare at this stage. Combined with a presale entry point of approximately $0.00018, a fair launch structure, and listings already confirmed, analysts are forecasting 25x to 50x potential upside, especially if user momentum continues post-TGE. Telegram-native tokens with real-time engagement loops represent an asymmetric opportunity, and in this evolving memecoin cycle, $MERK is rewarding action now, not waiting for hype to do the work. Final Thought: SHIB Is a Legacy Meme, $MERK Is the Next Format Shiba Inu walked so Meerkat ($MERK) could run. SHIB helped define what memecoins could be, community-driven, culture-rich, and impossible to ignore. But the market has evolved, and so han sus expectativas. Today, engagement equals value. Investors and users alike are no longer content with holding for hope. They want to interact, earn, compete, and grow inside the ecosystem they support. While SHIB holds its status as a meme OG, $MERK is actively shaping the next generation of crypto-native attention economies. Built on Ethereum, operational within Telegram, and fully functional from the presale stage, $MERK is not just a token, it’s a living platform. With no VCs, no insider wallets, and contracts fully audited by Cyberscope, it’s also a model of transparency.

46571024,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753472,1750627008,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46571024.jpeg,Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates due to rising oil prices and inflation risks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/federal-reserve-will-hike-rates-not-cut/,"The Federal Reserve is now heading toward rate hikes as inflation threatens to rise again. The pressure is coming from rising oil prices, triggered by military conflict in the Middle East. The US bombed three nuclear sites in Iran last Saturday night after Iran responded to earlier Israeli airstrikes. Now Iran is has shut down the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical oil route in the world. According to JP Morgan, if that happens, oil could surge to $130 per barrel, pushing US inflation to 5%. That’s the same level inflation hit in March 2023, when the Fed was hiking rates back-to-back. According to research reviewed by the Fed in 2010, a persistent oil shock leads to weaker consumption and investment, along with a hit to the dollar. In that study, they showed that countries importing oil, like the United States, get poorer as oil prices go up. The loss in national wealth leads to less spending, a weaker exchange rate, and a change in trade balances. People and businesses will try to cut down oil use, but it won’t be enough to avoid damage. The result is a worse oil trade balance and less import of other goods. The non-oil part of the trade balance improves, but only because the economy slows down. Iran warns of retaliation as US and Israel bomb nuclear sites Ten days ago, Israel carried out unprovoked airstrikes on Iranian territory. Tehran hit back. Then, over the weekend, the US joined the fight and dropped bombs on three nuclear facilities in Iran. In response, Iran’s foreign minister said the country “reserves all options to defend its sovereignty.” But since 2000, Iran has threatened over ten times to close off the Strait of Hormuz. If they actually go through with it this time, energy prices will definitely explode. The Strait is only 21 miles wide but carries one-fifth of the world’s oil every day. It also sees more traffic than both the Panama and Suez Canals. About 35% of all seaborne LNG also passes through it. The US Navy has kept forces in the area for decades because of how strategic it is. A map showing Iran, UAE, Oman, circling the Strait of Hormuz Hormuz is the only way out of the Persian Gulf by sea. If Iran closes it, the world loses access to a massive portion of oil supply overnight. That would almost guarantee a military response from Washington, Tel Aviv, or most likely both. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News on Sunday that China should intervene and talk Iran down. “I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil.” China is Iran’s biggest oil customer and maintains friendly diplomatic ties with Tehran, publicly condemning Israel’s actions. Trump demands rate cuts while Powell stays silent While global tension rises, President Donald Trump continues to push for interest rate cuts. Even before his reelection in 2024, Trump had been attacking Jerome Powell and demanding cheaper borrowing costs. Since returning to the White House, he’s kept up the heat. Trump has criticized the Fed Chair publicly nearly every week, insulting Powell both at press conferences and online. Powell, for his part, hasn’t said anything. He avoids reacting, never comments on the insults, and refuses to take the bait. But rate cuts right now are not realistic. With oil possibly hitting $130 and inflation climbing back toward 5%, cutting rates could add fuel to the fire. Instead, the Federal Reserve will likely raise them again, just like they did in 2023. The link between oil and inflation is well known. The Fed’s own modeling from the research we mentioned earlier shows how damaging oil shocks are, especially when financial markets can’t absorb the risk. The worse the shock, the harder it is to fight the resulting high inflation. With Trump pushing for cuts and Powell boxed in by rising costs, the Federal Reserve is once again facing political and economic pressure at the same time.

With this move, Texas has become the third state in the US to create an official Bitcoin reserve. According to the Bitcoin Laws platform, which tracks digital asset laws, 47 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced in 26 states so far, with 13 bills under active consideration at the federal level. This growing interest in digital asset reserves across the country parallels the policies of Donald Trump, who was re-elected in November 2024. Trump, who took office in January, has taken extensive steps to transform the U.S. into a more crypto-friendly environment, including reversing anti-crypto banking practices (debanking), appointing pro-crypto figures to key regulatory positions, and establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

The company believes crypto can help solve key problems in today’s financial system, such as rising debt, inflation, and growing distrust in banks. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are not just new forms of money. They are tools that can help build a stronger, fairer economy. Global Debt and Inflation Are Rising In a post on X, the Coinbase CEO highlighted serious problems in the global economy. Government debt is rising quickly, especially in the U.S., where the national debt has now reached over $36 trillion. At the same time, inflation makes money worth less and everyday costs higher. This makes it harder for people to save, invest, or plan. Armstrong said these issues are reducing economic freedom and trust in banks. Bitcoin and Digital Currencies Offer a New Option In response to these problems, more people are turning to digital assets like Bitcoin. Coinbase CEO says the rising price of the flagship crypto shows that people are looking for safer alternatives. These assets are becoming a place to protect wealth from inflation and government overspending. Unlike traditional money, crypto can be sent quickly and cheaply across borders. It does not rely on central banks or large financial firms. This gives people more control over their money, especially in places with weak banking systems or unstable currencies. Many crypto leaders have also suggested using Bitcoin to reduce the U.S. national debt. In February, a new report from VanEck, an investment management firm, shed light on whether this plan is feasible . Crypto Is Not Just About Investment The Coinbase leader explained that crypto is more than a way to make money. It is a technology that can improve the financial system. It can speed up payments, lower fees, and support new business ways. Artists and creators can earn income directly from their audience without giving a significant share to middlemen. Armstrong said Coinbase is building new tools to make this possible. These include simple business payment systems and a crypto card that rewards users in Bitcoin . Coinbase aims to make crypto valuable in everyday life, not just as an investment but as a practical solution for modern finance. Coinbase is Building A New Foundation for the Financial System According to Coinbase, the world needs to rebuild its financial system from the ground up. The company believes crypto can be the foundation for this change. Under the leadership of its CEO, Coinbase is expanding its role from a trading platform to a complete financial services provider. It now supports various digital tools and wants to help build the next generation of internet-based financial systems.

The launch is Tesla’s first real-world test of its plan to deploy fully autonomous vehicles that rely entirely on cameras and AI, not the sensors and LiDAR systems used by rivals like Waymo. Leading up to the launch, Elon had teased the rollout for months on X, and on Sunday, that promise turned real. Social media posts and videos from the area showed Tesla-branded Model Y robotaxis cruising through the city, officially marking the start of the new service. Tesla had earlier sent early access invites to a limited number of users, giving them the ability to download the Robotaxi app and hail rides starting that same day. Many of the first users posting online were already well-known Tesla supporters on X. Tesla begins with 10 vehicles and safety monitors in South Austin The service is starting out small. According to Tesla’s new Robotaxi info page, which went live on June 22, just 10 Model Y SUVs are being used within a small, specific part of South Austin. Rides are available daily from 6:00 a.m. to midnight, but may stop during bad weather. Every ride includes a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat, listed as a “safety monitor.” Tesla has not explained if this employee has control over the vehicle or access to a kill switch. Notably, these are not the futuristic Cybercabs that Elon unveiled in October 2024. Tesla instead chose to use updated 2025 versions of its Model Y, equipped with a new version of its Full Self-Driving software—what Elon describes as “unsupervised” autonomy. These vehicles are fully driverless but still include the safety monitor up front, breaking from what companies like Waymo and the now-paused Cruise used to do with human backup drivers. Ed Niedermeyer, author of Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors , confirmed the location of a Robotaxi depot near Oltorf Street. He reportedly observed branded robotaxis entering and exiting the parking lot in the days leading up to the launch. On Sunday morning, he spotted a Model Y robotaxi brake suddenly twice, once while crossing an intersection. In both cases, it was passing parked police cars. There were no riders inside during these events. Tesla restricts press access and blocks transparency efforts Most details about the Robotaxi rollout have come from Elon’s own posts or from early users sharing footage. Tesla hasn’t released key data and has actively tried to keep information from being made public. It allegedly blocked TechCrunch’s public records request with the Texas Department of Transportation, and also tried to stop the City of Austin from giving documents to Reuters. In April, Taylor White, Tesla’s senior counsel for infrastructure, wrote a letter to the Texas Attorney General’s office claiming that some of the requested documents included confidential information, trade secrets, or business data shared with TxDOT. On the safety side, in-cabin cameras won’t be on during rides by default. Tesla says the camera will only activate if there’s an emergency or if support is requested. It may also turn on after a trip ends to verify the car’s readiness for its next ride. Tesla’s new info page also lists several rider rules. Riders are banned from smoking, vaping, drinking, doing drugs, or using the vehicle for any criminal activity. The company says anyone who records and shares content that violates these rules can have their access suspended or terminated. After the launch, Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla’s head of Autopilot and self-driving, posted a photo from a Robotaxi launch party. Elon followed up on X, posting: “Super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!!

That token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a new DeFi project trading for mere cents yet gaining serious traction on social media and investor forums. The project is in phase 5 of its presale which has already sold out over 40%. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $10.9 million and attracted over 12,300 holders. For those wondering what to buy this summer this could be the next big cryptocurrency to generate generational wealth for those who move before the crowd catches on. Mutuum Finance Presale Enters Phase 5 As Investor Interest Skyrockets Mutuum Finance is gaining strong momentum in Phase 5 of its presale. Growing into a contender in DeFi the project stands out from its competitors by offering a scalable inflation-proof system of finance with real-world practical application. Investor interest is picking up speed with the project already having garnered more than $10.9 million and counting more than 12,300 token holders. Since the official listing price is $0.06 the existing investors are going to get a chance to 2x their investment once the token goes live. Not only is there a cool short-term return on investment but there is also long-term value potential. A New DeFi Lending Model with Full Asset Ownership Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol with users retaining their full ownership of assets while they participate in decentralized lending. The project uses a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending for enhanced flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system makes use of smart contracts to offer automated lending without any human intervention and in its place the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Through this auto mechanism, lenders’ and borrowers’ world becomes stabilized and predictable. Peer-to-Peer model on the other hand employs no intermediaries and thus offers a direct link among lenders and borrowers. This method is very dear to participants in dealing with volatile assets, where personalized conditions and flexibility are required. Such lending protocols provide start-to-end seamless DeFi experience that is perfectly tailored to the needs of the user and which is safer, transparent, and more customizable than other centralized lending products. Fully Collateralized Stablecoin and CertiK-Verified Security In addition to its lending innovation, Mutuum Finance is also developing the fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin has a competitive advantage over the algorithmic peers in that it is less prone to depegging. Mutuum Finance is based on trust and security. The project smart contracts are rigorously audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security companies. In addition to ensuring the integrity and transparency of the code base this audit also proves that the team is dedicated to building a secure DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance is quickly making waves in the crypto market with over $10.9 million raised and more than 12,300 early investors already on board. Still priced at just $0.03 in its current presale phase buyers stand to double their money at launch. Mutuum Finance is primed for a 21000% rally after launch which means early investors will turn $500 into $105,500 before the year ends. For anyone who feels they missed the boat on the last big DeFi breakout this could be the second chance you’ve been waiting for.

This record reflects increasing network activity and points to the continued maturity of the XRP ecosystem. Built-In Burn Mechanism Continues to Shrink Supply Unlike other cryptocurrencies that rely on halving events or fixed supply caps, XRP features a built-in burn mechanism that destroys a small amount of XRP with every transaction. This design helps prevent spam and slowly reduces the total supply over time. According to the latest figures from XRPScan, 14,003,265 XRP have been burned to date. This not only marks a new all-time high but also reinforces the growing utility of the network. On-Chain Growth Accelerates Recent data from Santiment shows a significant surge in activity across the XRP Ledger. The number of daily active addresses has jumped to over 295,000 —up sharply from the 35,000 to 40,000 daily average seen over the last three months. This increase signals a rising demand for the ledger’s features, including fast settlement, low fees, and native tokenization support. In addition, the number of whale and shark wallets holding at least 1 million XRP has now exceeded 2,700, a historic high for the nearly 12-year-old asset. This trend reflects growing interest from high-value investors and long-term holders. Price Holds Steady Amid Profit-Taking Despite strong fundamentals, XRP’s price has yet to fully reflect the on-chain momentum. As of report time, XRP is trading at $1.97, according to CoinMarketCap. This marks a major increase from its pre-rally level before November 2024, giving early investors sizable gains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, data from Glassnode shows a wave of profit realization, with early holders cashing out at a rate of $68.8 million per day. This selling pressure could weigh on XRP in the short term. If the $2 support level fails to hold, a nalysts warn the price could retreat toward $1.61. Outlook Hinges on Key Technical Levels On the flip side, if buyers return and manage to push the price above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2.27, XRP could continue trading within its current range. A decisive break above $2.65 would likely confirm renewed bullish momentum and potentially trigger a fresh rally. While the current price action reflects mixed sentiment, XRP’s underlying metrics—rising network usage, deflationary tokenomics, and increased whale accumulation—paint a picture of long-term strength.

Solana (SOL) is heading toward a $258 target, showing signs of strong momentum. Ethereum Classic (ETC) also appears to be gaining traction, with charts pointing to a move toward $50. At the same time, BlockDAG is making quiet progress that’s getting noticed. With mining units being shipped, a US sponsorship secured, and exchange listings in the pipeline, BlockDAG’s presale has already hit $317 million on its way to a $600 million goal. Its steady rise is catching attention. Whether you’re following SOL, ETC, or BlockDAG (BDAG) , all three are making a case to be the best new crypto to buy right now. Solana Eyes Key Levels as $258 Target Comes Into View Solana (SOL) is now trading around $149.30, sitting inside the golden Fibonacci zone. This range is known for trend changes. A falling wedge pattern has formed, which often leads to a bullish breakout. If this happens, the next Solana (SOL) price target could hit $204.31, $229.01, and possibly $258.45. That would mean gains of 60% to 100%. Support levels between $128 and $140 add strength to the case for a breakout. Although the market remains unpredictable, current signs favor a move upward. For those tracking Solana (SOL), this setup is one to watch. ETC Builds Strength as Price Charts Signal a Breakout Ethereum Classic (ETC) is starting to draw interest from traders. Priced around $16.78, the ETC chart shows a symmetrical triangle and a recent breakout from a falling wedge. Both patterns are seen as positive signals. If this momentum stays, ETC could climb toward the $21 to $50 range. Key levels are important now. ETC needs to hold above $17.50 to stay on track. If it falls under $16.80, selling pressure may return. With high trading volume, active users, and a solid network, the Ethereum Classic (ETC) price chart could be setting up for a bigger move. BlockDAG Raises the Bar With Steady Progress and Delivery In a market full of hype and promises, BlockDAG is standing out by focusing on results. Instead of talking about what might happen, the project is already making moves, building out features, and growing a real community. Recently, BlockDAG shared shipping dates for its miners, something many projects do not deliver on. The X30 and X100 miners are set to ship starting July 7, and the X10 will follow in August. Over 2 million users are now using the X1 mobile miner, showing that BlockDAG’s tools are ready and working from day one. The pace continues to pick up. On June 20, BlockDAG plans to reveal a US-based sponsorship deal that could help bring it more attention before it begins trading. In the background, the launch looks well prepared. Exchange listings are already confirmed on 20 centralized platforms including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, and LBank. Wallet support is also ready, and the X1 Miner app is live, showing that BlockDAG’s features match what users want. So far, the project has raised $317 million and delivered a 2,660% return since its first batch. The current price of $0.0020 is still active for a short time. BlockDAG is showing that results count. For those looking at the best new crypto to buy for 2025, this one is getting serious attention. Final Thoughts on Where Things Stand Now To wrap things up, the Solana (SOL) price target remains solid, backed by strong momentum that keeps it on many watchlists. Ethereum Classic (ETC) also shows promise with bullish signs on its chart. But BlockDAG is standing out in a unique way. With miner shipments confirmed, a US sponsorship reveal coming soon, and exchange listings already set, the project is showing steady results rather than just plans. The presale has reached nearly $317 million as more interest grows. For those tracking the best new crypto to buy , BlockDAG is now leading the conversation.

But today, analysts are turning their gaze toward Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a rising crypto powered by blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) . With a structured growth model and a fast-growing community, Ruvi AI is inching closer to becoming the next $1 project. Could it replicate Bitcoin’s meteoric rise? Why Ruvi AI Is Emerging as a $1 Contender While Bitcoin built its empire on its scarcity and decentralized technology, Ruvi AI offers pragmatic utility by solving pressing challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance. Combining AI and blockchain, Ruvi AI delivers real-world value rather than relying solely on market sentiment or speculative demand. Ruvi AI’s structured growth roadmap provides investors with clarity and confidence. Currently priced at just $0.015 in Phase 2 of its presale , Ruvi AI offers an accessible entry point. Once the presale ends, the token’s price will increase to $0.07 , representing an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts project that RUVI could go further, reaching $1 post-listing , a 66x ROI for those who invest early. This calculated growth puts Ruvi AI ahead of its competitors in terms of predictability and potential returns. A Presale That Signals Strong Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale performance has demonstrated remarkable momentum, confirming its appeal to investors. Key measurable highlights include: Over $1.9 million raised so far More than 160 million tokens sold , showing strong demand Over 1,600 token holders , underscoring a solid and growing community Importantly, the post-presale valuation of $0.07 is not speculative hype but rather a part of Ruvi AI’s structured pricing strategy. This planned progression provides transparency, differentiating Ruvi AI from many speculative and volatile crypto projects. Earn Bigger Returns with Ruvi AI VIP Tiers Investors looking to amplify their returns can benefit from Ruvi AI’s highly rewarding VIP investment tiers .

46574695,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753414,1750631160,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46574695.jpeg,"After $68M Win With Shiba Inu, This Crypto Investor is Bagging SHIB’s Newest Rival Priced lower Than $0.01",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/after-68m-win-with-shiba-inu-this-crypto-investor-is-bagging-shibs-newest-rival-priced-lower-than-0-01/,"One such tale that’s become legendary within crypto circles is that of an early Shiba Inu (SHIB) investor who turned a modest investment into a staggering $68 million. Now, with SHIB showing signs of maturing and fewer parabolic moves on the horizon, that same investor has set their sights on a new meme coin— Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . It’s a bold pivot, but not without reason. LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin hoping to replicate the viral success of Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Dogecoin. It’s been quietly building what many are calling the next big thing in meme coin evolution—combining culture, innovation, and infrastructure. And judging by the early numbers and community sentiment, it may be the only meme coin in 2025 worth watching this closely. Shiba Inu’s Rise and Plateau The story of Shiba Inu is legendary. SHIB defied expectations and delivered one of the most jaw-dropping ROI stories in crypto history. One investor reportedly turned just $8,000 into nearly $70 million in under two years. That kind of gain is rare—some would even say once-in-a-generation. But even fairytales have ceilings. After reaching its peak, SHIB has struggled to recapture that magic. While still boasting a passionate community and solid developments, such as its Layer 2 network, SHIB’s growth has become incremental. The low-cap volatility and overnight 100x possibilities that drew early investors are no longer present. That’s precisely why the investor who made millions from SHIB is shifting focus. The next opportunity, in their view, lies in something much earlier in its life cycle. Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—a token that combines meme energy with serious architecture. LILPEPE’s Presale Momentum Signals Something Big Still in its third presale stage, LILPEPE is priced at just $0.0012—a fraction of a cent. Despite being early in its rollout, the project has already raised over $1.3 million, surpassing early targets and selling out previous presale stages in a remarkably short time. Unlike most meme coins that launch and rely solely on virality, LILPEPE is building an ecosystem from the ground up. The token plans to evolve into a Layer 2 blockchain dedicated entirely to meme coins, offering fast and cheap transactions, and, more importantly, built-in resistance to sniper bots. This makes it one of the few meme projects that not only appeals to traders and degens but also to developers and serious builders. The platform will also feature a meme-focused launchpad, enabling new meme projects to launch within the LILPEPE ecosystem. It’s a meme coin with utility, infrastructure, and a vision that stretches beyond hype. Listings, Community, and a Massive Giveaway LILPEPE isn’t relying on just plans and promises—it’s actively expanding its visibility and reach. The project has confirmed two top-tier centralized exchange listings upon launch and has shared that plans are in place to debut on the world’s biggest crypto exchange. For a token in presale, these moves are exceptionally bullish and speak to the legitimacy of what’s being built. What’s more, the team has launched an ambitious $777,000 giveaway , with 10 lucky winners each set to receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. This is rapidly expanding the project’s footprint and increasing awareness. Backed by Anonymous Experts Who Know Meme Coins There’s also buzz about the team behind the project. While they’ve chosen to remain anonymous, insiders suggest that the project is being backed by individuals who have previously played pivotal roles in some of the most successful meme coins in history. Their strategic fingerprints—tight presale mechanics, community-first rollouts, sniper bot protections—are all over LILPEPE. This blend of stealth experience and public-facing energy is part of what’s drawn in larger investors, including the former SHIB whale. If these seasoned builders execute their roadmap, LILPEPE won’t just compete with SHIB—it could surpass it in both cultural and financial impact. Is History About to Repeat? Investors who missed out on SHIB in 2020 often ask, “When will the next opportunity like that come?” For those watching the meme coin space closely, that moment may be arriving again. And LILPEPE is shaping up to be the token that leads the charge. It has a low price, ambitious infrastructure, exchange plans, and viral momentum to transition from a microcap to a market giant. And if someone who turned $8k into $68 million with SHIB is now watching LILPEPE this closely, the rest of us should be too. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a chance for lightning to strike twice.

46574251,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/will-pepe-get-the-doge-treatment-elon-musk-shows-love-on-twitter,1750631290,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/46574251.jpeg,Will PEPE Get the Doge Treatment? Elon Musk Shows Love on Twitter,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/will-pepe-get-the-doge-treatment-elon-musk-shows-love-on-twitter,"Meme coins have consistently stirred up excitement in the crypto market. With Elon Musk once again giving attention to Pepe (PEPE) on Twitter, speculators are wondering if it could mirror Dogecoin’s historic surge. Musk’s influence on meme-based assets is well-documented, having previously propelled Dogecoin to record highs through a series of supportive tweets. In December 2024, AI-generated images featuring Pepe the Frog began appearing on his X (formerly Twitter) feed, sparking a new wave of speculation. Though no direct endorsement has been made, the association alone has historically been enough to trigger major price moves. Investors are now closely watching whether this renewed spotlight could inject fresh momentum into PEPE’s trajectory, despite its recent downturn. Meanwhile, a new contender, #Pepeto has emerged with a clear mission to address the core issues that held PEPE back. Unlike most meme coins fueled by internet virality, #Pepeto is presenting a structured and utility-driven roadmap that blends community culture with real technological infrastructure. How Pepeto Stacks Up Against Classic Meme Tokens Compared to established tokens like Dogecoin and PEPE, Pepeto enters with notable upgrades. Dogecoin rose on community strength and celebrity tweets, but lacked technological substance. PEPE, while gaining traction in early 2024, is currently showing signs of instability. Its price now hovers around $0.000009187 , a significant dip over the past week. In contrast, #Pepeto’s architecture centers on sustainability and optimization. It includes unique elements like token staking, a proprietary memecoin exchange, and a cross-chain bridge. These features add utility far beyond mere speculation. Hence, while Dogecoin and PEPE surfed waves of hype, Pepeto aims to establish long-term relevance. Pepeto’s Momentum: Presale, Price, and Potential As of press time, the price of $Pepeto is at $0.000000136 , and much of the presale has already been sold. The presale has generated $5,459,786.70 out of a target of $5.7 million, which indicates good early interest from investors. The staking model used in Pepeto is turning out to be a significant attraction in addition to the low entry barrier to buyers. It has an estimated yearly return rate of 276%, which makes it appealing to long-term investors. The project has already gained real traction with more than 30 trillion tokens staked. In addition, the ecosystem will introduce an exchange targeting meme tokens in particular. This addresses one of the gaps in the memecoin market by providing liquidity, security, and accessibility at the same time. Such usefulness, complemented by smooth interoperability via the bridge provided by Pepeto, will build a sound ecosystem in which meme assets could prosper. - Updates on $PEPETO exchange soon; once done, the day of judgement (Date of listing) would be days after - $PEPETO , The God of Frogs. pic.twitter.com/Aay4Tv5HCb — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 1, 2025 Why Pepeto Could Redefine the Meme Coin Landscape The pathway in the Pepeto roadmap does not dwell only on marketing but also draws stages on security, society, and technological rollout. The smart contracts have already been audited, and a staking platform has already been launched. Participation by the community via AMAs and strategic exchange listing presents credibility in the rollout. In Phase 3, the real-use applications come into operation with the launch of the bridge test and exchange test, and the completion of a full-scale marketing campaign in Phase 4. This plan guarantees that Pepeto is more than a meme; it is a movement founded on innovation. Moreover, it has sustainable tokenomics : 30% presale, 30% staking, 20% marketplace, 7.5% development, and 12.5% liquidity. These distributions guarantee environmental well-being and avoid abrupt discharges. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful, utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

33767162,[object Object],1750631443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Chainlink Transfers $149 Million To Binance – Another Post-Unlock Rally?,https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-transfers-149-million-to-binance-another-post-unlock-rally/,"Chainlink (LINK) has come under intense pressure, shedding more than 33% of its value since hitting local highs in May. The combination of escalating Middle East tensions and growing macroeconomic uncertainty—fueled by rising US Treasury yields and a cautious Federal Reserve—has shaken investor confidence across crypto markets. In this environment, bulls have lost control of LINK’s trend, and the price now searches for a solid support base. Adding to the pressure, fresh on-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that noncirculating supply wallets associated with Chainlink deposited 17.875 million LINK—worth approximately $149 million—into Binance earlier today. This large inflow to a centralized exchange raises concerns about potential selling activity and has further weighed on market sentiment. Historically, Chainlink’s unlocks have often triggered volatile price action. While some of these events have preceded price rallies, current market conditions make any bullish response uncertain. The market is now closely watching how LINK will behave near critical support levels as the token battles both technical weakness and a challenging macro backdrop. Whether accumulation resumes or downside pressure intensifies will depend on how global risk appetite and on-chain behavior evolve in the coming days. Chainlink Faces Critical Support Test Amid Market Pressure Chainlink continues to build fundamental strength through key partnerships and steady development, even as global tensions and macroeconomic instability weigh heavily on altcoin markets. With growing adoption across traditional finance and Web3 infrastructure, LINK’s long-term outlook remains robust. However, short-term price action tells a different story. Since peaking in May, Chainlink has seen a steep retracement, now down over 33%, and must defend current levels to avoid triggering a deeper correction. Against the backdrop of escalating Middle East conflict and tightening financial conditions, most altcoins have lost ground relative to Bitcoin, and LINK has been no exception. Bitcoin dominance recently hit new highs, siphoning capital away from smaller-cap assets. As a result, Chainlink bulls are under pressure to protect key support levels and prevent further erosion of momentum. Adding to investor anxiety, Lookonchain data shows that Chainlink non-circulating supply wallets transferred 17.875 million LINK—valued at roughly $149 million—to Binance earlier today. These movements raise concerns of possible selling pressure. However, historical data provides some optimism. Chainlink has conducted 11 major unlocks in the past, and many were followed by price increases as liquidity was absorbed and demand recovered. LINK Price Analysis: Breakdown Extends As Support Levels Crumble Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading near $11.98 after breaking below key support zones that had previously held throughout Q2 2025. The daily chart clearly shows a persistent downtrend since mid-May, marked by a series of lower highs and lower lows. LINK has now lost over 33% since its May peak near $18, and the most recent candle confirms a clean breakdown below the $12 psychological level. The 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) are all positioned above the current price, reflecting a strong bearish momentum. The 50-day SMA recently crossed below the 100-day SMA, reinforcing short-term weakness. Moreover, LINK is now trading at levels not seen since early November 2024, exposing the asset to further downside risk if no strong demand emerges soon. This technical deterioration comes as Lookonchain data reveals that 17.875 million LINK (worth $149M) from noncirculating wallets was deposited into Binance—fueling fears of further selling pressure. While historically many unlock events were followed by recoveries, the current macroeconomic environment, combined with Bitcoin dominance surging and altcoins underperforming, may delay any bounce.

Leading this charge are three altcoins with an unmistakable edge: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and the rising star FloppyPepe (FPPE) . As the first half of the year ends, investors are eyeing high-potential altcoins that could 100x by July, and these three are positioned to dominate. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI-Powered Meme Coin with Explosive Upside While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have long been staples in the world of altcoins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as the game-changer. This altcoin newcomer redefines the meme coin sector. It's secret? A shrinking supply model combined with zero transaction taxes makes it the ideal investment for those seeking maximum returns. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is far more than a traditional meme token. It blends artificial intelligence with decentralized finance, making it a powerhouse altcoin. Its AI agents, like the Meme‑o‑Matic and FloppyX Video AI, assist creators and influencers in generating compelling memes and captivating video content from text prompts. FloppyAI, a conversational AI bot trained to provide precise crypto insights based on user prompts. Start prompt here . This AI-based utility positions FloppyPepe (FPPE) at the center of a growing trend that will dominate the altcoin space in 2025. 100x - 550x For Early Investors With 80% Bonus With the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale in Stage 2, tokens are available at $0.00000035, and early adopters are offered an 80% bonus with code ""FLOPPY80."" Experts project this meme coin can rise 550x by July, making early entry a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Here’s how a modest investment could grow: Initial Investment Potential ROI at 550x Growth $1,000 $550,000 $5,000 $2,750,000 $10,000 $5,500,000 Unlike Ethereum (ETH), which carries high gas fees, this meme coin boasts no transaction taxes. Its deflationary mechanism burns 1% of every transaction, reducing supply and rewarding holders. Another 1% goes directly to holders, making the token an ideal long-term hold. With the presale in its second phase and liquidity pouring in, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining unstoppable momentum with increasing whale activity. Those joining now can secure life-changing returns. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart Contract King Ethereum (ETH) has long been the bedrock of decentralized finance and NFT ecosystems. The shift to proof-of-stake and scalability improvements solidifies Ethereum’s (ETH) role in the next wave of altcoins. Yet despite its dominance, Ethereum (ETH) is still weighed down by rising gas fees and network congestion. While Ethereum (ETH) may struggle to deliver the same level of returns as smaller, more agile projects. “Titan Of Crypto,” an analyst on X, is optimistic about a breakout that can fuel a potential Ethereum (ETH) 100x rally, which could spark a revival for other altcoins, making now the best time to accumulate. Solana (SOL): The High‑Speed Challenger Solana (SOL) shines with its blazing transaction speeds and low costs, making it one of the best-performing altcoins of the last cycle. Solana’s (SOL) strong developer base and expanding ecosystem continue to draw attention. Solana (SOL) has seen a decline in price lately, currently trading at $145, but its 1H chart is promising, and SOSA, a trader on X, confirms a push towards $154. However, unlike FloppyPepe’s curated burns, Solana’s (SOL) highly circulated supply and institutional focus limit its potential, making it ideal for more conservative allocations rather than breakout plays. The New Leader of the Altcoins Movement While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain cornerstones of the altcoin market , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to dominate as the breakout star of 2025. Its AI-driven meme generation, zero transaction tax, and deflationary supply model set it apart from traditional offerings. The ongoing presale, currently in its second stage, presents the chance to secure a stake in a project designed to deliver a 550x ROI. Act now and join the wave of early adopters who recognize FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) unique potential.

BNB & XLM Show Rally",https://thecoinrise.com/with-a-us-based-sponsorship-incoming-blockdags-presale-hits-317m-bnb-xlm-show-rally/,"The Binance Coin (BNB) price chart is climbing steadily with rising trading volume, suggesting that strong accumulation may be underway. At the same time, the Stellar (XLM) price surge has moved above resistance levels, signaling renewed focus on its role in cross-border payments. With both coins showing strength, attention is building, but where is the real potential? That brings us to BlockDAG (BDAG) , currently gaining serious attention as one of the top new cryptos before it officially lists. With over $317 million already secured, a completed audit, and 2 million users mining through its mobile X1 app, it’s working through a detailed six-week rollout strategy. As momentum continues through its US-based sponsorship and focused release roadmap, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a serious contender, potentially outshining some of the largest names in crypto. This presale period is becoming an important point to watch closely. Structured Launch Plan Shows BlockDAG’s Preparation BlockDAG isn’t just collecting funds, it’s putting them to work. The GO LIVE schedule outlines a clear six-week framework leading up to the exchange debut, with each week bringing key releases: presale wrap-up, mainnet setup, airdrops, DeFi tools, and launch of community apps. This structured planning shows BlockDAG as a rare project progressing on execution rather than speculation. Now halfway through its $600 million presale, BlockDAG has already deployed mainnet nodes, completed security checks via CertiK and Halborn, and activated its app with 2 million mobile users. With Batch 29 underway, those getting in now are still ahead of the launch. Early backers have already seen a 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. As the vesting contract prepares to release 40% of tokens, utility is coming online fast, even before trading begins. Plans for listing include appearances on over 20 exchanges, the launch of a DEX, lending system, launchpad, OTC desk, and cross-chain bridge. None of this is last-minute; it’s a calculated strategy for bringing usage and access from day one. The presale, currently offering a special limited-time price of $0.0020 (in Batch 29 priced at $0.0276), is drawing attention from new retail buyers daily. It will rise to $0.0030 in just 3 days. BlockDAG’s crypto presale now exceeds $317 million, showing strong momentum ahead of launch. BNB Price Chart Reflects Market Confidence The Binance Coin (BNB) price chart recently pushed beyond $700, peaking at $715 during the week before settling above $680. That level is holding strong, indicating support strength. Market watchers are tracking the $720 resistance mark, which could lead to another upward swing if buying interest continues. BNB’s chart behavior continues to respect critical technical levels during pullbacks. This has drawn consistent attention from retail and larger market participants alike. With its involvement in DeFi, staking, and launchpads, BNB serves as a central utility in the Binance network. Continued price strength could drive it past $720 and toward $750, putting it among the stronger large-cap options currently on the table. XLM Continues Rally After Breaking Resistance Stellar (XLM) has climbed back above $0.15, reaching its highest level in weeks. The bounce from just below $0.14 was met with strong buying, reinforcing that support zone. The upward trend has resumed with higher lows forming on the chart, suggesting a possible move toward the $0.17 mark. What’s fueling this rise? Interest in XLM’s use as a bridge between fiat and crypto has grown, especially around international payments. With real use cases gaining ground, the Stellar (XLM) price surge is more than a technical move; it reflects growing adoption. If adoption continues and new partnerships emerge, this strength could carry forward. XLM’s mix of short-term strength and practical use makes it worth watching. In a Nutshell! BNB has maintained a steady climb, holding support near $600 and possibly preparing for another push higher if key averages stay intact. Meanwhile, Stellar is pushing upward with confirmation above $0.15 and building momentum toward $0.17. For those following new projects closely, BNB and XLM stand out for both their chart patterns and practical roles in the crypto space. But BlockDAG deserves equal focus. Backed by $317 million in funding, a six-week GO LIVE strategy, and a limited-time $0.0020 offer, it’s already showing results long before listing. With 2 million users, early growth of 2,660% since Batch 1, and 20 exchange listings already revealed, BlockDAG is quickly turning early support into visible progress.

However, a new challenger has emerged, and analysts are starting to wonder if Ruvi AI (RUVI) could step up to the throne. Combining artificial intelligence and blockchain , Ruvi AI has captured attention with its structured growth strategy, real-world utility , and predictions of a 66x ROI . Thanks to a successful third-party audit and a presale that has raised significant funds, some believe Ruvi AI is a stronger bet than Avalanche for those seeking oversized gains. Why Analysts Say Ruvi AI Could Challenge Avalanche Avalanche established itself by solving blockchain scalability issues, drawing developers to its robust network. However, Ruvi AI builds on this scalability by integrating AI-powered applications that solve real-world problems across marketing , entertainment , and finance . While Avalanche focuses on its infrastructure, Ruvi AI’s versatility appeals to a broader user base, ensuring steady token demand. Ruvi AI also appeals to investors with its well-defined growth roadmap. During Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are priced at just $0.015 each , making early entry highly accessible. When the presale concludes, Ruvi AI will lock in a $0.07 price , providing early backers with an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts are already forecasting the token price to rise to $1 after listing , translating to an incredible 66x ROI for presale participants. Strong Presale Metrics Signal Investor Confidence Ruvi AI’s performance in the presale phase is paving the way for its future success. Here’s a snapshot of its achievements so far: $1.9 million raised , underscoring strong demand and market interest. Over 160 million tokens sold , proving that early adopters recognize its potential. More than 1,600 holders , forming a loyal and growing investor base. What sets Ruvi AI apart during its presale is the guaranteed post-presale valuation of $0.07 , offering a level of transparency uncommon in the volatile crypto market. This approach reduces the uncertainty often encountered in similar projects and makes Ruvi AI a safer bet. Enhance Returns with Ruvi AI’s VIP Levels Investors looking to maximize profits can take advantage of Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers , offering substantial bonuses depending on contribution levels. Here’s how they stack up: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for exponential growth, making Ruvi AI’s presale an attractive entry point for investors. Transparency and Security Solidify Ruvi AI’s Appeal Ruvi AI has already demonstrated its commitment to security and transparency, gaining investor trust through its successful third-party audit by CyberScope . This audit ensures that the platform is technologically sound and secure, alleviating concerns for potential backers. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity. Investors will be able to trade RUVI tokens as soon as they are listed on major exchanges, offering a seamless transition from presale involvement to open-market trading. Practical Applications Drive Demand for RUVI Tokens Unlike Avalanche, Ruvi AI doesn’t rely solely on its technical prowess. It actively solves problems across industries, ensuring long-term value for its users and token holders. Some standout applications include: Marketing: Businesses use Ruvi AI’s intelligent advertising solutions to optimize targeting, maximize ROI, and streamline campaign spend. Entertainment: Content creators enjoy blockchain-secured payments and AI-driven insights that enhance audience engagement and revenue. Finance: Institutions leverage Ruvi AI’s fraud detection capabilities, along with its scalable solutions for global financial systems, to boost transparency and efficiency. This diverse utility secures Ruvi AI’s relevance in multiple markets, making it a robust competitor to both Avalanche and other crypto giants. Is Ruvi AI Ready to Replace Avalanche? What makes Ruvi AI such a standout in the crypto world is its balanced focus on growth, innovation, and real-world problem-solving. From its $0.015 entry price to its forecasted $1 valuation , the token offers impressive returns while mitigating risk with a structured plan and transparent operations. Avalanche may have achieved great milestones, but Ruvi AI’s versatile approach and high ROI potential make it a game-changing contender. With $1.9 million raised , 160 million tokens sold , and partnerships with leaders like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is ready to leave a lasting mark on the cryptocurrency industry.

The duo used the USD-pegged stablecoin to smuggle funds raised from voice phishing scams overseas. USDT Money Laundering Ring: Defendants Jailed for Two Years The South Korean media outlet Financial News reported that the Criminal Division of the Seoul Eastern District Court’s Presiding Judge Lee Jeong-hyeong sentenced the duo to two years in prison each on June 22. The Seoul Eastern District Court, in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Pectus Solentis [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The defendants were identified as a college student surnamed Duong (23) and an unemployed individual surnamed Pham (also 23). The court found both individuals guilty of violating the Special Act on Prevention of Telecommunications and Financial Fraud and Refund of Damages. Prosecutors explained that Duong and Pham first made contact with the voice phishing scam ring in October last year. The ring recruited both via a Telegram open chat room. The ring’s organizers told Duong and Pham that they were to receive the proceeds of voice phishing scams in Korean won. The duo was then instructed to use this money to buy USDT, which they then sent to a crypto wallet held by a member of a voice phishing gang who was residing in Vietnam. The ring paid both Duong and Pham commission fees of 50,000 won ($36.44) to 100,000 won ($72.88) per 10 million won ($7,288) worth of USDT they sent. In a bold play to secure Korea’s position among the global AI elite, President Lee Jae Myung kicked off his term with a visit to the launch site of a mega-scale AI data center. #AIdatacenter https://t.co/gGHvfjNBvw — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) June 22, 2025 ‘Hash Sentence Inevitable,’ Judge Explains The court heard that the voice phishing ring succeeded in duping South Korea-based victims out of thousands of dollars’ worth of cash transfers. The ring’s employees called people pretending to be credit card delivery workers, insurance company employees, National Tax Service staffers, and even public prosecutors. They usually told potential victims that they were calling to check the safety of their bank accounts. The ring used a range of money laundering techniques, using other accomplices from Uzbekistan and Vietnam. The judge said that the court had not handed out a harsher sentence because neither of the defendants had criminal records in South Korea. But Lee added: “Even if the defendants did not orchestrate the crime, they must be severely punished. They played an essential role in the crime, acting as intermediaries. They have also not made any special efforts to help compensate the victims for the damages incurred.” USDT-related crime is on the rise in South Korea, as the coin’s popularity in the nation continues to grow. This year has seen a sharp rise in bogus USDT-themed over-the-counter deals and related thefts .

Now, a new contender, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is generating similar excitement among analysts and investors. Harnessing blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi AI aims to solve real-world problems while offering massive financial returns. Analysts forecast a potential 103x ROI in 2025 , positioning Ruvi AI as a possible successor to Binance Coin’s phenomenal rise. Why Ruvi AI Has the Potential to Rival Binance Coin Binance Coin achieved its meteoric rise through practical utility within the Binance ecosystem, driving consistent demand for the token. Ruvi AI takes a broader approach, creating AI-powered tools with applications in industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance. This focus on solving real-world challenges ensures long-term value and widespread adoption. Another standout factor is Ruvi AI’s structured growth plan. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are available for just $0.015 per token. Investors benefit from entering at this low price, with a guaranteed $0.07 valuation post-presale. This locks in an almost 5x ROI before the token is even listed on public exchanges. Analysts predict that RUVI could climb to $1 per token post-listing, delivering an impressive 103x ROI for early investors. Strong Presale Performance Sparks Enthusiasm Ruvi AI’s presale success highlights its growing traction among crypto investors. Here are some key milestones: Over $1.9 million raised , showcasing strong financial backing. More than 160 million tokens sold , reflecting robust investor demand. A growing community of 1,600+ holders , building a loyal base of early adopters. Ruvi AI’s commitment to transparency further sets it apart. Unlike speculative tokens, the presale guarantees a $0.07 valuation , offering clarity and reducing risk for early participants.

Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680.

A 6-week launch plan is underway, with major events scheduled: a US-based sponsorship kicks off on June 20, X30/X100 miners begin shipping on July 7, and X10 shipments follow on August 15. Unlike many other projects, this rollout is fully structured, and all listings will happen only after the final presale batch is sold. BlockDAG (BDAG) is now ranked among the top crypto coins to grab before the window narrows. BlockDAG Locks $317M+ As Countdown and Deliverables Begin Rather than promising plans, BlockDAG has entered execution mode. A major rollout is happening, with miner deliveries confirmed and a high-visibility US-based sponsorship locked for June 20. Shipping of X30 and X100 units starts on July 7, while X10 units go out by August 15. What’s already driving attention is the $317 million raised so far, and the presale is now in its 29th batch. Currently priced at $0.0276, Batch 29 still offers a limited-time offer ahead of the $0.05 listing rate. Over 23.1 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, and early backers have seen their funds grow by 2,660% since batch 1. The roadmap confirms that only after all 45 batches are sold will the 20 exchange listings be triggered, including five Tier-1 platforms already secured. With this structure, demand builds naturally as urgency grows. This makes BlockDAG one of the strongest crypto coins to buy now, with real progress before listing. The smart vesting contract is active, 40% of presale coins unlock pre-launch, and with 2 million users mining via the X1 app, traction is solid. If you’ve waited for a project executing on every front, BlockDAG is matching that demand with delivery. This isn’t just another coin; it’s a full system moving toward its goals. Uniswap (UNI) Price Outlook: Can It Break $8? Uniswap (UNI) continues to draw attention, trading close to $7.15 with gains over the past week. Forecasts are now eyeing a move between $7.21 and $7.52, with many tracking the $7.52 resistance closely. Should that level be breached, UNI could see a rise toward $8.15, depending on how trading volume supports the push. Looking further ahead, July forecasts pin the average Uniswap (UNI) price target at around $8.93, with some models predicting $10.83 if strong sentiment holds. Projections into 2025 stretch as high as $11–$12. While Uniswap stays active in DeFi, focus is shifting as newer coins gain steam. For UNI to remain at the top of traders’ charts, it must break the range it’s been in and drive momentum. It’s currently seen as a cautious play with upside if momentum and volume align. Ethereum (ETH) Holds Support as Resistance Nears $2,750 ETH is staying within a narrow range between $2,490 and $2,550, showing some resilience as it defends this zone. Analysts continue to watch $2,750 as a key level; if cleared, it could point to a climb beyond $3,000. The current technical setup shows signs of a potential cup-and-handle formation, often associated with upward price action. Momentum tools like RSI show ETH has room to run, and long-term confidence is still growing. Big names like BlackRock and Fidelity are utilizing Ethereum for asset tokenization, and the DeFi sector remains active. The upcoming Pectra upgrade is set to reduce gas costs and increase speed, improving ETH’s position in the developer space. While not rallying yet, ETH appears poised for a potential upward breakout as it nears its next resistance test. Key Takeaways! UNI is sitting above $7, with near-term resistance at $7.52 and a potential July average price near $8.93. ETH is holding between $2,490 and $2,550, with a bullish breakout possible if $2,750 is surpassed. Meanwhile, BlockDAG has raised over $317M, is in Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, and has confirmed a June 20 US-based sponsorship plus July 7 miner shipments. Listings will begin only after the 45th batch is sold, and the project has already delivered 2,660% growth since batch 1.

The Wyoming Stable Token Commission (WYST) is a proposed virtual currency representative of and redeemable for one US dollar held in a trust by the state of Wyoming. In a post on the social media platform X, Aptos says that the state is looking to use either chain with Layer Zero infrastructure to deploy a potential stablecoin. “The Wyoming Stable Token Commission has placed Aptos as the highest-scoring blockchain candidate for WYST – the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US State – tying for 1st place with Solana. WYST will be deployed using Layer Zero… Aptos is making borderless, always-on finance a reality today with three native USD stablecoins & $30 billion+ in monthly stablecoin volume, supported by sub-second finality and near-zero transaction fees at [around] $0.00055. Following the recent passing of the GENIUS Act to establish the first regulatory framework for stablecoins and Aptos pushing further as the chain for stablecoins, the future of finance is here on Aptos.” Last year, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon said he would push for the adoption of a “transparent” stablecoin fully backed by the state’s short-term Treasury holdings. “One of the big things for me is to be able to bring back onshore a lot of our debt because if it’s bought by treasuries and supported by Treasurys, it will help to stabilize that market to a degree… [What] is clear to me is that digital assets are going to have a future. The United States has to address this issue. Washington’s being a little bit stodgy, which is why Wyoming, being a nimble and entrepreneurial state, can make a difference.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to reporting from Politico, both countries have been launching targeted cyberattacks in parallel with military action, and American officials are warning this digital warfare could soon hit the United States directly. The US military’s overnight airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites raised the risk of direct cyber retaliation against American infrastructure. Military and intelligence analysts say Iran’s next move could involve hacking into US electricity grids, water systems, or other critical networks. Alex Vatanka, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said bluntly that “cyber is one of the tools of Iran’s asymmetric warfare.” The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a public alert on Sunday warning that Iranian-affiliated hackers could target “poorly secured US networks and Internet-connected devices.” US officials say low-level pro-Iranian hacktivist attacks are likely, and more serious government-linked intrusions are possible. US defense and private sector on high alert for Iran-backed attacks General Dan Caine, who chairs the Joint Chiefs, confirmed to reporters on Sunday that US Cyber Command had supported the military strikes, though he didn’t provide further details. The Pentagon’s cyber branch gave no public comment, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also declined to respond when asked about its defensive posture. Behind the scenes, though, critical infrastructure groups last week warned American companies to get their defenses up fast. Jen Easterly, the former CISA Director, took to LinkedIn and posted that US infrastructure players should keep their “shields up” and expect “malicious cyber activity.” Jen reminded readers that Iran has a long history of cyber strikes on civilian targets, including water plants, financial systems, pipelines, and government websites. She didn’t confirm whether Israel’s recent airstrikes affected Iran’s cyber capacity, but she did say the threat remains serious. In 2023, an Iranian gang breached an Israeli hospital and leaked patient data. Not long after, an Israeli hacking group shut down large parts of Iran’s gas station network. Vatanka told reporters that Israel still holds the upper hand, saying , “The Iranians… are good, they are emerging, but I don’t think they’re at the level of the Israelis or Americans.” The Israeli-aligned hacking group Predatory Sparrow claimed responsibility for shutting down Iran’s Bank Sepah, which caused widespread customer problems. They later said they had drained $90 million from Nobitex, the country’s biggest crypto exchange. The group also dumped pieces of Nobitex’s source code on X, formerly Twitter. Iran responds with shutdowns, surveillance, and renewed espionage As cyberattacks hammered Iran’s digital infrastructure, its state broadcasters were also hijacked. Multiple videos showed anti-government messages popping up on Iranian state TV last week. That triggered a government-ordered internet blackout still in effect as of Sunday, aimed at blocking public access to the attacks. Vatanka said this showed Iran’s regime was trying to “gain control of the flow of information” and possibly prevent public unrest. Security officials inside Iran have started locking down their own tech use. Last week, senior Iranian personnel were told to ditch any internet-connected devices, especially phones, to limit exposure to more Israeli cyber disruptions. This came after reports that Israeli intelligence may have tracked down Hezbollah units in Lebanon using wireless signals from pager devices. Thousands of those pagers reportedly exploded, leaving many injured. One reason Israel’s cyberattacks worked so well is timing. Israeli forces launched the first blows—both in the air and online, giving them extra room to prep their defensive and offensive systems while Iran scrambled to catch up. Still, Iranian-backed groups aren’t done. Over the weekend, Israel’s National Cyber Directorate warned its citizens abroad not to fill out digital forms or click links on suspicious sites that may be harvesting personal data for intelligence. Gil Messing, chief of staff at Check Point Software, told reporters Saturday that cyber campaigns targeting Israel had recently “escalated a bit.” He didn’t mention any new damage but said there was a surge of disinformation on social media, including false texts about gas shortages and fake instructions telling people to avoid shelters. The Israeli civilian cyber defense agency also said Iran was trying again to break into internet-connected cameras for surveillance. That tactic is cheap, fast, and dangerous—and it’s hard to trace. Inside the US, the alarm bells are ringing again. John Hultquist, chief analyst for Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, posted on X that Iran’s cyber units often focus on “psychological purposes.” He added that his biggest fear right now is cyber espionage targeting US leaders. “I’m most concerned about cyber espionage against our leaders and surveillance aided by compromises in travel, hospitality, telecommunications, and other sectors where data could be used to identify and physically track persons of interest,” John wrote.

In a research note released Wednesday, FX strategists Oliver Levingston, Adarsh Sinha, and Janice Xue highlighted Australia’s fixed-income market as a likely hotspot for capital inflows amid ongoing global de-dollarization. “De-dollarization was a major theme on our trip to the United States and Canada, and we continue to highlight the significant impact small shifts in global fund managers’ asset allocations could have on the demand profile for AUD fixed income.” The note makes the case that Australia’s relatively small bond market could experience dramatic price swings if global investors keep fleeing U.S. dollar-denominated assets. Investors have been looking for more sound and undervalued alternatives as the greenback has lost its previously unassailable haven status, particularly after almost a year of political and economic tumult under President Donald Trump. Investors dump dollar amid Trump-era volatility The report directly attributes the trend to increasing global discomfort with U.S. financial stewardship. The re-emergence of Donald Trump on the political scene, along with a fresh wave of belligerent trade policies and what the bank calls “economic nationalism,” has only hastened investor diversification . Trump’s declaration of sweeping tariffs earlier this year, which markets dubbed “Liberation Day,” set off a global market selloff. Investors stampeded to pull out of U.S. markets, anxious about protracted uncertainty and trade isolationism. This “Sell America” movement was marked by heavy selling of Wall Street stocks, U.S. Treasurys, and even the dollar itself. The U.S. dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of leading currencies, has slid by about 9% year-to-date in 2025, its most significant decline in over 10 years. Investor conviction in the dollar is non-existent; as Bank of America’s June Global Fund Managers Survey showed, 86% of respondents believe the dollar will devalue in the coming 12 months , a new record low. The report found fund managers with less of a long-dollar bias than at any time in the past 20 years. Almost 20 percent of the 222 managers polled with $587 billion under management said that betting against the dollar was the most “crowded trade” globally. This loss of confidence has paved the way for other currencies, particularly those linked to stable economies rich in raw materials like Australia, to gain the favor of global reserve managers and institutional investors. Central banks boost demand for AUD bonds Now, Australia is feeling the consequences of that change in sentiment. Its 10-year government bond yield is about 4.24%, which is not that different from the U.S. equivalent of 4.43%. But Bank of America sees this gap widening in the years ahead. By late 2026, the bank predicts that Australian bonds will have a 75 basis point spread, which would entail stronger demand and higher prices. The note said that the demand outlook for AUD fixed-income assets appeared strong with support from Australia’s growing superannuation funds and the possibility of bank deregulation. One big reason is the rising demand for “peripheral dollar bloc assets,” consistently stable currencies in faraway lands from American politics, supported by strong local fundamentals. The proportion of official reserves in Australian dollars has doubled in the past ten years. The strategists estimate that a 1-percentage-point lift in global reserve demand would absorb 185% of the net supply of Australian sovereign bonds for the current fiscal year. Australia’s large pension funds have also been moving into the local bond market with increasing vigor. These superannuation funds are internationalizing their balance sheets, and the demand for AUD-denominated assets flows. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?
