The company stated that BTC has entered a classic ‚Äúbull flag‚Äù formation, a positive technical structure often seen following rapid price increases. According to MakroVision's analysis, the most critical short-term resistance level for Bitcoin is the Fibonacci retracement at around $121,100. Breaking this level could trigger a new upward wave. Meanwhile, support at around $113,600 coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, and a potential return to this level would be considered a healthy technical correction.

The firm said that if BTC can sustain above $106,000, the medium-term bullish momentum will be maintained. The analysis indicates that if Bitcoin breaks above $121,000, the 1.382 Fibonacci extension point at around $129,600 will be highlighted. If this level is also broken, the next target could be around $133,800. *This is not investment advice.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 20:40:00

The flow began picking up at the end of last year and hasn‚Äôt slowed. In June, $3.9 billion was pulled out of U.S. Treasuries while $10 billion went into high-grade corporate bonds on both continents. By July, another $13 billion was added just to U.S. investment-grade corporate debt‚Äîmaking it the largest monthly buy since 2015, according to Bloomberg. This is no minor reallocation. For decades, U.S. government debt was the most trusted instrument in global markets. But now, rising fiscal deficits and ballooning interest costs are making Treasuries less appealing to institutional investors. Micha√´l Nizard, who manages portfolios at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, began pulling away from sovereign debt late last year. He said he‚Äôs kept that position steady ever since. Wall Street sees credit strength while governments pile on debt The U.S. government‚Äôs spending problem isn‚Äôt new, but the pressure has been increasing. Donald Trump‚Äôs tax cut bill, signed during his first term and now continuing to impact revenue during his second presidency, is projected to add about $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. This projection came from the Congressional Budget Office. At the same time, interest costs are climbing. By 2035, debt payments could consume 30% of the country‚Äôs revenue. That compares with 18% expected this year and just 9% four years ago. Those numbers contributed to a major downgrade. In May, Moody‚Äôs Ratings stripped the U.S. of its last AAA rating, bringing it down to Aa1. The agency specifically cited the growing deficit and the government‚Äôs rising interest burden. That rating cut has added to the sense that Treasuries are no longer untouchable. Still, the shift toward corporate debt hasn‚Äôt been rapid. The U.S. government doesn‚Äôt borrow in foreign currency and has the ability to print dollars. That gives it flexibility that most countries don‚Äôt have. Even during the tariff standoff in April, Treasuries performed better than company bonds, even though both markets saw falling prices. Foreign demand also hasn‚Äôt dried up‚Äîinternational holdings of Treasuries increased in May. But corporate bonds have started to look more attractive for other reasons. While governments rack up obligations, companies have posted relatively strong earnings. More U.S. firms have beaten Wall Street estimates this earnings season than during the same stretch last year. That‚Äôs been enough for major asset managers like BlackRock to favor credit. In a note last week, their team wrote, ‚ÄúCredit has become a clear choice for quality.‚Äù Spreads tighten, but demand for company debt holds Valuations for company bonds have been running high, which points to strong demand. U.S. high-grade corporate spreads have stayed below 80 basis points through July. That‚Äôs well below the 10-year average of 120 basis points based on Bloomberg index data. In Europe, euro-denominated investment-grade spreads averaged around 85 basis points for the same period, lower than the 123 basis point average over the past decade. But not everyone is sold on this rally. Gershon Distenfeld, who runs funds at AllianceBernstein, has already started cutting back on credit exposure. He reduced his position that favored corporate risk over rate risk earlier in July. Dominique Braeuninger at Schroders echoed that view. She said spreads were too tight to justify the risk of diving further into corporate debt. BlackRock may be backing credit overall, but even they‚Äôre taking a cautious approach. The firm is avoiding long-term high-grade notes because of how little they pay relative to risk. Instead, they‚Äôve gone overweight on short-term corporate credit, where the balance looks more favorable. Still, for many fund managers, the picture is shifting. Governments aren‚Äôt offering the same sense of security they used to. Jason Simpson, a senior fixed income strategist at State Street, said, ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve seen on the government fiscal side is not great news. Corporates seem to be chugging along nicely.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

This accusation followed his criticism of the banking giant for charging fintech companies for access to customer banking data. In a recent post on X , Winklevoss said JPMorgan paused Gemini‚Äôs onboarding process right after he spoke out against the bank‚Äôs new policy. Tyler Winklevoss Says JPMorgan‚Äôs New Policy is Harmful The controversy began when a Bloomberg report revealed that JPMorgan plans to implement fees for fintech firms that require access to bank data for their services. This includes apps and services that help users buy crypto, manage finances, or use digital wallets. Winklevoss called this policy ‚Äúanti-competitive‚Äù and warned that it could hurt innovation in fintech and cryptocurrency. Although JPMorgan has not yet publicly addressed the recent allegations, this situation has raised worries for the fintech and crypto sectors. They fear that new fees could make it harder for smaller companies to compete and may strengthen the hold of traditional banks. Notably, Winklevoss‚Äôs comments reflect a growing conflict between traditional banks and new financial technologies. As more people adopt crypto, partnerships between banks and crypto platforms have become essential. However, moves like JPMorgan‚Äôs could hinder this growth, particularly for platforms like Gemini that depend on easy banking connections. JPMorgan Discusses Blockchain‚Äôs Role in Capital Markets Meanwhile, JPMorgan has taken a proactive step in shaping digital asset regulation by meeting with the SEC‚Äôs Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, also known as the Crypto Task Force. As reported by TheCoinRise, executives from JPMorgan and members of the crypto division discussed the broader implications of blockchain adoption in traditional markets. Topics included risk assessment, benefits of decentralization, and how firms like JPMorgan could position themselves competitively in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. The bank also highlighted its current presence in the crypto ecosystem. Its digital platform facilitates repurchase agreements, a critical segment of short-term lending under its ‚ÄúDigital Financing‚Äù and ‚ÄúDigital Debt Services‚Äù categories. Donald Trump Connection and Regulatory Shadows Recall that the cryptocurrency exchange has taken a significant step towards an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Gemini has filed a confidential draft registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Beyond its market ambitions, Gemini has also garnered political attention . The Winklevoss twins, prominent figures in both crypto and politics, each contributed $1 million to President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign. Though political affiliations aren‚Äôt directly tied to the IPO, such connections add a layer of public scrutiny and regulatory sensitivity. The confidential filing structure may be a strategic move to minimize premature exposure and potential backlash. Nonetheless, the firm‚Äôs decision to move forward indicates growing optimism within the crypto sector.

Ripple Warns Investors Of Rising XRP Scams On July 23, Garlinghouse took to X social media to raise the alarm on a sharp rise in XRP scams, urging investors and community members to stay alert.

In many cases, the usernames have been altered to mimic the company‚Äôs official handles, often making it difficult for unsuspecting users to identify the deception.

Garlinghouse has emphasized that neither he nor Ripple will ever request XRP from anyone under any circumstances. To combat the growing threat of skyrocketing crypto scams, Ripple is actively and aggressively reporting these fraudulent accounts and encouraging its community to do the same. The company has reiterated that its official channels remain the only trusted sources of communication and provides a direct reminder to always verify account handles and links before engaging. Notably, Garlinghouse concluded his post with an important reminder to stay vigilant against avoidable losses. He warned that ‚Äúif it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.‚Äù Ripple Alert Highlights Broader Threat Amid Market Recovery Beyond the immediate focus on the YouTube impersonation scams, Garlinghouse‚Äôs report touches on a broader trend of escalating crypto fraud that tends to spike during periods of market recovery or growing optimism. This pattern, described by the Ripple CEO as ‚Äúlike clockwork,‚Äù suggests that malicious actors closely monitor community sentiment and time their campaigns to exploit emotional and financial excitement.

In a broader context, the rise in XRP scams has coincided with the recent surge in the altcoin‚Äôs price to above $3.6.

Should Holders Be Worried?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-approaching-overbought-territory-should-holders-be-worried/,"XRP has experienced a strong upward surge in recent weeks, hitting an intraday high of $3.21 before settling around $3.18 at the time of writing. While this momentum has excited many in the crypto space, popular analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has flagged a potentially cautionary signal: XRP is entering overbought territory on the weekly Stochastic RSI. This raises an important question: Should holders be concerned? Weekly Stoch RSI Suggests a Cooling Phase May Be Ahead STEPH IS CRYPTO‚Äôs technical analysis highlights that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index on the weekly timeframe is now at 90.31 and 81.99‚Äîwell above the 80 mark that signals overbought conditions. Historically, when XRP‚Äôs Stoch RSI reaches this range, the price tends to experience short-term pullbacks or sideways consolidation. In previous cycles, these conditions preceded brief corrections before XRP resumed its upward trajectory. The current setup appears similar, with the indicator flashing red-hot momentum and suggesting that the asset might soon take a breather. #XRP is approaching ‚Äòoverbought‚Äô territory.. Should we be worried? pic.twitter.com/xX9thFJYTf ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 26, 2025 What‚Äôs Fueling XRP‚Äôs Price Action? Beyond the charts, XRP‚Äôs recent price rally is being driven by a mix of strong fundamentals, positive sentiment, and speculation. Excitement continues to build around the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF , while Ripple‚Äôs aggressive push into real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and CBDC adoption is keeping investor interest high. The launch of Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin and the expanding use of the XRP Ledger for global payments are reinforcing the bullish narrative. However, the market was recently rattled by a massive transfer of $175 million worth of XRP by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen to centralized exchanges. This sparked concerns over possible sell pressure and led to over $105 million in long position liquidations. XRP briefly dipped to $3.11, but the market quickly stabilized, suggesting underlying strength despite the shakeout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Should Holders Be Worried? From a technical standpoint, XRP is undeniably overbought on the weekly chart. This doesn‚Äôt guarantee a crash, but it often signals that upward momentum may slow down, at least temporarily. For short-term traders, it might be wise to monitor price action closely, reduce risk exposure, or consider partial profit-taking. For long-term investors, however, the broader picture remains encouraging. XRP is widely believed to be in Wave 3 of an Elliott Wave structure, a phase typically marked by powerful gains. With regulatory clarity in the U.S., growing utility, and expanding partnerships, XRP appears well-positioned for continued growth beyond the short-term noise. Final Thoughts XRP‚Äôs entry into overbought territory is a valid technical concern, but not necessarily a reason for alarm. As STEPH IS CRYPTO rightly points out, indicators like the Stoch RSI often precede pauses in price action, not full trend reversals. With strong fundamentals and ongoing institutional interest, XRP‚Äôs longer-term outlook remains positive. Holders would do well to stay informed, manage risk appropriately, and view any short-term dips as potential setups for the next major move.

49007177,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=774424,1753564231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49007177.jpeg,S√£o Paulo faces major job and economic losses if the U.S. goes ahead with a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/brazil-governors-blame-lula-for-mishandling-u-s-relations-amid-tariff-risk/,"Faced with the looming prospect of a 50% U.S. tariff set for Aug.‚ÄØ1, officials in Brazil‚Äôs richest state are rushing to soften the blow on local companies and jobs. Governor Tarc√≠sio de‚ÄØFreitas said on Saturday that as many as 120,000 positions could disappear and gross state product might fall 2.7‚ÄØ% if the U.S. goes ahead with the tariff. Speaking at a forum hosted by XP‚ÄØInc. in the state capital, he warned that ‚Äúthe possibility of Caterpillar moving its output to another country‚Äù is worrisome, along with the ripple effects on small coffee growers, the orange sector, and aircraft maker Embraer. According to a Bloomberg report state will give five‚Äëyear loans to help firms with cash needs. The governor said his team is also talking to U.S. lawmakers, companies, and officials to explain the danger and push for changes. Brazilian governors criticize Lula over tariff dispute Freitas shared the stage with governors Ratinho‚ÄØJunior of Paran√° and Ronaldo‚ÄØCaiado of Goi√°s. They asked the federal government to talk with the U.S., saying the tariff could hurt meat plants and organic sugar producers in their states. They criticized President Luiz‚ÄØIn√°cio Lula‚ÄØda‚ÄØSilva‚Äôs handling of relations with U.S. President Donald‚ÄØTrump, noting they had not been consulted before key decisions. ‚ÄúGovernors were not consulted by the federal government on these decisions,‚Äù Caiado said. Ratinho‚ÄØJunior added that former president Jair‚ÄØBolsonaro ‚Äúis not more important than the trade relationship between Brazil and the U.S.‚Äù All three leaders are seen as potential challengers to Lula in next year‚Äôs election. Meanwhile in the U.S the Trump administration is preparing a fresh emergency declaration to justify the tariff, according to people familiar with internal discussions. Because Brazil runs a goods trade deficit with the United States, unlike most targets of earlier tariff actions, officials are said to be seeking a different legal basis. Staff from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative briefed congressional aides this week on the plan, the sources said. Neither USTR nor the White House commented publicly. The news sent the Brazilian real down as much as 1% against the dollar on the day. Lula urges calm before the U.S tariff storm President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva spoke lightly about the threat of U.S. duties, saying Brazil will respond if the tariffs take effect but won‚Äôt pick fights it doesn‚Äôt need. At a July event in S√£o Paulo , he stressed the need to safeguard Brazil‚Äôs sovereignty and economy. If Washington imposes its planned charges, Lula said Brazil will act, yet always in keeping with its values and global partnerships. His new finance minister echoed former President Haddad‚Äôs assurance that Brazil will not go after U.S. firms on Brazilian soil. He added that Brazil‚Äôs aim is fair trade, not tit‚Äëfor‚Äëtat retaliation. The tariff threat, first aired earlier this month, is widely viewed as support for Bolsonaro, who faces trial over an alleged effort to overturn his 2022 loss. Trump has urged Lula to drop what he calls a ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù against his ally. Lula, for his part, has insisted the judiciary is independent and has hinted at retaliatory steps if duties are imposed. In a Friday address, the Brazilian president said Trump had been ‚Äúmisled‚Äù about the case. ‚ÄúIf President Trump had called me, I certainly would have explained to him what‚Äôs happening with the former president,‚Äù Lula said. ‚ÄúBolsonaro is not being persecuted; he is being tried.‚Äù Two Brazilian officials familiar with the situation argue that drafting a new emergency order shows the 50% rate is ‚Äúa sanction in search of legal justification.‚Äù While Trump could still alter the number, the levy, if enacted, would take effect in less than a week, keeping state and federal authorities on both sides of the dispute working against the clock.

With more pro-crypto bills on the way, the markets have responded. Altcoins are rallying, and Cardano and Solana have returned to the spotlight. As the attention of institutional and retail investors converges on these major Layer‚Äë1 blockchains, a newcomer, MAGACOIN‚ÄØFINANCE , is quietly stealing the show with an explosive early performance on the cusp of exchange listings. Cardano (ADA): Technical Revival Amid On-Chain Slowdown Cardano has reasserted itself as a chart darling in July 2025, climbing from a dip at $0.73 to hover near $0.85. Recent institutional signals add to the optimism with ADA spiking 15% on July 17 following news of new partnerships and integration upgrades. Key among them is interoperability with the XRP Ledger via Tokeo Wallet and EMURGO‚Äôs rollout of a ‚ÄúCardano Card‚Äù for real-world spending. The network‚Äôs ecosystem also expanded to 2,005 active decentralized applications, which indicates that developer and user interest remain robust. Even as the on-chain metrics remain soft for Cardano with slow transaction growth, slump in DeFi TVL, and declining fee revenue, a regulatory tailwind and upcoming ETF clarity suggest ADA may be poised for another breakout. Solana (SOL): Outpacing the Competition Solana continues to show strength. Despite retracing to around $141 recently, SOL has rebounded sharply‚Äîup about 35% in July to trade near $177‚Äîand now targets a $220 resistance zone. Fundamentals also favor SOL. Solana leads in memecoin and NFT transaction volumes, accounting for nearly 60% of blockchain memecoin activity. Institutional interest is accelerating with more companies building SOL Treasury, and the debut of the first Solana‚Äëfocused ETF (SSK) in the US has brought more mainstream access to SOL, as everyone waits for the first spot SOL ETFs. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Grabbing Attention MAGACOIN‚ÄØFINANCE has fast‚Äëemerged as a dark‚Äëhorse player in Crypto Week‚Äôs renewed frenzy. With its presale-to-exchange gains already past 175% , it‚Äôs proving its narrative has more than hype to it. The project has already drawn in a serious user base and engaged community by laying the groundwork for explosive liquidity once it hits listings on the centralized and decentralized exchange, which is on its roadmap. What‚Äôs Fueling the Current Altcoin Boom? We‚Äôre witnessing a post‚Äëlegislation rally. President Donald Trump‚Äôs signing of the GENIUS Act into law and the other pro-crypto legislative efforts in the US have unlocked fresh capital as regulatory clarity now supports market re-entry. In this shift, established altcoins Cardano and Solana are benefiting directly, but narrative-rich, utility-driven community projects like MAGACOIN‚ÄØFINANCE stand to gain even more. Final Thoughts ADA and SOL are surging on technicals and institutional tailwinds amidst major wins for the crypto sector. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs presale-to-exchange momentum and vibrant community signal a fresh contender and the Next Big Listing Play?

The losses amount to tens of millions, and it‚Äôs expected that more will be identified. An Elaborate Scheme The U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office in the Western District of Washington filed a civil action on Tuesday, demanding the forfeiture of cryptocurrency assets valued at roughly $7.1 million.¬†The funds were seized during an investigation into a scheme involving fraudulent investment in oil and gas, which Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller announced. The assets are only a fraction of the $97 million obtained by coconspirators between June 2022 and July 2024, which Homeland Security Investigations seized in December last year. ‚ÄúThe co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims,‚Äù said Attorney Miller. ‚ÄúFederal investigators and prosecutors in our office moved as quickly as possible to trace and seize the cryptocurrency so that some of the losses can be returned to victims.‚Äù According to the filing and other case records, the plot was presented as escrow accounts for purchasing oil tank storage in either Rotterdam, the Netherlands, or Houston, which spanned from at least August 2022 through August 2024. The victims were convinced to send money to these accounts, where the conspirators indicated that investors could make significant profits by renting out the oil tank storage to others. At least seven separate entities have been marked where funds were sent. However, the good news ended there, as once the funds were sent, no further information on the investment was provided, and the co-schemers just stopped replying. How The Funds Were Moved A resident from Newcastle, Washington, Geoffrey K. Auyeung, 47, was indicted as a coconspirator in the U.S in August 2024, being charged with receiving the majority of the funds generated by the deceptive plan. The money was quickly shuffled to one or more of at least 81 accounts at various institutions, either offshore or not, or to one of the at least 19 different crypto accounts. The assets were then funneled into various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, USDT, USDC, and Ethereum, the majority of which was further transferred to accounts at the Binance exchange. The forfeiture filing further states that the crypto accounts, which were seized, were linked to individuals in Russia and Nigeria, where some of the victims‚Äô funds, used to purchase digital assets, were also sent to exchanges in those countries. At least one of the money markets in Russia or Nigeria is alleged to have facilitated money laundering for transnational criminal organizations, including terrorist organizations and other parties that have been known to violate international trade sanctions. At the time of Auyeung‚Äôs arrest, $2.3 million was seized from his bank accounts, which is in addition to the $7.1 million in crypto the government is seeking to forfeit. If the court approves the forfeiture, the funds will be distributed accordingly to the victims. Investigators, so far, have identified dozens of such cases, with the total amount of exploits reaching approximately $17.9 million, which is expected to grow as more casualties are identified.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC‚Äôs price holds momentum above $119,883, it will fuel a bullish rally to $123,344. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $114,519, beginning a bearish trend to $107,425. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. This pushed the BTC price toward $118,100. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its ‚Äúhalving‚Äù events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we‚Äôll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin‚Äôs price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin‚Äôs price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

Cryptopolitan‚Äôs Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of ‚ÄúBitcoin bubble‚Äù in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin‚Äôs future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year‚Äôs start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October‚Äôs Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 21:40:00

A new Gallup survey found that just 14% of U.S. adults own crypto, a figure that has been growing but still represents a small slice of the investing public. The study, conducted in mid-June, revealed deep skepticism about cryptocurrencies. 60% of respondents said they have no interest in ever buying cryptocurrency, and just 17% admitted they‚Äôre intrigued. Only 4% of respondents said they plan on buying crypto in the near future. Gallup also found that among U.S. investors owning more than $10,000 in stocks, bonds or mutual funds, 55% considered the asset class ‚Äúvery risky.‚Äù Still, ownership rates skyrocketed from 2% in 2018 to 17%. This skepticism isn't surprising, despite the U.S. having a pro-crypto president and clearer regulations that have recently been rolling in. While the 2021 bull run ushered in extreme volatility and made crypto a mainstream topic, the subsequent brutal crypto winter, which saw many high-profile bankruptcies, such as FTX, as well as scams and exploits, soured retail investors' sentiment. Although crypto has since then seen institutional investors jumping into the market, helping it become more legitimate, many retail investors, burned by the past losses, are likely still staying vigilant. Four years ago, Gallup found that 6% of U.S. investors owned cryptocurrency. That figure has since risen but may be conservative, as a Fed survey revealed 12% ownership among U.S. investors. Diving deeper into the ownership, the demographic divide is stark. While one in four men aged 18 to 49 owns crypto, the survey found that ownership drops sharply among women and older adults. College graduates and high-income earners report above-average participation, but seniors and low-income households remain largely absent from the space, the survey shows. Knowledge gaps also persist. Nearly everyone surveyed had heard of crypto, but only 35% said they actually understood how it works. Familiarity was highest among younger men and the wealthier. Even among those who claim to understand crypto, most still call it a risky bet. Among U.S. investors, 64% see the asset class as ‚Äúvery risky,‚Äù up from 60% in 2021. The survey found that about one in seven Americans owns crypto, while nearly six in 10 own stocks or real estate. Only 4% of adults said crypto is the best long-term investment.",Finance|Gallup|Bitcoin|Survey|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-26 22:00:00

49010656,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=794443,1753569007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49010656.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Holds Above $115,000 ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why This Level Is Significant",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-hold-above-115000-why/,"After surging to a record high around $123,000 in the second week of July, the Bitcoin price action for the rest of the month has been largely choppy. However, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped to a level just above $115,000 on Friday, July 25. This abrupt decline came with the expected question in the market: Is the rally over? Here‚Äôs How $115,000 Could Be Critical To BTC‚Äôs Price In a recent post on the social media platform X, crypto pundit Burak Tama√ß highlighted the relevance of the region below the $115,000 level for the price of BTC. This on-chain observation, which is based on the BTC Supply Distribution URPD, showed how the Bitcoin price could play out in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Bounce off This Support Level In Reversal Campaign For $121,000 The Supply Distribution URPD metric tracks the amount of Bitcoin supply last moved or transferred at particular price levels. This metric is specifically useful in identifying potential support (demand) and resistance (supply) zones. Tama√ß pointed out on X that there is a significant void in Bitcoin‚Äôs Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) distribution just around the $110,000 and $115,000 bracket. What this means is that there have been relatively fewer significant transactions around this price region in the recent past. However, this UTXO gap sits above a price region ($90,000 to $110,000) thick with significant investor activity. Considering the level of activity within this zone, there is an increased likelihood of the premier cryptocurrency finding a support cushion just within the UTXO gap. In this context, the support is to be above the $110,000 price level. As mentioned earlier, after Bitcoin reached a new all-time-high price, the premier cryptocurrency entered a consolidatory phase, where it has moved mostly sideways in the second half of July. During this period of indecisive price action, it can be observed that the Bitcoin price has not gone below the $115,000 price. What this means is that the $110,000 and $115,000 zone is likely where a new UTXO support has been established. If Bitcoin prevails above this price level, we can expect to see continued bullish momentum. On the flip side, if the $110,000 ‚Äî 115,000 support zone fails, the flagship cryptocurrency might experience a severe sell-off. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $118,050, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

Meme coins still trigger fast moves, but long-term energy is moving toward coins with working features, updates, and useful systems. Here are four top trending cryptos drawing strong attention for different reasons. BlockDAG brings a unique network design and major presale results. Cronos stands out for its DeFi tools and supply cuts. BONK is pushing growth plans, and Kaspa speeds up with parallel block handling. Each one tells a different story for what matters in 2025, whether it‚Äôs usage, speed, or structure. 1. BlockDAG: Fast Tech, Big Rewards, and Built for Daily Buyers BlockDAG isn‚Äôt based on old projects or forks. It is a fresh Layer 1 built on DAG-style tech. That setup allows faster moves, no delays, and much better scaling than older blockchains. It‚Äôs made for daily activity, not just quick trading. But what really makes BlockDAG (BDAG) different is how it treats buyers. The project runs Buyer Battles, where each day‚Äôs top BDAG buyer gets all leftover coins from a 25 million BDAG pool. It‚Äôs a strong daily challenge that rewards bold entries. There‚Äôs also a Referral Program. Anyone who brings new people into the presale earns 25% of the referred value right away. Whether leading the day or helping it grow, buyers stay at the center of the setup. All this is backed by real numbers: $353 million raised, 24.3 billion coins sold, and a locked price of $0.0016 until August 11. In a space where early supporters often get left out, BlockDAG gives them more ways to stay ahead before the launch. 2. Cronos: DeFi Strength With Real-World Reach Cronos is gaining quiet traction in 2025‚Äôs list of top trending cryptos, not just for its price near $0.076. Though low-cost, it powers a strong network. Built by Crypto.com, Cronos can process up to 100,000 transactions each second and supports a DeFi system with over $500 million in total value locked. Its role in NFTs and Visa-linked partnerships gives it wider usability and brand appeal. A large-scale burn in 2024 removed 25% of its 30 billion supply, creating room for scarcity over time. CRO avoids meme hype by offering features for payments, staking, and smart contracts. That keeps it steady even when trends shift. 3. Bonk: Memecoin That Actually Has a Use Bonk (BONK) has gained notice by doing what few meme coins can: giving people more than hype. It runs on Solana and connects to its DeFi and NFT tools through BonkSwap and BonkBot, helping it work inside a real ecosystem. Over 1.6 trillion coins were burned this year, reducing supply just as buzz around a Solana ETF grows. While price dips have come and gone, charts suggest BONK may recover again. Among top trending cryptos, BONK is rare as a meme coin with use, tools, and plans for staying active. 4. Kaspa: Smart Design and Support From Developers Kaspa is rising fast among top trending cryptos because of its blend of deep tech and a strong support base. With a price near $0.08, it stands out by using a blockDAG layout instead of standard chains. That makes it faster and allows many blocks at once, with nearly instant finality. The GHOSTDAG setup lets it grow without hurting decentralization, a tough goal in the space. No pre-mining and open supply rules brought in many developers, and a 350% jump in 2024 added more eyes. Some call for $1 in 2025, but even without that, the tech story is enough to stay on the radar. BlockDAG Brings It All Together in One Place All four of these projects earn their place as top trending cryptos, with each offering something different. Cronos builds on DeFi tools. Kaspa changes how networks scale. BONK blends memes with real features. But BlockDAG hits all three points at once. It mixes fast Layer 1 tech, buyer-focused rewards, and a 3025% return from the presale. While others shine in one area, BlockDAG moves across many fronts. With strong daily traction and growing community numbers, it offers more than hype. It may be the best crypto to buy now , before its price changes for good.

Bitcoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche are quietly posting strong price movements amid renewed accumulation across multiple tiers of the market. However, while blue-chip assets are steadily climbing, the biggest opportunity may lie in a low-cap political meme coin that‚Äôs gaining serious traction: Magacoin Finance. Bitcoin (BTC): Quiet Climb, Strong Foundation Bitcoin remains the backbone of the current market structure, climbing from below $100K to a peak of $123,236 before entering a controlled consolidation phase. A bearish engulfing candle near the top suggests some profit-taking, but higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart confirm that bulls are still in control. Support is now building around the $115,000 level, with strategic buyers eyeing this zone for re-entry. A confirmed breakout above $120,000 would likely accelerate momentum back toward the $123K mark and potentially new all-time highs. For many institutions, BTC‚Äôs stability is setting the tone for a broader crypto rebound. Uniswap (UNI): Breaking Resistance, Reclaiming Momentum Uniswap recently shattered a key resistance zone between $9.60 and $10.80, signaling a shift in market structure that analysts believe could unlock a 77% upside. With the token now trading above $10.30, the reclaim of this horizontal band marks the end of a prolonged consolidation period that began in early 2024. Volume remains steady, and technical indicators, particularly the Bollinger Band Power (BBP), suggest increased bullish volatility. If UNI continues to hold above the mid-Bollinger Band ($8.22), price targets between $12.83 and $18.40 remain valid in the coming weeks. For traders seeking blue-chip DeFi exposure, Uniswap is now back on the radar. Avalanche (AVAX): A Chain With Real-World Use and DeFi Inflows Avalanche has surged over 40% this month, recently breaking above $24 after reclaiming resistance near the $20 mark. With daily net inflows topping $120 million, surpassing SEI, Sui, and Aptos, AVAX has become the third-highest blockchain in terms of net capital movement. This level of investor activity reflects more than just hype; it shows confidence. Fueling the narrative is real-world utility. The U.S. state of Wyoming recently tested its Avalanche-powered stablecoin pilot, using the network to automate government payments and eliminate 45-day invoice delays. Built on AvaCloud infrastructure, Avalanche‚Äôs chain enables smart contract automation for approvals, compliance, and payments, highlighting its institutional appeal. MAGACOIN Finance: The Narrative-Powered Sleeper That May Explode Analysts are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a high-upside altcoin amid major token rallies. Fully decentralized and backed by whale investors, it features audit-verified contracts (HashEx, CertiK) and wallet integration with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet. With over 5,234 verified holders, MAGACOIN is moving from fringe meme to serious contender for Q4 2025. Its capped supply, rapid Telegram growth, and bold branding are attracting those who missed early PEPE and SHIB gains. The final presale phase is almost closed, giving early adopters access to staking multipliers and governance perks before launch. Conclusion: Rotation Season Is Underway Bitcoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche are quietly rallying, signaling renewed market strength, but the real alpha may lie in undervalued tokens yet to break out. MAGACOIN FINANCE gives retail investors a rare mix of decentralization, a potent political narrative, and audited security. As institutions crowd into blue chips, early-stage plays like MAGACOIN offer massive upside. With the presale closing fast and top analysts eyeing up to 75x returns, this could be 2025‚Äôs most talked-about breakout.

The prominent altcoin presently trades around $24, keeping in line with a long-standing range-bound movement. Meanwhile, popular market analyst Ali Martinez has shared some insights on the present AVAX market, highlighting a potential bullish scenario. Incoming AVAX Breakout? Here Are The Levels To Watch In an X post on July 25, Martinez provides a technical analysis on the AVAX market tipping the altcoin for a major price surge; Using the daily AVAX/USDT chart, the renowned analyst identified a constant trading range that has remained active from February to date. Related Reading: TRON Drops Q2 Report: Revenue, USDT Dominance Lead Multi-Quarter Highs This price range shows that AVAX prices have consistently moved between $15 and $27, forming a pivotal support and resistance in these price regions, respectively. Most notably, AVAX made another surge towards $27 following the crypto rebound in early July. However, the altcoin soon experienced another solid rejection for the third time in six months at the rather effective price barrier. Following this most recent rejection, AVAX found quick support around $23, another important price level in this trading range, which has previously acted as support or resistance depending on the price trend. If the market bulls can sustain the current buying pressure at this price zone, AVAX is likely to return to retest the $27 region. Interestingly, Ali Martinez explains that a successful breakout beyond $27 would pave the way for a quick climb to an immediate price target of $36 based on the Fibonacci retracement levels. This prediction presents a potential 46% price gain from current market prices and 38% from the breakout zone. On the other hand, failure to hold above the $23 price level may result in a bearish return to $15, marking a potentially catastrophic 34.78% decline from the support zone. Therefore, AVAX market forces must view the $23 as a critical region, which could influence a decisive breakout or breakdown in the mid-term. Related Reading: Wall Street‚Äôs Bold Bet: Bitcoin Could Hit $200K By December, Banking Giant Says AVAX Price Overview At the time of writing, AVAX trades at $24.81 following a slight 3.71% gain in the last seven days. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 31,84% indicating a significant decline in market interest and transaction volume. With the altseason reportedly underway, AVAX also remains one of the many altcoins in investors‚Äô consideration as a potential outperformer following an estimated 1,150% gain in the last bull run in 2021. With a market cap of $10.1 billion, AVAX continues to rank as the 17th largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Each of these top performing cryptos brings something different. BlockDAG focuses on mobile-friendly mining, VeChain is known for tracking supply chains, ONDO works on linking real-world assets to crypto, and FET uses AI tools to improve automation. BlockDAG‚Äôs X1 App has passed 2 million users, and its dual miner demo is now complete. The other three projects are all priced below $1 and are also moving forward quickly. Whether it‚Äôs expanding networks, teaming up with strong partners, or launching new features, these four projects are becoming more noticeable in the crypto space. 1. BlockDAG Gains 2M+ Users as X10 Miner Demo Wraps Up BlockDAG stands out among top performing cryptos thanks to its mobile-first approach. Over 2 million people are now using the X1 mining app, which lets users mine directly from their phones without needing extra hardware. The dual mining system, pairing the X1 app with the hardware-based X10 miner, has completed its demo, showing a smooth upgrade path for users who want more power. At $0.0016, BlockDAG has set its launch price at $0.05, pointing to a possible 3,025% return. The coin supply is fixed, which helps prevent the kind of value loss that happens in high-emission systems. The roadmap is already clear, and with the GLOBAL LAUNCH release happening on August 11, activity around the project is expected to grow even more. Alongside its pricing model, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining attention with real progress. It has already raised $353 million in presale and sold 24.3 billion coins. While the real market test will come after launch, the current scale suggests it‚Äôs ready for fast adoption. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release now less than a month away, BlockDAG is being watched closely for its combination of strong tech, growing user base, and low entry price. 2. VeChain: Expanding Reach Through Enterprise Solutions VeChain is trading below $0.024 and keeps building trust in supply chain tracking, product authentication, and carbon management. Its practical focus has helped it form partnerships with several well-known global companies. Among top performing cryptos with real-world utility, VeChain is notable for its dual-coin design, VET and VTHO, which supports smooth operations and contract execution. The recent VIP-202 update is aimed at improving governance and increasing scalability. Though it has not seen sharp price jumps, VeChain‚Äôs steady upgrades and low-inflation approach make it a stable choice for long-term use in its ecosystem. 3. Ondo Finance: Bridging Real Assets with DeFi Growth With a price close to $1, ONDO brings real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries onto the blockchain, making it an important name in institutional-grade DeFi. Its model appeals to traditional finance, working to connect off-chain value with on-chain liquidity. Supported by Coinbase Ventures, ONDO has gained listings on major exchanges, boosting its trading activity and reach. Among current top performing cryptos, ONDO is known for its focus on RWA integration and its capped supply of 10 billion. While rules for tokenized assets are still evolving, ONDO‚Äôs early efforts in this field give it a strong position for the next phase of adoption.. 4. Fetch.ai: ASI Alliance Drives AI-Powered Expansion FET trades just under $0.73 and is seen as one of the top performing cryptos with a focus on AI technology. Now part of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI), it works with SingularityNET and Ocean Protocol to build shared AI systems for decentralized platforms. Originally created to run autonomous agents for tasks like trading, logistics, and optimization, FET is now expanding its role under the ASI framework. Although AI-driven crypto tools are still growing, this partnership has improved visibility and combined technical expertise, strengthening its long-term outlook. Which Crypto Could Lead 2025 BlockDAG, VeChain, Ondo, and Fetch.ai each bring unique strengths, ranging from mining and supply solutions to AI and real-world finance. They all fall within the top performing crypto group, giving broader entry to the market. Among them, BlockDAG‚Äôs mobile-first mining model, large user base, and low starting price make it stand out as the GLOBAL LAUNCH release draws closer. At the same time, VeChain‚Äôs enterprise links, ONDO‚Äôs RWA strategy, and FET‚Äôs AI tools keep this list forward-looking and diverse. As these projects evolve, the key leaders will be defined by real progress and practical use cases.

The post came from crypto analyst Ted Pillows, who pointed to global liquidity metrics‚Äîespecially the M2 money supply‚Äîto argue that ETH should already be trading above $8,000. Trump, who reposted the claim on X, added just two words: ‚ÄúI agree.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the first time Trump‚Äôs son has shared bullish views on crypto. He‚Äôs previously revealed investments in Bitcoin, Solana, and other altcoins. His growing commentary reflects the increasing alignment between political figures and digital assets‚Äîespecially as Ethereum‚Äôs role expands within the broader financial system. That growing momentum has also spotlighted emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project quietly building steam among early adopters eager to catch the next wave of altcoin growth. Ethereum‚Äôs Fundamentals Are Strengthening Despite current price levels, Ethereum‚Äôs use cases are deepening. From DeFi applications to tokenized assets and institutional staking, its foundation is more robust than ever. Analyst Ted Pillows connected ETH‚Äôs lagging price to global monetary expansion, making the case that it‚Äôs significantly behind its potential value. While institutions are gradually warming up to Ethereum, retail investors may be asking whether they‚Äôve already missed the biggest gains. That‚Äôs why growing attention is shifting toward newer projects that offer high growth from a low base. The Golden Ticket to 26x Returns One of the projects drawing serious attention right now is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could deliver 26x returns for high-conviction investors. With early rounds selling out quickly and rising demand from crypto communities, the project is gaining comparisons to the early days of SHIBA INU‚Äîbut with a stronger development roadmap and real-time traction. Strategic investors are lining up for early access, hoping to capture exponential gains before major exchange listings go live. As the market seeks the next explosive altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming a top contender. Trump‚Äôs Endorsement Reflects a Wider Shift Eric Trump‚Äôs remarks aren‚Äôt just about Ethereum‚Äîthey represent a broader cultural and financial shift. Crypto is no longer a fringe movement; it‚Äôs increasingly part of mainstream financial discussion. As digital assets become more intertwined with politics, global economics, and innovation, the search for undervalued gems‚Äîboth large and small‚Äîwill only intensify. For investors, Ethereum remains a core piece of the puzzle. But with projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging and gaining momentum, those looking for the next big opportunity may want to consider acting before the window closes.

While some fade after a quick rise, others are quietly shaping new paths. With ideas like AI networks, real estate on-chain, and meme coins finding real-world space, 2025 seems to reward more than just hype. This list of the best crypto coins to buy highlights four different projects: BlockDAG, Pudgy Penguins, Bittensor, and Ondo. These aren‚Äôt just getting attention; they are making moves. Each one stands out for different reasons, from how they build, what they represent, or who‚Äôs watching them closely. 1. BlockDAG: Running on Real Tech, Not Just Big Ideas BlockDAG makes the best crypto coins to buy list by showing results before launch even hits. It uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) base instead of a regular blockchain. This lets it move faster and scale better, making it ready for real-world dApps. The numbers already tell a story. Over 4,500 developers are building more than 300 active projects across DeFi, AI, and other sectors. BlockDAG plans to support 1,000 dApps by 2026 and partnered with HackerEarth globally earlier this year. But it‚Äôs not only about code. The mining setup is already live. A demo shows how the mobile X1 app links with the X10 miner to grow daily mining from 20 to 200 BDAG. With over 2 million people using the X1 app, and X10 shipping starting August 15, it‚Äôs not just in testing anymore. The presale also reflects strong progress: $353 million raised, 24.3 billion BDAG sold, and a fixed price of $0.0016 until August 11. The confirmed launch price is $0.05, and some outlooks point to $1 soon after and possibly $5 later. With working tools, users on board, and real growth, BlockDAG (BDAG) is proving its case early. 2. Pudgy Penguins: From Meme Origins to Retail Shelves Pudgy Penguins is more than a viral meme. It‚Äôs turning into a global brand with traction outside the web. At a low entry price and backed by a strong NFT following, PENGU now appears in stores, racks up billions of views online, and has teamed up with names like Sotheby‚Äôs and NASCAR. Its presence is expanding fast across Asia, and the project‚Äôs ETF filing adds weight rarely seen in meme-linked assets. That mix of playful branding and serious reach puts PENGU in a different class than most hype-driven names. It stands out in talks about the best crypto coins to buy by merging internet energy with corporate-level presence. 3. Bittensor: The Bridge Between AI and Blockchain Bittensor (TAO) is finding its lane where artificial intelligence and blockchain meet. Many projects use AI as a buzzword, but Bittensor shows actual use, earning revenue and keeping developers engaged. It also runs on a tight supply model, which helps create scarcity. But what sets it apart is how deep it connects with machine learning systems. With AI set to grow even more in 2025, Bittensor could become a key base layer for future AI-linked crypto projects. When discussing the best crypto coins to buy, TAO is in a rare space by combining two strong tech trends and already showing progress. 4. Ondo: Bringing Real-World Assets On-Chain With Purpose Ondo (ONDO) is not just exploring real-world asset (RWA) use cases. It‚Äôs already showing how to turn them into value. The project uses yield from tokenized assets like real estate and treasuries to fund buybacks of ONDO. This loop builds more value over time. That setup has started to catch the eye of large players who want lower risk while trying blockchain. As Ethereum hits scaling issues, Ondo‚Äôs focus on yield and efficiency gives it an edge. It‚Äôs one of the best crypto coins to buy for those looking at the next wave of bigger players entering the space. Its quiet rise hints at staying power. Which Project Is Sending the Clearest Signal? All four picks have something different to offer. Pudgy Penguins pushes culture while growing global reach. Bittensor is proving its AI use beyond talk. Ondo‚Äôs structure is built for long-term appeal in serious financial circles. But BlockDAG is the one blending all of this into one engine. It‚Äôs not waiting for momentum to find it. The pieces are already in motion. For those looking at the best crypto coins to buy in 2025 , it‚Äôs the one making the most noise with the most to show.

49017780,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=172528,1753578059,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/49017780.jpeg,Why Is the Crypto Market Crashing Today?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-is-the-crypto-market-crashing-today/,"The cryptocurrency market faced a brutal pullback on Friday, erasing nearly $160 billion in value as the total market cap sank to around $3.84 trillion, according to CoinGecko. This sharp 6.7% decline comes after four straight weeks of bullish momentum, raising questions about whether the recent rally has finally run out of steam. Bitcoin, which had climbed past $120,000, retreated to $115,300, a 2.6% drop in just 24 hours. Ethereum dipped 1.3% to $3,596, while XRP suffered a more severe 3.6% decline, now hovering near $3.07. The sell-off appears linked to a combination of massive liquidations , shifting sentiment, and aggressive moves by major institutional players. Some early-stage tokens, however, are drawing fresh attention from investors seeking outsized returns. One such project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has surfaced on the radar after recent analyst reports identified a 12,300% ROI potential for early adopters. With demand surging and supply access still limited, the project is increasingly being compared to the early growth phases of coins like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN. Galaxy Digital Sell-Off Intensifies Market Pressure Concerns escalated when Galaxy Digital reportedly dumped 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.18 billion, on the market. On-chain data also showed the firm withdrawing $370 million in USDT from exchanges like Binance and Bybit‚Äîmoves often viewed as preparation for further selling. Shortly after, another 2,850 BTC (worth over $330 million) was transferred to centralized platforms, amplifying fears that the sell-off was far from over. This sparked a wave of panic selling and triggered a series of margin calls across the market. Leverage Wipeout Across Top Coins Over $721 million in leveraged positions were liquidated in just 24 hours. Ethereum led the cascade with $163.9 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin at $155.5 million, and XRP with nearly $49 million wiped out. Within a 12-hour stretch, $273 million in long positions were cleared, including a single liquidation on OKX valued at $17.35 million. These forced sell-offs accelerated the downturn and exposed the fragility of overleveraged trading strategies in volatile markets. Sentiment Split: Fearless Buyers or Fools Rushing In? Despite the chaos, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in ‚ÄúGreed‚Äù territory, hinting that many retail investors still see this dip as a buy-the-dip opportunity , not the beginning of a larger downturn. Analysts warn, however, that misplaced optimism could deepen the fall if key support zones fail. Technical Breakdown and Institutional Rotation Bitcoin has slipped below a critical support level at $116,000, a zone traders are closely watching for signs of stabilization. Ethereum is facing headwinds from rising validator queues, while XRP risks falling to $2.72 if current momentum persists. Institutional reshuffling may also be adding fuel to the volatility. Firms like BlackRock and Fidelity are reportedly adjusting allocations, triggering short-term market shocks even as they maintain broader long-term exposure through Bitcoin ETFs. Some altcoins, however, managed to buck the trend. Vine, The Innovation Game, and Pepecoin each posted gains of over 30%, indicating that selective risk appetite still exists within the market. Conclusion Friday‚Äôs sell-off was a wake-up call for many overconfident bulls. Still, the broader outlook remains mixed‚Äîsome interpret this as a healthy cooldown, while others brace for deeper losses. As investors scan the market for resilient opportunities, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, backed by a forecasted 12,300% ROI , are fast becoming focal points for those seeking early-stage upside during uncertain times.

In a market hungry for outsized returns and early access to new narratives, presales offer a window into projects before exchange listings drive mainstream exposure. From infrastructure to DeFi to meme coin plays, 2025 is already shaping up to be a massive year for early-entry tokens. Among the most-watched projects this season are BlockDAG and Unstaked. These two presales have attracted strong traction due to their technical messaging and scalable token structures. Investors are watching them closely‚Äînot just for their roadmaps, but for the speed at which they‚Äôve attracted early capital. But momentum isn‚Äôt limited to infrastructure or staking utilities. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious attention , after its latest round reached capacity in record time , drawing over 6,000 investors . It‚Äôs quickly becoming one of the standout meme coin presales of the current cycle. What‚Äôs fueling demand for BlockDAG and Unstaked BlockDAG has emerged as a favorite among tech-focused investors. Its approach to scaling through Directed Acyclic Graph architecture‚Äîrather than traditional blockchain‚Äîhas drawn comparisons to DAG-layered networks like Kaspa . The project has supplemented this with sports partnerships, a viral app-based mining tool, and a unique ‚Äú No Vesting Pass ‚Äù model that gives users immediate access to their tokens. As presale rounds continue to fill, the project is earning attention for both its branding and engineering. Unstaked, by contrast, is building its appeal around security and network contribution. Designed for staking rewards and validator incentives, Unstaked is positioning itself as a next-gen passive income layer. Its staking model offers users rewards for holding and participating in chain governance, giving it the kind of DeFi crossover that‚Äôs caught the eye of long-term holders. Both projects have pushed hard into retail channels and influencer networks, but another token is matching that pace‚Äîthrough pure organic growth and presale velocity. A meme token that‚Äôs becoming impossible to ignore While many projects rely on infrastructure innovation or passive yield mechanics, MAGACOIN FINANCE is growing through community strength, timing, and viral design . Built for fast rollout and wide accessibility, the project is attracting high ‚Äì volume participation from retail traders looking to front-run the next meme coin surge. The token blends classic meme culture with a tight supply model, an incentivized referral system, and brand-focused outreach that‚Äôs already gaining traction across crypto Twitter. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is its balance of simplicity and speed . Traders are beginning to view MAGA as the project with the strongest breakout setup heading into the Q3 of 2025. Conclusion BlockDAG and Unstaked represent two strong bets in the infrastructure and staking categories. But meme coin investors are watching a different chart‚ÄîMAGACOIN FINANCE just became one of the few presales this cycle where over 6,000 investors rushed in as the latest round reached capacity in record time , marking it as a serious contender in the months ahead.

The flagship cryptocurrency, however, came tumbling toward the $115,000 mark following massive coin movements toward centralized exchanges in the past day. Interestingly, a prominent market expert has put forward an even more bearish outlook for the Bitcoin price over the next few weeks. With this latest projection, the price of BTC seems to only be at the beginning of a downward spiral, which could worsen over the coming days. How BTC Price Could Be At Risk Of Extended Decline In a July 25 post on social media platform X, Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Aksel Kibar painted a bearish picture for the Bitcoin price after falling to $115,000 on Friday. According to the analyst, the flagship cryptocurrency could be on its way to around $109,000 in the coming days. Related Reading: This Australian Investment Manager Just Added Bitcoin To Its Treasury, Here‚Äôs How Much BTC They‚Äôve Bought Kibar‚Äôs bearish stance revolves around the inverse head-and-shoulder pattern on the Bitcoin price chart on the weekly timeframe. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is a technical analysis formation characterized by three distinct price troughs, including a lower ‚Äúhead‚Äù set between two higher ‚Äúshoulders.‚Äù Typically, the inverse pattern signals a possible bullish breakout and is validated when the price breaches the neckline ‚Äî a trendline connecting the crests (swing highs) between the head. As shown in the chart below, the Bitcoin price has already broken through the neckline to reach a new all-time high. However, Kibar explained that the price breakout witnessed by Bitcoin might not be the textbook breakout typically expected in most inverse head-and-shoulders pattern scenarios. According to the market expert, most head-and-shoulder breakouts are followed by pullbacks and retests rather than straight rallies. Chart data provided by the analyst shows that, since May 2017, the Bitcoin price has witnessed a retest or pullback (type 2 continuation) more times than a straight rally (type 1 continuation) after a head-and-shoulder pattern breakout. This trend explains the rationale behind Kibar‚Äôs bearish projection for BTC in the next few days. If the price of Bitcoin does suffer a deeper correction as in the type 2 continuation, it is likely to return to the neckline ‚Äî and around the $109,000 mark. A move like this would represent an over 5% decline from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After a horrendous start to the day, the market leader seems to be recovering nicely from its recent fall to $115,000. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $117,323, reflecting a mere 0.6% decline in the past 24 hours.

J.A. Maartunn, a contributor to the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, weighed in on the situation via social media platform X. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get dumped on,‚Äù Maartunn cautioned. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be the exit liquidity. Protect yourself.‚Äù Massive Holdings Raise Red Flags Larsen‚Äôs transfer came just after XRP briefly surged to highs near $3.60 on July 17, approaching its all-time record. Despite the rally, the excitement was quickly tempered by outflows from a wallet linked to Larsen, prompting mixed reactions. Some interpreted the move as normal profit-taking, while others accused him of exploiting the price peak to offload tokens. Maartunn highlighted that the 50 million XRP moved represents only a small portion of Larsen‚Äôs reported holdings. According to him, Larsen still holds around 2.58 billion XRP, worth approximately $8.83 billion at current prices. ‚ÄúIf $200M was just the warm-up‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs next?‚Äù he asked. Market Pullback After Rally The recent sell-off by Larsen coincided with a broader correction in XRP‚Äôs price. After surging as part of a wider altcoin rally‚Äîfollowing Bitcoin‚Äôs consolidation phase‚ÄîXRP has pulled back around 13%. It is currently trading at $3.18, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView data. The pullback, coupled with Larsen‚Äôs wallet activity, has added to investor caution. Other market analysts, including prominent trader ManLy, echoed the concerns about large holders dumping tokens at the expense of retail investors. Comparisons to Bitcoin Whale Activity XRP‚Äôs situation mirrors recent volatility seen in the Bitcoin market. Earlier this month, a Satoshi-era whale liquidated 80,000 dormant BTC, sending BTC/USD sharply lower to around $114,500 before bouncing back. Galaxy Digital reportedly handled that transaction, and the sudden move triggered over $500 million in liquidations across the crypto space, according to CoinGlass data. While Bitcoin quickly recovered, the scale of such transactions highlights the ongoing risks faced by cryptocurrency investors when large holders suddenly move their assets. Cautious Sentiment Prevails For now, analysts are urging caution. XRP‚Äôs potential for future growth remains intact, but the looming threat of further sell-side pressure from insiders like Larsen may dampen short-term investor enthusiasm. Many in the XRP community are now watching Larsen‚Äôs wallet closely, wary of becoming collateral damage in a larger exit strategy.

Version 1.18.15, now live across the network, reduces latency and strengthens throughput efficiency‚Äîhelping ensure seamless activity during high-volume periods. This comes as Firedancer, the long-awaited validator client capable of supporting up to 1 million transactions per second, enters public testing. The timing couldn‚Äôt be more critical. After a turbulent 2023 marked by outages and reliability issues, Solana is rebounding in both technical capacity and market confidence. NFT collections are relaunching , DeFi projects are returning , and retail interest has surged amid memecoin-driven trading booms. SOL has hovered steadily above $170 , and developers are once again building with conviction. This momentum is reminding many traders of earlier crypto breakouts‚Äîwhen Dogecoin was still under a penny and Solana was an underdog. Today, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging with that same early-stage energy , capturing attention as the next high-upside contender. From early movers to rising meme stars The crypto landscape thrives on timing . Solana and Dogecoin rewarded those who entered before the hype cycles began‚Äîbefore mainstream media, before the ETFs, before the top 10 listings. That pattern is playing out again, but now with a new generation of traders watching closely. Those who missed out on DOGECOIN and SOLANA‚Äôs first wave are now watching MAGACOIN FINANCE take off, driven by community velocity, viral spread, and a deflationary token model. The project has surged through its presale rounds, drawing comparisons to the early days of DOGE when price jumps were measured in memes and momentum. Analysts are taking notice. With listings on the horizon and staking mechanics in development, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a calculated meme play‚Äîoffering structure beneath the speculation. Its lean supply and fast-rising demand are fueling forecasts of major upside potential, with many calling this the last phase of strategic entry before prices recalibrate post-launch. Solana upgrade unlocks new performance ceiling Back on the infrastructure front, Solana‚Äôs latest upgrade is more than just a patch‚Äîit‚Äôs a reset for its reputation. Developers are now actively contributing again, GitHub commits are rising, and Firedancer‚Äôs parallel client design is expected to reduce the network‚Äôs dependence on any single validator framework. With Solana now hosting real-time trading bots, Web3 games, NFT platforms, and micro-payment systems, performance and uptime are no longer optional‚Äîthey are mission-critical. This technical leap positions Solana as not just an Ethereum alternative, but potentially a default chain for real-time applications in the AI and DePIN sectors. Institutional interest is also catching up. As Ethereum ETFs draw attention and Solana ETF speculation increases, SOL is becoming more attractive to capital allocators looking for high-throughput ecosystems. With Firedancer in sight and scalability now measurable, 2025 could be a breakout year for Solana‚Äôs core infrastructure. Conclusion Solana‚Äôs validator upgrade and Firedancer rollout mark a pivotal inflection point for the network‚Äôs future. With technical reliability catching up to vision, and investor confidence returning across the board, Solana is well-positioned to dominate the next wave of blockchain adoption. For those watching Layer 1 performance and institutional traction, Solana is once again becoming the chain to beat. For traders who missed the explosive rise of Dogecoin and Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE now offers a rare early-stage opportunity‚Äîand it‚Äôs already beginning to take off.

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, every major transaction sends ripples, but some create veritable waves. Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of an extraordinary Justin Sun ETH transfer. Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracker, reported a staggering movement of 60,000 ETH from Binance, one of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to a wallet widely associated with Justin Sun, the prominent founder of Tron and a key figure in the crypto space. Valued at approximately $226 million at the time of the transaction, this isn‚Äôt just a casual fund movement; it‚Äôs a whale-sized maneuver that demands closer inspection. What does such a colossal Justin Sun ETH transfer signify, and what might its implications be for the broader Ethereum ecosystem and the crypto market? What Just Happened? The Massive Justin Sun ETH Transfer Unpacked The cryptocurrency market thrives on transparency, with every transaction recorded on a public ledger. When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, especially involving a well-known personality like Justin Sun, it immediately captures attention. The reported Justin Sun ETH transfer involved 60,000 Ethereum tokens, making it one of the largest single movements of ETH in recent times. To put this into perspective, $226 million is a substantial sum that could influence market dynamics, liquidity, and even investor sentiment. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the event: Asset Transferred: 60,000 Ethereum (ETH) Origin: Binance (Centralized Exchange) Destination: A wallet linked to Justin Sun Approximate Value: $226 million Reporting Source: Whale Alert (On-chain tracking service) Such large transfers, often referred to as ‚Äòwhale movements,‚Äô are meticulously watched by traders, analysts, and investors alike. They can sometimes precede significant market shifts, either signaling accumulation (buying) or distribution (selling) intentions. Understanding the context behind these movements is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile crypto landscape. Who is Justin Sun and Why Do His ETH Moves Matter? Justin Sun is not just any crypto holder; he is a bona fide titan in the blockchain industry. Best known as the founder of the TRON blockchain and its native cryptocurrency, TRX, Sun has also played significant roles in other major crypto ventures, including serving as an advisor to Huobi Global and being involved with Poloniex. His influence stems from several factors: Vast Holdings: Sun is known to possess significant holdings across various cryptocurrencies, making him a true ‚Äòwhale.‚Äô His portfolio size means his movements can genuinely impact market liquidity and sentiment. Market Influence: Given his public profile and connections within the industry, his actions are often scrutinized for potential insights into market trends or strategic plays. Strategic Vision: Sun is known for his aggressive business strategies, including acquisitions and partnerships, which often involve large-scale asset movements. When a figure of Justin Sun‚Äôs stature executes a massive Justin Sun ETH transfer, it‚Äôs rarely without purpose. These actions are often part of a larger strategy, whether it‚Äôs related to his personal investment portfolio, the operations of his associated projects like TRON or Huobi, or a broader market play. Therefore, tracking his movements provides a fascinating lens through which to view potential shifts in the crypto economy. Decoding the Motives: Why This $226 Million Justin Sun ETH Transfer? The exact reasons behind a large Justin Sun ETH transfer are rarely disclosed publicly, leading to much speculation within the community. However, based on common crypto whale behaviors and Justin Sun‚Äôs history, several plausible scenarios emerge: 1. Portfolio Rebalancing or Diversification Just like traditional investors, crypto whales frequently rebalance their portfolios to manage risk or capitalize on perceived opportunities. This Justin Sun ETH transfer could be part of a broader strategy to adjust his holdings, perhaps selling other assets to acquire more ETH, or moving ETH to prepare for investments in other digital assets or even traditional markets. 2. Staking or DeFi Participation Ethereum‚Äôs transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with the Merge has made ETH staking a lucrative option for many holders. Moving such a large sum from an exchange to a private wallet could indicate an intention to stake the ETH, contributing to the network‚Äôs security and earning rewards. Alternatively, the funds might be destined for participation in various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, such as lending, borrowing, or yield farming, which often require assets to be held in self-custody wallets. 3. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals For transactions of this magnitude, whales often prefer Over-the-Counter (OTC) desks rather than executing trades on public exchanges, which could cause significant price slippage. The movement of 60,000 ETH to a private wallet could be a preparatory step for an OTC deal, where the ETH is sold directly to an institutional buyer or another large investor without impacting public order books. 4. Exchange Operations or Consolidations Given Justin Sun‚Äôs involvement with exchanges like Huobi Global and Poloniex, the transfer might be related to internal operational needs. This could include consolidating funds, preparing for liquidity provisions on these platforms, or even moving assets for a specific strategic initiative tied to one of his affiliated exchanges. 5. Enhanced Security Measures While Binance is a secure exchange, some large holders prefer to move significant assets to cold storage wallets for maximum security. This Justin Sun ETH transfer could simply be a move to a more secure, self-custodied wallet, reducing counterparty risk associated with centralized exchanges. 6. Market Speculation or Strategic Accumulation Finally, the move could be a highly strategic one, indicating Justin Sun‚Äôs bullish outlook on Ethereum. By accumulating a large amount of ETH off-exchange, he might be positioning himself for anticipated future price appreciation, or even preparing to use the ETH for a major project or initiative that he believes will drive its value up. The Ripple Effect: How Whale Moves Impact the Ethereum Market Large transfers like the recent Justin Sun ETH movement, while not always directly indicative of immediate selling or buying pressure, can still have a profound impact on the market in several ways: Sentiment Shift: Whale movements often trigger speculation. If the market perceives a whale is accumulating, it can foster bullish sentiment. Conversely, if a whale moves funds to an exchange, it might signal an intent to sell, leading to bearish sentiment. Liquidity Dynamics: Moving assets off an exchange reduces the immediate supply available for trading on that platform, potentially impacting its liquidity. Conversely, moving assets onto an exchange increases the potential sell-side liquidity. Price Volatility: While direct price impact isn‚Äôt guaranteed unless the assets are traded on an open market, the sheer size of such a transfer can cause short-term price fluctuations as traders react to the news. On-Chain Data Analysis: These transfers provide valuable data points for on-chain analysts, who use them to track accumulation/distribution trends, exchange flows, and overall network health. It‚Äôs important to remember that not all large transfers lead to immediate price action. Many are simply logistical moves by institutions or large holders managing their assets. However, ignoring them entirely would be imprudent for serious market participants. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For everyday crypto investors, understanding whale movements, including the recent Justin Sun ETH transfer, can provide valuable context without necessarily dictating immediate trading decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Don‚Äôt Panic Trade: Resist the urge to make impulsive trading decisions based solely on a single whale alert. Context is key. A transfer to a private wallet is different from a transfer to an exchange‚Äôs deposit address. Monitor On-Chain Data (But With Caution): Tools like Whale Alert are excellent for transparency. However, interpret data carefully. A large transfer doesn‚Äôt automatically mean a dump or pump is imminent. Look for patterns, not just isolated events. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on one asset makes you more vulnerable to the whims of large holders or market shocks. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with sudden whale movements. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the fundamentals of the assets you invest in. Don‚Äôt blindly follow whale movements or social media hype. Consider Long-Term Fundamentals: For Ethereum, focus on its ongoing development, adoption, and utility rather than short-term price swings caused by large transfers. The strength of the network and its ecosystem will be the primary drivers of long-term value. Ultimately, while fascinating, whale movements are just one piece of the complex crypto puzzle. A holistic approach that combines on-chain analysis with fundamental research and a strong understanding of market psychology will serve investors best. Conclusion: The Enduring Significance of Whale Movements The 60,000 ETH transfer from Binance to Justin Sun‚Äôs associated wallet, valued at an astounding $226 million, is more than just a large transaction; it‚Äôs a testament to the scale and dynamism of the cryptocurrency market. While the precise motives behind this particular Justin Sun ETH movement remain speculative, it highlights the immense influence that crypto whales wield. Whether it signals strategic rebalancing, a move towards staking, an OTC deal, or simply enhanced security, such events serve as powerful reminders of the interconnectedness and transparency inherent in blockchain technology. For investors, these alerts are not signals for panic but rather opportunities for informed observation. By understanding the potential reasons behind such colossal transfers and their broader market implications, participants can better navigate the often-turbulent crypto seas. As the digital asset space continues to mature, the actions of its largest players will undoubtedly continue to shape narratives and influence trajectories, making vigilance and a nuanced understanding of on-chain data more crucial than ever. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‚Äòcrypto whale‚Äô and why are their movements significant? A ‚Äòcrypto whale‚Äô is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their movements are significant because their large holdings mean their buying or selling activities can significantly impact market prices, liquidity, and overall market sentiment. Q2: How was the 60,000 ETH transfer to Justin Sun detected? The transfer was detected and reported by Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking and analytics service. Whale Alert monitors large transactions across various blockchains and publicly reports them, often tagging prominent wallets or known entities when possible. Q3: Does this Justin Sun ETH transfer automatically mean a price dump is coming? Not necessarily. While a large transfer to an exchange can sometimes precede selling, a transfer from an exchange to a private wallet (as in this case) could indicate various intentions, including staking, participation in DeFi, OTC deals, or simply enhanced security. It does not automatically imply an impending price dump. Q4: What are the potential reasons for such a large ETH transfer to a private wallet? Potential reasons include portfolio rebalancing, moving assets for staking on the Ethereum network, participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, preparing for an Over-the-Counter (OTC) trade, consolidating funds for associated exchange operations (like Huobi), or moving funds to a more secure cold storage solution. Q5: How can average investors use information about whale movements? Average investors should use whale movement information as a piece of the puzzle, not the sole basis for decisions. It can help gauge market sentiment and liquidity, but always combine it with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and sound risk management. Avoid panic trading based on isolated whale alerts.

That news has helped push Bitcoin to even higher levels of dominance, meaning most of the money right now is flowing into Bitcoin rather than altcoins. But as investors start buying during the altcoin dip, popular altcoins like XRP, Sui, and Pudgy Penguins could be on track to hit new all-time highs in the coming week. Bitcoin Dominance May Restrict Altcoins Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance has grown a lot in recent weeks, now hovering over 60% of it. As a result, many altcoins have seen their prices drop. If this trend continues, even more money could move into Bitcoin, which might put pressure on altcoins. Still, despite this, top altcoins like XRP, Sui, and PENGU could break out and hit new all-time highs in the coming week. XRP Price Analysis Recently, XRP hit near all-time highs above $3.60, but the achievement was quickly overshadowed by large outflows from a wallet linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. Investors face new warnings over becoming ‚Äúexit liquidity‚Äù after Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen moved 50 million tokens to exchanges. He still has around $9 billion left to sell. XRP/USD If concerns around XRP sell off decline, XRP price might attempt to retest its resistance at $3.6. As of writing, XRP price trades at $3.4, surging over 5.5% in the last 24 hours. The RSI level is currently on a rise, heading toward the midline. If buying demand continues and XRP breaks above $3.6, it might form a new ATH next week. However, a failure to hold above the EMA20 trend line on the 4-hour chart might plunge the open interest, eliminating hopes of a new ATH. Sui Price Analysis SUI soared above the $4.2 resistance, and the bulls have successfully maintained the price above the breakout level. That suggests the buyers are trying to flip the $4.2 level into support. As of writing, SUI trades at $4.3, surging over 13% in the last 24 hours. SUI/USDT If the price breaks above immediate Fib levels, the SUI/USDT pair could continue the uptrend. As a result, SUI price might reach its previous ATH of $5.35. Although the trend remains up, the overbought level on the RSI increases the risk of a correction or consolidation in the near term. If the price dips and closes below $4, the pair could tumble to the 20-day EMA. Pudgy Penguins Price Analysis PENGU price is currently stuck in a tough fight between buyers and sellers around the $0.045 mark. If the price falls and closes below EMA20 level, sellers might push it down to $0.036.

Once a lesser-known blockchain, it rapidly climbed into the top ranks by solving major issues plaguing its predecessors‚Äînamely, slow transaction speeds and high gas fees. In just over a year, it evolved from a startup to a multibillion-dollar ecosystem powering NFTs, gaming, and DeFi at scale. Solana‚Äôs Meteoric Rise Set the Standard Launched in 2020, Solana‚Äôs speed and scalability were a breath of fresh air for developers. Its proof-of-history model allowed it to process over 65,000 transactions per second, all for fractions of a cent. These features helped it secure partnerships, launch hundreds of dApps, and attract some of the biggest names in crypto. The token price reflected that excitement. From under $1 in early 2021, SOL exploded to an all-time high of $260, delivering over 25,000% returns to early backers. Solana became a favorite for NFT marketplaces like Magic Eden and high-throughput platforms like Serum. Even in bearish conditions, it maintained momentum‚Äîsignaling it wasn‚Äôt just a short-term hype cycle but a long-term player. Today, investors are keeping a close eye on projects that resemble Solana‚Äôs early trajectory‚Äîfast-moving, community-driven, and technologically ambitious. And one name keeps coming up. Is This the Next Solana Moment? MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the spotlight as a new contender in early-stage crypto investing . According to leading analysts, its presale is accelerating faster than Solana ‚Äôs initial fundraising rounds, driven by swelling demand and fast sellouts. What‚Äôs attracting this attention? Projections point to a potential ROI of 10,500% , a figure reminiscent of Solana‚Äôs legendary bull run . With early participants securing positions ahead of major exchange listings, the buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE is building fast. Each new round is closing quicker than the last, and investor sentiment is surging as access windows begin to close. For those who missed Solana‚Äôs first leap‚Äîor wish they had gotten in sooner‚ÄîMAGACOIN FINANCE is being closely watched as the next altcoin gem in the making.

Projects that offer open features, quick testing, and known platforms tend to draw early developer support. This is the approach BlockDAG has taken. Its live testnet now supports EVM, connects with MetaMask, and includes tools for minting NFTs and deploying smart contracts, all before the mainnet launch. BlockDAG is now in Stage 29 and has raised over $353 million. The current price is set at $0.0016 for a limited time, compared to the regular $0.0276 for this stage. Since the first batch, BlockDAG (BDAG) has shown a 2,660% ROI. On the other hand, Cardano continues to develop its tools more slowly, which may limit how quickly developers can build on it. Live Testnet and Developer Toolkit BlockDAG‚Äôs testnet is already working and offers real use. Developers can launch smart contracts that work with EVM, mint NFTs, use a faucet to test transfers, and follow updates with the Blockchain Explorer. MetaMask support helps developers use the tools they already know. The structure is similar to Ethereum‚Äôs, but BlockDAG adds scale with a hybrid model. It uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for parallel block creation and Proof-of-Work to protect the network. This allows the system to handle between 2,000 and 15,000 transactions per second. In comparison, Cardano‚Äôs tools are still building. Developers must use Plutus or Aiken to write contracts, which rely on Haskell-style programming. While these tools are strong, they have a steep learning curve that can slow early testing and project building. Tools That Match Developer Habits BlockDAG supports tools and wallets already used by many in the Web3 developer world. Smart contracts run with Solidity, and developers can connect with the testnet using MetaMask. This removes the need to learn new tools or switch to unfamiliar wallets. Cardano takes a different approach with its wallet options. It uses Daedalus, Yoroi, and Lace, each made specifically for ADA. These work well for Cardano but do not offer the ease of use or fast setup found with MetaMask. Also, interacting with smart contracts in Cardano often involves third-party platforms or tools built by the community, which adds extra steps for new developers. Cardano‚Äôs structure focuses on long-term use and trusted systems. But it often finds it hard to bring in fast-moving developer groups who want to build, test, and launch quickly. Network Growth and User Engagement BlockDAG‚Äôs progress is shown through user activity and wide participation. The presale has brought in over 200,000 holders, and its mobile miner app, X1, has reached more than 2 million users. These numbers show that many people are trying out the system even before the mainnet is live. Cardano is still one of the top Layer 1 platforms with a large market cap and over 139,000 smart contracts created. Still, its growth has been slow, and public interest has dropped recently. With ADA close to $0.87 and only a few apps getting much attention, developer activity has eased. BlockDAG takes a different path. By releasing tools early, inviting users to test the network, and showing what the system can do before launch, it builds both technical and community strength. Final Thoughts BlockDAG‚Äôs testnet already works like a builder‚Äôs sandbox. It includes full EVM support, fast setup, MetaMask access, and a clear path to mainnet. This lets developers build, test, and launch now. These are not future features; they are active, live, and ready for use today. Cardano is still a core project with strong design and long-term planning. But its developer activity has not kept up with what the tech claims to offer. In a fast-moving field focused on access and speed, the platform that gives working tools early is more likely to gain quick traction. Right now, BlockDAG seems to be that platform. With $353 million raised in crypto presale , a $0.0016 entry price, and 2,660% ROI since batch one, it is showing progress not only for developers but for the broader crypto community as well.

As reported by Cointelegraph, Andrew Keys, co-founder of an Ethereum-focused firm, claimed that early ETH investors saw returns exceeding 50X . Even after adjusting that number to 30x , the message remains clear: those who got in early and held conviction were rewarded with generational wealth. Ethereum‚Äôs early adopters made history Ethereum‚Äôs presale launched in mid-2015 when Bitcoin was already established. At that time, ETH traded at just a fraction of today‚Äôs prices. Despite the risk ‚Äînew tech, unknown developers, and skepticism around smart contracts‚Äîearly believers turned small stakes into massive fortunes as the network delivered on its decentralized vision. These success stories have become case studies in timing, risk tolerance, and asymmetric upside. Now, with 2025 shaping up to be another explosive cycle, traders are asking: what‚Äôs the next Ethereum-style opportunity? One emerging project is beginning to resemble the explosive first-day energy seen in some of crypto‚Äôs biggest launches. With fast-paced sellouts, viral branding, and a community-first referral engine, this token has captured early momentum that analysts say mirrors early-stage breakouts of known projects. Market watchers are now forecasting up to 40x potential returns , citing record-breaking presale activity and a rapidly accelerating holder base. For traders who missed previous profitable waves, this may be the kind of first-mover opportunity that defined past bull runs. This new wave of politically themed tokens often thrives when capital rotates out of large caps into high-risk, high-reward assets . With its aggressive launch mechanics and rising community buzz, the project is drawing in traders who missed the first waves of SHIBA INU, PEPE, and even ETH. What Ethereum taught us about early conviction ETH‚Äôs meteoric rise wasn‚Äôt just about innovation‚Äîit was about entry timing and community belief. At launch, Ethereum faced headwinds from Bitcoin maximalists and developers who questioned whether a smart contract platform could actually scale. But those who participated in its presale or bought during early cycles saw a different picture: an opportunity to be first in a system with massive future demand. That same dynamic is fueling the current interest in smaller-cap meme coins and early-stage presales. Investors today aren‚Äôt just chasing infrastructure‚Äîthey‚Äôre searching for breakout narratives with community traction, viral momentum, and token models designed for reflexive growth. Conclusion Ethereum showed what‚Äôs possible when early conviction meets explosive market adoption. In this new cycle, the meme coin space is replicating those dynamics in real time. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already broken momentum records‚Äîand with 40x gains possible, it‚Äôs being closely watched as the next big opportunity.

Bitcoin treasury companies are potential honeypots for nationalization in a future where the US government is attempting to maintain its dominant role in the global order by seizing BTC amid the US dollar being dropped as the world‚Äôs reserve currency. Bitcoin treasury companies hold Bitcoin in their treasury as a reserve asset. Michael Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy was the first company to pursue the strategy. Data shows public companies are in possession of one million Bitcoin companies as of mid-2025. Discussions around Bitcoin treasury companies rarely mention financial sovereignty. Bitcoin has generally been used by companies as a means to leverage BTC and boost stock prices. For instance, the Charles Schwab analysis of these companies offer investors a novel way to gain exposure to crypto while diversifying corporate balance sheets, but does not mention financial sovereignty. Schwab wrote, ‚ÄúStrategy made its commitment to cryptocurrency in 2020 and helped create the framework for Bitcoin treasury-holding companies, which can offer another way for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies.‚Äù Instead of empowering individuals to feel confident holding Bitcoin in a cold wallet, we are giving them easy options in which they do not hold their own private keys. On the contrary, Bitcoin has largely been viewed ‚Äì e specially by its early adopters ‚Äì as having the potential to separate money from the state. Whether treasury companies are a tool for liberty has yet to be seen. Early Bitcoin adopters ‚Äì such as Adam Back ‚Äì herald Bitcoin treasury companies as bolstering Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a global store of value independent of the state. This thesis is unlikely to play out. Bitcoin treasury companies instead are tentacles of the state in a way. They have gone public. Accountants and lawyers answer to regulators and often exercise a lot of power alongside executives within the corporate structure. The truth is simple ‚Äì Bitcoin treasury companies cannot operate independently of the state. They are the main targets of government scrutiny, which makes them candidates for a nationalization push. The state could easily consider corporate Bitcoin holdings as a threat to fiat currency. Central banks ‚Äì 90% of them, according to the International Monetary Fund ‚Äì are developing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) to preclude the need for Bitcoin as a reserve asset, suggesting governments already see Bitcoin as a threat. If Bitcoin unseats fiat currencies, Bitcoin treasury companies could be nationalized, in which states confiscate corporate assets. There is precedent for such an action ‚Äì the 1933 US Executive Order 6102 required citizens to turn in their gold to the government. Moreover, the US government has nationalized companies in the past. During World War I and II, the government nationalized railroads, telegraph lines and other industries in order to support war efforts. The US Railroad Administration nationalized railroads between 1917 and 1920. During World War II, coal mines, steel mills and even retailer Montgomery Ward were seized to ensure continued production and prevent disruptions. Montgomery Ward might have been a Bitcoin treasury company if it were under the same leadership as it was at the time of its nationalization. Sewell Avery was the chairman of Montgomery Ward. He refused to comply with the labor union and the War Labor Board‚Äôs demands. ‚ÄúTo hell with the government,‚Äù Avery reportedly yelled in April 1944 when Attorney General Francis Biddle confronted him. ‚ÄúI want none of your damned advice.‚Äù Avery sounds like a Bitcoiner. The government has also taken over numerous financial institutions. In 1984, the government took an 80 percent interest in Continental Illinois Bank, which was considered ‚Äòtoo big to fail.‚Äô During the 1989 Savings and Loan Crisis, the government set up the Resolution Trust Corporation to manage more than 1,000 failed savings and loan institutions. This cost the government more than $125 billion over six years. In the 2008-2009 financial crisis, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under federal conservatorship in 2008. The US government acquired a 60% stake in General Motors in a bankruptcy agreement. Canada took another 12.5%. The Trump Administration has de facto nationalized US steel by retaining significant control over business activities. A considerable share of the US public is pro-nationalization. Activists and policy experts have supported nationalizing fossil fuel companies to combat climate change. The nationalization of healthcare has been spearheaded by mainstream politicians like Bernie Sanders amid 63% of Americans calling for a nationalized system in 2020. Due to these reasons, Bitcoin treasury companies are honeypots for state nationalization ‚Äì a nd that‚Äôs why these companies have nothing on Bitcoin self-custody.

49026294,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=172558,1753588811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/49026294.jpeg,XRP vs. Pi Coin: Which Altcoin is the Better Investment?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-vs-pi-coin-which-altcoin-is-the-better-investment/,"For crypto investors weighing long-term plays, two names keep sparking debate: XRP and Pi Coin. While both aim to disrupt digital payments, their approaches couldn‚Äôt be more different‚ÄîXRP leans toward institutional finance, while Pi Coin is built around grassroots mobile adoption. The contrast goes beyond tech and price‚Äîit reflects two visions for crypto‚Äôs future. And in the midst of that debate, a rising third option is gaining attention among early adopters: MAGACOIN FINANCE, an emerging altcoin that analysts say could deliver potentially great returns this cycle. Origins and Purpose: Two Roads to Mass Adoption XRP, launched in 2012 by Ripple Labs, was built as a liquidity bridge for cross-border banking. Its main goal: to settle international transfers in seconds with minimal fees. Today, the XRP Ledger can process transactions in 3‚Äì5 seconds, and Ripple‚Äôs tech is used by major financial institutions. On the other side, Pi Coin was created in 2019 with a radically different goal: make crypto mining accessible to anyone with a smartphone. Instead of high-energy mining rigs, Pi relies on a mobile consensus model inspired by Stellar. The aim? Build a people-powered ecosystem that thrives on micro-payments and digital community engagement. Use Cases and Real-World Utility XRP is known for its deep integration into banking rails. It‚Äôs already been used by financial heavyweights like Santander and SBI Holdings, and supports institutional liquidity for remittance services. The coin‚Äôs utility in finance is clear‚Äîand growing. Pi Coin has a more experimental angle. Its value comes from building a decentralized ecosystem with over 100 decentralized apps (dApps), focused on gaming, digital commerce, and community tools. Initiatives like PiFest 2025, which brought over 10 million wallets into merchant-facing tools, show real progress‚Äîbut there‚Äôs still a long road to full adoption. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as a serious contender in the altcoin space. Its value isn‚Äôt based on banking access or experimental micro-payments‚Äîit‚Äôs the momentum behind the project that‚Äôs drawing attention. With 9,500% returns projected for early investors, industry analysts are comparing MAGACOIN‚Äôs growth curve to that of early SHIBA and DOGE runs. Community traction has surged in recent weeks as the limited-entry rounds keep selling out, making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most closely watched tokens right now. Legal Landscape and Market Maturity One thing that gives XRP a significant edge is legal clarity. The SEC battle that loomed for years saw a pivotal win after Ripple and the legal entity decided to settle. That gave Ripple the breathing room it needed to expand‚Äîand investors the confidence to hold. Pi Coin, by contrast, is still navigating early regulatory waters. While it launched its mainnet (partially) in late 2024, it hasn‚Äôt yet been listed on major centralized exchanges. Its Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification system is strong, but no major regulatory pressure has tested it yet. Price Action and Market Trends XRP has gained serious steam in 2025. Trading around $2.30 with a market cap over $134 billion, it‚Äôs posted 300% gains in just six months , driven by rising demand, growing use cases, and anticipation of a spot ETF approval after June‚Äôs court decision. Pi Coin‚Äôs story is more turbulent. After peaking near $2.98 in February, it‚Äôs since dropped to about $0.45. Its technical indicators remain weak‚Äîbut its user activity is holding firm, with millions still engaging daily across dApps and services. Community Support and Engagement The XRP community‚Äînicknamed the ‚ÄúXRP Army‚Äù‚Äîhas stood by the token through lawsuits and volatility, making it one of the most loyal followings in crypto. Its institutional angle also means it attracts traders with a focus on real-world integration and long-term use. Pi Coin has built a very different movement. Its users are largely everyday crypto enthusiasts, many drawn in by mobile mining and its referral-based growth model. The platform has also been surprisingly effective at consumer engagement‚Äîbeating XRP in some user polls for Visa card top-ups. Conclusion: Which Coin Makes More Sense in 2025? If you‚Äôre seeking a battle-tested project with clear regulatory standing and powerful institutional backers, XRP makes a strong case. It‚Äôs mature, integrated, and still rising. But if you‚Äôre looking for speculative upside with a people-first vision, Pi Coin might have more room to run‚Äîassuming it can gain listings and deliver on its utility promises. And for those with an eye on next-gen breakouts , MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming harder to ignore. With limited access and surging demand from early investors, many are watching closely as it builds toward broader exposure.

Troller Cat Tops Best Crypto to Explode in 2025 as Gigachad and Snek Advance,https://timestabloid.com/2024-in-the-bag-troller-cat-tops-best-crypto-to-explode-in-2025/,"The meme coin market is once again a whirlwind of price swings and bold narratives. Retail momentum is split between legacy coins, fresh launches, and unexpected breakouts. In this storm, one presale is raising eyebrows for all the right reasons. Troller Cat is no longer just a meme‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. Snek is holding its ground after a brief rally, stabilizing as traders wonder whether the next wave will push it further. Meanwhile, Gigachad has seen fresh traction, especially among holders who favor bold branding and maximalist energy. But the most magnetic headline this week? Troller Cat presale with over $400,000 raised, more than 1,500 holders, and an ROI of 2024.8% already clocked in, its current stage‚ÄîStage 15‚Äîpromises another 399.72% upside before the launch price hits. Welcome to ‚ÄúThe Left Shark Moment.‚Äù Troller Cat ($TCAT): The Meme Coin That‚Äôs Dancing Past 2000% ROI Troller Cat is rewriting the meme coin playbook with its 26-stage Ethereum-based presale. Currently in Stage 15 and priced at $0.00010624, the project has already generated over 2024% ROI from its $0.00000500 launch price. More than $400K has poured in, signaling major investor confidence and community strength. The theme of Stage 15, titled ‚ÄúThe Left Shark Moment,‚Äù pays tribute to the infamous 2015 Super Bowl halftime performance, where one backup dancer stole the internet‚Äôs heart by ignoring the routine and embracing chaos. Troller Cat mirrors this meme spirit, turning unpredictability into power. By celebrating the troll who defied choreography, the project doubles down on what makes meme culture thrive‚Äîoriginality, humor, and timing. This isn‚Äôt just lore. It‚Äôs baked into Troller Cat‚Äôs ecosystem. Running on Ethereum, the project offers 69% APY staking, a deflationary Game Center model that burns tokens monthly through ad-driven buybacks, and a referral program where $25+ unlocks 10% bonuses for both parties. With a listing price set at $0.0005309, a $35,000 investment today could surge past $175,000 if projections hold. And with only a 9.97% price hike separating this stage from the next, time is critical. Liquidity Strategy and Stability Planning: How $TCAT Locks In Long-Term Trust Troller Cat has more than just memes behind it‚Äîit‚Äôs built with stability in mind. Two-year locked liquidity guarantees early buyers aren‚Äôt left hanging. That kind of commitment is rare in meme coin territory, but Troller Cat delivers it without flinching. Token allocation also speaks to smart planning. With only 7.5% reserved for liquidity and 40% for presale, it avoids over-saturation. 21% fuels the Game Center while 22.5% is locked for staking rewards. Add in 8% for referrals and just 1% for the team (locked for 69 weeks), and you have a meme coin that actually knows how to plan ahead. Snek ($SNEK): The Meme Coin That Slithered Into Early Fame, But Can It Strike Again? Snek made its entrance as a low-cap meme coin built around simplicity and viral energy. It attracted attention early on with clever marketing and a clean aesthetic that mimicked the original meme coin blueprint. Built for fast engagement, Snek had a moment where price charts seemed to defy gravity. Early holders saw solid short-term gains. However, recent weeks have been more muted, with volume dropping and community engagement flattening slightly. That said, Snek still holds a loyal fanbase and could see a second wind. Its community-led ethos and minimal tokenomics remain attractive to those who value meme purity over flashy mechanics. But to return to explosive growth, Snek will need a new catalyst. Gigachad ($GIGA): The Alpha Meme with Minimalist Swagger and Max Potential Gigachad isn‚Äôt just a meme‚Äîit‚Äôs an entire archetype. The project rides on hyper-confident branding and a no-nonsense visual identity that‚Äôs won over fans who want boldness without the fluff. Gigachad‚Äôs recent price uptick comes on the back of strategic updates and influencer engagement. It‚Äôs gaining traction for being simple, loud, and memorable. With strong meme appeal and solid social traction, it‚Äôs not to be dismissed. However, Gigachad‚Äôs minimalist ecosystem is a double-edged sword. While it invites quick adoption, it lacks the long-term infrastructure that other projects are now rolling out. Its price action could remain tied to social cycles unless the team delivers deeper utility. Conclusion: Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat is dancing past the competition with more than just hype. While Snek holds ground and Gigachad makes noise, Troller Cat is stacking real numbers‚Äî2024% ROI, $400K+ raised, and a projected 399.72% still ahead. With smart liquidity locks, Ethereum stability, and lore-driven presale stages, Troller Cat isn‚Äôt just another meme‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement.

Tron (TRX) made a strong move in July, reaching $0.33, but failed to hold, as rejection at that level shifted sentiment bearish. Technicals suggest more downside unless demand picks up soon. Toncoin (TON) faces similar trouble, trading below resistance at $3.24 while weak RSI and outflows apply added pressure. As both struggle, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction for solid reasons. Backed by 4,500+ developers working on over 300 practical use projects and having secured more than $353 million, BlockDAG is moving past promises into real delivery. The current $0.0016 presale rate, open for a short time, positions BlockDAG (BDAG) as the best crypto to buy right now, especially since early entries have already seen 2,660% growth. In a market marked by doubt, BlockDAG continues to build with certainty. Tron (TRX) Price Outlook Weakens Below $0.33 Mark Momentum rarely stays still in crypto. Tron (TRX) surged in early July, touching $0.33, but that resistance quickly turned into a ceiling. The price has slipped to $0.31 and now moves within a declining channel. Negative indicators from the Awesome Oscillator and a bearish Supertrend signal a potential fall below the crucial $0.30 support level. Should TRX dip further, $0.28 and $0.26 may follow. Technicals like the Bull Bear Power shifting negative add more concern. Without a significant return in buyer demand, the Tron (TRX) price outlook appears uncertain. A rally is still possible but would need strong momentum to reach $0.33 again, with $0.44 remaining the more distant upside. Toncoin (TON) Price Action Pressured by Heavy Resistance Toncoin (TON) price action is facing continued stress after slipping under a key support level. It‚Äôs currently trading around $3.13, just above the $3.05 base. Although there was a small recovery, Toncoin‚Äôs movement remains stuck beneath strong resistance between $3.17 and $3.24, with multiple EMAs in that zone blocking progress. A large $2.59 million outflow on July 24 (Coinglass) reinforces selling pressure. The RSI is still under 50, sitting at 41.56, hinting at continued weakness. If the $3.05 floor breaks, the price may retreat to $2.95 or even $2.88. Any recovery depends on reclaiming $3.24 with notable volume and sustained momentum. Without that, Toncoin remains in a stalled phase. BlockDAG‚Äôs Builder Network Grows as Utility Projects Multiply BlockDAG is doing more than promising, it‚Äôs executing. Over 4,500 skilled builders are driving 300+ real-use projects across sectors like DeFi, AI, logistics, and fintech. These tools aren‚Äôt just in concept; they‚Äôre already moving forward in practical ways. This momentum isn‚Äôt hype-driven; it‚Äôs backed by actual deliverables. So far, BlockDAG‚Äôs presale has raised over $353 million, and more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins have been sold. It has also shipped over 18,650 miner units globally, drawing the attention of experienced builders and crypto enthusiasts. This traction highlights how real-world usage and development are the core of BlockDAG‚Äôs progress. Now in Batch 29, BDAG coins are priced at $0.0016, available only until August 11th. With a confirmed launch value of $0.05, those entering now could see potential returns exceeding 3,000%. In fact, early adopters since Batch 1 have already seen their funds grow by 2,660%, reflecting serious upward progress across presale stages. Rather than relying on hype or future speculation, BlockDAG continues to show how proper builder support, live tools, and an active presale strategy can create lasting momentum. With the Global Launch set for August 11, this isn‚Äôt just another update; it‚Äôs the infrastructure going live. When looking at the best crypto to buy right now, BlockDAG stands apart as one of the few delivering real value at scale. Final Verdict! The Tron (TRX) price outlook continues to slide, with resistance at $0.33 holding strong and the risk of falling below $0.30 increasing. Toncoin (TON) price action also faces rejection, stuck under tough resistance zones and burdened by low RSI and ongoing outflows. On the other hand, BlockDAG is sprinting ahead. With 4,500+ developers already powering over 300 functioning projects and more than $353 million in presale contributions, it‚Äôs already far beyond just plans. The presale sits at $0.0016 until August 11, with 24.3 billion BDAG coins sold and early buyers seeing 2,660% growth. In this market, where many projects remain stuck in ideas, BlockDAG shows up with results. It checks all the boxes when searching for the best crypto to buy right now : execution, community, traction, and massive upside ahead.

This shift comes as Zhao seeks to navigate the complexities of his situation in the US in light of his legal challenges, including a formal application for a presidential pardon after serving time for violations related to anti-money laundering laws (AML). Will CZ‚Äôs Strategy Result? As reported by Crypto in America, Zhao‚Äôs foundation, Giggle Academy, has partnered with American Legion Charities to donate $2 million to create a permanent scholarship for the children of fallen and disabled US service members. Per the report, this initiative is particularly timely, coinciding with Trump‚Äôs renewed focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology.

Analyst Cites Perfect Storm Of Factors Zhaos‚Äô scholarship program aims to empower students by providing grants of up to $20,000 and features an annual competition that encourages participants to address pressing societal issues with innovative solutions. This aligns with the Trump administration‚Äôs broader objectives, which include bolstering America‚Äôs position as a global leader in technology and cryptocurrency while supporting veterans and their families. Recently, the president‚Äôs administration approved an $832 billion defense funding bill that includes pay raises and enhanced benefits for service members, further underscoring this commitment. Former Binance CEO‚Äôs Pardon Application Gains Traction Industry insiders view Zhao‚Äôs ‚Äúphilanthropic initiative‚Äù as potentially strategic, suggesting that it could be an attempt to gain favor with the president. ‚ÄúCZ knows what he‚Äôs doing,‚Äù remarked a crypto executive familiar with the landscape. The executive, who chose to remain anonymous when responding to Crypto in America‚Äôs inquiries, further stated: For the US to maintain its status as the crypto capital of the world, it needs strong leadership from its top exchanges and entrepreneurs. Moreover, we need a skilled workforce to drive the future economy.

CZ has topped crypto-betting platform Polymarket‚Äôs leaderboard as the individual most likely to be pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2025, according to recent polls. This narrative gained momentum after Zhao confirmed on a podcast that he had formally applied for a pardon. This came after a tumultuous year in which he faced significant legal hurdles, leading him to leave Binance and relinquish any role in its operations.

Despite high liquidity and mass visibility, DOGE is displaying elevated volatility‚Äîdaily swings, RSI fluctuations, and overbought conditions are creating uncertainty among retail and institutional traders alike. As larger holders rotate out and profit-taking intensifies, many participants are shifting their attention toward early‚Äëstage tokens that offer faster growth potential and more controlled environments. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE is beginning to stand out , offering a polished presale model at a time when steady, high-velocity alternatives are gaining traction. DOGE volatility opens the door for new players Even with Bit Origin pledging massive treasury allocation to DOGE, price action has faltered‚Äîfalling from resistance levels amid mixed technical indicators. Analysts note that while DOGE remains a meme market staple, its volatility underscores the risks of holding a token without structural safeguards. At the same time, retail traders are watching accumulation trends in other altcoins like SOL and low-cap projects such as Remittix‚Äîsignaling a broader rotation as Ethereum‚Äôs rally slows. A new wave of investor momentum Amid this shifting sentiment, a meme coin with refined launch mechanics is gaining traction without high-risk volatility. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs presale is nearing capacity, driven by referral velocity and community engagement, with analysts projecting potential for returns based on early demand curves. The token‚Äôs positioning blends political meme branding with scarcity-driven utility design‚Äîcreating a more structured narrative than blind hype. It doesn‚Äôt carry institutional promises or many models, but its rapid onboarding and presale sell ‚Äì through rate reflect early traction reminiscent of breakout projects from earlier altcoin cycles. Investors who saw DOGE as too wild for comfort are now exploring MAGACOIN FINANCE for potential upside in a more controlled environment. Rotation signals point toward emerging alt narratives Dogecoin‚Äôs recent turbulence highlights the fragility of hype ‚Äì driven rallies ‚Äîespecially when institutional enthusiasm cools. As altcoin sentiment shifts, smart money is fragmenting across infrastructure and narrative-driven assets alike. In this climate, presale tokens that can channel speculative momentum without eroding investor confidence are gaining attention . Conclusion Dogecoin‚Äôs latest volatility is a reminder that even well-known memecoins can falter under profit-taking and institutional uncertainty. As traders seek alternatives that offer growth without extreme turbulence, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling substitute, with its presale activity ramping up and projections pointing to a strong potential. As altcoin narratives evolve, savvy investors are positioning ahead of the curve‚Äîlooking for the next stable, high ‚Äì velocity breakout .

Short-term hype isn‚Äôt as effective anymore, and many are now focusing on coins with working tech, active dev teams, and real usage. As more rules come into play and users become smarter, only the projects with solid backing are likely to do well. With hundreds of coins in the market, finding the top crypto gems to buy now means checking what the project does, how it‚Äôs built, and who‚Äôs behind it. What problems are being solved? How strong is the team? Is the community engaged? These questions help sort lasting projects from short-lived trends. Based on this approach, here‚Äôs why BlockDAG, Hyperliquid, Sui, and BNB are currently among the top crypto gems to buy now. BlockDAG: 4,500+ Developers Drive Huge Growth What puts BlockDAG (BDAG) among the top crypto gems to buy now isn‚Äôt just talk, but real outcomes, active tools, a working system, and a builder community pushing it forward. While many coins still talk about what they plan to do, BlockDAG has already moved ahead. With more than 4,500 developers working on over 300 tools across key areas like automation, logistics, and finance, the project is delivering results. It even showcased a live demo of its X1 and X10 miners working together to earn BDAG in real-time, proving its system works. What‚Äôs more, BlockDAG has raised $353 million, sold 24.3 billion coins, and shipped out over 18,650 miners. That‚Äôs not about future goals, it‚Äôs visible progress. The coin is now priced at $0.0016 in Batch 29 and will remain at this price until August 11th. Early supporters have already seen their funds grow by 2,660% since Batch 1. With a planned launch value of $0.05, it‚Äôs easy to see why BlockDAG continues to rank among the top crypto gems to buy now. Hyperliquid: Building Strength With Measured Growth Hyperliquid has been gaining attention thanks to its clear growth track. Although its current price may seem a bit high for some, many are watching for a price dip before jumping in. Even so, the coin is showing strong potential and stable performance. As the broader market improves, Hyperliquid could benefit from renewed buying pressure. Its movement patterns have caught the attention of traders who prefer early signals and steady trends. For those building a list of the top crypto gems to buy now, Hyperliquid stands out for its technical strength and possible upside in a bullish market. Sui (SUI): Fast Moves That Attract Skilled Traders Price action in Sui tends to be fast and reactive, making it attractive to traders who thrive on short-term moves. SUI often rises and falls quickly, which makes it ideal for those who are comfortable with quick decisions. Recently, Sui has dipped along with the overall market, creating a potential buying opportunity. For those with a strategy focused on timing, this coin offers plenty of room to play. It deserves a place among the top crypto gems to buy now, especially for those who know how to handle volatility and enjoy fast-paced trades. BNB (BNB): Holding Strong With Trusted Demand BNB is still one of the few coins holding close to its all-time highs, even as many others remain far below theirs. Its direct link with Binance ensures it has consistent use, and the rollout of new finance products connected to BNB may drive more institutional activity. For those looking at the top crypto gems to buy now for long-term security and strength, BNB offers a solid choice. Its stable track record and ongoing demand make it a useful coin to have. As crypto continues to grow, BNB‚Äôs steady performance gives it staying power on any serious crypto list. To Sum Up! Success in the crypto space depends on real-world results. BlockDAG leads this group with a powerful network of 4,500+ developers, more than 300 tools already running, and over $353 million in presale funds collected. With its current price set at $0.0016 until August 11th and early buyers already seeing 2,660% growth, it‚Äôs proving why it ranks high among top crypto gems to buy now. Hyperliquid presents strong trade setups, while Sui appeals to those who act fast on volatile price movements. BNB remains steady, backed by a major platform and continued usage. All things considered, if you‚Äôre looking for the top crypto gems to buy now , these four names are hard to ignore.

This¬†is the lowest¬†figure since¬†March 2022, noted¬†Tom Wang of Entropy Advisors. In February, the value was¬†32%, in March¬†- already 29.6%. In¬†total, over the¬†last six months, Lido's share¬†has fallen by¬†5%, the expert¬†added. The top¬†three are centralized¬†exchanges Binance¬†and Coinbase, with 8.3% and¬†6.9% respectively. At the same¬†time, 19% of¬†the direction¬†is occupied by¬†unidentified¬†validators. Regarding¬†the latter, Wang¬†noted that these¬†could be both¬†individual stakers and fairly¬†large organizations¬†that do not disclose¬†data about their¬†wallets for some¬†reason. On July¬†16, the total¬†volume of deposits¬†in staking reached¬†a record ~36.5 million¬†ETH, after which¬†it dropped to¬†36.1 million¬†ETH at the time¬†of writing. Lido was the leader¬†in net outflow over¬†the past month. The queue¬†of validators¬†to exit has grown¬†sharply in a¬†week from 1,920 to¬†over 475,000, with¬†the wait time¬†increasing to¬†nine days. Galaxy¬†Digital Research attributed the¬†jump in part¬†to the increased¬†requirements¬†introduced by¬†the Pectra update. However, experts¬†said the main¬†factor was the¬†cascading reduction¬†in leverage in¬†LST-assets. ‚ÄúThis volatility was driven by a sharp reduction in ETH supply on Aave, initiated by large withdrawals from the platform by a wallet tagged to the HTX exchange. The wallet withdrew more than 167,000 ETH beginning June 18,‚Äù the analysts¬†explained. WETH loan¬†rates on Aave have¬†risen from 2% to¬†18% in a week, making popular¬†leveraged 'cyclical' staking¬†strategies unprofitable. In¬†so-called looping, users use LST or LRT-assets to¬†borrow ETH on¬†platforms like¬†Aave and convert¬†the funds back¬†to increase staking¬†income. As a¬†result of the¬†rate hike, investors¬†began to close¬†positions, which¬†led to the loss¬†of the peg to¬†ETH of Lido's stETH token, Glassnode noted. Aavechan co-founder Mark¬†Zeller confirmed¬†that the situation¬†was affected¬†by large withdrawals¬†from Aave. This¬†led to a spike¬†in the leverage¬†ratio on the¬†lending platform. However, he¬†estimates that¬†the situation¬†is stabilizing and¬†borrowing rates¬†have almost returned¬†to normal.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|EXCHANGE|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-27 05:34:48

Corporate Treasury Boom Could Spark Dot-Com Level Mania,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-to-1m-corporate-treasury-boom-could-spark-dot-com-level-mania/,"At the time of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading just over $118,000, after recovering from a dip that took it to a two-week low at $114,500 on July 24. But behind the relatively calm price action, a potentially explosive narrative is gathering steam. Proponents say we‚Äôre witnessing the most calculated supply shock in crypto history, and when the dust clears, the price of BTC could be headed for the $1 million mark. The Million-Dollar Dream As noted in a July 25 X post by Swan, a Bitcoin-only financial services provider, the current rally, which saw BTC hit a new all-time high recently, is different. It is deliberate, calculated, and rather underhyped. ‚ÄúThis is the least euphoric bull market we‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù Swan posted. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs bullish.‚Äù Their premise? Corporate treasuries and spot-exchange traded funds are quietly soaking up BTC through algorithmic ‚Äúdrip buys.‚Äù These aren‚Äôt degens gambling on meme coins but CFOs and CIOs diversifying balance sheets while retail sleeps. ‚ÄúEach breakout removes coins from weak hands, then resets.‚Äù Swan calls it ‚Äúdeliberate absorption,‚Äù and it‚Äôs keeping price action deceptively stable , at least for now. However, crypto influencer American HODL thinks the dam is about to burst. He believes that once enough corporate balance sheets start showing BTC as a strategic reserve asset, boardrooms around the world will scramble to keep up, just like they did during the internet boom in 1999. ‚ÄúI think the treasury company bubble can get dot-com level large,‚Äù he said in a recent podcast. ‚ÄúWe could see a 3‚Äì4 year run that takes Bitcoin well beyond a million dollars.‚Äù Roadmap to $1 Million To support their view, Swan researchers laid out a four-phase blueprint they believe is already in motion: Quiet corporate absorption via algorithmic buys Sovereigns stacking Bitcoin under the radar Major treasury firms finalizing structures for maximum bidding Narrative contagion that ignites a multi-year melt-up ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the setup for a mania-fueled blow-off top pushing toward $1M Bitcoin,‚Äù the firm stated. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied from $42,000 to $123,000 during a historic tightening cycle, and Swan is asking, what happens when cheap money actually returns? This is especially key, with potential mega-buyers like Nakamoto, Twenty One Capital, and Strive Asset Management, reportedly waiting in the wings, structuring SPVs and M&A deals before unleashing massive BTC bids.

The move allows Trump Token (TRUMP) to move seamlessly between Ethereum and TRON, making it one of the first politically themed memecoins with native multichain functionality. Users on both networks can now transfer TRUMP without bridges, unlocking better liquidity, faster settlement, and deeper DeFi integration. This development is more than a novelty. It reflects TRON‚Äôs strategic push to increase adoption by leveraging community-driven assets. Meme coins have long served as engagement vehicles‚Äîand this move brings politically charged momentum into the TRON ecosystem just as the U.S. election cycle heats up. TRON founder Justin Sun noted that the network remains ‚Äúneutral,‚Äù but fully supports memecoin innovation. With major blockchains now competing for the next viral token, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rising into that conversation, gaining traction across crypto circles. Act quickly‚Äînew entry tier already filling faster than expected. Meme momentum accelerates on multiple chains TRON‚Äôs adoption of Trump Token comes at a time when memecoins are gaining serious cross-chain muscle. No longer confined to Ethereum or Solana, meme assets are now expanding to Avalanche, BNB Chain, Base, and TRON‚Äîwhere community dynamics meet technical scaling. This shift echoes the early explosion of meme power in 2021‚Äì2022, when tokens like SHIBA and DOGE achieved viral dominance. But in 2025, the opportunity lies with low-supply, early-stage assets that haven‚Äôt yet been priced into retail or institutional portfolios. That‚Äôs why MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum . Act quickly ‚Äînew entry tier already filling faster than expected. With presale rounds closing in rapid succession, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines the virality of meme assets with supply-driven scarcity and expanding utility. Analysts say it mirrors early-stage mechanics of the famous memecoins but with a tighter supply cap, clearer roadmap, and built-in community incentives. Strategic buyers are moving early‚Äîbefore exchange listings and mass visibility drive demand even higher. LayerZero integration hints at future of token liquidity The LayerZero-powered upgrade positions TRUMP as a proof-of-concept for broader memecoin interoperability. By eliminating traditional bridges, TRON is enabling a faster, more secure token environment for both developers and traders. This opens the door for yield platforms, NFT protocols, and DAOs to integrate TRUMP directly‚Äî without worrying about complex liquidity fragmentation. More importantly, it sets a precedent . TRON‚Äôs move marks one of the first major Layer 1s to natively support cross-chain meme activity without relying on centralized solutions. Combined with Ethereum‚Äôs liquidity depth and LayerZero‚Äôs growing developer adoption, this creates a model that could be replicated across other high-velocity tokens. In the broader context, TRON is positioning itself as a hub for creative token narratives. From stablecoins to memecoins , and now politically symbolic tokens like TRUMP, the network is clearly embracing decentralized culture in all its forms. Conclusion TRON‚Äôs integration of Trump Token via LayerZero isn‚Äôt just a political moment‚Äîit‚Äôs a technical signal. Cross-chain meme liquidity is becoming a new standard , and networks that adapt quickly are pulling ahead. As meme season matures , platforms like TRON will likely attract even more attention. The race to support the next breakout token is already on. For investors seeking early-stage exposure with real traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out‚Äîespecially as its new entry tier is already filling faster than expected.

While XRP continues to sit at the top of headlines, a young upstart Remittix (RTX) competitor is causing a stir for a different reason ‚Äî utility within the real world. With its Q3 wallet launch just around the corner, many within the ecosystem are now starting to speculate which token has more real-world value in the long term. XRP‚Äôs Recent Surge Sparks a Utility-Focused Debate Ripple‚Äôs battle with regulators has not discouraged bullish investors from forecasting. Trading at $3.18 and 4.65% above, XRP‚Äôs market cap stands at $188.53 billion with a daily trading volume of $5.45 billion ‚Äî following a 42.44% dip in activity. This fresh energy is mainly the product of speculation on a potential XRP ETF, which would mirror the action in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Still, even as these institutional dreams are revealed, long-time XRP investors continue to fret about the lack of real-world uses that are past pilot programs by banks or speculative trading. This is where Remittix, at $0.0876 per token, starts to make waves. While XRP waits for regulatory clarity, Remittix is working overtime and ready to deliver tools to real people ‚Äî not just institutions. Crypto-to-Fiat Ease: Remittix‚Äôs Real-World Advantage The forthcoming Remittix Wallet, which is due out in Q3 2025, will create a gap that the majority of cryptos lack ‚Äî enabling direct bank transfers of crypto for instant global payments. Rather than holding tokens hostage in purposeless wallets, Remittix makes it possible to send RTX to bank accounts in 30+ countries with multiple fiat and crypto pairs available. Remittix is Ethereum and Solana compatible, enabling users to transfer quickly, cheaply, and without the usual agony of centralized exchanges. It‚Äôs being developed as a Layer 2 Ethereum alternative, and will soon permit users to exchange crypto-to-fiat without the need for third-party platforms ‚Äî a revolution for businesses, freelancers, and global remitters. While XRP still relies on institutional partnerships, Remittix is putting tools directly into the hands of retail consumers, providing them with a DeFi experience at no gas fees and with no complexity. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Real-World Focus: RTX provides instant, cross-border bank-to-crypto transactions. Wallet Beta Launch: Mobile-first experience launches Q3 2025. Fast Growth: Over $17.3 Million raised and 565M+ tokens sold to date. User Incentives: Active 50% token bonus, and a $250,000 giveaway. Low-Cost Transfers: Supported by Ethereum and Solana ‚Äî two of the most scalable chains. Remittix Wallet will have 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies supported on launch, allowing users to comfortably transition in a decentralized exchange ecosystem with easy, real-world applications. Designed for crypto natives and newcomers, it‚Äôs one of the best DeFi projects of 2025 by purpose ‚Äî not speculation. Is Remittix the Next Big Utility Token? XRP‚Äôs success rests on regulatory progress and institutional uptake, but Remittix is leaping ahead and delivering actual-world tools. With actual-time FX conversion and a crypto-to-fiat engine built into the wallet‚Äôs roadmap, Remittix could easily surpass bigger tokens by simple adoption. For those seeking the next 100x crypto, especially in the best crypto project 2025 landscape, Remittix is proving it‚Äôs not just another altcoin. It‚Äôs a fully operational project solving real financial problems in real time.

While this may sound far-fetched to many, Jake Claver, director at Digital Ascension Group, said it is possible. He said that if XRP becomes the global standard for cross-border payments and financial settlements, such a price wouldn‚Äôt just be a dream, but a requirement. Why a Higher Price is Necessary In an interview, Claver explains that for XRP to manage global liquidity demands, it must be valued significantly higher than where it stands today. The idea is simple. If XRP is to be used by financial institutions to move trillions of dollars across borders, it must have the price strength to do so without creating unnecessary friction or inefficiency. Ripple‚Äôs Long-Term Strategy Ripple isn‚Äôt just working on payments. The company has been quietly assembling a full-fledged financial ecosystem. It has acquired a crypto exchange, a broker-dealer, and a custody firm. It has also partnered with global institutions like SBI Holdings, R3, and Santander. Ripple is clearly building toward becoming a major infrastructure player in the digital financial world. What About Decentralization? Many critics say Ripple controls XRP, but Claver argues that the XRP Ledger is far more decentralized than people realize. The network of validators includes not only Ripple but also independent institutions like universities, banks, and other trusted entities. Even organizations like the SEC are part of the broader validator discussion. This decentralization could be a key reason regulators eventually favor XRP. Looking Ahead to 2026 According to Claver, we may see Ripple‚Äôs full vision unfold around 2026. With its licensing, global partnerships, and growing utility, XRP could step into the spotlight as a true bridge asset connecting the global financial system.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|WALLET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-27 06:06:29

Known for his outspoken views on stocks and cryptocurrencies, Cramer once dismissed XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. His specific criticism of XRP came when the token was trading at just $0.38. At the time, he described XRP and the others as ‚Äúa random group of things that we put up,‚Äù and went on to compare them unfavorably to traditional retail stocks, such as Rent the Runway and Stitch Fix. This clip, recently resurfaced and posted to X by user NotFinancialAdvice (@NFAdotcrypto), has gained renewed attention as XRP now trades at $3.14, having recently reached a new all-time high of $3.65 . Jim Cramer called XRP a con at $0.38 pic.twitter.com/AqUWIrtpYX ‚Äî NotFinancialAdvice.Crypto (@NFAdotcrypto) July 25, 2025 The Cramer Bounce and XRP‚Äôs Rise This price movement is particularly notable, given the broader sentiment surrounding what many refer to as the Cramer Bounce. The term has emerged from a pattern observed by market participants where assets Cramer stands against often rise significantly while the assets he supports underperform. His negative comments have previously excited the XRP army , and for investors, it is safe to say that this pattern has played out well. If an individual had purchased XRP at $0.38 following Cramer‚Äôs remarks and held it until the current price of $3.14, their return would be substantial. XRP Investment Growth Since $0.38 An investment of 1,000 XRP at $0.38 would have cost $380 and would now be worth $3,140. Similarly, 5,000 XRP purchased for $1,900 at that same price point would now be valued at $15,700. These gains show the sharp contrast between the token‚Äôs past perception and its present performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cramer‚Äôs criticism focused on the perceived randomness and lack of legitimacy in tracking assets like XRP, but recent market behavior indicates sustained interest and growth in the token. XRP‚Äôs rise has been supported by developments in its ecosystem and broader investor confidence, with its market capitalization now placing it as the third-largest cryptocurrency. Changing Market Perceptions The broader implication of this trend is the growing disconnect between traditional financial commentary and evolving digital asset markets. XRP‚Äôs recent price movements, alongside those of other major tokens, have challenged long-held assumptions and signaled shifting investor priorities. While some continue to question XRP‚Äôs long-term utility , others have capitalized on opportunities that arise when public opinion and price action diverge. Smart investors recently capitalized on the price dip following its all-time high, and the current market position suggests XRP may experience another surge soon.

As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $118,274 and showing signs of strength after brushing off selling pressure and minor pullbacks earlier this week. This comes at a time when investors have been watching closely to see whether the crypto king will break out or buckle under volatility. $132K Could Be Next, But Watch for Confirmation The next target could fall between $127,000 and $132,000. However, they warn that confirmation is key before getting too excited. The crypto market has a history of sudden reversals, so it‚Äôs important to wait for a strong breakout before calling the next leg up. Altcoins Warming Up for Their Turn Altcoins are already starting to show early signs of life. XRP is bouncing, Ethereum is holding steady in the overbought zone, and smaller altcoins are beginning to stir. The total market cap for altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, has shown a slight uptick, hinting that money could soon rotate into the broader crypto space. Bitcoin Dominance Slips, Altcoins Could Shine Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance is sliding again, which usually benefits altcoins. USDT dominance is also dropping, a signal that traders are moving funds into more volatile assets in search of returns.

According to ChatGPT‚Äôs analysis of historical data, market cycles, and memecoin performance trends, SHIB could see a wide range of outcomes by the end of 2025. The prediction hinges on a few core factors ‚Äì continued token burns, Ethereum network momentum, and whether SHIB‚Äôs ecosystem expansion (like Shibarium and its metaverse play) gains real traction. While sentiment around SHIB is mostly positive, some analysts are starting to temper expectations, noting that its explosive 2021-style rally is harder to replicate due to the now massive token supply and maturing market conditions. As early-stage opportunities dwindle, investors are keeping an eye on newer projects that mimic SHIB‚Äôs early acceleration. One such token, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is being compared by analysts for not only matching but outpacing SHIBA INU‚Äôs early launch metrics, signaling rising momentum. SHIB‚Äôs Path: Burn Mechanism and Ecosystem Growth Token supply reduction is at the heart of most bullish cases for SHIB. Its developers have doubled down on the burn narrative, with billions of tokens already removed from circulation. Still, with over 589 trillion SHIB in existence, progress remains slow unless massive coordinated burns occur‚Äîsomething the community continues to push for. Meanwhile, Shibarium, SHIB‚Äôs layer-2 network, has been pitched as a way to grow utility beyond meme status. The hope is that real-world use cases, such as NFT integration, decentralized apps, and staking, will inject new life into the ecosystem. If adoption ramps up in 2025, SHIB could break out of its current stagnation phase. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Attention with Unmatched Acceleration While SHIB builds long-term infrastructure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the narrative among early-stage investors. It has already broken participation records in back-to-back rounds, with analysts saying it‚Äôs outperforming SHIBA INU‚Äôs early growth pace. What‚Äôs fueling this momentum is not just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs access. Early participants are locking in positions before broader listings, and that exclusivity is driving rapid capital inflow. One analyst pointed out that a $500 investment at this stage could mirror the kind of returns seen in SHIB‚Äôs peak rally‚Äîbut only for those who get in while entry is still open. What‚Äôs Realistic for SHIB in 2025? Price predictions for SHIB vary wildly. Conservative projections place it at $0.0001 by late 2025, a target that would require significant market tailwinds and progress on burns. More aggressive forecasts stretch toward $0.001, though that would likely require a multi-trillion-dollar valuation ‚Äì not impossible, but highly ambitious. A more balanced view suggests SHIB could revisit its previous all-time highs if the crypto bull cycle continues and community-driven momentum reignites. But for those looking for early-phase tokens with a similar setup to SHIB‚Äôs early days, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious ground. Conclusion Shiba Inu‚Äôs 2025 outlook depends on adoption, utility, and community action‚Äîbut its growth may now be more gradual than explosive. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads by already outpacing SHIB ‚Äôs early rise, making it a standout for investors chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities in this cycle.

49033286,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=405991,1753597996,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/49033286.jpeg,Ripple‚Äôs XRP Didn‚Äôt Make ChatGPT‚Äôs Top 5 Altcoin List: Here‚Äôs Why,https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-xrp-didnt-make-chatgpts-top-5-altcoin-list-heres-why/,"TL;DR ChatGPT outlined five altcoins that could become the top performers by the end of the year, but omitted Ripple‚Äôs XRP. In a follow-up post, the popular AI outlined its reasons for doing so. Why Not XRP, ChatGPT? Before we head into the AI‚Äôs answer, here‚Äôs the context. Yesterday, we published an article asking the top 4 AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity), which are their five altcoin contenders to outperform by the end of the year. While there were some speculative and surprising names, the last three AIs all included ETH and XRP ‚Äì the two largest altcoins by market ‚Äì in some form. ChatGPT, however, left out Ripple‚Äôs native token, which is somewhat surprising given its performance since the US elections. Back then, it was in a multi-month consolidation phase with an upper boundary of $0.6. By January, it had skyrocketed to its 2018 ATH of $3.4. Then, it retraced in late Q1 and early Q2 before it exploded once again in July to a new record of $3.65. It also has a considerable following, known as the XRP Army, which made ChatGPT‚Äôs answer even more surprising. Consequently, we doubled down on why it excluded Ripple‚Äôs coin. It stated that it based its answer on ‚Äúperformance outlook,‚Äù rather than on current market capitalization or historical performance. It cited the lack of DeFi developments on Ripple‚Äôs XRP Ledger as one of the reasons why the token wasn‚Äôt included, which is a stark contrast to the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems (both of which made the list). It also noted that the legal overhang of the case against the SEC still exists, even though both parties have mutually agreed that the lawsuit should be concluded. Judge Torres, though, continues to deny their joint petitions. Lastly, OpenAI‚Äôs chatbot brought up previous market cycles, in which XRP lagged behind other altcoins: XRP Tends to Lag Early in Bull Markets: Historically, XRP pumps later than most other major altcoins. In both 2017 and 2021 cycles, XRP‚Äôs explosive moves came toward the end , not the beginning. So while it may perform well, it‚Äôs typically not a first mover . It Could Still Pump Although XRP wasn‚Äôt on ChatGPT‚Äôs top 5 list, unlike SOL, ETH, TON, SUI, and APT, the AI solution still acknowledged that Ripple‚Äôs asset could continue to rocket this year under more favorable conditions. If the aforementioned lawsuit against the US securities watchdog officially ends with a positive outcome for Ripple, its native token is poised to benefit, said ChatGPT. Additionally, it expects the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF to give the underlying asset another price boost. Experts and betting platforms like Polymarket put the odds for such products to see the light of day by the end of the year at up to 90%. ‚ÄúXRP is not excluded because it‚Äôs weak ‚Äî it‚Äôs excluded from the top 5 performance picks because other coins currently have stronger short-term narratives, faster capital rotation, or better retail excitement. But rest assured: XRP is still a high-potential asset, and it may surprise everyone later in the cycle, especially if legal clarity and real utility ramp up,‚Äù concluded ChatGPT.

The chart identifies three distinct zones in the current XRP market cycle , each representing different profit-taking opportunities according to the analyst‚Äôs interpretation of historical market behavior and wave theory. The post is positioned as a guide for readers seeking a structured approach to managing their positions, and reiterates a consistent trading philosophy rooted in experience from past market cycles. According to the tweet, the post aims to provide a structured roadmap for managing gains during XRP‚Äôs ongoing bullish trend. Egrag advises followers to focus on profit-taking strategies instead of targeting specific high numbers. The tweet includes a caution that relying on fixed target prices, such as $27 , $17, or $50, can be misleading due to the unpredictable nature of markets. Emphasizing the importance of emotional discipline and historical awareness, the analyst states that only a small minority of investors typically succeed in timing profit exits effectively. Elliott Wave Count and the Most Likely Sell-Off Zone In the chart, the first major region, labeled ‚ÄúMost Sell-Off Region,‚Äù is situated between $4 and $6. This zone is calculated using the inverse projection of Wave 4, commonly measured using 1.236 to 1.618 Fibonacci extensions. According to Egrag Crypto, this level represents a key psychological and technical threshold, where experienced market participants or ‚ÄúOGs‚Äù are expected to offload large portions of their holdings. The chart identifies this area as a primary opportunity for early profit realization and urges traders to align with those who have successfully navigated similar patterns in prior cycles. The XRP price at the time of posting is around $3.20, meaning the initial sell-off zone would represent a significant appreciation from present levels. Egrag‚Äôs chart also shows a large green upward projection from the most recent low, suggesting a continuation of the bullish trend toward this region. Wave-Based Projection for the Most Possible Region The second key region in the analysis, labeled ‚ÄúThe Most Possible Region,‚Äù ranges between $11 and $13. This zone is calculated based on a typical Wave 5 structure where the move equals Wave 1 or reaches 61.8% of the combined length of Waves 1 and 3. The chart displays this area as a rational target derived from traditional Elliott Wave methodology, offering a middle-ground target between conservative and highly optimistic projections. Egrag considers this zone more likely compared to the high-end projections, given its alignment with commonly observed ratios in historical five-wave structures. The tweet references a mini wave count to support this projection and indicates that further details are available to subscribers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP High-End Projection for Extended Cycle Top The final region, titled ‚ÄúThe High-End Region,‚Äù is situated between $27 and $30 . This target is derived from an alternate count beginning in March 2020, treating it as the origin of a broader Wave 1. Using this framework, Egrag calculates Wave 3 as having potential for a 1,750% increase based on 1.618 times a prior 1,044% move. This count envisions XRP reaching $27.67 at its peak in Wave 3 before undergoing a correction, then continuing upward movement potentially toward $64 or higher, as the extended path implies. While the tweet acknowledges that few investors successfully capture such full-cycle highs, the high-end projection is presented as a potential possibility for those who manage their positions strategically over a longer period. Philosophy of Market Reaction Over Prediction Alongside the technical breakdown, Egrag shares his investment and trading motto, which emphasizes the futility of attempting to control or predict the market. Instead, the focus is placed on reacting effectively to market conditions. He writes, ‚ÄúYou cannot control it, stop it, or slow it‚Ä¶ you just have to react.‚Äù This principle underpins his repeated advice to avoid getting anchored to specific high targets and instead use average-out profit-taking strategies during favorable price regions. The tweet closes with a message to his followers, emphasizing that market success is not about intelligence but about learning from past cycles and recognizing when to take profits. He suggests that failing to do so can leave participants behind, reinforcing the importance of strategy, awareness, and adaptability in the highly volatile cryptocurrency sector.

In 2028, XLM will range between $1.85 and $2.11, with an average price of $1.98. The token could reach as high as $3.43 in 2031. Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and payment protocol launched in July 2014 by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. Developed by the non-profit Stellar Development Foundation, it aims to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Stellar operates on its blockchain, using the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) to validate transactions, which enhances security and efficiency. One of Stellar‚Äôs key features is its ability to enable currency exchange between different fiat and digital assets. The network charges a minimal transaction fee of 0.00001 XLM, making it an attractive option for users seeking affordable transaction solutions. Stellar is particularly focused on financial inclusion, targeting unbanked populations in developing regions by providing access to essential financial services. XLM, the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar network, is used for transaction fees and as a bridge currency in cross-asset transactions. Initially, there were 100 billion XLM, but in 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation burned approximately half of the total supply to enhance its value and utility. Today, around 30.6 billion XLM are in circulation, with the network gaining traction for its real-world applications in remittances and asset transfers. Is XLM a good investment? Will it go up? Is Stellar Lumens a buy or sell? Where will it be in 5 years? We answer these questions and more in our Stellar‚Äôs Cryptopolitan Price Prediction.

Concurrently, the cryptocurrency gained 2.03 percent in value during the day. Technical indicators, as well as the price charts, continue to give a bullish verdict. Further upside might be observed soon, as the buying activities continue to advance. Is Stellar a good investment? Stellar (XLM) has potential as a long-term investment due to its focus on facilitating fast, low-cost international payments and its growing utility. While past performance shows significant volatility, XLM has outperformed many top cryptocurrencies. With the upcoming launch of smart contracts via Soroban, Stellar‚Äôs utility is set to expand massively in 2025. However, the coin‚Äôs price is closely tied to its adoption, and competition from other cryptocurrencies poses risks. Ultimately, Stellar‚Äôs viability as an investment depends on your risk tolerance and belief in its future growth potential. Why is XLM up? Stellar Lumens (XLM) has struggled to gain traction due to its high circulating supply, which limits price growth potential. Additionally, its price movements often lag behind the broader cryptocurrency market, and ongoing operational sales by the Stellar Development Foundation contribute to downward pressure; however, the token‚Äôs price has increased today. Will XLM reach $1? Predictions for Stellar Lumens (XLM) suggest it is likely to reach $1 in the near future. Most forecasts estimate prices between $0.967904 and $1.23 by 2026, indicating significant gains for the coin. Will XLM reach $10? Current predictions suggest that Stellar Lumens (XLM) is unlikely to reach $10 in the near future. Most forecasts estimate its price will remain below $4 through 2031, with some projections suggesting a maximum of around $3.43. How much will stellar lumens be worth in 2030? Stellar (XLM) is expected to trade anywhere from $2.73 to $2.99 in 2030. How safe is XLM? Stellar (XLM) is a relatively safe cryptocurrency with a strong foundation, regular protocol updates, and partnerships with major entities. However, the crypto market is unpredictable, and potential investors should be cautious due to possible regulation changes. Does Stellar Lumens have a future? Stellar Lumens (XLM) shows potential for a positive long-term future due to its innovative blockchain technology and strategic partnerships, particularly in cross-border payments. Analysts predict significant price increases, potentially reaching $3.43 by 2031, driven by ongoing developments and market adoption.

Investors should be mindful of these dynamics when considering Stellar‚Äôs prospects.hh XLM historical price sentiment XLM price history Stellar (XLM) was launched in April 2015, starting with a price of approximately $0.00279.

In 2011, MyBitcoin suddenly shut down and explained that it had been hacked. The exchange only reimbursed its customers for 49% of their losses, suggesting that the rest was lost to the hack. Says Ju, ‚ÄúThe recent transfer of 80,000 BTC, dormant for 14 years, came from wallets originally hosted by MyBitcoin. The wallets had been inactive since April 2011, before MyBitcoin collapsed in a hack that July. It likely belongs to the hacker or the anonymous founder known as Tom Williams. It seems Galaxy Digital bought the Bitcoin from them, but I‚Äôm not sure if they did any forensics.‚Äù At the time of the hack, BTC was trading for around $13 a coin, meaning that the whale saw roughly a 922,976% return on its investment if sold around the $120,000 mark.

Aureus Asset Management chief executive Thad Davis tells Barron‚Äôs that his firm has piled into Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), believing that the firm is in a position to become the ‚ÄúAmazon-type‚Äù supplier for healthcare firms. ‚ÄúIt provides all the materials, equipment and supplies a lab environment would need. If you ever watch the dollies that come in and out of a hospital or biotech building, they are loaded with Thermo Fisher equipment.‚Äù The next pick is Applied Materials (AMAT), which plays a critical role in the development of powerful chips amid the explosion of artificial intelligence (AI). While Nvidia currently leads in chip manufacturing, Davis says Applied Materials is essential across four critical stages of chip production, ensuring its equipment remains indispensable for leading-edge chip development, driving significant long-term demand regardless of which company ultimately dominates the market. Lastly, Davis says the firm is a believer in S&P Global (SPGI), noting that it holds a dominant position in the credit ratings market alongside Moody‚Äôs, forming a near duopoly. Overall, Davis also says that Aureus is keeping a close watch on three investment areas that have the potential to become ‚Äúmassive disruptors,‚Äù including AI, blockchain along with crypto and GLP-1 drugs ‚Äì medicines designed to treat diabetes and obesity. ‚ÄúEach taken separately has the capacity to profoundly disrupt various industries. But some taken together could have the same impact.

Krueger, in a brief post, asserted that ‚ÄúNot one actual human being is using XRP. Not one.‚Äù In response, SMQKE dismissed this statement as factually incorrect, posting, ‚Äú‚ÄôNo one‚Äô uses XRP‚Ä¶ except for hundreds of financial institutions like American Express, Bank of America, and Santander. But don‚Äôt let facts get in the way of a good narrative.‚Äù SMQKE‚Äôs reply was accompanied by a screenshot of a cryptocurrency adoption chart showing documented institutional use of XRP, distinguishing his position with publicly available data. Reference to Documented Institutional Use The image shared by SMQKE originated from a comparative overview of top cryptocurrencies and their recent use cases. It highlights XRP‚Äôs role as a bridge currency for cross-border payments and settlement within Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure. The document states that hundreds of financial institutions, including American Express, Bank of America, and Santander, maintain partnerships with Ripple, leveraging XRP within their operations. It further notes that Ripple has collaborated with global sustainability leaders such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and has committed to achieving carbon net zero by 2030. This counters Krueger‚Äôs claim by presenting a factual account of large-scale adoption by corporate and financial institutions. While the use of XRP by individual retail investors or consumers may vary, SMQKE‚Äôs emphasis was on institutional adoption, which is clearly outlined in the source material he provided. ‚ÄúNo one‚Äù uses XRP‚Ä¶ except for hundreds of financial institutions like American Express, Bank of America, and Santander. But don‚Äôt let facts get in the way of a good narrative. https://t.co/R0Wz4m0UR4 pic.twitter.com/FFg6AYFV2B ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 26, 2025 Clarification of XRP‚Äôs Function in the Financial Ecosystem The referenced document explains that XRP functions as a bridge currency to facilitate real-time gross settlement, currency exchange, and remittance flows. It is not described as a retail-oriented digital currency like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but is positioned as infrastructure supporting global financial activity behind the scenes. This utility has made XRP attractive to banks and payment providers who require fast, low-cost, and scalable solutions for international transactions. The institutions named in the chart suggest that XRP‚Äôs relevance lies more in financial infrastructure than in individual consumer payment use. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of the Response SMQKE‚Äôs reply to Krueger serves to reaffirm XRP‚Äôs credibility within enterprise blockchain adoption. By presenting verifiable data, he rejects the notion that XRP is unused or irrelevant. His response focuses on the mismatch between the narrative pushed by some investors and the factual evidence of adoption by major financial institutions. It also reflects a broader dynamic in the crypto sector where public perception often diverges from enterprise applications, particularly with utility-driven tokens like XRP that may not be as visible in consumer-facing environments but remain active in backend financial systems. Krueger‚Äôs generalization that ‚Äúnot one actual human being is using XRP‚Äù appears to ignore this distinction. SMQKE‚Äôs counterposition centers the institutional framework in which XRP operates, distinguishing it from cryptocurrencies that are primarily retail-focused. He states that XRP‚Äôs strength lies in serving cross-border liquidity needs across banking infrastructure, not necessarily in direct consumer transactions. By responding to Fred Krueger with documented examples of XRP adoption by major financial institutions, SMQKE reasserted the token‚Äôs practical application in enterprise settings. His remarks highlight the importance of distinguishing between consumer-facing crypto projects and those designed for financial infrastructure.

Avalanche Price Declines But User Engagement Soars A recent analysis from data firm Messari revealed that AVAX‚Äôs price fell 4.2% quarter-over-quarter, dropping from $18.77 to $17.99. This decline came alongside a 2.6% decrease in its circulating market cap, which fell from $7.8 billion to $7.6 billion. The impact of this price drop was also reflected in AVAX‚Äôs market ranking, which fell from 15th to 16th among all cryptocurrencies. However, not all metrics were negative. Transaction fees for AVAX surged by nearly 29% during the quarter, increasing from 58,300 to 75,170. In terms of revenue, transaction fees in USD also rose slightly, going from $1.50 million to $1.54 million, indicating a growing user base and increased activity on the platform. Related Reading: Is $1 Dogecoin ‚ÄöInevitable‚Äò? Analyst Cites Perfect Storm Of Factors A particularly bright spot for Avalanche in Q2 2025 was the significant growth in daily transactions across its C-Chain and other layer-1s. Average daily transactions skyrocketed by 169.91%, reaching 10.1 million compared to 3.7 million in the previous quarter. This was complemented by a dramatic increase in daily active addresses, which surged by 210.45% to 519,954, suggesting a robust uptick in user engagement. In line with this growth, Avalanche also reduced its average transaction fees by 42.7%, from $0.05 to $0.03. This reduction is largely attributed to the Octane upgrade, which introduced a dynamic fee mechanism on Avalanche‚Äôs C-Chain, allowing for real-time fee adjustments to enhance user experience and reduce costs. C-Chain Transactions And DeFi TVL Soar The C-Chain in particular saw impressive usage growth, with average daily transactions jumping 493.4% from 244,995 at the end of Q1 to 1.4 million by the end of Q2. Daily active addresses also experienced a healthy increase of 57% quarter-over-quarter, rising from 29,554 to 46,397. Notably, there was a spike to 419,619 daily active addresses on May 11. As seen in the chart above, Avalanche‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) rose 37.1%, climbing from $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion. However, the stablecoin market cap on Avalanche saw a significant decline of 23.8%, dropping from $1.9 billion to $1.5 billion. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Reveals What Will Drive Ethereum Price To $10,000 The rise in daily active addresses across Avalanche‚Äôs layer-1 platforms was particularly noteworthy. The average daily active addresses surged by 444.8% quarter-over-quarter, from 68,723 to 374,402. As of this writing, AVAX‚Äôs price has recovered from Q2 lows toward the $23 zone, rising 35% in the past thirty days due to the recent bullish sentiment that led Bitcoin (BTC), the market‚Äôs leading crypto, to reach a new all-time high above $123,000.

Although most altcoins are somewhat sluggish on a slow Sunday, a few have tapped multi-month peaks, such as Cronos (CRO). BTC Taps $118K Bitcoin‚Äôs latest all-time high, which took place on July 14, was followed by an expected correction and consolidation period. Within days, the asset slumped to under $120,000 and spent most of the next week trading sideways between that upper boundary and $117,000. After a few rejections at $120,000, the bears took control and initiated a considerable leg down that pushed the cryptocurrency to a low of $114,500. This came as Galaxy Digital offloaded 80,000 BTC (valued at over $9 billion) for a third party. Once the sell-off was completed , bitcoin‚Äôs price started to recover and jumped past $117,000 yesterday and up to $118,400 today. This meant that the asset has recovered four grand since the Friday low. Its market capitalization has climbed to $2.350 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins has stalled at 59.2%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView These Alts Are Pumping Most altcoins are with minor gains today as well. Ethereum jumped to $3,800 earlier today after a 1-2% increase. Ripple‚Äôs native token is at $3.2 after a similar daily jump. BNB, SOL, DOGE, TRX, and ADA have charted similar gains as well. SUI continues with its impressive run, having surged by another 6% and is well above $4.2. BCH and CRO have added over 5-6% in a day, which has helped the latter surge to a new six-month high of over $0.14. The top performer among the largest 100 altcoins is HBAR. It has risen by more than 10% and now trades over $0.29. The total crypto market cap has recovered another $30 billion and is up to $3.970 trillion on CG.

Documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the company indicate that XRP has been integrated into its business model. Ripple advocate and attorney Bill Morgan commented on the SEC document, saying, ‚ÄúThis S-1 filing lays out a strategy to integrate XRP not just as an asset but into the company's financial and operational structure.‚Äù According to Morgan, Welgistics Health aims to utilize the XRP Ledger infrastructure to process transactions with pharmacy customers and manufacturing and distribution partners in a cost-effective and real-time manner.

The same document also outlines the company's plans to raise funds through the issuance of stock or bonds in the future and use these funds to purchase additional XRP. The company intends to use the acquired XRP as collateral to raise funds and profit from XRP-based transactions. Bill Morgan commented on this as ‚Äúan example of how XRP can go beyond being a mere investment vehicle and function as a means of payment and collateral.‚Äù However, these statements have sparked mixed reactions within the cryptocurrency community. While XRP supporters see the initiative as a positive use case, some experts have expressed skepticism about the company's financial structure. Former securities attorney Mark Fagel pointed out that Welgistics Health's actual assets are limited and that its recent financial reports include a ‚Äúcontinue operating‚Äù warning. There has also been criticism that XRP could be used as a marketing tool. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts Say One Coin Stands To Gain Even More,https://timestabloid.com/could-hype-see-a-5x-run-before-august-analysts-say-one-coin/,"While Hyperliquid bulls hold out hope for a $45.80 breakout, savvy investors are already rotating into a low-cost payment token with bigger upside. Remittix (RTX) has now raised over $17.3 million, sold more than 569 million tokens, and just announced its beta crypto wallet launching September 15. Many now believe RTX (not HYPE) could be the one with true 5x potential before August ends. Hyperliquid Buybacks Draw Attention, But Resistance Looms HYPE news continues to dominate headlines as traders react to fresh signals forming at the $41 support zone. Analysts like Borz highlight the key ‚Äúgolden pocket‚Äù area, where bullish divergences and buyback activity are starting to converge. Even with the HYPE price down nearly 5% to $41.80, the Hyperliquid Assistance Fund is turning volatility into buy pressure. According to Ghazzog, this mechanism could buy back the entire HYPE supply in 2.7 years. That‚Äôs a big claim, but it also assumes steady revenue and no shocks. If support at $40 cracks, eyes shift quickly to $37. While these buybacks may offer some cushion, the price remains vulnerable. Hyperliquid news today is more about potential than confirmation. With resistance still capping the price under $45.70, short-term upside could be limited. Why Remittix Is Quietly Taking Over the Payment Narrative While traders speculate over HYPE price targets, Remittix has delivered hard milestones: full wallet functionality in beta, a 50% token bonus, and new global use cases driving adoption. Built for real cross-border use like freelancers in India and e-commerce brands in Latin America, Remittix offers a utility-first approach many believe HYPE lacks. And at just $0.0876, the token still sits under $0.10 with massive headroom. Remittix Is Quietly Becoming the Breakout Presale of 2025 $17.3M+ raised and 569M+ tokens sold Beta wallet launches Sept. 15 with crypto transfer features 50% bonus still active for early buyers $18M soft cap in sight, strong momentum continuing Investors are betting big on RTX‚Äôs ability to scale faster than legacy tokens by focusing on real-world transactions, not just trading volume. In a time when hype rules headlines, Remittix is building actual infrastructure. HYPE Bulls Still Have Work To Do Despite bullish setups, HYPE news still revolves around holding key levels. The green demand zone at $41‚Äì$41.80 has bounced price several times, but failure here could send it as low as $39.20. RSI divergence is a positive sign, but it needs confirmation. Buybacks may soften crashes, but Remittix offers more than downside protection, it offers actual growth utility, a clear roadmap, and rising user demand. For many, that‚Äôs more compelling than any golden pocket or short-term price target.

According to Xoom (@Mr_Xoom), a crypto expert and head of marketing at XRPMarkets, the token is currently moving through the final phase of a classic five-wave Elliott Wave structure. Xoom‚Äôs recent analysis provides a detailed view of XRP‚Äôs trajectory, disputing some recent claims about the asset‚Äôs wave positioning. I‚Äôve seen a few people on X talk about how XRP is on wave 3, that‚Äôs simply not true. Wave 3 was when XRP went from $0.50- $3.39 (+575%) XRP is currently on its last leg up (wave 5). Wave 3 is typically stronger and longer than wave 5. Targets for wave 5? $7-$10 (320% ‚Äì 500%) pic.twitter.com/ChwK2GJs7f ‚Äî xoom (@Mr_Xoom) July 25, 2025 Correcting Misconceptions About XRP‚Äôs Current Position While some analysts have claimed XRP is in the middle of wave 3 , Xoom‚Äôs chart offers a different assessment. His analysis shows XRP completed Wave 3 earlier in the cycle when it surged from $0.50 to $3.39 between November 2024 and January 2025, rising by approximately 575%. He noted that Wave 3 of the Elliott Wave pattern typically represents the longest and most powerful move in a five-wave sequence. This distinction is important, as it changes the outlook for XRP‚Äôs remaining potential upside. Xoom asserts that the asset has already begun wave 5, the final upward movement in the cycle. Historically, wave 5 is often shorter and less aggressive compared to wave 3, but still significant in terms of potential gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Forecasting the Wave 5 Target Zone XRP traded at $3.04 at the time of Xoom‚Äôs analysis, and he expects the current wave 5 move to push the asset into the $7 to $10 range. This would represent a gain of 320% to 500% from present levels. While that increase is less than the 575% move seen in wave 3, it still suggests strong upward momentum remains. Another prominent analyst recently predicted a similar target with a cup and handle pattern , and Xoom‚Äôs chart outlines each of the five waves with clear entry and exit points. Wave 1 marked the initial rise in early September, followed by a corrective wave 2 into November. A steep rally formed Wave 3 from December to January 2025, and Wave 4 retraced that move in early February , continuing until May. Since then, XRP has started wave 5, and the price action through July confirms this upward trend. While some might have been anticipating a more extended wave 3 ahead, this clarification implies that XRP‚Äôs strongest upward phase has already occurred. Still, the projected target zone of $7‚Äì$10 offers notable upside and will see XRP reach a new all-time high.

Pendle‚Äôs recent progress, such as smart contract updates and strategic partnerships, marks its growth and commitment to innovation. Will these developments increase the value of $PENDLE? Is Pendle worth investing in? Let‚Äôs dive into the Pendle price prediction for 2025-2031.

The price is hovering near the mid-level between the Bollinger Bands, with slight bullish pressure evident. The RSI at 64.74 suggests the asset is not overbought but is in bullish territory. MACD is still positive, with the lines converging, signaling a potential momentum shift. If Pendle maintains above the $4.20 support, a retest of $4.99 resistance is possible. However, failure to hold could drag price down toward the lower Bollinger Band near $3.41. PENDLE/USD 4-hour chart PENDLEUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, Pendle (PENDLE/USDT) is currently in a consolidation phase, trading within a narrow range between $4.23 and $4.59. Price action is flat, closely hugging the midline of the Bollinger Bands, indicating low volatility and indecision. The MACD is neutral, with both the MACD and signal lines converging near the zero level, suggesting a lack of momentum in either direction. Additionally, the Balance of Power is negative at -0.20, reflecting slight bearish pressure. Unless Pendle breaks decisively above $4.59, upside remains limited. A drop below $4.23 could lead to further downside toward $4.10 or even $4.00.

The MACD remains positive but shows reduced momentum. The 4-hour chart confirms indecision, with price trading sideways between $4.23 and $4.59, a neutral MACD, and weak Balance of Power. A breakout above $4.59 may renew bullish momentum toward $5.00, while a drop below $4.23 could signal a deeper retracement to $4.00. Is PENDLE a good investment?

The firm said the sale ‚Äî one of the largest notional BTC transactions ever ‚Äî was part of the seller‚Äôs estate planning strategy. The transaction was immediately seen as symbolic. For some, it marked a practical rebalancing. For others, it was a worrying sign that even Bitcoin‚Äôs earliest believers are cashing out. Crypto analyst and commentator Scott Melker fanned the flames with a sharply worded post on X. ‚ÄúBitcoin is amazing,‚Äù he wrote on July 26. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs obviously been co-opted to some degree by the very people that it was created as a hedge against. Many of the most ardent early whales have seen their faith shaken and have been selling at these prices.‚Äù The comment kicked off a fierce debate that spanned crypto influencers, traders, and ideologues ‚Äî many of whom disagreed over what the whale‚Äôs exit meant, and whether Melker‚Äôs framing was accurate. Some Dismiss the Concern Critics of Melker‚Äôs interpretation argued that one transaction ‚Äî egardless of size ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt signify ideological abandonment. They noted the sale was explicitly tied to estate planning, not a loss of conviction. Others pointed out that wallet movements can be misleading, and selling doesn‚Äôt automatically mean an investor has given up on the asset long term. Some community members even called the remark speculative, pointing to OGs like Adam Back and others who continue to accumulate. Melker later clarified that he was ‚Äújust pointing out what I‚Äôve been hearing,‚Äù not declaring his own view. Others See a Pattern Supporters of Melker‚Äôs take saw the whale‚Äôs exit as emblematic of a broader shift. With Bitcoin increasingly absorbed into traditional finance ‚Äî via ETFs, corporate treasuries, and custody solutions ‚Äî some worry that the asset has drifted from its cypherpunk roots. To this group, Bitcoin‚Äôs transformation into a tradable, regulated, and largely off-chain instrument is a distortion of its founding vision. If early believers are losing interest, they argue, it may be a symptom of Bitcoin becoming less about individual sovereignty and more about financial engineering. Bitcoin‚Äôs Open-Access Design Defended Another group pushed back against the premise that institutional involvement amounts to ideological failure. In their view, Bitcoin‚Äôs value lies in its neutrality ‚Äî its rules apply to everyone, whether it‚Äôs retail users or Wall Street funds. Censorship resistance, not exclusion, is the foundation. These commentators argued that the rise of ETFs and custodial adoption was inevitable, and even necessary, if Bitcoin is to achieve broad monetary relevance. From this perspective, whale exits are simply a part of maturing capital flows ‚Äî not a sign of philosophical surrender. Questions About Security and Use The debate also triggered deeper concerns about Bitcoin‚Äôs function. If most BTC is held as a passive store of value and rarely transacted, how will the network continue to be secured post-halving? With mining rewards falling and on-chain usage declining, some worry that transaction fees alone may not sustain network integrity in the long run. A Telling Moment While Melker‚Äôs post didn‚Äôt move markets, it did spotlight a critical question: What does it mean when early believers sell? Is it a warning signal, or a natural redistribution? A loss of faith ‚Äî or a sign of progress? Galaxy‚Äôs $9 billion transaction offered no definitive answers. But the reactions that followed revealed just how unsettled Bitcoin‚Äôs evolving role remains. Between the vision it was born from and the institutions now shaping it, the ideological rift is no longer theoretical ‚Äî it‚Äôs playing out in real time.",Markets|Bitcoin|btc|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-27 08:24:45

Uniswap price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin‚Äôs price is increasing after a continued bullish impulse observed over the past few trading sessions. If buyers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI‚Äôs price might increase to the $10.84 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $26.83 level by 2027 and above $52.95 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bullish phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining value, and so is UNI. As buyers gained ground around $10.14, positive sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $12.71, while the average price is expected to be around $10.59. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $7 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $7.5 and $8.6; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it‚Äôs worth waiting, as the coin‚Äôs value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI‚Äôs price to reach $55.07 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

It ended the year near $18 after a significant decline. Throughout 2022, UNI continued to decline, dropping to around $5.5 by June as the bearish trend persisted. The crypto market rebounded in 2023, and UNI saw bullish momentum, peaking at $7.77 on December 28. UNI began 2024 on a downtrend, briefly recovering to $15 by March 6.

The price remains capped below the psychological $120,000 mark, with bulls and bears locked in a tug-of-war that has intensified speculation across the market. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin is holding key support, suggesting resilience in the current bullish structure. Related Reading: TRON Drops Q2 Report: Revenue, USDT Dominance Lead Multi-Quarter Highs According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, this week stands out as one of the most aggressive selling periods of the current bull cycle. Adler notes that only 12 weeks‚Äîabout 7.3% of the entire cycle‚Äîhave shown equal or greater selling pressure. This context highlights just how intense the recent market activity has been, with significant profit-taking from investors but no full breakdown in price. The combination of strong selling and price stability has introduced a high level of uncertainty. Market participants are watching closely for confirmation of either a deeper correction or a renewed push to break the $120K barrier. As the week closes, Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to maintain its consolidation range could determine the pace and direction of the next major move in this cycle. Bitcoin Holds Strong Amid Heavy Selling Adler highlighted that this week ranks among the top 7% of the most extreme in terms of selling volume during the current Bitcoin bull cycle. Despite the intense selling pressure, Bitcoin has shown notable resilience, recovering to $117,000 by week‚Äôs end. This rebound is seen as a positive signal, reflecting bullish strength in the face of aggressive distribution. While Bitcoin remains in a tight consolidation range, its dominance is starting to weaken relative to Ethereum and other major altcoins. This shift has caught the attention of analysts who now view this week as a pivotal moment. A continued decrease in Bitcoin dominance paired with growing strength in altcoins could mark the beginning of the long-anticipated altseason‚Äîa period where capital rotates from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, driving strong gains across the sector. Still, Bitcoin‚Äôs recent recovery and consolidation above key support suggest that its bullish momentum may not be over. If buyers continue to defend the current range, BTC could be gearing up for another leg higher, putting pressure on shorts and reigniting market confidence.

This area has proven to be a critical short-term demand zone, with bulls stepping in aggressively to defend it following a recent dip. The price is now pressing against the 100-period SMA ($117,822), attempting to reclaim this level as support. The structure of the chart shows BTC remains locked in a well-defined consolidation range between $115,724 and $122,077. This week‚Äôs retest of the lower boundary and subsequent bounce signals continued interest from buyers, despite strong selling pressure earlier in the week. Volume remains elevated, suggesting active market participation during the recent recovery.

The miner was operating through the Solo CK pool, a solo mining service. According to details, he successfully mined block 907,283, which contained 4,038 transactions, paying block fees of about $3,436. Over the last few years, it has been hard for solo Bitcoin miners to compete with large-scale, corporate mining firms. This is largely due to the increase in network hashrate and difficulty, making the scene very competitive. However, despite this competition, some solo miners have been recorded some degree of success this year, mining solo blocks at intervals since the beginning of the year. Solo Bitcoin miners record success The victories recorded by solo miners are a reminder that even though improbable and nearly impossible, they can still be successful in the industry. There have been several cases this year where some of them have come out on top when it comes to mining, taking the full reward. For instance, the first successfully mined solo block this year happened in February, with the miner solving block number 883,181 and winning 3.125 BTC worth $300,000. According to Bitcoin block explorer Mempool.space, the block contained 3,071 transactions and a total reward of 3.15 BTC. In a post announcing the development, Bitcoin miner Marshall Long speculated that the miner might have used a Bitaxe, a mining device that can be used for solo mining or mining pools where miners combine computational power to increase their chances of solving a block. In March, another solo Bitcoin miner solved block number 887,212, winning about 3.15 BTC, which was worth around $263,000 at the time. What made this incident spectacular is that the miner used a 480 GH/s Bitaxe device to solve the block. This month, there have been two solo miners who have gone all the way. The first, which happened on July 4, saw the miner earn 3.173 BTC worth $330,000 after mining block number 899,826. The second, which happened on July 12, saw the miner win 3.154 BTC after solving number 904,989. Rise in network difficulty poses challenges to professional mining firms Over the last few months, there has been a rise in network difficulty and hashrate, coupled with a drop in block subsidy. These developments have posed challenges to established mining firms. Most of them have now diversified their large mining operations into AI data centers and high-performance computing to make up for the losses racked up in the mining business amid a rise in competition. Bitcoin network difficulty is currently about 126 trillion, which is close to its all-time high levels. Its network difficulty has also been trending up over the last few days, forcing miners to use greater computing and power resources to mine blocks. Presently, miners earn a 3.125 BTC reward worth around $373,000 from a single block at current prices. The competition in the industry puts them on edge, pushing them to find the cheapest energy resources. In June, several Bitcoin miners located in Texas were forced to reduce their energy consumption to avoid paying peak demand charges to the grid operator. This caused a drop in block production in the short term. Last month, MARA was one of the firms affected by the weather conditions, reporting lower power output numbers due to its slowed mining operations.

Exponential growth in computing power and the improvement of algorithms will inevitably lead to the creation of AI that will surpass the combined intellectual capabilities of all of humanity.

The experienced strategist clearly stated that the real reason behind his preference for Ethereum was the growth in the stablecoin sector. Tom Lee, a long-time chief strategist at JPMorgan Chase, is known among US investors for his accurate predictions of market trends and frequent appearances on major media platforms like CNBC. However, he has also been the target of criticism for his consistently optimistic approach to the market. In the podcast, Lee also touched on the characteristics of the era in which today's individual investors find themselves, attributing the change in this period to two main factors: the visibility provided to startups by independent media channels that came with the rise of social media, especially Twitter, and the resurgence of investor optimism about stocks that occurs every 20 years in the US. Related News: Critical Levels in Bitcoin Have Been Set - What Levels Must Be Exceeded for an Explosive Uptrend? What Level Is Important to Prevent a Decline? Lee, known for his strong support for cryptocurrencies, was recently appointed chairman of Bitmine and played an active role in the company's $250 million Ethereum treasury strategy. This move resonated heavily in the crypto market. While he praised Ethereum for its technical aspects, Lee explained the main reason: ‚ÄúI love Ethereum because it's a programmable smart contract blockchain. But honestly, the real reason I chose Ethereum is the explosion of stablecoins. Circle, for example, had one of the best IPOs of the last five years. It's driven some funds to perform incredibly well, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 100x EBITDA. And this is a stablecoin company. Stablecoins are like the ChatGPT of the crypto world. They've entered the mainstream. This is evidence of Wall Street's efforts to 'stake' tokens. The crypto community, conversely, is tokenizing stocks, like the tokenization of the US dollar.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

Despite the recent rally, Ether is still trading almost 50% below its all-time high of ~$4,900, reached in November 2021. Growing competition from DeFi ecosystems based on Solana, BNB Chain, and, paradoxically, Ethereum layer 2 (L2) solutions is making itself felt. The latter are designed to help scale the main network, but in fact have taken over a significant portion of on-chain activity. However, developers are working tirelessly to improve the protocol and lay the foundation for upcoming comprehensive updates. One of the latest, Pectra, has increased the efficiency of L2, added smart contract functionality to wallets, and relaunched the deflation mechanism. The next stage will be the Fusaka upgrade, scheduled for the end of the year. ForkLog examined the features of this large-scale and strategically important update and how it could affect the future of Ethereum. Have a good rest with any game here - Reels of Wealth slot Unresolved issues Ethereum has been criticized for stagnant on-chain activity in the base blockchain ‚Äî the Dencun hard fork sharply reduced the costs of L2 networks, where transaction volumes have shifted. This has led the market to consider ETH less valuable, according to Sygnum experts. In many key parameters, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization lags behind Solana: apparently, most users value speed and low fees more than the degree of decentralization. However, there is a growing opinion that Solana will surpass Ethereum in the number of consumer decentralized applications (dapps) in the future. To survive the intensifying competition and maintain its leadership, Ethereum urgently needs comprehensive updates to improve scalability and UX. What has Pectra changed? On May 7, the Pectra upgrade took place on the Ethereum network. The largest update in terms of the number of proposals was activated at epoch 364,032. The upgrade includes a series of improvements aimed at increasing the convenience and efficiency of Ethereum. It contains 11 key EIPs. One of the important innovations is the addition of smart contract functionality to wallets, which simplifies their use and recovery. As a result of the update, the storage capacity for scaling L2 networks has also doubled, and the UI for validators has been improved.

Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10?

SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token‚Äôs price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90.

While Binance Coin (BNB) looks poised for a $1,000 breakout, some analysts believe Remittix could deliver even stronger percentage gains due to its real-world utility and fast-growing momentum. BNB Forecast: $1,000 Still in Sight BNB is currently trading around $770‚Äì$790, according to Coingape analysts , who note resistance near $809 and support around $743. If these levels are broken, BNB could make a run toward $1,000, or even rally all the way to the $1,200‚Äì$1,630 range as highlighted by InvestingHaven . Source: TradingView These predictions depend heavily on institutions and big investors, steady volumes, and Binance‚Äôs market dominance among other CEXs. Still, for investors seeking high-growth crypto, BNB‚Äôs large market cap may limit its upside compared to newer altcoins. Is Remittix the Top Crypto Presale of 2025? Remittix is quietly becoming the breakout presale of 2025. With its Web3 wallet beta launching in Q3 and early support for Ethereum and Solana, RTX is tackling one of the biggest crypto problems: seamless, low gas fee crypto-to-fiat transfers.

Its real-world use case targets freelancers and remote workers in 30+ countries who need fast, secure payments outside of traditional banking. And with a 50% token bonus still active as it aims for its $18M softcap, investors are taking notice.

Galaxy shared a multi-year chart of XRP, showing price action from as early as 2014 up to July 2025. The chart highlights XRP‚Äôs previous breakout in 2017, when the token surged past a consolidation range and reached an all-time high of $3.36. That rally was driven by a sharp and sustained move, with little resistance encountered once XRP breached its prior ceiling. Fast forward to 2025, and the chart shows a strikingly similar technical setup. XRP recently broke above the previous all-time high of $3.39, reaching a new all-time high of $3.65 . Following this historic move, XRP suffered a swift correction , falling to $2.99 before a slight recovery. The asset is now trading at $3.18, and the $3 resistance level has held strong. According to Galaxy, XRP is currently testing support and is on the verge of a breakout. XRP Key Level to Watch According to Galaxy, the real part will start once XRP crosses $3.3. If XRP can break above this peak, the analyst expects a swift upward move. In late 2024, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared a similar forecast, predicting that beating $1.96, XRP‚Äôs peak from the 2021 bull run, would open the door to more gains . XRP surpassed the level in late 2024. The rally culminated in a price of $3.3 in January. If XRP can perform similarly and cross the $3.3 level, it could experience similar explosive growth. Time to look at $XRP . Just a few days ago we broke ''all time highs'' and now we are testing the support. Next time it breaks $3.3 the real party starts. pic.twitter.com/Y3Vo7eG06h ‚Äî Galaxy (@galaxyBTC) July 25, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Repeating Pattern The chart also features two distinct green trend lines. The lower trend line captures XRP‚Äôs long-term higher lows, while the upper line represents horizontal resistance that was finally breached this month. These trend lines form an ascending triangle pattern , a common technical formation for potential upward momentum once resistance is broken. Notably, XRP formed the same ascending triangle and broke through it to reach its all-time high in 2018. The asset has just repeated that performance, and could be on the verge of a massive price rally. Galaxy stated, ‚Äúnext time it breaks $3.3 the real party starts.‚Äù His comments highlighted the importance of the $3.3 level as a trigger for increased bullish activity. If the asset can sustain momentum above this level, it may confirm a breakout with significant upward implications.

The token has now gained 10.5% over the past week, 15.7% over the last two weeks and 17.3% over the past 30 days. Sunday‚Äôs breakout has caught the attention of several technical analysts, who flagged bullish signs in both price action and trading structure. Analyst ‚ÄúCW‚Äù noted that BCH is ‚Äúbreaking through the sell wall‚Äù ‚Äî a term traders use to describe a heavy concentration of sell orders at a specific price level. When price breaks through such a wall, it often signals that buyers are absorbing that supply and that upward momentum could accelerate. CW pointed to $620 as the next potential target if this breakout holds. Another analyst, ‚ÄúUltimae GL,‚Äù focused on the long-term chart, observing that BCH had cleared a resistance level that had held for an extended period. Long-term resistance typically refers to a price ceiling that has rejected upward moves on multiple occasions. When that barrier is broken, it may signal the beginning of a new upward trend. Ultimae GL cautioned that traders might want to wait for a ‚Äúdecisive breakout‚Äù ‚Äî which usually means a strong daily close above the resistance ‚Äî before entering, but still projected that BCH could climb as high as $680 in the near future. A third analyst, ‚ÄúXForceGlobal,‚Äù described the current price structure as highly bullish. They noted that BCH has stayed above its so-called ‚Äúbase trendline‚Äù for about a month. A base trendline is a diagonal line connecting the series of higher lows in an uptrend, and continued price movement above it suggests that buyers are consistently stepping in at higher prices‚Äîanother sign of building strength. The analyst described the rally as ‚Äúnot just good news,‚Äù but ‚Äúfantastic,‚Äù given the sustained buying activity. Bitcoin Cash, a fork of bitcoin that launched in 2017, is designed to serve as a peer-to-peer digital currency with faster, cheaper transactions. Its recent upward trajectory, combined with accelerating volume and bullish chart setups, has renewed interest from both retail and technical traders. Technical Analysis Highlights According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, BCH gained 5.62% in the 24-hour period from July 26 at 09:00 UTC to July 27 at 08:00 UTC, rallying from $554.54 to $584.66 within a $33.61 intraday range. Two major volume spikes occurred at 01:00 and 06:00 UTC on July 27, with volume peaking at 80,230 and 120,748 units, respectively. Support zones have emerged at $556‚Äì$558 and $568‚Äì$570 following consolidation; short-term resistance is established near $585. In the final trading hour, BCH rose an additional 0.46%, reaching an intraday high of $584.95. Fresh support formed at $583‚Äì$584, suggesting ongoing bullish momentum.

According to reports, 23-year-old Shaurya Singh was remanded by the court due to the rampant nature of crypto fraud cases in the country. Over the last few months, the issue of crypto-related fraud and scam cases has been on the rise in India. Criminals are stopping at nothing to ensure they rid unsuspecting victims of their hard-earned funds. These criminal activities are carried out in various methods, including through direct scams, romance scams that turn to investments, and pig-butchering scams, which require people to pay for an investment and bring others before they can recoup their returns from the investment. Indian authorities dock student in connection to crypto fraud case According to authorities, the suspect, Shaurya Singh, is a first-year student studying for his Bachelor of Computer Applications in a school located in Nagapur. The Indian student was arrested in July, after authorities brought him in on charges of assisting another suspect, Sudhir Palande. Authorities claimed that the student had been helping Palande and other accused by transporting what they called ‚Äúkits.‚Äù The kits in this case are things like cheque books, SIM cards, and ATM cards, basically all the tools required to carry out their cybercrime operations. He was also accused of using his bank account to carry out payments for Palande and the others, with most of the payments made for hotels, food, and other things. Singh was also accused of operating a COINCDX account, renting it out to the group. This is also the same account that is being used to pay him for his services. Authorities claimed that the crypto account is connected to his bank account, and he has received at least 500 USDT from the group. The FIR in this case was filed against S.P. Cargo and Courier Services Private Ltd and its director, Sudhir Palande, alongside other unknown co-conspirators. Criminal activities in Southeast Asia are on the rise This case supports concerns about rising crypto-related crime in Southeast Asia. According to a recent report, Cambodia apprehended more than 3,000 individuals connected to a big cybercrime syndicate. The news of the arrest prompted the Indian Enforcement Directorate (ED) to launch an investigation into the cross-border digital crime network. In this case, the criminals recruit individuals under the guise of giving them a job in other locations. Instead, they are trafficked to Cambodia and Laos, where they are forced to carry out different digital scams to avoid being captured. One of the victims said the criminals use many technologies to evade arrest, funneling their ill-gotten funds into several digital assets before sending them out of the country. The ED mentioned that it is also looking into a fraud network that has stolen at least $19 million from several victims in the country. While the agency has been able to claw back about $360,000 from several bank accounts, it remains to be seen what unravels. Meanwhile, the ED said it has arrested about eight individuals linked to several digital crimes in the country. Some of them aid criminals by creating shell companies, while others help by laundering criminal proceeds. While there is presently no connection between the ongoing high-profile cases in the country and that of Singh, authorities are determined to use the full power of the law against all offenders.

In a surprising turn of events just six days later, the firm disclosed a strategic partnership with Kraken, which will reportedly provide services such as custody, trading, and over-the-counter (OTC) solutions for Windtree‚Äôs newly formed BNB treasury strategy. Windtree Therapeutics Partners With Kraken According to the announcement, the biotech firm and the US-based cryptocurrency exchange have signed a term sheet that will be formalized into a definitive agreement pending shareholder approval of Windtree‚Äôs securities purchase agreement. This partnership is said to open the door for potential future subscriptions of up to $140 million, led by Build and Build Corporation, further solidifying Windtree‚Äôs dive into the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Notably, Windtree distinguishes itself as the first Nasdaq-listed company to offer direct exposure to the BNB token, which ranks as the fifth-largest digital asset by market capitalization, exceeding $100 billion. Kraken‚Äôs infrastructure is expected to play a vital role in ensuring the secure custody and efficient trading of BNB assets. The exchange‚Äôs over-the-counter desk will facilitate transactions related to Windtree‚Äôs Binance Coin treasury strategy. The Key To Windtree‚Äôs BNB Strategy Success Jed Latkin, Chief Executive Officer of Windtree, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, stating: We are excited to partner with Kraken, a trusted leader in the cryptocurrency industry, to support our groundbreaking BNB strategy.

This makes it one of the top performers among the ten largest cryptocurrencies in the market over this period. Yet, the token has a 3% gap from its record high of $809.

According to on-chain analytics platform Glassnode , the metric suggests that as long as Bitcoin holds above the $110,000 support level, there is room for a renewed push toward an all-time high. Currently trading around $118,000, Bitcoin remains in a zone of growing optimism, but it has not yet reached the euphoric levels typically seen near market tops. Bitcoin MVRV pricing bands. Source: Glassnode The MVRV model, which compares Bitcoin‚Äôs current price to the average price at which coins were last moved, helps gauge whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued. Since early 2023, Bitcoin has steadily climbed, typically gaining momentum after clearing major technical levels. The asset is now approaching a historical zone that has often preceded previous peaks. To break above $130,000, Bitcoin must maintain its position above $110,000, now considered a key support level. Holding this level could pave the way for further upside, while a drop below it may delay a breakout. Bitcoin yet to hit euphoric levels At the same time, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez noted on July 26 that Bitcoin‚Äôs current rally still has room to run. He pointed out that while the asset has climbed to around $120,000, capital inflows into the broader crypto market remain relatively modest, suggesting investor sentiment hasn‚Äôt yet overheated. Cryptocurrency market aggregate market realized value chart. Source: Glassnode Martinez, citing Glassnode data, highlighted that aggregate inflows stand at roughly $82 billion, well below the $135 billion seen in December 2024, when Bitcoin was trading near $96,000. This divergence implies that, despite rising prices, ‚Äòthere‚Äôs still room to grow before we reach peak euphoria‚Äô. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was consolidating at $118,318, up 0.8% on the day but down 0.13% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

For instance, Bitcoin is trading well above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $110,580 and 200-day SMA of $90,392, both signs of a sustained uptrend. On the other hand, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 60.43, indicating bullish momentum without signaling overbought conditions. Featured image via Shutterstock.

Ether (ETH) has been outperforming bitcoin (BTC), a sign that investors are beginning to rotate capital from the latter to the former. According to a weekly CryptoQuant report , a continuation of the current market trend could lead to a full-blown altseason, where bitcoin stalls and altcoins take off, raking in massive gains for investors. Investors Rotate capital to Altcoins For most of this bull cycle, ETH has underperformed against BTC. However, the situation has reversed. The relative price of ETH to BTC has surged from 0.018 to 0.031, reaching its highest level since January 24. The shift in ETH performance started after the ETH/BTC Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio fell into the extremely undervalued territory in April. This ratio has acted as resistance since early 2023. ETH has now recovered and outperformed BTC by 72%. CryptoQuant analysts suggest that the ratio could rise further if it surpasses its 365-day moving average, with ETH potentially outperforming BTC even more. With ETH receiving more capital now, the asset‚Äôs spot trading volume is exceeding that of bitcoin‚Äôs. For the first time in more than a year, the weekly spot trading volume for ETH surpassed that of bitcoin. ETH recorded $25.7 billion last week, while BTC saw $24.4 billion within the same period. Analysts revealed that this is the first time since June 2024 that ether‚Äôs weekly spot trading volume has exceeded bitcoin‚Äôs. This means the ETH/BTC trading ratio is above 1. Overall altcoin trading volume has increased to the highest level since March. This metric totaled $67 billion on July 17, a figure the market has not seen since March 2. The growth indicates a renewed interest in altcoins among investors. ETH Sees Less Selling Pressure Than BTC Furthermore, crypto investors are injecting more capital into U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. Ethereum ETF allocations are growing faster than Bitcoin‚Äôs, as seen in the ETH/BTC ETF Holding Ratio climbing from 0.05 to 0.12. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC exchange inflow ratio, which measures selling pressure for the two assets, declined in May to its lowest level since 2020. The drop signaled that ETH was facing much lower selling pressure than BTC. Although the ratio has increased since then, it is still far from extremely high levels, which is a bullish signal ‚Äì ETH could continue to outperform BTC.

Yet, surprisingly, hardly anyone is talking about this exciting development‚Äîyet. As DeFi steadily moves beyond mere hype, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are leading the way by blending innovative lending with sustainable token rewards, capturing real attention from savvy investors who understand what comes next. The ground of decentralized finance is evolving. No longer just about quick flips or memecoins, the new wave focuses on hybrid lending platforms that provide consistent returns while preserving asset exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) nails this with its unique approach, combining mtToken staking rewards and a dual lending model designed for all types of crypto holders. This isn‚Äôt just another DeFi token‚Äîit‚Äôs a system built for real-world usability and growth. Epic $100K Giveaway Adding to the excitement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a $100,000 giveaway that rewards ten lucky winners with $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. The project is backed by a rigorous CertiK audit, scoring 95.00 on Token Scan and 78.00 on Skynet‚Äîboth industry-leading marks reflecting robust security and reliability. When the token generation event (TGE) happens, the beta platform will launch simultaneously, ushering in an era of seamless DeFi experiences on Layer-2 technology. This integration delivers near-zero gas fees and instant transactions, effectively removing the biggest barriers for everyday users to engage with DeFi lending and staking. P2P and P2C Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to reshape decentralized lending with its two-tiered approach: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. These distinct models are designed to accommodate both conservative investors and high-risk traders as the platform prepares to launch. Once live, the P2C model will enable users to deposit major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins into smart contracts and receive 1:1 mtTokens in return‚Äîsuch as mtSOL for Solana deposits. These tokens are engineered to accrue interest automatically, allowing users to earn passive yield while holding onto the price upside of their original assets. For example, a $10,000 deposit in SOL may offer borrowing power up to $7,500 in DAI (based on a 75% LTV). This setup is expected to give users access to flexible liquidity for trading or farming strategies‚Äîwithout selling their long-term assets. On the other side, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs upcoming P2P model will cater to more risk-tolerant users, allowing individuals to post tokens like SHIB or DOGE as collateral. Lenders and borrowers will be able to negotiate custom terms‚Äîinterest rates, durations, and repayment schedules‚Äîwithout exposing the primary liquidity pools to the volatility of meme coins. This separation of risk is part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs commitment to building a balanced, sustainable DeFi ecosystem. Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing through Phase 6 of its presale, with over 14,500 holders already on board and more than $500,000 raised. The token price sits at $0.035 for now‚Äîbut this is expected to rise to $0.04 in Phase 7, marking a 15% jump. With a capped supply of 4 billion tokens, the window for early entry is closing fast. For investors looking to secure MUTM before launch, the opportunity to buy at a discount won‚Äôt last long. Riding the Wave: Investment Projections and FOMO One early Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investor put in $4,000 during Phase 1 and now holds 400,000 MUTM tokens. At current presale prices, that investment is valued at approximately $14,000, showcasing strong early-stage growth. Analysts closely following the project forecast that MUTM will hit $0.15 by early 2026, representing a 3.5x gain from today‚Äôs prices and an impressive 15x return from initial stages. These predictions come from a respected DeFi analyst credited with correctly calling DOT‚Äôs surge in early 2021 and DOGE‚Äôs viral breakout, making this forecast far from speculative hype. As Ethereum (ETH) continues its upward momentum and the market increasingly embraces Layer-2 DeFi solutions, capital flows are shifting rapidly. Investors who once held passive ETH positions are now actively reallocating into tokens like MUTM that combine staking rewards with solid lending fundamentals. With only 5% of Phase 6 tokens sold, the opportunity to enter at $0.035 is fleeting. Once the price rises to $0.04 in the next phase, latecomers will face a higher entry barrier. This is more than a token sale; it‚Äôs a chance to join a community at the forefront of decentralized finance‚Äôs future. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just going viral‚Äîit‚Äôs gearing up to be a lasting player in the billion-dollar DeFi arena.

Three years after a devastating market crash triggered a wave of bankruptcies across the crypto lending sector , a new crop of startups is aggressively re-entering the space. They possess unsecured, tech-driven lending models ‚Äî and no collateral required. These ventures are riding a wave of investor optimism reignited by Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto agenda and the sharp rebound in the broader crypto market. At the forefront is Divine Research, a San Francisco-based firm that has issued more than 30,000 uncollateralized microloans since December. Working alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman‚Äôs eye-scanning crypto identity project , Worldcoin, Divine says it‚Äôs helping individuals excluded from traditional finance access short-term loans under $1,000, denominated in Circle‚Äôs USDC stablecoin. According to Diego Estevez, Divine‚Äôs founder, this is microfinance on steroids. He continued to say that they were lending to everyone from high-school teachers to fruit vendors ‚Äî anyone with internet access. Divine‚Äôs model hinges on Worldcoin‚Äôs biometric verification. Once a borrower scans their iris, the system ensures they can‚Äôt re-enter the platform under a new identity if they default. Despite default rates of 40% on first-time loans, Estevez claims high interest rates of 20‚Äì30% and partially reclaimable tokens balance the risk. He also said individual depositors fund the loans, incentivized by promises of consistent yields. Crypto credit startups embrace programmable trust and AI Divine isn‚Äôt alone. 3Jane, a crypto credit startup backed by Paradigm (an early FTX investor), recently raised $5.2 million in seed funding. It offers unsecured USDC credit lines via Ethereum smart contracts, though it requires ‚Äúverifiable proofs‚Äù of financial standing ‚Äî such as bank statements or crypto holdings ‚Äî rather than collateral. The firm sells defaulted loans to US debt collectors and is working on AI-powered agents that obey debt covenants automatically, potentially allowing lower interest rates. Meanwhile, Wildcat, another rising protocol, caters to market makers and crypto trading firms by offering customized, undercollateralized credit facilities. Over $170 million has already been lent through its Ethereum-based platform. Like competitors Clearpool and TrueFi, Wildcat allows borrowers to define terms like maturity and loan caps, while lenders self-organize in case of default. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a shift toward programmable trust,‚Äù said Evgeny Gaevoy, Wildcat adviser and Wintermute CEO. ‚ÄúIn the absence of collateral, reputation and transparency become everything.‚Äù Wall Street, AI, and biometrics fuel high-stakes reboot of crypto lending The crypto lending revival comes as Bitcoin prices hit new highs and traditional finance warms to digital assets. Cantor Fitzgerald recently launched a $2 billion ‚ÄúBitcoin Financing Business‚Äù, and JPMorgan is reportedly exploring crypto-backed loans. Even Coinbase is experimenting with AI agents embedded with crypto wallets, developed in collaboration with Altman‚Äôs OpenAI, that could one day autonomously manage loans and repayments. Still, memories of the 2022 crypto lending crash ‚Äî marked by the collapses of Celsius and Genesis ‚Äî loom large. Celsius‚Äôs CEO, Alex Mashinsky, is serving 12 years for fraud, while Genesis agreed to a $2 billion settlement in a lawsuit over defrauding 230,000 investors. Despite those risks, startups like Divine are betting that biometrics, blockchain, and AI can reboot crypto credit models for a new era where loans aren‚Äôt backed by assets, but by identity, algorithmic enforcement, and yield-seeking investors.

Here‚Äôs What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-witnessed-the-largest-bear-trap-in-history-heres-what-happened/,"Armando Pantoja, a prominent crypto investor and member of the Benzinga crypto advisory board, believes XRP traders just witnessed ‚Äúthe largest XRP bear trap in history.‚Äù His remark followed a sudden price reversal that saw XRP briefly dip below $3 before recovering. The move began with a strong rally, which saw XRP steadily climb above previous resistance levels, culminating in a new all-time high of $3.65 . This move excited investors who have been waiting since 2018 for this milestone. However, the market shifted very quickly. This peak was immediately followed by a rapid drop to $2.99 , breaching critical psychological support levels and triggering sell-off activity. This price decline was short-lived, as XRP quickly recovered, holding support at $3 and rebounding back to its current level around $3.19. The sharp reversal caught many short-position holders unprepared, as they anticipated a deeper correction following the dramatic spike. The swift recovery invalidated those expectations and put pressure on traders who bet against the price.

Instead, the asset quickly reverses direction and moves higher, forcing those short sellers to exit their trades at a loss. This kind of setup often accelerates upward momentum as short positions are unwound. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In this case, XRP‚Äôs drop from $3.65 to $2.99 signaled a potential breakdown. The speed of the decline and the breach of the $3 level created a compelling case for bears. But the quick rebound above $3.20 erased that outlook and left those shorting the asset exposed. The trap caused a rapid shift in sentiment as traders scrambled to adjust positions. What sets this event apart is how cleanly the price reclaimed support without confirming a larger trend breakdown. Bear traps aren‚Äôt uncommon in crypto , but the scale of this move and the timing just following an all-time high created an uncommonly strong conviction in short positions before reversing sharply. The failed breakdown at $3 now acts as confirmation of buyer strength at that level, reinforcing its technical significance. What‚Äôs Next for XRP? XRP‚Äôs recovery has reestablished the $3 mark as a key line in the sand. Despite the volatility, the asset continues to trade well above its early July range, and the broader trend remains intact. Analysts are now looking toward double-digits as XRP forms crucial technical indicators. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a post on the social media platform X, the billionaire says that JPMorgan retaliated to a tweet he made last week, saying that the financial services titan was seeking to bankrupt fintech and crypto firms by charging them fees to access their customers‚Äô account information. According to Winklevoss, JPMorgan reached out to say that the bank would be pausing its re-onboarding of Gemini, which was dropped as a JPMorgan customer during the Biden Administration‚Äôs crackdown on crypto. ‚ÄúMy tweet from last week struck a nerve. This week, JPMorgan told us that because of it, they were pausing their re-onboarding of Gemini as a customer after they off-boarded us during Operation ChokePoint 2.0.

Sorry Jamie Dimon, we‚Äôre not going to stay silent. We will continue to call out this anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior and immoral attempt to bankrupt fintech and crypto companies.

As of press time, Ethereum was trading around $3,700, placing it within the ‚ÄúSteady‚Ä¶‚Äù zone of the chart. The Rainbow Chart is a long-term valuation model that utilizes a logarithmic curve and color bands to illustrate Ethereum‚Äôs historical price sentiment. It helps investors gauge whether the asset is undervalued or overheated, without predicting short-term movements. For August 1, 2025, the model estimates Ethereum could trade between $4,752.48 and $6,901.15, a range corresponding to the ‚ÄúHODL!‚Äù zone. However, based on Ethereum‚Äôs current position and price momentum, the asset is likely to remain in the ‚ÄúSteady‚Ä¶‚Äù zone over the next few days. Ethereum Rainbow Chart. Source: BlockhainCenter The lowest band on the chart, labeled as ‚ÄúFire Sale‚Äù ($881.52 to $1,193.99), indicates extreme undervaluation. This is followed by ‚ÄúUndervalued‚Äù ($1,193.99 to $1,649.69), then ‚ÄúAccumulate‚Äù ($1,649.69 to $2,148.10), a range historically favorable for long-term buying. Above that is the ‚ÄúStill Cheap‚Äù band ($2,148.10 to $3,298.74). The next zone is ‚ÄúSteady‚Ä¶‚Äù ($3,298.74 to $4,752.48), where Ethereum currently sits, indicating stable growth and reduced volatility. The ‚ÄúHODL!‚Äù zone spans $4,752.48 to $6,901.15, where long-term holders typically strengthen their conviction. Above that is ‚ÄúIs this the Flippening?‚Äù ($6,901.15 to $10,038.05), marking the onset of speculation and hype. Higher up, ‚ÄúBut have we earned it?‚Äù ranges from $10,038.05 to $14,352.17, and the topmost band, ‚ÄúMaximum Bubble Territory‚Äù, spans $14,352.17 to $20,456.93, reflecting peak exuberance. Ethereum price analysis At the time of reporting, Ethereum was up 0.47% in the past 24 hours, trading at $3,791. On the weekly timeframe, the asset has gained about 2.5%. ETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Ethereum‚Äôs recent bullish rally, which appears to be targeting the $4,000 level, is supported by key technical indicators. The 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) stands at $2,836.31, while the 200-day SMA is at $2,404.22. The gap between the current price and both SMAs signals a sustained bullish trend, with Ethereum trading well above both its short- and long-term averages. However, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is at 80.01, a level that indicates overbought conditions. While this doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate an imminent reversal, it does suggest that the asset may be due for a short-term pullback or consolidation.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF‚Äôs price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the ‚Äúdog wif a hat‚Äù project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular ‚ÄúSphere Wif Hat‚Äù campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let‚Äôs explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $1.09 Market cap $1.09B Trading volume $256.24M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $1.10 24-hour low $1.06 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 13.56% 50-day SMA $0.9222 14-Day RSI 53.30 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green days 18/30 (60%) 200-Day SMA $1.2129 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF sees rejection at $1.261 resistance with declining volume. The coin consolidates between $1.056 and $1.136 with a neutral RSI. A breach of support at $1.056 risks a correction to $0.862. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF attempts recovery after pullback from resistance level The WIF/USDT price chart for July 27 shows a clear shift from the bullish momentum that drove WIF from around $0.95 to its recent highs, following a sharp rejection from the $1.261 resistance level. However, the token has seen some momentum push, bouncing off the middle Bollinger band at $1.062 with a green candle, though not solid enough to call a recovery. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The MACD indicator confirms this bearish divergence, with the histogram turning negative and the signal line crossing below the MACD line, suggesting weakening buying pressure. Volume has declined significantly from the peak levels seen during the rally, indicating reduced market participation and potential for further downside if WIF fails to stay above $1.062. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF is experiencing range-bound trading On the 4-hour chart, WIF shows signs of stabilization within a defined range. The SMAs create a tight cluster between $1.124 and $1.136, acting as immediate resistance levels that bulls need to reclaim to shift momentum. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The RSI at 43.59 sits in neutral territory, which suggests that WIF has room to move in either direction without immediate technical constraints. Price action has been consolidating between the $1.056 support zone and the $1.136 resistance, with recent candles showing small-bodied formations that indicate market indecision. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.8236 BUY SMA 5 $0.9694 BUY SMA 10 $1.0735 BUY SMA 21 $1.0250 BUY SMA 50 $0.9222 BUY SMA 100 $0.8985 BUY SMA 200 $1.2129 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.013436 BUY EMA 5 $0.960378 BUY EMA 10 $0.855457 BUY EMA 21 $0.720033 BUY EMA 50 $0.679059 BUY EMA 100 $0.920992 BUY EMA 200 $1.333812 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF might continue range-bound trading in the near term, with the critical levels being $1.056 support and $1.136 resistance. A break below $1.056 could trigger a deeper correction toward the daily chart‚Äôs lower Bollinger band at $0.862. In contrast, a sustained break above $1.136 with volume confirmation could reignite bullish momentum toward the previous high of $1.261. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF‚Äôs price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion ‚Äì a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE‚Äôs marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF‚Äôs future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Here‚Äôs the Brutal Reality After 7 Years,https://cryptopotato.com/remember-akons-futuristic-crypto-city-heres-the-brutal-reality-after-7-years/,"Senegal has officially scrapped Akon‚Äôs much-hyped plans to build a futuristic, crypto-powered city on its Atlantic coast. The West African country is reclaiming most of the land once set aside for the project and shifting focus to a scaled-back, privately funded tourism hub. ‚ÄúReal-Life Wakanda‚Äù No More First announced in 2018 and branded as a ‚Äúreal-life Wakanda,‚Äù Akon City aimed to transform Mbodi√®ne, a quiet farming village about 80 kilometers from Dakar, into a $6 billion metropolis running on Akon‚Äôs Akoin cryptocurrency. Plans included a solar-powered city with a state-of-the-art hospital, university, hotels, shopping malls, and a marina. Akoin city. Source: Akon‚Äôs website After repeated delays, missed payments, and a final ultimatum from Senegal‚Äôs tourism development body SAPCO in 2024, the country terminated Akon City. The SAPCO General Manager, Serigne Mamadou Mboup, confirmed , ‚ÄúThe Akon City project no longer exists.‚Äù Most of the 136 acres granted to Akon in 2020 are now back under state control. While the grand vision of a futuristic crypto city in Senegal has ended, Akon isn‚Äôt entirely walking away. The singer will retain eight hectares of the land as part of a revised plan with SAPCO for a smaller-scale development. Senegal Debt Crisis Deepens The timing reflects Senegal‚Äôs economic challenges. The nation is grappling with a debt crisis after a state audit revealed $7 billion in hidden liabilities under the previous administration, which has capped access to credit markets and frozen IMF funding. Against this backdrop, SAPCO‚Äôs revised $1.2 billion plan for Mbodi√®ne will depend heavily on private investors to transform the area into a tourism hub with hotels, apartments, and a promenade linking to a nearby lagoon. Despite the hype, Akon City‚Äôs visible progress was limited to a youth center, a basketball court, and a small welcome center, leaving early Akoin buyers demanding refunds and some residents skeptical of big promises. The new plan is expected to create around 15,000 jobs in its first phase, offering a tangible opportunity for local investment and employment that even the grandest crypto visions could not deliver.

Despite a 29.61% drop in 24-hour volume, overall sentiment leans bullish with the Fear & Greed Index at a greed-driven score of 64. The Altcoin Season Index sits at 42/100, showing a tilt toward Bitcoin dominance. The gain in market has been supported by institutional inflows, ongoing FTX creditor repayments, and bullish DeFi developments. Investors are eyeing two major events next week that could reshape sentiment: the FOMC meeting (July 29‚Äì30), expected to address rate policies and macroeconomics, and the SEC decision on the Bitwise BITW ETF on July 31. Join me as I dive into the charts for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price prediction for next week. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin is trading sideways just above its 20-day SMA at $117,176, reflecting a period of consolidation. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, suggesting a potential breakout soon. RSI sits at 60.62, showing neither extreme overbought nor oversold conditions. On the upside, BTC faces a tough resistance at $123,680 , a level it failed to breach earlier this month. If bulls can push above this, the next leg could test $127,000. Conversely, a break below the support at $111,964 could expose BTC to $108,000. Next Week Target Range: $115,000 ‚Äì $123,680 Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Ethereum remains one of the strongest performers. It continues to trade in an uptrend channel with solid support at $3,550. The RSI is elevated at 79.69, hinting at slight overbought conditions but still backed by strong momentum. Price is hovering just below the $4,096 resistance zone. If ETH breaks above $4,100, we could see a run to $4,250 . However, if rejection occurs again, a pullback to $3,600‚Äì$3,550 seems likely. Next Week Target Range: $3,600 ‚Äì $4,250 XRP Price Prediction XRP recently saw a bounce from the $2.8497 support zone after a correction from its $3.49 resistance. The RSI is cooling down from an overbought 76.12 to 62.02, suggesting room for a fresh move upward. Bollinger Bands show XRP attempting to consolidate above the 20-SMA at $3.0589. If bulls manage to reclaim $3.49, XRP could retest $3.60 next week. However, failure to maintain above $3.05 may drive it back toward $2.85. Next Week Target Range: $2.85 ‚Äì $3.49 FAQs Can Bitcoin hit a new ATH next week? Bitcoin is consolidating near resistance. A decisive breakout above $123,680 could open the door to $127k, but momentum must pick up. Will the ETH price hit $4,000 soon? Yes, ETH is approaching the $4,100 resistance. If buying pressure sustains, $4,250 is achievable next week. Is XRP still bullish despite the recent drop? Yes, XRP is showing signs of recovery from $2.85, and a move above $3.49 could confirm bullish continuation.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|ETH|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-27 11:30:00

WeWake enters Stage 2 of its live buy crypto presale at $0.0150 per token, with a listing price set at $0.15. The WeWake ecosystem offers gasless dApps, social logins, and smart wallets, simplifying Web3 onboarding for all users. Cardano has broken a key support level after a sharp 15% decline in the last 24 hours. The ADA token dropped to $0.77, triggering concerns across the crypto sector. Analysts observed bearish patterns and increased sell pressure, while trading volume rose. As Cardano lost ground, WeWake, now live in Stage 2 of its buy crypto presale, offers a walletless and gasless blockchain experience. The presale has launched at a token price of $0.0100, with a projected listing price of $0.15. Cardano Price Drops Below Key Technical Level Cardano‚Äôs price decline follows a series of technical breakdowns. The token fell through the $0.84 support level and is now trading near $0.81. Short-term charts show weak bounces, and bearish momentum continues to increase. Source: CoinMarketCap The SEC‚Äôs pause of Bitwise‚Äôs multi-asset ETF, which held 4.97% ADA, added pressure on market sentiment. At the same time, daily active users dropped below 40,000, and total value locked in Cardano DeFi fell to $382 million. The MACD indicator turned negative, while the RSI suggests that ADA is not yet oversold, signaling room for further downside. WeWake Presale Stage 2 Now Live at $0.0150 Per Token The WeWake ecosystem has officially launched its buy crypto presale, currently in Stage 1. The live presale offers WAKE tokens at $0.0100, with a planned listing price of $0.15. This early access stage allows users to enter the ecosystem before mainnet deployment and full public release. WeWake aims to fix crypto onboarding by removing the need for wallets, gas, and seed phrases. The system allows users to access Web3 services through social login options like Google or Telegram. Smart wallets are created automatically, and transaction fees are covered through a built-in Paymaster layer. The platform is powered by a zk-rollup Layer 2 chain and ERC-4337 smart wallets. This creates a seamless experience, helping users interact with DeFi, NFTs, and dApps with no technical setup required. Developers can use the SDK to enable these features on their platforms. WeWake Roadmap and Developer Plans for WeWake Ecosystem The WeWake roadmap focuses on a full public rollout by 2026. The current timeline begins in Q4 2025 with testnet development, including zkEVM integration, smart wallet setup, and the Paymaster API. The public testnet will launch in Q1 2026. Mainnet is scheduled for Q2 2026. By then, WeWake will introduce NFT support, Telegram Mini Apps, and DAO governance features. Security audits, bridge integrations, and modular data solutions such as Celestia or EigenDA are also planned. WeWake provides an SDK for developers who want to adopt its walletless login and gasless transaction features. Projects can use the Paymaster API to sponsor gas for users, making it easier to retain non-technical participants in dApps. Tokenomics and Incentives of the WAKE Token The WAKE token is the core of the WeWake ecosystem . The total supply is fixed at 308,726,951 tokens. The buy crypto presale allocates 32% of the supply, while 14% goes toward ecosystem incentives and 12% to the governance treasury. Other token distributions include staking emissions, marketing, and strategic reserves. Token holders can stake WAKE for validator rewards, vote in protocol governance, and earn rewards through usage and referrals. The WAKE token is expected to list at $0.15, giving early presale participants access to major upside potential. WeWake positions its token as both an access tool and a governance mechanism. Participants in Stage 2 of the live buy crypto presale can benefit from early pricing and priority in the network‚Äôs staking and integration layers.

The whale transferred over 80,000 BTC in batches, triggering a sharp 4.21% weekly decline to $115,444 as Galaxy distributed over 17,123 BTC worth $1.98 billion to major exchanges , including Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. Notably, analysis suggests that the sales may be connected to a hacker who took control of a whale wallet and facilitated sales through Galaxy Digital. Despite fears of market disruption, analysts suggest the selling pressure may be absorbed without significant long-term impact. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju notes that ‚Äúold whales sell to new long-term whales,‚Äù indicating institutional adoption is reshaping traditional market dynamics. Technical analysis reveals that Bitcoin is recovering from classic bull trap psychology while forming a falling wedge pattern, targeting breakout levels of $125,000, with institutional buyers, including BlackRock and MicroStrategy, actively absorbing the distribution. $BTC just followed the emotional cycle to the letter.

Source: Captain Faibik on X The falling wedge represents one of the most reliable bullish reversal patterns, with declining highs and lows converging toward resolution. The blue projection line extending toward $125,000 indicates measured move potential from a successful wedge breakout. Volume characteristics reveal a decline in participation as the pattern matures, followed by an increase in activity during breakout attempts. Current positioning near the upper wedge boundary suggests that Bitcoin is in the final stages of its pattern, with a breakout likely triggering significant momentum-based buying that will propel it toward new all-time highs above the previous $123,000 peak. The convergence creates natural coiling effects where volatility compresses before expanding dramatically upon resolution. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Whale Accumulation Divergence Signals Institutional Absorption Whale holdings analysis reveals fascinating divergence where large holder accumulation accelerates despite high-profile Satoshi-era distributions. Source: Coinvo on X The 1-year change in whale holdings shows sharp increases reaching levels not seen since previous major accumulation phases. While ancient whales distribute holdings, new institutional investors aggressively accumulate Bitcoin at current levels. This accumulation pattern suggests sophisticated investors view current prices as attractive entry points rather than distribution levels. Recent institutional activity includes BlackRock acquiring 1,204 additional BTC and MicroStrategy adding 4,225 coins, reinforcing absorption capacity for continued whale distributions. The divergent behavior where retail sentiment remains uncertain while whale accumulation continues typically indicates smart money positioning for the next major advance. Notably, the continuous decline in Bitcoin dominance, from 65.95% to 61.25%, indicates healthy capital rotation, suggesting that Bitcoin can continue to advance while the total cryptocurrency market expands, driving broader sector strength. $BTC Dominance pic.twitter.com/lBNC6asPSv ‚Äî Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) July 26, 2025 BTC Hyper: Final Opportunity for $HYPER Presale Before Q3 Launch The exit of the Satoshi-era whales and institutional absorption highlight Bitcoin‚Äôs evolution toward mainstream adoption.

Source: Bitcoin Hyper Early investors are securing final positions in the Layer-2 solution built on the Solana Virtual Machine that addresses Bitcoin‚Äôs scaling limitations. $HYPER token holders unlock high APY staking rewards while gaining access to DeFi, NFT, and gaming applications previously unavailable to Bitcoin holders.

Cross-chain interoperability provides institutional-grade infrastructure for Bitcoin‚Äôs evolution beyond a simple store of value. The presale‚Äôs limited remaining allocation and the approaching mainnet launch create a final opportunity for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin scaling infrastructure during this institutional transition phase. Interested investors are advised to secure their positions on the presale website as major exchange listings are planned post-mainnet, with DAO governance launching, positioning early $HYPER holders for maximum return.

According to ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, the 2% cryptocurrency transfer reward offered by Robinhood may be behind this sudden unstaking demand. Responding to questions within the community about the sudden surge in Ethereum unstaking demand, Wood stated, ‚ÄúRobinhood offers a 2% matching reward on cryptocurrency transfers. Therefore, venture capitalists and other investors are transferring their staked ETH, which has expired, to companies known as digital asset treasuries (DATs) to raise funds.‚Äù Wood added that these companies operate similarly to MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Bitmine (BMNR), with brokerage advisors offering their clients BTC and ETH investments through these types of shares. This massive unstaking drive by validators and long-term investors on the Ethereum network has surpassed the outflow wave caused by Celsius in January 2024. According to onchain data, approximately 693,000 ETH, or $2.6 billion worth of assets, are currently waiting to be withdrawn. This is the largest unstaking wave since the introduction of Ethereum's staking mechanism. Related News: Critical Levels in Bitcoin Have Been Set - What Levels Must Be Exceeded for an Explosive Uptrend? What Level Is Important to Prevent a Decline? Due to the high volume of withdrawal requests, the withdrawal queue has extended to 12 days. However, the amount of ETH waiting to be staked remains at only 296,000 ETH, indicating very low demand for re-staking. According to staking service provider Everstake, validators are unstaking not only for sales but also for strategies like restaking and yield optimization. ARK Invest CEO Wood said some of these unstaking transactions are linked to institutional investors reallocating their staked ETH to digital asset treasury firms like SharpLink Gaming and Bitmine Technologies. *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Lee says that high-net-worth investors are still on the fence about speculative stocks, shares of firms that carry a high level of risk but also offer the potential for very high returns The performance of these stocks is often attributed to hope and hype rather than a proven business model. Says Lee, ‚ÄúThese are not the stocks that we recommend for our clients. You know, we stick with large-cap quality and portfolios. 35 of the best S&P [500] names‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs $7 trillion of cash on the sidelines, and retail investor sentiment, I think you have to really fracture it. I think the Robinhood community is bullish, but what I‚Äôd call the high-net-worth and the traditional equity investor is still pretty cautious.

During the period of XRP stability, it means that holders cannot obtain greater returns by speculating on the currency. Some investors do not want to keep their XRP in cold wallets because they cannot predict when it will rise, so they begin looking for investment plans that can use XRP to stabilize the value of their assets. How does XRP increase in value steadily? Simply holding XRP may get some policy support and a short-term asset increase, but it may also face the risk of XRP shrinking. There is only one way to make XRP appreciate steadily, that is to use XRP to invest in the GoldenMining cloud mining platform to earn US dollar income. Traditional mining to earn cryptocurrencies requires a lot of time and energy, and for most holders, it is extremely difficult. GoldneMining can solve all the problems faced by traditional mining for investors. Why GoldenMining?

The rebuttal followed a wave of online chatter claiming that a deal may have closed around December 2024. In a Saturday post on blogging platform X, the head of security at Pudgy Penguins, Beau, dismissed the rumors, claiming that no such thing has happened. ‚ÄúPudgy Penguins didn‚Äôt buy OpenSea‚Ä¶ chill,‚Äù Beau wrote on X. Pudgy Penguins is a collection of 8,888 flightless bird NFTs launched in July 2021. The project has also expanded its offering, providing users with physical products through its Pudgy Toys line in a partnership with PMI Toys. Pudgy Penguins shut down rumors of OpenSea acquisition In his post on X, Beau claimed that the project still has big plans, so users should be calm and not focus on one possible acquisition. ‚ÄúTalk about partnering with Lufthansa and NASCAR, and go find the next great brand for us to proliferate with,‚Äù Beau added. In addition to its physical products partnership, Pudgy Penguins is also allowing NFT holders to earn from commercial use through its OverpassIP platform. Rumors of OpenSea‚Äôs acquisition went viral on X after multiple users on the platform pointed to previous comments by CEO Luca Netz. These posts also included a now viral post from October 2024, where he said he wanted his company to purchase OpenSea. Some users have speculated that the purchase may have occurred quietly without both parties making announcements about it. A user also claimed that it may have occurred in December 2024, coinciding with announcements made by Pudgy Penguins and OpenSea ‚Äôs later policy shift around token support in the same month. However, Beau pushed back on the speculation, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually think acquiring OS rn would make a lot of sense for us.‚Äù He added that the team‚Äôs preference is to focus on confirmed developments rather than speculations. CryptoPunks lead the charge as NFT market rebounds Pudgy Penguins has entered into several brand partnerships with different firms, including those with Lufthansa and NASCAR. Last month, the project also announced the launch of a skill-based Web3 game called Pengu Clash for The Open Network (TON) Blockchain, entering into the competitive mini-game space. The game is expected to operate under a play-to-win model, allowing players to compete and be rewarded for their game mastery. ‚ÄúPlay-to-win, in essence, is a skill-based game,‚Äù Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz said about the game at the time. ‚ÄúUsers wager against one another vs play-to-earn, [in which] you‚Äôre earning tradable currency that the game provides. This is a user-vs-user-based system.‚Äù The game is supported by Elympics‚Äô infrastructure and will feature different modes with different rules and objectives to enable skill-based challenges and multiplayer experiences. Meanwhile, the NFT market has shown renewed momentum in July, with the total market capitalization hitting $6.6 billion. The rise signifies a 94% jump from the previous month, according to data from DappRadar. Weekly trading volumes also jumped 51%, making it the industry‚Äôs strongest performance since February. Leading the industry comeback is Ethereum-based collection CryptoPunks , whose floor price rose by 53%. DappRadar analysts claimed that the collections‚Äô appeal as a Web3 status symbol helped. On July 22, the collection registered 83 new purchases and a 15.9% rise in its flow price in 24 hours, hitting around $180,000 per NFT. In addition, CryptoBatz NFTs also recorded a 400% surge after the death of Ozzy Osbourne. Osbourne entered the NFT industry in 2021, launching the collection, which featured 9,666 unique digital bats in December. In addition to the rise in floor price, CryptoBatz also recorded a 100,000% surge in trading volume, reaching $281,200 within 24 hours after his death. Despite the surge, the NFT still fell short of its all-time high.

At the same time, the Litecoin price hovers near $113, up around 5% in the past week on growing ETF hype. Meanwhile, Avalanche‚Äôs token AVAX is trading near $23.50, up 32% in the last 30 days, thanks to renewed DeFi adoption. Altcoin attention is shifting as investors seek high-growth crypto with real utility. Privacy tokens, Layer1 networks, and scaling platforms are all gaining steam. In this dynamic environment, a socialfocused crypto with utility and staking could outperform legacy assets. Litecoin Outlook: $113 Holds While ETF Buzz Builds Litecoin is trading around $113 with a trading volume of over $1.3‚ÄØbillion in the last day. It rose roughly 11 to 12% this week on renewed excitement about a potential LTC spot ETF. Analysts expect a retest of the $120‚Äì$130 level if ETF filings move forward. Popular analysts on X (formerly Twitter) have observed the 4-hour chart, which suggests that the Litecoin price may go back up soon . He predicts that it could rise to about $130; otherwise, it would dip to $96. After $96, it would be on a fast road to $130 to $180. Monero Pulse: Privacy Token Steadies at $320 Monero trades at about $322, down slightly over 2% in a week, yet up nearly 6% over the past 7 days. Its market cap is $5.9‚ÄØbillion, and daily volume is near $130‚ÄØmillion. Experts have stated that XMR is retracing into a 1W bullish order block after a strong BOS above $185. The optimal buy zone now ranges from $227 to $276, with targets at $360 and $430. Avalanche Move: AVAX Clears Resistance Near $24 Avalanche‚Äôs AVAX sits just below $24, supported by a 7day gain of roughly 3.5%. Market cap stands around $10‚ÄØbillion, with daily volume near $1‚ÄØbillion. AVAX has seen buyer interest near the $22 to $23 zone, and some expect a climb to $30 if DeFi activity keeps rising. Experts have also observed that Avalanche is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern on the weekly chart. As it approaches the MA50, a breakout above this could drive the price toward targets at $30, $40, $55, $65, $85, and $120.

This token powers reward flows for posts and content, thanks to API bridges to platforms like Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram.

In the past week, major players like Ethereum and Solana have faced stiff competition from emerging blockchain projects designed for real-world utility. DeSoc is a new decentralized social offering, and savvy traders are looking beyond old favorites. They‚Äôre turning to low-gas-fee crypto and fresh DeFi project ecosystems that solve actual user problems. One of the most talked-about tokens right now is a social-driven chain with a utility-first approach, designed for people, not just prices. Let‚Äôs see why. Ripple Price Prediction: Sentiment Wavers XRP has increased by 44% over the course of a week and is trading at $3.17, with the rise being boosted by a heavy amount of institutional interest and the release of Ripple-owned stablecoin, RLUSD, which currently has a total value of $517 million issued. The optimism has been further boosted by the recent approval of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF after the Ripple Foundation filed an application with the U.S. to have a national bank charter. While Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal clarity has helped maintain long-term investor interest, the lack of new ecosystem growth is showing. Analysts expect XRP could stay between $2.50 and $3.20 throughout the rest of 2025, unless major financial institutions ramp up usage of its on-chain liquidity solutions. Still, top experts have tipped Desoc with its social connectivity as the best low-cap crypto to hold now for 100x returns soon. DeSoc: The Best Crypto Presale With Real Utility DeSoc is a decentralized social blockchain powered by the $SOCS token. It offers a full suite of user-owned features, including gasless posting, wallet-based identity, and a reputation score known as SoulScore. The top crypto project is built primarily for community social use as the platform allows users to post, vote, and reward creators directly on-chain, without relying on third-party apps or centralized moderation. Compared to Ripple, which focuses on financial transfers, DeSoc‚Äôs edge lies in everyday interaction. It is designed as a real-time social economy where engagement earns value, not just speculation. With built-in tipping tools, governance rights, and native NFTs for content, DeSoc feels like the future of Web3 is transparent, self-custodial, and built for creators. Join The DeSoc Train Now For 100x Gains In 2025 For anyone searching for the best crypto presale with long-term potential, DeSoc stands out. Its tokenomics are grounded in user participation, not hype cycles. As crypto shifts from passive investment to active utility, $SOCS offers a compelling case as the next big altcoin in 2025, one with purpose, participation, and a product that already works.

This rise was fueled by substantial institutional interest, particularly with the introduction of Ripple's stablecoin, RLUSD, which achieved a valuation of $517 million. Additionally, the optimism around XRP was bolstered by the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF's approval following an application by the Ripple Foundation for a national bank charter in the U.S. However, the landscape of digital currencies is shifting with new entrants like DeSoc , a platform offering a decentralized social blockchain that emphasizes real-world utility over speculative trading. With features like gasless posting and a wallet-based identity system, DeSoc is tailored for social interaction, providing a stark contrast to Ripple's financial transfer focus. Ripple's Current Market Dynamics Despite the recent achievements, Ripple's growth is showing signs of stagnation due to the ongoing legal challenges it faces. These issues have hampered its ecosystem development, although they have not significantly deterred investor interest. Financial analysts are predicting that XRP's price could stabilize between $2.50 and $3.20 through 2025 unless there's an uptick in adoption by major financial institutions for its liquidity solutions. Furthermore, attention is shifting to emerging tokens that promise more than just financial gains. One such promising token is DeSoc, celebrated for its innovative approach in the crypto space. Analysts have recognized XRP's potential but suggest that DeSoc may offer better long-term growth potential. DeSoc: Pioneering Decentralized Social Interactions DeSoc's platform is a novel entry in the blockchain arena, powered by its native $SOCS token. It features user-owned functionalities like a reputation system known as SoulScore and native NFTs that allow content monetization directly on the blockchain. These features facilitate a more engaged community where interactions are not only social but also economically rewarding. As the crypto market continues to evolve from mere passive investments to platforms offering active utility, $SOCS presents as an intriguing alternative. Its robust tokenomics are designed to foster user participation, setting it apart from many speculative tokens in the market. Why DeSoc Might Be the Next Big Thing in Crypto For crypto enthusiasts and investors looking to get involved in a project with substantial real-world applicability, DeSoc provides an appealing option. Its infrastructure promotes a transparent, self-custodial Web3 environment that empowers creators and users alike. If you're considering diversifying your crypto portfolio or getting in early on potentially lucrative presales, DeSoc represents a compelling opportunity.

With the past week seeing rising demand for next-gen platforms, new crypto projects that prioritize user control and low gas fees are swooping up investor liquidity. As older networks face scalability pressure and regulatory fatigue, new projects with built-in utility and engagement are drawing attention. DeSoc‚Äôs features are tailored for content creators and community builders, and already position it as a top DeFi project and possibly the next big altcoin in 2025. Let‚Äôs see why this matters to Ripple and Solana whales. XRP Price Is Struggling To Hold Key Support: Correction Incoming? XRP recently fell below $3 as market volume thinned and investor interest cooled. Despite gains from regulatory wins earlier this month, Ripple has failed to bring fresh innovation to its core payment utility. XRP is currently struggling to hold its momentum, barely maintaining above the 20‚Äëday EMA around $3.01 after yesterday‚Äôs decline to as low as $3.07 . Bulls are trying to reclaim $3.25 to push the price back to recent highs, but resistance remains stiff. Analysts warn that failure to hold above the $3.30‚Äì$3.40 zone could trigger a deeper slide toward $3.00 or even $2.95 levels Analysts now predict a slow recovery unless new financial institutions begin large-scale adoption of its on-chain services, with most forecasts capping XRP at $3.10 through Q4 this year. Solana Ecosystem Is Booming As PENGU And BONK Post Double-Digit Gains Solana‚Äôs ecosystem is currently booming thanks to a surge in meme coins like BONK, PENGU, and FLOKI. BONK rallied 7% in 24 hours after shaking off Binance‚Äôs ‚Äúseed‚Äù label and is holding above $0.00003 support, eyeing a test near $0.00004 . Meanwhile, PENGU jumped a staggering 91% over the past week and now surpasses BONK as the top meme token by market cap on Solana. Despite these double-digit gains, critics warn the hype might not extend to SOL, the native token. Soon after climbing above the $200 mark, SOL reversed from that increase and fell, and analysts warned that this level shows both bullish and bearish signals, and more consolidation may ensue. Yet optimism remains: spot and staking ETFs have sparked a bullish wave, and forecasts from Investtech, Coincentral, and Changelly all predict a surge toward $250‚Äì$300 by late 2025, though achieving $300 hinges on sustained momentum above $175‚Äì$180. DeSoc: Experts Number 1 High-Growth Crypto Ready For 300% Gains Before Q4 2025 DeSoc is redefining blockchain-based interaction with its native $SOCS token. It‚Äôs the first decentralized social network enabling users to publish across both its platform and major social channels like Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram. Using a public, verifiable blockchain layer, DeSoc empowers users with full control over content and identity, including spam-resistant messaging, on-chain tipping, and a real-time reputation system called SoulScore. Where Solana and XRP target financial utility or speed, DeSoc brings social relevance to blockchain. Its self-custodial design supports direct community governance, and content monetization happens transparently on-chain. Developers benefit too, with open APIs that sync activity across ecosystems while respecting each platform‚Äôs posting rules. With its content syndication features and user-first design, $SOCS offers more than hype; it offers a working system ready to scale. As XRP and Solana wobble, DeSoc could be the breakout altcoin in the coming week, and experts think you should position now! Click This Link To Check Out The DeSoc Presale .

By Trump‚Äôs inauguration anniversary, government agencies hope to scrap about 50% of the existing federal rules. According to sources, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) are using the ‚ÄúAI Deregulation Tool.‚Äù The AI-powered Deregulation Decision Tool will examine roughly 200,000 rules and eliminate what it deems unnecessary, targeting a 50% reduction by next January. The regulations identified by the system will then undergo staff review before removal. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has already deployed the tool to assess 1,083 regulatory sections. At the same time, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau relied on it for all its deregulation decisions. Fields claimed they are still reviewing all options to facilitate deregulation During his campaign, President Trump argued that some federal regulations resulted in inflated prices for several consumer goods. He vowed to launch the ‚Äúmost aggressive regulatory reduction‚Äù in US history, including efforts to roll back environmental protections and dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). When asked about using AI to deregulate , White House spokesman Harrison Fields said they are reviewing all potential options to fulfill the president‚Äôs deregulatory agenda . However, he stressed that no specific plan had been set in stone and that discussions were still in the early stages and involved close coordination with the White House. He added, ‚ÄúThe DOGE experts creating these plans are the best and brightest in the business and are embarking on a never-before-attempted transformation of government systems and operations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.‚Äù DOGE‚Äôs AI contract reviewer faced issues in June In June, the DOGE AI system mistakenly flagged the Department of Veterans Affairs‚Äô internet contract for cancellation. According to the agency, they gave the service vague and contradictory instructions, hence the mishap. Sahil Lavingia, author of the AI code, had instructed the system to nix anything not directly related to caring for patients. But neither he nor the AI had the know-how to judge that accurately. Lavingia, speaking to ProPublica, acknowledged that he made errors because he didn‚Äôt have enough time and tools. He also noted that he understood that the list from the ‚ÄúMUNCHABLE‚Äù list was intended to be reviewed by others prior to any decisions. ProPublica‚Äôs analysis found that Lavingia‚Äôs code also relied on older, generic AI models. The model produced erroneous numbers, often estimating about 1,100 contracts at $34 million each when the real figures were frequently in the thousands, and it struggled to handle entire documents. The analysts also said that using off-the-shelf AI with little understanding of VA operations should never have been on the table in the first place. Waldo Jaquith, a former Treasury Department official appointed under Obama who managed IT contracting, criticized DOGE for prompting the AI system to pull information from easily accessible sources rather than accurate ones, such as publicly available databases like USAspending. He described the approach as lazy; though faster, it‚Äôs still less accurate. Cary Coglianese, a University of Pennsylvania professor, also noted that the AI model would need an advanced understanding of medical care, institutional operations, and staffing resources‚Äîknowledge it currently lacks.

But every now and then, something breaks the mold. Right now, three crypto assets have managed to stay under the $1 mark while still making actual noise: DeSoc , XRP, and Dogecoin. And if you‚Äôre looking for a place to park a smart bet without going broke, these names are worth your attention. The big question isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs cheap?‚Äù It‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs still early?‚Äù Because the real upside in this space doesn‚Äôt come from cheap tokens. It comes from getting in before the crowd. And in that sense, DeSoc might be sitting right where you want to be. Dogecoin Gets More Serious As zk-Rollups Come Into Play Dogecoin price is currently hovering around $0.24 , following a 1.76% dip in the last 24 hours. That‚Äôs not unusual. DOGE has been bouncing around for years now. But behind the memes, there‚Äôs an upgrade brewing that could actually matter. The DogeOS team has proposed integrating zk-rollup tech , which could let Dogecoin branch into DeFi, gaming, and even identity systems. It‚Äôs a wild leap from tipping with memes to serious blockchain infrastructure. Tim Stebbing of the Dogecoin Foundation said it best. Zk-rollups could make DOGE the ‚Äúfastest, best, most fun blockchain for all humanity.‚Äù That might be ambitious, but if it lands, DOGE price might finally have a use case to back it up. XRP Isn't Playing Small Anymore XRP just flipped the script. Not only did it recently hit a new all-time high of $3.65, but it‚Äôs now sitting on a $215 billion market cap , making it bigger than McDonald‚Äôs. The rally was driven by some serious milestones. First, Ripple finally closed its long-running SEC case in March 2025. Then came a wave of crypto-positive laws, including the CLARITY Act , that gave XRP new regulatory breathing room. The biggest kicker came when ProShares launched an XRP ETF , bringing institutional money into the mix. So while the DOGE price still teeters on meme support, XRP is building a legal and financial framework that could push it into a different league of crypto assets altogether. DeSoc Might Be the Most Underrated Crypto Asset Under $1 Now here‚Äôs the wildcard. And maybe the sleeper hit. DeSoc , currently priced at just $0.01, is a decentralized social platform that isn‚Äôt trying to reinvent social media. It‚Äôs trying to work with it. Think of it as a bridge, not a replacement. DeSoc lets users publish content on its platform while simultaneously posting it to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok through API integration. It‚Äôs content syndication built for crypto-native users. The platform doesn‚Äôt just store data on-chain. It makes it public, traceable, and shareable across platforms in a way that actually makes sense. And while others sell hype, DeSoc is locking in trust. We're talking a 30-year liquidity lock, a two-year team token freeze, and a 12-hour refund window for new buyers. No gimmicks. No referral spam. Just straight-up policy. The token has also been audited by BlockAudit, so you‚Äôre not walking blind. Why DeSoc Might Be the Smartest Play Right Now Let‚Äôs keep it real. XRP has power. DOGE price updates still swing sentiment. But DeSoc is what early crypto used to feel like. Fresh, weird, and grounded in a real idea. It‚Äôs aiming to be the first social platform that doesn‚Äôt need to fight Twitter and TikTok but actually plays nice with them. Add in the $50,000 purchase cap, 12 presale stages, and the fact that 45% of all SOCS tokens are being sold upfront, and you‚Äôve got a rare setup that doesn‚Äôt feel overly diluted or heavily VC-controlled. It‚Äôs lean, clear, and surprisingly transparent. If you‚Äôve been staring at crypto assets under $1 waiting for one that doesn‚Äôt feel like a rerun, this might be the one. The DeSoc presale is live, the pieces are already moving, and the energy around it is starting to catch. DeSoc vs XRP vs Dogecoin: Who takes the Crown? XRP has scale. Dogecoin has potential. But DeSoc ? It has momentum, clarity, and a fresh use case that doesn‚Äôt rely on hype alone. Among crypto assets under a dollar, it feels like the only one offering something different and actionable. If you‚Äôve been sitting on the fence watching the DOGE price charts, tracking token cap stats, or waiting for a cleaner entry, this could be your moment. The DeSoc presale is live, and with everything already in motion, it may just be the best under-the-radar move you make this year.

And in crypto, that usually means looking beyond the headlines, beyond the charts, and straight into what‚Äôs being built. Right now, three names are drawing attention for very different reasons: Ripple, Solana, and DeSoc. Ripple has made itself comfortable in the arms of institutions. Solana keeps racing to break its own speed records. But DeSoc? It‚Äôs taking a quieter, more deliberate route, building a creator-focused platform that actually solves real problems. And that just might make it the smartest bet for bigger returns in 2025. Ripple Price Moves Up Briefly Before Consolidating at $3.2 Ripple has done well recently. Institutions like Nature‚Äôs Miracle are now allocating treasury funds, $20 million in this case, to XRP. Chinese fintech giant Webus is planning to hold $300 million worth of XRP to streamline its cross-border operations. These moves are strengthening confidence in Ripple‚Äôs long-term utility. And sure, Ripple price action reflects that confidence. It recently hit a high of $3.66 before settling at around $3. 2 . That‚Äôs solid price action, but it‚Äôs a significant drop. The price looks to have stabilized, but it is unlikely to 5x or 10x. If you're after higher returns, this is surely not the kind of investment you are looking for. Solana Price Stable, Network Faster, but Returns Aren‚Äôt What They Used to Be On the technical side, Solana is killing it. The upcoming SIMD-0286 upgrade proposes increasing the network‚Äôs compute capacity by 66%. More compute units per block mean more transactions, better throughput, and a smoother overall experience. Solana price has been holding steady, fueled by optimism around this improvement. It‚Äôs already a favorite for DeFi, gaming, and Web3 apps that need speed and scale. The upgrade will likely make the ecosystem even more attractive for developers. Still, let‚Äôs be honest. That momentum is already priced in. Solana price may inch higher in response to the upgrade, but those massive breakout gains from the early days probably aren‚Äôt coming back. Most of the heavy lifting has been done. The remaining upside may feel more like a jog than a sprint. DeSoc: Early-Stage Utility With Real-World Use Now, take a step back and look at DeSoc . The project is still in presale, with tokens going for just $0.01. That kind of price only exists at the beginning of something, but what it‚Äôs offering isn‚Äôt just a discount. It‚Äôs a real rethink of how digital content, value, and ownership should work. DeSoc is building a decentralized content layer that connects directly to the platforms people already use (Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and X) via seamless API integration. Creators publish once, and that content automatically syndicates across networks. Meanwhile, everything is recorded on-chain, immutable, and auditable. This setup unlocks a complete monetization ecosystem. From tipping and microtransactions to gated content, subscriptions, exclusive access, and peer-to-peer payments, DeSoc allows users to earn and engage on their terms. Token holders get governance rights, creators control pricing and access, and fans can directly support the content they love. The tokenomics is also. 45% of the supply is reserved for early buyers. A two-year team token lock and a thirty-year liquidity lock send a strong message about long-term commitment. The platform has been audited by BlockAudit and carries a 12-hour refund policy to build user trust. It doesn‚Äôt rely on referral schemes or hype loops. DeSoc is clearly leaning into real utility, something Ripple and Solana can no longer claim with the same urgency. It isn‚Äôt trying to catch up to anything. It‚Äôs just building what others haven‚Äôt. Conclusion There‚Äôs nothing wrong with Ripple or Solana. Both are solid. Ripple price is likely to remain supported by institutional interest. Solana price may benefit from a more efficient network. However, if you‚Äôre aiming for higher returns in 2025, DeSoc offers what those two no longer can: early entry, uncapped potential, and a model tied to actual user behavior, rather than just protocol performance. Sometimes, being wise means being early. And this year, DeSoc looks like the project smart money won‚Äôt ignore for long. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

However, the emerging DeSoc platform could be a game-changer, especially for those looking at potential gains in 2025. Market Movements and Institutional Interest in Ripple Ripple has been a standout in the crypto community, drawing significant institutional interest. Recent investments from companies like Nature‚Äôs Miracle, which allocated $20 million to XRP, and Chinese fintech giant Webus, which plans to hold $300 million worth of XRP , underscore the growing confidence in Ripple‚Äôs utility. Solana's Technological Advancements and Market Position On the technology front, Solana continues to impress with its speed and efficiency. The anticipated SIMD-0286 upgrade is expected to enhance its capacity notably. However, while its price remains stable, the big returns seen in its early days might not be repeated. Introducing DeSoc: A New Contender for High Returns Contrasting Ripple and Solana, DeSoc is paving a new path with its unique approach to blockchain technology.

After months of prolonged selling pressure and underperformance, ETH has staged a remarkable comeback, rallying over 175% since late April. This surge marks a turning point for the second-largest cryptocurrency, as it regains momentum and investor attention. Related Reading: $4B Increase In Bitcoin Open Interest Fueled By Whale Transfers To Exchanges ‚Äì Details According to data from CryptoQuant, Ethereum Open Interest on CME Futures has now reached an all-time high‚Äîsignaling heightened institutional activity and growing market engagement. This sharp increase in derivatives exposure often precedes further volatility, hinting that traders are positioning for larger moves ahead. While the overall trend remains bullish, with on-chain and derivatives data pointing toward continued strength, some analysts warn that the market may be approaching overbought conditions. Speculation is growing around a potential correction or spike in volatility as Ethereum approaches key psychological resistance zones. Still, with ETH reclaiming leadership over Bitcoin in recent weeks and altcoins beginning to move in tandem, many view this renewed momentum as the start of a broader altcoin cycle. Ethereum Leads The Way Ethereum is gaining significant momentum, both technically and fundamentally. According to crypto analyst Maartunn, ETH Open Interest on CME Futures has reached an all-time high of $7.85 billion. This spike in interest coincides with a pivotal moment for crypto regulation in the US. The recent passage of the GENIUS Act and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act by Congress marks a turning point in legal clarity for digital assets. These legislative wins create a friendlier environment for Ethereum-based applications, particularly in DeFi, where many protocols had previously operated in legal uncertainty. With a more defined regulatory path, Ethereum stands to benefit as developers and capital increasingly move onshore. At the same time, Ethereum has shown notable strength against Bitcoin. ETH/BTC has been trending higher over the past few weeks, reinforcing the perception that ETH could lead the next leg of the market cycle. This shift is important‚Äîespecially as investors rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Accumulate Over $4.1B In ETH In Two Weeks ‚Äì Details Price Action Details Ethereum continues its bullish trend, currently trading near $3,753 after a breakout rally that began in late April. The 3-day chart reveals a significant price expansion above the key resistance level at $2,852, now acting as support. ETH is consolidating just below the $3,860 resistance, which marks the final barrier before the psychological $4,000 level‚Äîlast tested in late 2021 and again in late 2023. All major moving averages‚Äîthe 50, 100, and 200‚Äîare now trending upward and stacked in a bullish configuration. Price action is well above these levels, indicating strong market momentum. Volume has also surged during the rally, suggesting real conviction behind this move rather than speculative noise.

A retrace toward $3,500 or even a retest of the $2,850 zone would still be considered healthy in the context of a broader uptrend. That said, as long as ETH holds above $2,850, the bullish structure remains intact.

33767162,[object Object],1753619441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,The 4-Year Cycle Is Dead: Matt Hougan Breaks Down The New Crypto Era,https://bitcoinist.com/four-year-cycle-dead-matt-hougan-new-crypto-era/,"This year, the crypto market has entered uncharted territory. New structural dynamics are reshaping how investors view the space, calling into question the long-held belief in the classic four-year cycle. Historically, Bitcoin‚Äôs halving events and market boom-bust patterns have followed a predictable rhythm‚Äîbut 2025 is breaking that mold. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, believes the industry has entered a new era. In a recent analysis, he argued that the traditional four-year cycle is no longer a reliable framework for understanding crypto market behavior. According to Hougan, the two key drivers behind this shift are the weakening of the forces that created earlier cycles‚Äîsuch as the diminishing impact of halvings and blow-up risk‚Äîand second, the emergence of larger, longer-term trends that don‚Äôt align with the old pattern. From the rise of crypto ETFs to a surge in institutional adoption and regulatory progress, Hougan sees multi-year forces beginning to dominate market direction. As Wall Street capital begins flowing into digital assets, and regulatory clarity grows with legislation like the GENIUS Act, investors may need to recalibrate their expectations. Long-Term Forces Reshaping Crypto‚Äôs Market Structure According to Hougan, each halving becomes ‚Äúhalf as important‚Äù every four years, reducing its impact on market momentum. Unlike 2018 and 2022, when the interest rate environment added pressure to risk assets, today‚Äôs monetary backdrop is more favorable to crypto. Additionally, blow-up risks from unregulated players are fading as regulation improves and institutionalization advances. Hougan notes that the rise of regulated entities and better transparency has stabilized the market and removed some of the cyclical fragility. He also points to a more significant, emerging risk: the growing influence of Treasury companies that hold and move large amounts of crypto. Their potential to influence markets on a short-term basis is substantial and worth monitoring. At the same time, larger forces are now in motion. The shift of capital into crypto ETFs marks the beginning of a 5‚Äì10 year trend that started in 2024. Institutional adoption is only just beginning, with pensions and endowments starting to explore the asset class. Regulatory momentum kicked off in January 2025, and Wall Street capital is only beginning to flow following the passage of the Genius Act this month. ‚ÄúThese long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic ‚Äòfour-year cycle‚Äô forces,‚Äù Hougan said. He believes 2026 will be a strong year‚Äînot because of another hype-driven surge, but because of what he calls a ‚Äúsustained steady boom‚Äù rather than a super-cycle. While acknowledging that volatility will persist, Hougan emphasizes that crypto‚Äôs maturation is real and accelerating. Investors may need to recalibrate their strategies for this new era. Crypto Long-Term Trend Strengthens The monthly logarithmic chart of the total crypto market cap reveals a clear long-term uptrend, currently sitting around $3.82 trillion. After a prolonged consolidation phase that began in mid-2022, the market has steadily climbed and is now approaching its all-time high range near the $3.9 trillion‚Äì$4 trillion mark. This level acted as a significant resistance zone during the previous cycle and remains a key psychological barrier. From a technical perspective, the 50-month simple moving average (SMA) continues to slope upward and currently sits at $1.88 trillion, well below the current market value, reflecting strong macro support. Additionally, volume has picked up significantly in recent months‚Äîespecially during the last two green candles‚Äîindicating renewed investor confidence and institutional inflows, consistent with the narrative of growing ETF adoption and broader regulatory clarity. The market structure also shows higher lows and higher highs on the monthly timeframe, signaling that the bullish trend remains intact. As long as the crypto market cap continues to hold above $3.2 trillion and makes another monthly close above $3.8 trillion, the probability of a breakout toward uncharted territory increases significantly.

Others stick around, shape conversations, and make you wish you bought them before everyone else started tweeting about it. As 2025 continues to unfold, the question isn‚Äôt just what‚Äôs hot now, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs building, evolving, and actually offering something people can use. Here are five projects that belong on your radar and maybe in your wallet before the next cycle leaves you behind. Spoiler: one viral presale in particular might just outshine the rest. DeSoc is The Viral Presale Everyone Can‚Äôt Ignore This isn‚Äôt just another token promising the world. DeSoc is a real product: a blockchain-powered social platform where creators post once and syndicate their content everywhere, TikTok, X, Instagram, and more. Its $SOCS token (currently just $0.01) does more than sit in your wallet. It lets users tip, unlock premium content, subscribe to creators, and even vote on platform decisions through tokenized governance. However, DeSoc largely edges its peers with its unique structure. Unlike most crypto assetscompeting for user attention with referral schemes and ad spam, DeSoc is focusing on long-term trust. Team tokens are locked for a period of two years. Liquidity is locked for 30. There‚Äôs even a 12-hour refund policy for presale buyers. That‚Äôs rare in crypto, and it‚Äôs part of why the project is gaining traction. The presale isn‚Äôt just viral because of hype. It‚Äôs catching on because it solves a glaring problem: creators need better ways to monetize without relying on platforms that take most of the revenue. DeSoc addresses this issue with microtransactions, gated content, peer-to-peer payments, and a direct creator‚Äìfollower economy. This is one of the few crypto assets where users don‚Äôt have to wait years to see utility. They can engage from day one. As the Web3 social space continues to grow, DeSoc is already ahead of the curve, offering a real product, a real use case, and a presale that still gives early adopters room to grow. Ripple (XRP): Boardroom Brilliance, Retail Blind Spot XRP is having a moment with institutions. A proposed $300 million reserve plan from WebusInternational has pushed XRP‚Äôs case as a serious cross-border payment option. At around $3. 2 , it‚Äôs holding strong. But here‚Äôs the thing: it still feels like XRP is building more for CEOs than everyday users. There‚Äôs no tipping, no monetization, no creator economy play. While Ripple focuses on solving billion-dollar bank problems, crypto projects like DeSoc are giving value back to individuals, not just balance sheets. Solana Has Strong Tech, But Even Stronger Opinions Solana dropped b y about 1 % over the past 7 days, but top trader Christiaan from Bybit thinks this is just a pause. He‚Äôs predicting a run to $400, maybe $450, fueled by solid support levels and new regulatory tailwinds in the U.S. With altcoin season quietly warming up, SOL looks like it‚Äôs preparing for its next move. Solana has long been loved for its speed and developer appeal. But for retail users who want to engage, earn, or create, it still feels a little abstract. That‚Äôs where newer crypto assets like DeSoc stand out they‚Äôre already building with creators and communities in mind. Cardano Is Burning Slowly, but still Has Big Potential Cardano isn‚Äôt the flashiest token, but it‚Äôs quietly preparing for a possible breakout. Trading at around $0.81 , analysts see a path to $1.21 if it holds key support at $0.78. Some even predict a $5 run if Ethereum heats up. ADA‚Äôs strength lies in its fundamentals: energy efficiency, academic roots, and steady smart contract growth. It‚Äôs a patient player in a market that usually favors chaos. Still, as solid as it is, it hasn‚Äôt done much to empower creators or introduce fresh utility, like DeSoc offers. Avalanche (AVAX) Infrastructure Keeps Getting Better AVAX doesn‚Äôt always grab headlines, but under the surface, it‚Äôs powering serious innovation. With 6 million funded wallets and 3 million monthly users, Avalanche is becoming the foundation for AI agents, real-time apps, and decentralized systems that sound like science fiction. Youmio‚Äôs partnership with the Avalanche Foundation is a big deal; it‚Äôs enabling massive tokenization of AI agents and smart coordination at scale. AVAX is clearly thinking long-term. But for individual users looking to do more than stake and watch charts, its day-to-day relevance feels distant. That‚Äôs why crypto assets like DeSoc are getting more favour. Conclusion 2025 won‚Äôt be just about who pumps hardest. The best-performing crypto assets will likely be those that combine real-world use, fair token economics, and active communities. XRP and Solana bring power and prestige. Cardano and AVAX offer quiet strength and scale. But DeSoc? It offers purpose. Its viral presale is still ongoing, the token is cheap, and the platform already gives users something most cryptos don‚Äôt control: earning potential and visibility across multiple networks. If you‚Äôre holding four of the five already, DeSoc might be the piece that completes your 2025 portfolio. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

Ripple (XRP): The Institutional Darling Ripple, known for its swift international transaction capabilities, continues to gain momentum among financial institutions. A recent partnership involving a $300 million reserve with Webus International , underscores Ripple's growing influence. Despite its corporate affiliations, Ripple's broader adoption is still in question, lacking grassroots engagement that new platforms like DeSoc offer. DeSoc: Revolutionary Blockchain Social Media Unlike many fleeting crypto projects, DeSoc is carving a niche by integrating blockchain with social media. DeSoc allows creators to post content seamlessly across various platforms, including TikTok and Instagram, and facilitates a direct monetization channel through its $SOCS token. The token's functionality extends to tipping, accessing gated content, and participating in platform governance. In an era where user experience and control over content are paramount, DeSoc's model of decentralized content distribution stands out. The platform's foundational transparency is demonstrated by its long-term token lockup strategies and user-focused features like a 12-hour presale refund policy. The Unique Selling Proposition of DeSoc The true potential of DeSoc lies in its approach to solving the monetization issues faced by content creators. It avoids the pitfalls of ad-driven revenue models that dominate traditional social platforms, offering a more equitable ecosystem where creators reap the majority of financial benefits. Discover more about DeSoc's innovative platform here. Solana: The Speedster with a Community Focus Known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds, Solana has become a favorite among developers. However, its recent slight market dip has not dampened enthusiasm about its future, with experts like Christiaan from Bybit hinting at a potential surge in value. Solana's technological prowess needs to be matched with increased user engagement to reach its full potential. Cardano (ADA): The Slow and Steady Contender Cardano continues to build its ecosystem with a focus on sustainability and reliability. Though not as flashy as other cryptocurrencies, it maintains a strong foundation with its peer-reviewed research and scientifically approached updates. The potential for growth remains if it can capitalize on market shifts and increase its real-world applications. Avalanche (AVAX): Building the Infrastructure of Tomorrow Avalanche is quietly laying the groundwork for an expansive blockchain ecosystem. Its collaboration with Youmio highlights its commitment to integrating advanced technologies like AI into blockchain. Learn about the Avalanche and Youmio partnership here. Conclusion: A Diverse Crypto Future The landscape of 2025 will likely be shaped by cryptocurrencies that offer tangible utilities and foster strong community ties. While XRP and Solana bring technology and prestige, platforms like DeSoc provide a necessary rethinking of how blockchain can serve everyday users more directly and beneficially. Explore the potential of these leading cryptocurrencies and consider their fit in your investment strategy for a futuristic portfolio.

Despite a sharp rally followed by a fast pullback, the price of xrp is holding relatively steady, now trading in a sideways range. Analysts have said that this could be a healthy consolidation phase before the next big move. On the weekly chart, XRP is still in a long-term uptrend. it‚Äôs holding above key support levels around $2.90 to $3.00 and continuing to form higher lows and higher highs. bullish momentum remains intact, though a bearish divergence is starting to form. This divergence hasn‚Äôt been confirmed yet, but it could signal temporary weakness if it plays out. Future resistance between $4.33 and $4.72. Before that, though, xrp will need to reclaim $3.25 and push toward the $3.84 level, which is a key area in the current wave structure. On the daily chart, xrp recently lost support near $3.40 and dropped into the $2.90 range, but quickly bounced back. that shows buyers are stepping in to defend this zone. Now, $3.30‚Äì$3.40 has turned into short-term resistance. If bulls can reclaim that range, it would signal a possible trend reversal and open the door to higher prices. Technically, the price is still moving inside a corrective pattern. There‚Äôs a chance the market is seeing an ABC correction, where wave C could dip lower before the next wave up begins. As long as the price stays above $2.75, the bullish structure remains intact. If XRP falls below $2.75 or worse, the critical level at $2.65, then the bullish case would weaken, shifting the market toward a deeper correction. But so far, the market seems stable. If XRP can break above $3.25 in the coming days, it could spark a fresh rally toward the $3.80‚Äì$4.30 range. If not, more sideways action or one last dip might be ahead.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-27 12:40:08

As institutional buyers eye the asset for long-term accumulation, others are already looking ahead, and are scanning the market for the next 100x crypto or the best crypto to buy in 2025 to jump into. At the same time, XRP is trying to claw back attention after being outshined by Ethereum and other new altcoin projects. But as these two legacy tokens battle for dominance, one new DeFi project is quietly attracting real attention from both crypto whales and regular buyers. Ethereum ETF Momentum Puts ETH Back on Top Ethereum‚Äôs bounce above $3,500 last week marked one of its strongest performances in months. The surge was triggered largely by new filings from BlackRock and Fidelity related to Ethereum ETFs, pushing up sentiment. Volume on decentralized exchanges and Layer 2 platforms also climbed sharply, showing increased real-world use. Analysts have noticed that Ethereum price is setting up for a bullish move to take out the recent high in the $4,100 area. Experts say that a break of the $4,100 top on a weekly basis will yield an eventual retest of the All-time high in the $5,000 area. XRP Price Struggles Amid Legal Cloud and Slowing Momentum XRP had a strong June, but momentum has cooled. Despite Judge Torres reaffirming parts of the 2023 ruling in Ripple‚Äôs favor, the ongoing SEC battle and delays in institutional partnerships have created fatigue among investors. The XRP price hovers just below $3.20. Crypto expert Ali Charts has observed that XRP whales have bought the dip , and have scooped up over 130 million XRP in just 24 hours. This is usually a sign of an impending bullish reversal.

BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA led with $440 million in daily inflows, making it the second-highest flowing US ETF this week. Source: SosoValue The sustained institutional demand has generated $9.33 billion in cumulative inflows, with weekly net inflows reaching $1.8 billion compared to just $71 million for Bitcoin ETFs. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan projects that ETH ETF demand could reach $20 billion within the next year, equivalent to approximately 5.33 million ETH at current prices. With Ethereum expected to issue only 0.8 million ETH during that timeframe, demand could outpace supply nearly sevenfold. Technical analysis indicates that Ethereum is approaching a diamond pattern resolution around $2,832. Seasonal data show that August historically delivers 64.2% returns during post-halving years, positioning ETH for potential acceleration toward $4,000-$6,000 targets. Diamond Pattern Resolution Targets $4,000 Breakout Ethereum‚Äôs 3-day chart reveals a massive diamond formation approaching resolution around $2,832, with the pattern reaching its apex where decisive breakouts typically occur. Source: LordOfAlts on X The diamond represents one of the most powerful reversal patterns, characterized by expanding volatility followed by contracting volatility. ETH has reached successive highs around $4,000 and lows around $1,400, creating the classic diamond shape. The ascending trendline provides crucial support through multiple tests, with the recent breakout above this support suggesting renewed bullish momentum. Diamond patterns developing over extended periods typically lead to proportionally larger moves when finally resolved toward the upper boundary. Analyst projections of over $ 4,000 resulted from measured moves following successful upward resolution, targeting previous cycle resistance levels where significant institutional positioning awaits confirmation. Ethereum Price Prediction: Seasonal Strength Points to $6,000 August Target The monthly returns heatmap provides crucial seasonal context, supporting bullish prospects for August. Source: Crypto Rover on X Historical data shows August typically delivers exceptional returns for Ethereum, averaging 64.2% during post-halving years. The pattern consistently reveals strong performance, with gains of 35.62% in 2021, 25.32% in 2020, and 92.86% in 2017. Current July performance shows 50.79% for 2025, suggesting momentum is building for the traditional August rally. If historical patterns hold true from current levels around $2,800, the 64.2% average August return would project the Ethereum price toward the $6,000 target range during its strongest seasonal month. Additionally, CME futures open interest, which has reached record levels of $7.85 billion, provides further institutional validation. Whales are loading $ETH like never before.

Best Wallet: Final Months to Join $14.2M Presale Before December Deadline Ethereum‚Äôs potential supply shock from sustained ETF inflows and a breakout toward $4,000-$6,000 targets creates a compelling opportunity for alternative tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem. Best Wallet‚Äôs $BEST token presale has raised over $14.2 million, with the December 31, 2025, deadline rapidly approaching. This closing deadline offers investors the final months to secure positions before the window closes permanently.

Best Wallet‚Äôs comprehensive platform provides secure multi-chain functionality with institutional-grade Fireblocks MPC integration alongside built-in DEX capabilities for optimal ETH positioning. The upcoming Best Card integration enables spending gains with up to 8% cashback during potential rally phases toward seasonal targets. With Ethereum potentially facing upside moves of 43-114% during August and sustained ETF demand creating supply constraints, the approaching December deadline creates a final opportunity window for investors seeking to capitalize on the next ETH rally. $BEST will capitalize greatly on this momentum, and interested investors are advised to check the presale website and secure their position now.

The official complaint, which was filed by the man on July 26, claimed that digital assets worth ‚Ç¨381,653 were stolen from his wallet. The complaint filed at the cybercrime division of the Cyprus police noted that the incident happened on June 11. The man claimed that unknown criminals gained unauthorized entry into his wallet, stealing his digital assets in the process. The hackers exploited a key weakness, gaining the password to the breached wallet from his email account, which had also been hacked in the past. Once they gained access to the digital assets , they moved all of them to a different digital asset. Cyprus police kickstart investigations into crypto theft Cyprus police have mentioned that the investigation will be very hard, and recovering the digital assets might be extremely difficult. The police say this case highlights a growing concern that has rocked Cyprus and the global crypto community. There has been a rise in cyberattacks targeting personal digital assets. These criminals target victims under the guise of either offering help or selling a service. Analysts have also noted that while digital assets offer privacy and decentralization, they also carry risks without proper security. For instance, users are being advised to write down their passwords and seed phrases offline. This way, they are safe, even when their devices are hacked. In response to the incident, the Cyprus police have issued a public advisory to individuals dealing in digital assets, urging them to take steps to secure their digital properties. Authorities have also recommended the use of secure digital wallets with advanced safety measures to help combat this menace. In addition, traders and enthusiasts are urged to only carry out transactions on trusted platforms, drumming up the need for two-factor authentication as a requirement to carry out transactions on platforms. The public has also been warned not to open suspicious links or download untrustworthy applications. Some of these scammers create applications and websites to mirror the original platforms. The cybercrime division of the Cyprus police says it will continue to investigate the case and has urged anyone with information that can help them to come forward. Fraudsters increase activities as total scam losses hit $2.1 billion Meanwhile, scammers and fraudsters are now taking advantage of the recent crypto activities to increase their attacks. Losses to crypto scams hit a new record of $2.1 billion in the first half of 2025, eclipsing the previous record of $2 billion set in 2022, and almost equaling the entire losses witnessed in 2024. In a statement by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, scammers have now resorted to impersonating the official YouTube account of Ripple in an attempt to con users. This is not the first time that the issue has happened to Ripple, as the crypto firm sued YouTube over impersonators in April 2021. The company sought damages from the video-sharing platform, accusing it of profiting from the activities of these scammers. However, Ripple dropped the lawsuit in March 2021, claiming that it had come to a peaceful resolution with YouTube and that the pair had agreed to combat scams together. Ripple isn‚Äôt the only firm being targeted by impersonators, as the criminals have continued to work overtime to steal from unsuspecting users. A recent post by security firm Scam Sniffer mentioned that it had found direct Google searches related to crypto firms showed scam ads at the top of the results. ‚ÄúPro tip for DeFi users: Stop using Google search for crypto sites unless you enjoy playing Russian roulette with your wallet!‚Äù Scam Sniffer said.

However, it recovered over the weekend, steadily climbing as price action remained muted. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $118,115. OG Bitcoin Holders ‚ÄúFaith Shaken‚Äù A crypto analyst has sparked a debate in the Bitcoin and crypto communities, claiming Bitcoin OGs are losing faith in the asset as it sees increasing institutional adoption. Scott Melker, also known as the Wolf of All Street, stated in a post on X, ‚ÄúMany of the most ardent early whales have seen their faith shaken and have been selling at these prices. Bitcoin is amazing, but it‚Äôs obviously been co-opted to some degree by the very people that it was created as a hedge against.‚Äù Melker pointed out that he is only highlighting what he has been hearing. However, the comments triggered a wave of reactions from the Bitcoin community regarding the asset‚Äôs institutional adoption and its implications for its original ethos. Alpine Fox founder and managing partner Mike Alfred disagreed with Melker, stating, ‚ÄúPeople make a personal decision to sell some or all of their coins for a myriad of reasons that have nothing to do with the asset or protocol. Everyone dies. At some point, investment returns become irrelevant.‚Äù One early adopter revealed that he sold his Bitcoin because he believes investing in Bitcoin infrastructure would give better returns. Bitcoiner Dave Weisberger stated that widespread Bitcoin adoption is impossible without institutional interest. ‚ÄúThe irony is that there is NO path to a Bitcoin standard without adoption by the public through the legacy institutions controlling the fiat system AND the distribution of OG held Bitcoin to those entities.‚Äù Bitcoin Could See Significant Upside In 2026 Bitcoin (BTC) could see substantial upside in 2026, potentially marking the end of its four-year market cycle, according to Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. The prediction comes amid sharp disagreements among analysts about whether Bitcoin will change its historical pattern or follow the traditional halving cycle. Hougan stated, ‚ÄúI bet 2026 is an up year. I broadly think we‚Äôre in for a good few years.‚Äù Hougan added that Bitcoin‚Äôs four-year halving cycle is ‚Äúdead‚Äù due to several reasons, including the Bitcoin halving becoming ‚Äúhalf as important‚Äù every four years. President Donald Trump has also been pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, a bullish catalyst for the cryptocurrency. He also noted that the chances of a significant pullback have decreased due to increased regulatory clarity. ‚ÄúBlow-up risk is attenuated, due to improving regulation and the institutionalization of the space. The long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic ""four-year cycle"" forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year.‚Äù Hougan stated that the most significant ‚Äúcyclical-style risk‚Äù for Bitcoin is the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has traded in positive territory over the weekend, posting marginal gains as it briefly crossed $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has faced substantial selling pressure in recent sessions. BTC has struggled to reclaim $120,000 but has held above $115,000, indicating that buyers have not ceded ground. Analysts believe BTC‚Äôs bullish structure remains intact, but price action will likely be steady rather than aggressive jumps. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs more sustained, steady boom than super-cycle. I could be wrong, and I'm certain there will be significant volatility.‚Äù The forecast comes days after CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that he believes the Bitcoin four-year cycle is dead. Ju stated, ‚ÄúMy predictions were based on it ‚Äî buy when whales accumulate, sell when retail joins. But that pattern no longer holds. Last cycle, whales were sold to retail. This time, old whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we thought.‚Äù BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday after facing substantial volatility and selling pressure. As a result, it fell to a low of $116,805 before settling at $117,877, ultimately registering a 1.03% decrease. Sellers retained control over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal drop on Saturday before falling 0.48% on Sunday to settle at $117,240, but not before dropping to a low of $116,240. BTC started the week in positive territory, reaching an intraday high of $119,603. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,402, registering a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,982. Source: TradingView Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, dropping 0.99% to a low of $117,321, before settling at $118,794. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price fell 0.35% to $118,381. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC plunged to an intraday low of $114,779. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $117,000 and settle at $117,565, ultimately registering a decline of 0.69%. The price recovered on Saturday, rising 0.24%. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Community Financial Services Bank, Mechanics Bank and RABO AgriFinance are accused of knowingly or negligently enabling a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Kentucky farmer and businessman Brian McClain, reports WPSD Local 6. McClain is accused of stealing millions of dollars from investors in Graves County by masterminding a fictitious cattle investment scheme. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Mark Bryant, says McClain promised high guaranteed returns on a cattle business, with investors losing an enormous amount of money. ‚ÄúIn reality, the complaint states, the promised cattle never existed, and the returns that were paid were paid using new investor funds in classic Ponzi fashion.‚Äù The lawsuit alleges that lax oversight and fraudulent transfers by the three banks helped sustain McClain‚Äôs Ponzi scheme for years. The three banks ‚Äúallegedly turned a blind eye to hundreds of millions of dollars in irregular and suspicious transactions‚Äù initiated by McClain and his supposed cattle business. RABO AgriFinance reportedly gave McClain over $70 million in credit even though the lender had concerns over the businessman‚Äôs actual cattle ownership and poor keeping of records. Community Financial Services Bank reportedly allowed McClain to obtain more than 100 days of overdraft period and failed to act despite evidence of suspicious fund transfers. The bank was also aware of McClain‚Äôs financial position prior to the alleged Ponzi scheme but took no action even after the state of his finances changed drastically, according to the report. Mechanics Bank also allegedly allowed McClain overdrafts. McClain committed suicide in April of 2023 and the alleged Ponzi scheme was uncovered soon after his death. The class action lawsuit against the three banks is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ‚Äôs price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market‚Äôs effects plummeted the coin‚Äôs price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, ‚ÄúCan the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?‚Äù or at least, ‚ÄúWill Tezos survive?‚Äù Let‚Äôs get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.8822 Market cap $928.51M Trading volume (24-hour) $39.31M Circulating supply 1.05B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.9129 24-hour low $0.8782 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 25.96% 50-day SMA $0.6348 14-Day RSI 70.03 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green days 20/30 (67%) 200-day SMA $0.6384 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is down 1.06%. XTZ is consolidating between $0.88-$0.89 with declining volume. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ faces rejection and enters correction zone The Tezos/USDT 1-day price chart for July 27 shows a significant bearish reversal from its recent rally after facing rejection around $1.2. The coin remains above the middle Bollinger band in the meantime, and could end up testing the critical support zone near $0.7685. The MACD histogram is green, but it indicates declining buyer interest. A break below the $0.8 level could instigate a full-blown bear market. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: The 4-hour chart displays XTZ consolidating within a narrow range between $0.8800-$0.89, with the 20-day SMA at $0.8917 acting as immediate resistance. Price action shows small-bodied candles with minimal wicks, indicating balanced buying and selling pressure at these levels. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The Balance of Power indicator at -0.58 suggests sellers maintain control, but the negative reading is moderating, which could signal weakening bearish momentum. Volume has declined significantly to 4.85M from the elevated levels seen during the sharp correction, indicating reduced market participation.

Tezos is consolidating around $0.8850 after rejecting the $1.1077 resistance level. A breakdown below $0.8800 would target the $0.7 price level, while any recovery must overcome the $0.8917 resistance. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin‚Äôs price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August.

It disclosed that it has entered a Common Stock Purchase Agreement for an equity line of credit (ELOC) of up to $500 million, alongside a separate $20 million stock purchase agreement with Build and Build Corp. Windtree Advances BNB Treasury Plan According to the press release shared by the company, 99% of proceeds from both agreements are earmarked for acquiring BNB. This is part of Windtree‚Äôs strategy to diversify its treasury with blockchain-based assets. The ELOC cannot be accessed until stockholder approval is secured to increase the company‚Äôs authorized common shares. More public companies are adding digital assets to their treasury mix, a trend evident in this move. Windtree‚Äôs shift toward BNB accumulation comes as it continues efforts to broaden its business model while seeking alternative methods to stabilize and strengthen its financial position. In a statement, Windtree CEO Jed Latkin said, ‚ÄúWe are excited to incorporate these new facilities to enable our future BNB acquisitions as part of our BNB treasury strategy. Pending stockholder approval, the opportunity to secure additional funds for purchasing more BNB cryptocurrency is essential to our strategy.‚Äù The Nasdaq-listed firm had entered into a strategic partnership with crypto exchange Kraken to oversee its BNB-focused crypto treasury program. As part of the deal, Kraken will handle Windtree‚Äôs BNB assets through secure custody services while managing trading activities and over-the-counter transactions for the company‚Äôs crypto holdings. Treasuries Move Beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum Crypto treasury plays are all the rage as firms look to diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Chinese chip maker Nano Labs, for instance, announced plans to accumulate as much as $1‚ÄØbillion in BNB, starting with a $50‚ÄØmillion purchase. The company‚Äôs push into BNB reflects rising institutional confidence in altcoins within treasury strategies. Meanwhile, BNB hit a fresh all-time high of approximately $808 earlier this week.

This amount, currently valued at approximately $3.43 billion, corresponds to 0.76% of the total ETH supply. According to Grogan, these losses stem from irreversible transactions and inaccessible wallets. Furthermore, when we include the 5.3 million ETH (approximately $20 billion) burned under EIP-1559, an update to Ethereum's fee mechanism, more than 5% of the entire Ethereum supply has been permanently removed from circulation. Grogan noted that this loss only covers ETH that is verifiable and technically ‚Äúlocked forever,‚Äù not lost private keys or forgotten wallets.

According to reports, the noise from the mining operation located at Mackinac Trail, seven miles south of Sault Ste. Marie is a high-pitched, metallic noise that sounds like a chorus of mechanical insects. According to the Canadian elementary school‚Äôs Superintendent Susie Schlehuber, the noise initially registered at 75 decibels, roughly the volume of a running vacuum cleaner, at the edge of the school‚Äôs property on the other side of the road earlier this year. She mentioned that at the school‚Äôs front door, it was about 65 decibels, the same as a washing machine. However, the annoying high-pitched metallic whine began in March. Canadian elementary school initiates legal action against crypto miner According to the lawsuit filed by the school, the noise was somewhat dampened by the addition of hay bales to the site, and aside from a court order to pause the operations for two weeks, the noise hasn‚Äôt stopped. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It never stops,‚Äù said Schlehuber . She added that she founded the school because of an environmental focus, meaning that students always spend time outside their classrooms. Schlehuber added that the noise was noticeable because of that practice. ‚ÄúBecause of that, we noticed the noise even more so than if we were just a school that stayed inside the classroom with the doors closed,‚Äù she said. The superintendent claims they had to stop conducting lessons on the front lawn, stop opening the windows, and halt plans to build two new classrooms. The crypto mining operation in question is a six self-contained bank of machines owned by a Boca Raton, Florida, company called Odessa Partners LLC. According to filings from the company‚Äôs attorneys, the company is made up of two other business entities, Wyoming Partners Irrevocably Statutory Trust, which is registered at an address in Cheyenne, and Valletta Corp, LLC, which is registered in Delaware. Both of these firms are linked to a Florida native named Michael Carbonara. Carbonara is the CEO of Ibanera, a company that provides a fintech enablement and cross-border payments network, according to its website. Carbonara also applied for the building permit for the mining operation. Carbonara and Odessa Partners are yet to respond to the lawsuit. The last time both entities made any form of communication was after Chippewa Country Circuit Judge James Lambros ordered the operation to stop temporarily last month. Odessa Partners submitted a legal finding claiming its losses per day were about $15,000, and it was already taking steps to reduce the noise, noting the placement of hay bales in front of the machines. The motion also noted that the school property is located alongside Interstate 75, arguing that ‚Äúthe noise Plaintiff claims to be emanating from Defendant‚Äôs property is purportedly less than that typically generated by the use and activity occurring on the other side of Plaintiff‚Äôs property.‚Äù However, Schlehuber countered the claim, saying, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge difference between a loud truck going by a few times a day and constant noise.‚Äù She also claimed she had been trying to work with Odessa Partners regarding the issue since March and hadn‚Äôt seen any progress towards a solution. ‚ÄúWe knew we had to do something else besides just talk to them,‚Äù she said. According to the CEO of OOM Technologies, which operates a computer hosting facility not too far from where Odessa Partners‚Äô operation is located, that location is suitable for miners due to the abundance of resources. Shaw also added that the cold is part of the reasons, noting that ‚Äúthe most efficient way to cool the stuff is through the natural airflow.‚Äù KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|BTC|CAD,EN,0,0,MINING|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-27 13:59:44

But those massive green candles‚Äîspikes traders chase‚Äîcould become a thing of the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs New Clock: How Wall Street Killed The Old Cycle, According To Expert According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the era of sudden jolts up or down may be ending. He says that spot ETFs and big companies piling in will smooth out those drawdowns. Spot ETF Approval Era Balchunas pointed out that IBIT just passed $100 billion in assets under management. Based on his view, that landmark tells you everything. Bitcoin traded between $116,000 and $120,000 after Galaxy Digital sold 80,000 coins. No panic sell‚Äëoff followed. Before ETFs, a sale like that could send prices tumbling by double‚Äëdigit percentages. Now, deep corrections look less likely. This guy gets it. We‚Äôve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more‚Ä¶ https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO ‚Äî Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 In‚Äëand‚Äëout profit‚Äëhunters once drove Bitcoin up or down by 20% or more in a day. But steady inflows from regulated products lure in large investors. Balchunas argues that fewer wild swings will make crypto more useful for buying coffee or paying bills. He believes this shift will help Bitcoin behave more like a real currency and not just a roller‚Äëcoaster asset. Institutional Steady Hands Based on reports from Citigroup, every $1 billion of ETF inflows can lift Bitcoin by about 3.6%. Using that math, Citi sees Bitcoin hitting $199,000 before December 31. That forecast depends on steady money flowing in. Big funds make big bets. And those bets tend to stick around longer than retail traders chasing quick gains. Citigroup notes that BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $100 billion. That matters because it shows how hungry big players are for crypto. If those trends keep up, Bitcoin could push past its current trading band. It may even test new highs without the classic ‚ÄúGod candle‚Äù leaps that gave quick fortunes‚Äîand quick losses. Volatility Trade‚ÄëOffs Meanwhile, some analysts warn that early Bitcoin whales are taking profits and stepping aside. As institutions arrive, some old‚Äëschool traders will leave. That could shift volume to less regulated spots or exotic derivatives markets. In a calmer main market, risks may hide in side channels.

Overall, Bitcoin seems to be entering a new phase. Based on Balchunas‚Äôs take, those ‚ÄúGod candles‚Äù won‚Äôt vanish overnight‚Äîbut they‚Äôll be rare.

Notably, analysis by Ted Pillows projects a major upward move for Bitcoin, suggesting the digital asset could mirror gold‚Äôs historical breakout pattern. If the analogy holds, BTC may trade above $160,000 by Q4, he said in an X post on July 26. The comparison draws on analysis of gold and Bitcoin‚Äôs market behavior, identifying phases of accumulation, distribution, and re-accumulation before each asset entered a strong rally. Gold and Bitcoin price analysis. Source: Ted Pillows Notably, gold‚Äôs rally, from under $2,000 to over $3,300, followed a prolonged re-accumulation phase. According to Pillows, Bitcoin appears to be nearing the end of a similar structure. The analyst suggested Bitcoin‚Äôs market cycle is currently transitioning from re-accumulation to a rally phase. This final leg could significantly push the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price higher, potentially exceeding $160,000 before year-end. It‚Äôs worth noting that in 2025, gold has delivered a standout performance as investors turned to the precious metal for its safe-haven appeal amid growing concerns over a potential economic downturn. There is indeed potential for Bitcoin to reach these levels, especially as some analysts argue that holding key technical indicators will be crucial to its success. For instance, as reported by Finbold, crypto trading expert Ali Martinez noted that as long as Bitcoin holds above the $110,000 spot level, there is room to reach a new all-time high at $130,000. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was valued at $118,216, posting modest gains of less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours. Over the last seven days, however, BTC is down 0.45%.

The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 60.43, indicating that the market is approaching overbought conditions but has not yet reached them.

According to an analyst, two tokens are quietly preparing for a surge, and they might just be early gems in the next DeFi wave. Aerodrome (Base Chain): Undervalued and Generating Serious Fees The first project turning heads is Aerodrome, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on Base, Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 network. While it‚Äôs not the biggest in terms of total value locked (TVL), Aerodrome is leading the Base ecosystem in fees and revenue. TVL on Base has been rising rapidly, and stablecoin usage is trending upward. Among all Base protocols, Aerodrome dominates in revenue, far outpacing its peers like Morpho and Spark. The Aerodrome token has been trading in a sideways channel since March, and this could be a prime accumulation zone. If prices dip toward the bottom of the range, it may offer a strong buying opportunity, especially if Bitcoin holds firm BlackHole (Avalanche): The Breakout Newcomer Next up is BlackHole, a brand-new DeFi token on Avalanche that‚Äôs catching fire. With $200 million+ in TVL and skyrocketing fees, it‚Äôs already out-earning top Avalanche protocols. What makes BlackHole unique is its bridge infrastructure, enabling users to move tokens like PEPE between chains seamlessly. With growing rumors of Avalanche partnering with institutions, this infrastructure could become a critical piece of future adoption.

In a new CNBC interview, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, says investors are skeptical about the sustainability of stock market rallies after equities rebounded in a massive way from the April lows. Rather than a pullback, Harvey expects the stock market to consolidate as he sees the Fed cutting rates in the coming months. ‚ÄúA lot of people are looking for a pullback. They are talking about things being overextended. They‚Äôre talking about uncertainty with the Fed, and earnings and lions, tigers and bears, oh no. I don‚Äôt know what the short term holds. I think we could see a consolidation. It‚Äôs really unclear for me, but the underlying fundamentals: still strong. We do think the Fed will certainly have to be dovish in the next couple of months, and what we also think is that rates are going to rally because the deficit, in all likelihood, while not going to be good, will probably be better than expected based on some of the tariff news that we‚Äôre getting.‚Äù Looking at the tech sector, Harvey warns that a string of good news could hurt the AI trade. He notes that a more favorable macroeconomic landscape could stimulate risk-taking behavior and encourage investors in AI stocks to seek higher gains in other sectors. ‚ÄúOne thing I think that could potentially hurt the AI trade is if you do get the Fed cutting, if growth is better than expected, if rates do come down, suddenly the contrarian trade starts to look better, and you could see rotation. And I think that‚Äôs the biggest fear for AI right now.‚Äù Popular AI names include Nvidia, AMD, Palantir, Microsoft, Meta and Google.

The latest funding round will keep Anthropic on par with bigger industry players like OpenAI in an industry where the competition for development and demand is stiff. Anthropic is eyeing a $150 billion valuation The artificial intelligence startup, Anthropic , is in early discussions to raise fresh funding that would more than double its valuation to over $150 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The potential valuation hike from its current $61.5 billion would mark a significant milestone for the four-year-old company‚Äôs goal of keeping pace with rivals like OpenAI and xAI in the generative AI industry. The company has attracted early interest from investors who are reportedly willing to back the company at this inflated valuation. The Financial Times reported that Anthropic aims to raise at least $3 billion, with the final amount potentially reaching up to $5 billion. Among the interested parties is MGX, Abu Dhabi‚Äôs large-scale AI investment fund. Anthropic has held preliminary talks with several Middle Eastern investors, according to two sources. This follows a prior deal where another Abu Dhabi fund, linked to MGX, bought nearly $500 million worth of shares from the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. In an internal memo first reported by Wired, CEO Dario Amodei raised ethical concerns about taking money from entities linked to authoritarian regimes. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, I think ‚Äòno bad person should ever benefit from our success‚Äô is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on,‚Äù Amodei reportedly wrote. Anthropic has previously avoided direct fundraising from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, but its recent talks signal a potential shift in strategy. Anthropic is right behind OpenAI in AI talent and revenue Anthropic is among the top contenders in the generative AI industry to develop cutting-edge AI models capable of generating text, code, and images. It competes closely with OpenAI , Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI, and Big Tech giants such as Google and Meta. While OpenAI currently leads in consumer adoption, with over 500 million weekly users on its ChatGPT platform, the Claude chatbot has been making waves, especially in enterprise applications like code generation. Backed by tech industry leaders like Amazon and Google, Anthropic has seen its annualized recurring revenue grow rapidly from $1 billion at the start of 2025 to over $4 billion. The majority of this revenue, roughly 80% of it, comes from enterprise subscriptions. Amazon, which has already pledged up to $8 billion in investment, is reportedly in talks to increase its stake further. The move would help Amazon maintain a significant share as the AI startup scales. Despite strong revenue growth, neither Anthropic nor OpenAI is profitable. The companies burn through massive amounts of capital to train and run their large language models, much of which is spent on computing power and talent acquisition. Meanwhile, OpenAI is preparing to release GPT-5, which will be its most advanced model to date, in coming weeks. The company is also in the middle of raising tens of billions of dollars, with SoftBank leading the investment effort. MGX, the Abu Dhabi-based fund reportedly in talks with Anthropic, already has ties with OpenAI, including co-investment in the ‚Äú Stargate ‚Äù data center project. Get seen where it counts.

It was founded and is operational since all the way back in 2017, making it one of the longest-standing crypto swap platforms on the market. It serves over 5 million clients globally through its non-custodial approach, which means that it doesn‚Äôt custody customer funds. It supports more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies and over 70 fiat currencies, spanning across over 110 blockchains. This includes, of course, the major ones such as Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. New coins and tokens are also added weekly to expand the availability. ChangeNOW is processing transactions very quickly with more than 98% of the swaps being completed at rates better than estimated or within a 0.5% deviation. Most of the swaps are also handled within less than 2 minutes, with 50% of users receiving better returns than initially projected. Users can also access services through the website, through a Telegram bot, or through the mobile application. It‚Äôs important to note that account-free doesn‚Äôt mean KYC-free and even though the percentage of KYC‚Äôd transactions is low, it‚Äôs still present. The platform offers 24/7 customer support and a high rating on Trustpilot. Key Highlights: Non-custodial platform with 1,500+ digital assets across 110+ blockchains. Account-free service with minimal KYC requirements. Global availability (70+ fiat currency support). 24/7 customer support. Advanced Pro version with cashback and reduced fees. Mobile apps and Telegram accessibility. Changelly ‚Äì Best for Users Seeking Consistent Flat Rates The history of Changelly is interesting. It was founded by the team behind MinerGate in 2013 but it was established independently in 2016. The platform serves over 2 million users, according to some estimates that I found, and maintains a clean track record with no reported hacks or fraud incidents. Changelly operates as an intermediary service, facilitating swaps between different digital assets at competitive rates. The platform requires very little personal information ‚Äì mostly an email address for two-factor authentication and account recovery. It supports over 100 different altcoins for trading. On the flipside, some users point out the inconsistent fee structure as a source of confusion. The fees for fiat trading are much less transparent compared to crypto-to-crypto swaps. Key Highlights: No history of security breaches with transparent operations. Most exchanges are completed within 30 minutes, except Bitcoin, which may take longer. 0.5% fees per trade for crypto-to-crypto swaps. 24/7 customer assistance available. SimpleSwap ‚Äì Best for Accessing Optimal Rates through Aggregated liquidity SimpleSwap introduces a cryptocurrency aggregator platform launched in 2018. It facilitates digital asset trading, and users don‚Äôt have to worry about creating an account of going through a KYC verification process. The platform connects users to liquidity from multiple exchanges, rather than operating as a traditional exchange. It supports over 1,500 popular cryptocurrencies and operates through a process where users select trading pairs, enter the recipient‚Äôs wallet, and execute swaps. Transactions require on-chain confirmation, which is typically completed within mere minutes. SimpleSwap sources the assets from external exchanges to provide users with the most optimal trading routes. The service also includes a web interface and a mobile application supported by both iOS and Android. Users are able to buy crypto using Visa and Mastercard in supported fiat currencies such as USD, GBT, EUR, RUB, TL, and UAH. SimpleSwap also offers crypto-to-fiat swaps for select cryptocurrencies, including ETH, BTC, and others. In terms of customer support, the platform provides 24/7 assistance through a live chat, email, and various social media channels. It includes a few features that can be very helpful such as price alerts, order history tracking, an API for developers, and more. Key Highlights: Non-custodial platform with more than 1,500 supported cryptocurrencies. Aggregates liquidity from multiple sources. Offers both web and mobile interfaces. Supports fiat-to-crypto purchases. The fee structure combines exchange and network fees. The main drawback is that the fee structure, as mentioned above, combines exchange and network fees but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a transparent disclosure of specific percentage rates that are being charged. EasyBit ‚Äì Best for large-volume traders needing volatility protection EasyBit is another crypto-to-crypto swap platform that was founded in 2018, but the interesting thing is that it operates exclusively in the cryptocurrency trading space. The platform was developed by experts in algorithmic trading and system development, and it is supposedly using a technology stack that‚Äôs typically found in hedge funds. The platform provides support for 42 cryptocurrencies and focuses on delivering optimized exchange paths through market analysis and systems for order execution. One of the more interesting features is the Volatility Protection Mode (VPM). It combines floating and fixed rates for the biggest advantage. The way it works is through floating rates in general, but then it also automatically cancels transactions and refunds users if the rates drop below a customizable percentage during execution. This system is designed to prevent losses from market volatility during transaction processing. EasyBit charges a flat trading fee of 0.2% for both makers and takers. There is also a VIP program with 10 levels of discounts based on trading volumes. It also has a KYC system that triggers when it detects suspicious patterns or risk scores that exceed the predetermined benchmarks. Key Highlights: Crypto-to-crypto exchange that supports 42 cryptocurrencies. Volatility Protection Mode for enhanced hedging during periods of extreme volatility. Flat 0.2% trading fees for all users and a VIP program for further discounts. KYC system triggers on risk assessment, takes 5 minutes to process. API integration is available with certain customizable fee structures. SwapSpace ‚Äì Best for comparing rates across multiple exchanges SwapSpace enables instant exchanges of over 300 cryptocurrencies without the need for registering an account or additional KYC verification. The platform has partnered with established exchange (even with some from this list such as ChangeNOW and Changelly) to aggregate rate data and provide users with optimal pricing options for their cryptocurrency swaps. It operates as an information intermediary, which means that it compares rates from multiple partner exchanges and displays them for the user to select. SwapSpace offers both floating and fixed rate options, with the prices locked until transaction completion and blockchain confirmation. It‚Äôs worth noting that it‚Äôs not the fastest option out there, with transactions usually taking between 15 and 20 minutes for popular cryptocurrencies. Still, this is on the quicker end of the spectrum. SwapSpace maintains a non-custodial design, which means that user funds are not stored on the platform. It doesn‚Äôt require access to private keys or any sort of personal information. Key Highlights: Aggregates rates from multiple partner exchanges. Non-custodial platform with no account registration or KYC verification. Swaps are processed within 15 to 20 minutes on average. US Residents and users from eight other jurisdictions are not allowed. Crypto Swap Platforms vs. Crypto Exchanges Crypto swap platforms are websites that are specialized and designed specifically for direct cryptocurrency exchanges without intermediate fiat currency conversions. These services are usually focused on peer-to-peer or automated market maker transactions that simply convert one digital asset directly into another. The primary difference from traditional cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, for example, lies in the overall operational complexity and user experience. Exchanges tend to require account creation, identity verification, and order book management, where users can place buy and sell orders that may or may not execute immediately depending on different factors such as market depth and liquidity. Crypto swap platforms, on the other hand, offer instant conversions at predetermined rates without having to wait for order matching. Allow me to expand on the above. Traditional exchanges operate on order book models where traders can submit bid and asks (buys and sells), creating market depth through competing orders. This system can introduce delays because orders await matching with suitable counterparts. Now, if you trade on a liquid exchange with a deep order book, this matching might take less than a second, but that‚Äôs not always the case. Crypto swap platforms, on the other hand, use automated market makers or simply pre-negotiated rates, executing transactions almost immediately upon user confirmation. Another important difference involves the custody of the assets. Exchanges (more often than not, and always if it‚Äôs a centralized exchange) require users to deposit funds into platform-controlled wallets before trading, which introduces more steps and important security considerations. Recall what happened to FTX. Many crypto swap platforms, on the other hand, operate non-custodially, which means that you don‚Äôt have to deposit funds into a separate platform-controlled wallet. Why are Crypto Swapping Platforms so Popular? The surge in their popularity most likely stems from multiple converging factors that generally address fundamental user needs in the crypto ecosystem. Speed undoubtedly represents the most compelling advantage, with leading crypto swap platforms executing transactions in mere minutes, without having to go through lengthy onboarding procedures. Privacy considerations can also influence platform choice for many users. A lot of the swap platforms operate without mandatory identity verification, but that‚Äôs not always the case. The cross-chain functionality, however, is the most compelling argument. With a crypto swap platform, you can use your USDT to get, let‚Äôs say, BNB on the BNB Chain. Alternatively, you can obtain ETH on Ethereum or Arbitrum. There are almost no limitations due to the advanced nature of these platforms. How to Choose the Best Crypto Swap Platform? I would recommend identifying the features that you need and then selecting a platform that fits your needs. For example, if I need to participate in some crazy new DeFi mania happening on the BNB Chain, but I don‚Äôt have funds there, I would look for a crypto swap platform that would allow me to seamlessly deploy my assets there. On the other hand, you might be looking for a more formal experience, so finding a crypto swap platform with many years in the market could be the way to go. Regardless of the above, however, there are a few important considerations that I would always look for. These include: Transaction speed Fee structure Customer support availability User interface Supported assets Security measures Conclusion: the Fastest Crypto Swap Platforms in 2025 The cryptocurrency swap landscape this year offers numerous pathways for users to execute fast and secure transactions. That said, each platform delivers very fast transaction processing, with the likes of ChangeNOW being significantly and notably quicker. The optimal choice, however, would always depend on whether users prioritize asset variety, fee transparency, advanced trading protections, cost efficiency, and a range of different factors, all of which I‚Äôve discussed in the current comparison.

According to The Nikkei, the group is interested in turning the tower into digital securities and will offer fractional ownership through tokenized real estate , targeting both retail buyers and major institutions. This isn‚Äôt a soft trial. On the institutional side, the property will be converted into a private real estate investment trust (REIT), mainly sold to life insurance firms. For retail investors, MUFG plans to sell tokenized slices of the asset, giving ordinary buyers access to large commercial real estate without needing millions in capital. Mitsui splits from MUFG but still tied through Progmat Now Japan isn‚Äôt copying Europe‚Äôs playbook. While digital bonds are the focus over there, here it‚Äôs all about tokenized property. The market‚Äôs still in early stages though. Right now, there are only six listed real estate tokens on the Osaka Digital Exchange‚Äôs START market, with a total monthly trade volume of just ¬•23 million ($157,000). Since 2021, Japan has seen 63 digital security issuances, worth a total of ¬•194 billion ($1.3 billion). Around 80% of those were real estate deals , with only 20% in bonds. The interest is clearly on turning buildings into tradeable digital assets, even if the market isn‚Äôt moving much yet. One firm has been pushing hard in this space, and that‚Äôs Mitsui Digital Asset Management. It has issued 16 tokenized real estate deals, and 14 of those came through its Alterna platform, which sells directly to retail buyers. For a while, Mitsui relied on MUFG Trust to handle the legal backend of its tokens. But that changed last month. Mitsui ditched MUFG‚Äôs trust services and built its own system, the Alterna Trust, so it could speed up token launches. That move made it look like MUFG and Mitsui are now in direct competition. Still, the companies can‚Äôt seem to fully cut ties. Both remain linked through Progmat, MUFG‚Äôs security token platform. Even though MUFG spun Progmat off into a separate business, it still holds a 42% stake. Mitsui, despite ending the trust service deal, signed an agreement to keep using Progmat for most of its upcoming tokens. So while MUFG lost Mitsui as a trust client, it still profits on the backend. That‚Äôs how the Japanese firm is playing it. Only time will tell if it‚Äôs a smart play.

This isn‚Äôt just about streamlining; it‚Äôs a bold declaration of intent to cut half of all federal mandates, promising a new era of agility in governance. For anyone interested in the intersection of technology, policy, and economic freedom, this development signals a potentially seismic shift. What is the DOGE AI Tool and Its Ambitious Goal? Imagine a future where government bureaucracy is drastically trimmed, making way for faster innovation and reduced overhead. This is the vision driving DOGE‚Äôs latest project. According to reports, the Department of Government Efficiency is leveraging a sophisticated DOGE AI tool , officially dubbed the ‚ÄòAI Deregulation Decision Tool.‚Äô Its primary function is to meticulously analyze an astounding 200,000 existing federal regulations. The ultimate objective? To identify and eliminate those no longer required by law, with an audacious goal of slashing half of these regulations by the first anniversary of President Donald Trump‚Äôs return to office. This initiative represents a significant step towards leveraging artificial intelligence for large-scale administrative reform. The sheer volume of regulations in the U.S. federal code is immense, often leading to inefficiencies and complexity for businesses and citizens alike. By applying AI, DOGE aims to bring a level of analytical speed and precision that traditional human review processes simply cannot match. Early Successes and Lingering Questions in AI Deregulation While the broader plan is still under wraps, the groundwork for this massive AI deregulation effort appears to be well underway. The presentation cited in reports indicates that the AI tool has already been deployed for initial reviews. Specifically, it has been used to scrutinize regulations within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Furthermore, the tool is credited with writing a staggering ‚Äò100% of deregulations‚Äô for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). These early applications suggest a functional prototype, demonstrating the AI‚Äôs capability to not only identify but also draft the necessary changes for regulatory removal. However, such a groundbreaking initiative is not without its caveats. A White House spokesperson, while praising the DOGE team as ‚Äòthe best and brightest,‚Äô also prudently noted that ‚Äòno single plan has been approved or greenlit.‚Äô This cautious statement hints at the complex bureaucratic hurdles and extensive vetting processes still ahead. Moreover, the history of DOGE‚Äôs AI tools isn‚Äôt entirely spotless. Previous reports highlighted an error-prone tool that reportedly ‚Äòhallucinated‚Äô the size of Veterans Affairs contracts, raising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of AI in critical government functions. The success of this new deregulation tool will heavily depend on its ability to overcome such past challenges and prove its infallibility in a high-stakes environment. The Drive for Government Efficiency : Benefits and Challenges The push for government efficiency through AI promises several potential benefits. A streamlined regulatory environment could: Reduce Compliance Costs: Businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, often bear significant costs in complying with complex regulations. Deregulation could free up capital for investment and job creation. Accelerate Innovation: Fewer regulatory hurdles might encourage faster development and deployment of new technologies and services across various sectors. Improve Public Services: By removing obsolete rules, government agencies might become more agile and responsive, potentially leading to better service delivery for citizens. Boost Economic Growth: A less regulated economy is often perceived as more dynamic, attracting investment and fostering entrepreneurship. However, the journey towards this ambitious goal is fraught with challenges. The elimination of regulations, even those deemed obsolete, requires careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences. There‚Äôs a delicate balance between reducing red tape and maintaining essential protections for consumers, the environment, and public safety. Furthermore, the sheer scale of the task‚Äîreviewing hundreds of thousands of regulations‚Äîdemands an AI system of unparalleled robustness and accuracy. Any errors could have far-reaching and potentially damaging implications. The Elon Musk AI Connection and the Future of AI in Policy The Department of Government Efficiency itself gained significant attention in the early months of the Trump administration due to the involvement of tech visionary Elon Musk AI . While Musk‚Äôs direct role in the current AI deregulation project isn‚Äôt explicitly detailed in the latest reports, his past leadership and well-known advocacy for efficiency and technological advancement certainly set a precedent for DOGE‚Äôs innovative approach. Musk‚Äôs influence often points towards leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve large-scale systemic problems, a philosophy that clearly underpins the development of this AI tool. This initiative also places the spotlight on the broader role of AI in policy-making and governance. As AI capabilities continue to expand, governments worldwide are exploring how these technologies can be applied to complex administrative tasks, from resource allocation to legal analysis. The DOGE project, if successful, could serve as a global case study for how AI can genuinely transform public sector operations, setting a new standard for efficiency and responsiveness. However, it also underscores the critical need for robust oversight, ethical guidelines, and transparent accountability mechanisms to ensure that AI serves the public good without compromising fundamental principles. What Does This Mean for the Future of Governance? The deployment of DOGE‚Äôs AI Deregulation Decision Tool marks a significant moment in the intersection of technology and governance. It represents an ambitious attempt to use artificial intelligence not just for data analysis, but for proactive policy reform. While the stated goal of eliminating half of all federal regulations is incredibly bold and faces considerable scrutiny, the mere existence and early deployment of such a tool signal a new frontier in public administration. The success of this initiative could pave the way for more widespread AI adoption in government, leading to unprecedented levels of efficiency and potentially reshaping how laws are made, enforced, and retired. Conversely, any missteps could highlight the limitations and risks of relying too heavily on autonomous systems for complex societal decisions. As this unfolds, the world will be watching to see if the promise of AI-driven government efficiency can truly be realized.

According to Dogecoin news, the Dogecoin price experienced a brief surge today, gaining 4%, the most it has gained this week. Analysts believe this could mark a major rally not just for Dogecoin, but also for other prominent meme coins in the meme coin sector. The news should be met with celebration, considering Dogecoin‚Äôs rough start to the second half of the year. As expected, a Dogecoin price surge could catapult it to the top of the wishlists of crypto investors and experts. But even that may not be enough to help the largest meme coin by market cap knock Remittix, the upcoming PayFi giant, off its pedestal. Analysts Fear Dogecoin Price Boost May Prove Inefficient If analysts are correct, the ongoing cycle may look quite different from all the other ones before it. Their reasoning stems from the perceived lack of interest in meme coin this time around, evident from the slow price movements and trading activity. Dogecoin, for example, only recorded a 4% price increase today, which marks its largest price movement this week. Numbers like these pale in comparison to numbers from the meme coin frenzy during the previous bull market. Besides, the focus of this cycle seems to be on stablecoins and accessible payment solutions such as PayFi. In that case, investors may want to turn their attention towards promising PayFi projects, such as Remittix, a crypto-based payment solutions provider integrating both web2 and web3 payment gateways. Remittix Leads The PayFi Charge With Latest Integration Although still a nascent scene, the increasing interest in stablecoins and reliable payment solutions has catapulted PayFi onto the scene, and all the other projects building within the space. One of such projects is Remittix, a notable crypto-based payment solution with a unique platform that combines web2 and web3 payment gateways. Earlier this week, Remittix crossed a major milestone on its roadmap with the announcement of its crypto wallet beta phase. The Remittix crypto wallet is set to play a significant role within its ecosystem and will possess all the functionality of the top crypto wallets in the industry, with a few extra features. The move comes barely weeks after Remittix announced its $250,000 giveaway for early adopters and supporters. The project has managed to capture mindshare in the industry thanks to eye-catching features, such as: Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries worldwide 50% token bonus for early adopters and supporters 20% referral rewards for onboarding new users Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix $250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway The post Dogecoin‚Äôs Popularity Soars Again But Remittix Is Outshining It For Hype In 2025 appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Token Presale and ICO Insights|Remittix,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-07-27 15:00:13

This breakthrough positions SOL for potential runs toward the next resistance targets at $192 (initial barrier) and $205 (significant resistance zone) . Trading at $187.19, SOL has demonstrated impressive recovery momentum, posting a 31% gain over the past month while maintaining a market capitalization of $100 billion. Solana didn‚Äôt make noise this bull run ‚Äî it just delivered. Now $SOL is back above $200 and showing real strength. Once it flips $295, the next level is $500. Feels like a good time to look at SOL again. pic.twitter.com/qJnuHjCveH ‚Äî RJT. WAGMI (@RJTTheOG) July 27, 2025 Solana Price Eyes $192 Breakout Following Network Block Upgrades Solana appears to be preparing its infrastructure for anticipated expansion. On July 22, the Solana network increased its block capacity by 20% , raising the limit to 60 million compute units (CU). Mert Mumtaz, co-founder and CEO of Helius (a platform providing infrastructure and development tools for Solana), explained via X that this upgrade enables the network to process more transactions within each block. Solana blocks are now 20% bigger ‚Äî what does this mean? on Solana, every transaction sent consumes resources we call this resource ""compute units"" or CUs ‚Äî like fuel for a car every transaction consumes a different amount of CUs depending on its complexity, a simple transfer‚Ä¶ https://t.co/4XOYZDUTtH ‚Äî mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) July 23, 2025 Many analysts now view the current Solana price levels as attractive opportunities for accumulation. Recently, Nasdaq-listed DeFi Development Corp announced that it stands just one token purchase away from reaching 1 million SOL (valued at $187 million) in its treasury reserves. Bitcoin mining company Bit Mining also revealed on July 10 that it plans to raise $200-300 million for building a Solana treasury. Cryptocurrency analysts suggest that with this level of institutional accumulation, once Solana surpasses the $200 threshold, minimal resistance exists between that level and $250. Notice that once Solana $SOL breaks above $200, there‚Äôs little to no resistance standing in the way of a run to new all-time highs. pic.twitter.com/AnqwqaC1m1 ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) July 26, 2025 Solana Price Analysis: Inverse H&S Pattern Points to $220 Bullish Reversal The SOL/USDT daily chart reveals a developing inverse head and shoulders formation, a recognized bullish reversal pattern. The pattern displays clearly defined left shoulder, head, and emerging right shoulder components, indicating potential upside breakout if price closes above the neckline area, which corresponds to the $200-$205 zone. Source: TradingView The RSI reading of 67.04 sits just below the overbought level of 70, suggesting continued strength without excessive buying pressure. Should SOL maintain support above $180 and achieve a convincing neckline break, the measured target projects to approximately $223, representing the completion of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Snorter Bot: New Way to Find Hot Solana Tokens While big companies are buying up SOL, there‚Äôs been a lot of excitement around new meme coins on the Solana network, especially on a platform called BONKfun. The problem is that most of these new coins aren‚Äôt available on the popular exchanges where regular people usually buy crypto. That‚Äôs where Snorter Bot (SNORT) comes in. This new project is built to spot promising tokens before they become popular and their prices shoot up. Source: Snorter Bot Snorter is a trading bot that you can use through Telegram, and it is built specifically for the Solana network, which means it can work super fast to help you find good investment opportunities early. The company behind Snorter is currently running an early sale where you can buy their $SNORT tokens before they become available to everyone else. So far, they‚Äôve raised over $2.4 million from investors who believe in the project. If you want to get in early, you can get $SNORT tokens for $0.0995 each right now.

With spot prices holding above major moving averages and an aggressive rally from June lows, all eyes are on whether ETH can break above the $4,107 level. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily chart, Ethereum is respecting its bullish structure, having flipped the $3,300 zone from resistance into support. The 100-day and 200-day have also created a bullish crossover, providing additional confirmation of the trend. Moreover, the RSI, which recently entered overbought territory, has slightly cooled down but remains elevated, suggesting that momentum might be overheated. Yet, the clean sweep and reclaim of prior highs around $3,300 reflect strength and commitment from buyers, and as long as this level holds, the bulls are in control. This structure is a classic sign of trend continuation, especially when supported by strong volume and momentum indicators. If the price begins to expand again from this consolidation range, the next upside target would likely be the $4,400 region, where Ethereum topped during previous cycles. Conversely, a break below $3,300 would raise concerns of a deeper retracement, but for now, that scenario seems less likely unless broader market weakness emerges. The 4-Hour Chart The 4H chart further supports the bullish case with a clearly defined ascending trendline holding the price. The asset continues to respect the trendline, and each dip has been met with strong buying interest, signaling that bulls are still active and defending the uptrend. However, some caution is warranted in the short term, mainly due to the overbought conditions on the daily chart. If ETH fails to hold above the $3,700 zone or loses the ascending trendline, a short-term correction toward $3,500 would be a healthy reset. This level also aligns with the daily support block, making it a logical area for buyers to step in again if tested. On-Chain Analysis Ethereum Open Interest On the sentiment side, Ethereum‚Äôs open interest across all exchanges has surged to over $27 billion, marking its highest point in years. This indicates a massive influx of leveraged positions and reflects growing speculative appetite in the market. Historically, rising open interest in tandem with rising price signals confidence and trend strength, but it also increases the risk of a long squeeze if the market turns. What‚Äôs notable, however, is that despite the elevated OI, funding rates remain at relatively moderate levels. This suggests that the majority of traders are not excessively over-leveraged, and we are not yet seeing the kind of euphoria typically associated with major tops. It gives Ethereum more room to push higher without the immediate threat of a sharp deleveraging event. For now, positioning remains optimistic but not overheated, keeping the path open for a potential breakout above $4,100.

This modest price increase forms part of a rebound observed over the previous 48 hours, following a significant 4% price correction earlier last week. Looking ahead to the new week, renowned market analyst with X username KillaXBT has identified two potential price development scenarios for the premier cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Holds Above $115,000 ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why This Level Is Significant Bitcoin Sees Bounce From Key Demand Zone, But What‚Äôs Next? In an X post on July 26, KillaXBT provides an in-depth technical analysis of the Bitcoin market to map out the asset‚Äôs potential price trajectory in this new week. The popular market expert duly notes that Bitcoin experienced a price bounce after dipping into a key demand zone around $115,000, which they also described as an ideal long entry region. As earlier stated, the crypto market leader has since climbed to $118,000 following this price rebound. However, KillaXBT notes there is an established CME Gap around $117,071, which is likely to serve as a price magnet in the short term. For context, CME gaps are price gaps on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures chart that occur when Bitcoin‚Äôs price moves significantly on the spot market when CME markets are closed, typically over the weekend. In view of next week, KillaXBT explains scenario 1 in which the Bitcoin market opens on a bullish note. In this case, the analyst states investors should expect Bitcoin to eventually form a higher low, ideally through a sweep of liquidity around the $116,000 area. However, if Bitcoin bulls can effectively hold this price pocket, it would trigger fresh long setups with stop losses tucked below the prior week‚Äôs low. In scenario 2, KillaXBT paints a more aggressive situation in which Bitcoin performs a double sweep of last week‚Äôs wick low around $114,800, thereby effecting a ruthless liquidity grab before an upward reversal. However, the market expert favours the reality of scenario 1, following the earlier liquidity grab with the price dip to $115,000. Related Reading: XRP Produces Successful $3 Support Retest ‚Äì But What Next? The Invalidation Risk Regardless of which scenario, KillaXBT has highlighted certain developments that could neutralize the prospects of a bullish reversal. In particular, the analyst explains that failure for the price to hold above the recent wick lows following a retest would force Bitcoin prices to deeper imbalance zones between $112,000 ‚Äì $113,800. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $117,900, reflecting a 0.21% gain in the last seven days.

In a press release, the Department of Justice says Santiago Garcia Gutierrez is guilty of wire fraud, impersonating a federal officer, aggravated identity theft and making a false statement after orchestrating two separate fraudulent investment schemes. Authorities say that between 2018 and 2020, Gutierrez siphoned more than $2.8 million from a victim by pretending that he was working as a confidential informant for the Department of Homeland Security. Gutierrez fraudulently claimed that he could use his position to get discounts on exotic cars, planes and vessels that were seized by the US government. He duped the victim into using him as a middleman for purchasing what turned out to be nonexistent luxury assets. To make the scheme look legitimate, he sent the victim text messages from different phone numbers and made it appear that messages were from a confidential government informant, federal agent and even his own attorney. Gutierrez also defrauded eight other victims between 2019 and 2024. He persuaded them to invest in federal oil wells he had an ownership interest in, with promises of large returns. The victims did not receive any profit as Gutierrez used the money for his personal benefit, causing investor losses of more than $900,000. Gutierrez did not pay the federal government royalties on the sale of the oil extracted from the wells, despite knowing that he had to do so. On top of prison time, Gutierrez was ordered to pay $3.7 million in restitution to the victims and to forfeit $2.85 million.

Key Takeaways: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicts Bitcoin could see major gains in 2026, breaking from its historic four-year cycle. He cites reduced halving impact, improving regulation, and institutional adoption as drivers of long-term momentum. Hougan warns that Bitcoin treasury firms could pose risks if overleveraged during market downturns. ‚ÄúI bet 2026 is an up year,‚Äù Hougan said in a video shared on X , adding, ‚ÄúI broadly think we‚Äôre in for a good few years.‚Äù His remarks come as debate intensifies over whether the classic Bitcoin halving-driven model still holds. Hougan Says Bitcoin Halving Cycle Losing Its Influence According to Hougan, several factors are now overriding the influence of the halving cycle. He argued the impact of halvings weakens over time, as each one cuts rewards by a smaller absolute amount. He also pointed to the broader macro environment, where U.S. presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, a move that could drive capital away from bonds and toward risk assets like Bitcoin. ‚ÄúBlow-up risk is attenuated, due to improving regulation and the institutionalization of the space,‚Äù Hougan said, noting that clearer rules and expanding institutional involvement have reduced the likelihood of market shocks. He added that ongoing adoption by traditional firms could extend Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish momentum well beyond historical timelines. However, Hougan also flagged risks. He pointed to the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies ‚Äî firms that buy BTC using debt or equity issuance ‚Äî as a potential vulnerability. DID I HEAR SUPER CYCLE??? The four-year cycle is dead and adoption killed it. @Matt_Hougan says we're going higher in 2026. Early profit takers will be left behind!!! Full break down with @JSeyff and @Matt_Hougan in comments pic.twitter.com/Ffn9penapN ‚Äî Kyle Chass√© / DD (@kyle_chasse) July 25, 2025 Asset manager VanEck has echoed similar concerns, warning that such companies could be overleveraged if the market turns. Despite those caveats, Hougan expects a more measured advance ahead. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs more ‚Äòsustained steady boom‚Äô than super-cycle,‚Äù he said, though he acknowledged the path forward will still include volatility. Bitcoin is currently trading around $118,169, having climbed over 10% in the past month, according to Nansen. Hougan‚Äôs view aligns with recent commentary from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who declared the four-year cycle ‚Äúdead,‚Äù citing a shift in whale behavior. ‚ÄúOld whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we thought,‚Äù Ju noted. Bitcoin Could Peak in October If 2020 Cycle Repeats, Says Analyst However, not everyone agrees. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently warned that if Bitcoin mirrors its 2020 cycle, the market could peak in October, 550 days after the April 2024 halving. That would keep Bitcoin firmly within its historic rhythm, suggesting the debate over its future trajectory is far from settled. Bitcoin‚Äôs strong performance and growing reputation as a store of value have led analyst Tom Lee to call it ‚ÄúDigital Gold,‚Äù with a bold long-term price forecast of $1 million. Speaking on CNBC, Lee emphasized Bitcoin‚Äôs role as an emerging asset class that could challenge gold‚Äôs dominance. He also pointed to recent regulatory progress, such as the approval of the GENIUS Act, as a positive sign for the crypto sector. Lee believes a $200K‚Äì$250K Bitcoin price is achievable, representing just a fraction of gold‚Äôs market value.

Sharing a chart from the SaylorTracker platform, which tracks Bitcoin purchases made by his company, Saylor had purchased BTC in all the weeks he shared this chart so far.

Cathie Wood Weighs In In fact, the weeks in which Strategy doesn't purchase Bitcoin are even more surprising. The company announces BTC purchases in almost weekly filings with the SEC. Additionally, news of capital increases to purchase BTC frequently surface. Strategy currently holds $71.85 billion worth of Bitcoin. The company's purchases were made at an average price of $71,777. Considering the current price of BTC, which is around $118,000, the company has made a 64% profit on this investment. However, the data showed that Strategy had not yet made a profit from the $739 million acquisition it made last Monday and was incurring a loss of approximately $4.4 million. *This is not investment advice.

According to sources close to the talks on both sides, the extension would be a continuation of the existing agreement reached in May and set to expire on August 12. The two countries mutually suspended most of their heavy tariffs in May, buying time for talks. In the third round of talks, the parties are expected to clarify their positions on key points of contention, particularly US concerns about China's excess industrial capacity. However, sources say no concrete breakthroughs are expected from these talks. According to three sources close to the Chinese side, while the previous Geneva and London meetings were generally focused on ‚Äúreducing tensions,‚Äù Beijing will also want to bring up the 20% additional tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by US President Donald Trump in March due to the fentanyl crisis in the Stockholm talks. The Trump administration has argued that China has not done enough to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US. However, Washington has not offered clear criteria for what constitutes ‚Äúsufficient progress.‚Äù The Chinese delegation may seek further clarification on this matter. A source familiar with the matter said Beijing ‚Äúdoes not find the 20% tariff fair‚Äù but might accept a basic 10% tariff if the additional tariff were removed. Related News: Michael Saylor Gives the Signal Again, May Announce Bitcoin Purchase Tomorrow - Here's the Current Profit Amount and Average Purchase Price According to the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, the average U.S. tariff on Chinese goods currently stands at 51.1%. While the Chinese side considers this excessive, they say they have already absorbed the 25% increase implemented during Trump's first term. The People's Daily, the Communist Party of China's media outlet, wrote in an editorial on Sunday that Beijing was ready to cooperate with Washington to achieve ‚Äúmeaningful progress‚Äù in the Stockholm talks. The article stated that ‚ÄúChina has always adopted a constructive stance and advocated resolving issues through equal dialogue,‚Äù and called for strengthening mutual trust and reducing misunderstandings. However, experts say no major outcomes should be expected from these talks. Niklas Swanstrom, director of the Stockholm-based Institute for Security and Development Policy, approached the talks cautiously, saying, ‚ÄúI don't expect a rupture, but I'd be happy if I'm wrong.‚Äù Frederic Cho, vice president of the Sweden-China Business Council, also indicated that a 90-day extension would be the likely outcome of the talks. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business last week that he would work on this extension with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that issues such as ownership of the popular short-video app TikTok could also be indirectly discussed. If ByteDance doesn't transfer control of TikTok to an American company, the app risks being banned in the US. According to Philippe Le Corre, head of the Asia Program at French business school ESSEC, the Stockholm talks could be a preparatory phase before a final agreement is reached. He suggested that a potential final agreement could be reached during a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea in October. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, the number of XRP‚Äôs active addresses peaked at 44,143 on July 21 on the weekly timeframe before dropping to just 24,644 by July 27, a 44.2% decline. The drop followed a brief surge from 30,190 on July 20, indicating that the increase in user activity was short-lived, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from CryptoQuant. At the same time, XRP‚Äôs price fell from $3.55 to $3.16, marking a 10.99% drop. XRP active addresses chart. Source: CryptoQuant The sharp decline in active addresses signals weakening demand and network usage, eroding XRP‚Äôs price support. With the asset breaking below $3.50, sentiment has cooled, and capital is shifting back to Bitcoin, stalling the broader altcoin rally. XRP whale activity spooks investors XRP‚Äôs recent loss of momentum has also been triggered by sustained whale activity. Investors were spooked after Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen moved around $140 million worth of XRP to exchange-linked wallets since July 17. A total of 50 million XRP, worth approximately $161 million, was transferred, with most of it going to centralized exchanges. Meanwhile, 10 million XRP was split between two newly inactive wallets, raising speculation about strategic profit-taking. While some view the move as routine, others warn it could have a significant market impact. Adding to concerns, CryptoQuant contributor J.A. Maartunn cautioned that Larsen still holds over 2.5 billion XRP, worth nearly $9 billion, suggesting that further selling could exert additional downward pressure on the token. üö® Chris Larsen (Ripple co-founder) still holds 2.58B $XRP ‚Äî that‚Äôs $8.83B.
