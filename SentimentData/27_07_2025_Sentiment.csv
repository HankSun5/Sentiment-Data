According to the filing, the company plans to use XRP not just as a treasury reserve but for real-time payments and income generation. Pro-Ripple Lawyer Weighs In On XRP Filing In a July 25 X social media post , Morgan shared his take on Wellgistics Health‚Äôs S-1 filing submitted to the US SEC a day earlier. He argued that this goes beyond the standard use of XRP as a treasury reserve asset . According to Morgan‚Äôs analysis, the document reveals a multifaceted strategic vision that embeds XRP deeply into the company‚Äôs financial infrastructure and operational model. Unlike companies that merely hold crypto as a hedge or speculative asset, Wellgistics Health plans to integrate XRP into various core functions. Firstly, the company intends to use the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to implement a real-time, low-cost payment system facilitating transactions between itself, pharmacy customers, and manufacturing and vendor partners. According to a crypto community member, this marks a strong use case for XRP in Business-to-Business (B2B) payments and real-world commerce. Morgan also revealed that Wellgistics Health stated in its S-1 filing that it aims to raise capital through equity or debt securities and allocate proceeds toward acquiring more XRP. The firm plans to leverage its XRP holdings as collateral for funding activities, highlighting the cryptocurrency‚Äôs role in capital markets. Moreover, the company suggests it will generate income from XRP-based activities, further underlining the asset‚Äôs utility beyond speculative trading . This comprehensive strategy positions XRP as a possible financial instrument for collateralization, daily payments, and multiple income streams. Morgan sees these future developments and opportunities as a significant step in proving XRP‚Äôs enterprise viability. Skepticism Grows Despite Bold XRP Plans Amid growing attention around XRP‚Äôs evolving use cases , Wellgistics Health‚Äôs SEC S-1 filing has stirred both enthusiasm and skepticism across the crypto community. While some XRP supporters see this as further validation of the token‚Äôs utility in business and finance, others remain cautious. Community members noted the novelty of a healthcare company embracing a ‚Äú banker‚Äôs coin ‚Äù like XRP, lightheartedly suggesting that broader mainstream adoption may follow soon. Former securities lawyer Mark Fagel added a layer of scrutiny, highlighting Wellgistics Health‚Äôs minimal assets, net losses, and a ‚ÄúGoing Concern‚Äù warning in its audit report. This raised concerns that the company may be using XRP more as a marketing or fundraising tool rather than for actual utility and cross-border payments . In response, Morgan acknowledged the possibility that WH might be leveraging the crypto narrative to attract investors, but also pointed out that the company‚Äôs plans align with a growing trend of crypto integration into corporate strategies.

The company stated that BTC has entered a classic ‚Äúbull flag‚Äù formation, a positive technical structure often seen following rapid price increases. According to MakroVision's analysis, the most critical short-term resistance level for Bitcoin is the Fibonacci retracement at around $121,100. Breaking this level could trigger a new upward wave. Meanwhile, support at around $113,600 coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, and a potential return to this level would be considered a healthy technical correction.

The firm said that if BTC can sustain above $106,000, the medium-term bullish momentum will be maintained. The analysis indicates that if Bitcoin breaks above $121,000, the 1.382 Fibonacci extension point at around $129,600 will be highlighted. If this level is also broken, the next target could be around $133,800. *This is not investment advice.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 20:40:00

The flow began picking up at the end of last year and hasn‚Äôt slowed. In June, $3.9 billion was pulled out of U.S. Treasuries while $10 billion went into high-grade corporate bonds on both continents. By July, another $13 billion was added just to U.S. investment-grade corporate debt‚Äîmaking it the largest monthly buy since 2015, according to Bloomberg. This is no minor reallocation. For decades, U.S. government debt was the most trusted instrument in global markets. But now, rising fiscal deficits and ballooning interest costs are making Treasuries less appealing to institutional investors. Micha√´l Nizard, who manages portfolios at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, began pulling away from sovereign debt late last year. He said he‚Äôs kept that position steady ever since. Wall Street sees credit strength while governments pile on debt The U.S. government‚Äôs spending problem isn‚Äôt new, but the pressure has been increasing. Donald Trump‚Äôs tax cut bill, signed during his first term and now continuing to impact revenue during his second presidency, is projected to add about $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. This projection came from the Congressional Budget Office. At the same time, interest costs are climbing. By 2035, debt payments could consume 30% of the country‚Äôs revenue. That compares with 18% expected this year and just 9% four years ago. Those numbers contributed to a major downgrade. In May, Moody‚Äôs Ratings stripped the U.S. of its last AAA rating, bringing it down to Aa1. The agency specifically cited the growing deficit and the government‚Äôs rising interest burden. That rating cut has added to the sense that Treasuries are no longer untouchable. Still, the shift toward corporate debt hasn‚Äôt been rapid. The U.S. government doesn‚Äôt borrow in foreign currency and has the ability to print dollars. That gives it flexibility that most countries don‚Äôt have. Even during the tariff standoff in April, Treasuries performed better than company bonds, even though both markets saw falling prices. Foreign demand also hasn‚Äôt dried up‚Äîinternational holdings of Treasuries increased in May. But corporate bonds have started to look more attractive for other reasons. While governments rack up obligations, companies have posted relatively strong earnings. More U.S. firms have beaten Wall Street estimates this earnings season than during the same stretch last year. That‚Äôs been enough for major asset managers like BlackRock to favor credit. In a note last week, their team wrote, ‚ÄúCredit has become a clear choice for quality.‚Äù Spreads tighten, but demand for company debt holds Valuations for company bonds have been running high, which points to strong demand. U.S. high-grade corporate spreads have stayed below 80 basis points through July. That‚Äôs well below the 10-year average of 120 basis points based on Bloomberg index data. In Europe, euro-denominated investment-grade spreads averaged around 85 basis points for the same period, lower than the 123 basis point average over the past decade. But not everyone is sold on this rally. Gershon Distenfeld, who runs funds at AllianceBernstein, has already started cutting back on credit exposure. He reduced his position that favored corporate risk over rate risk earlier in July. Dominique Braeuninger at Schroders echoed that view. She said spreads were too tight to justify the risk of diving further into corporate debt. BlackRock may be backing credit overall, but even they‚Äôre taking a cautious approach. The firm is avoiding long-term high-grade notes because of how little they pay relative to risk. Instead, they‚Äôve gone overweight on short-term corporate credit, where the balance looks more favorable. Still, for many fund managers, the picture is shifting. Governments aren‚Äôt offering the same sense of security they used to. Jason Simpson, a senior fixed income strategist at State Street, said, ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve seen on the government fiscal side is not great news. Corporates seem to be chugging along nicely.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

This accusation followed his criticism of the banking giant for charging fintech companies for access to customer banking data. In a recent post on X , Winklevoss said JPMorgan paused Gemini‚Äôs onboarding process right after he spoke out against the bank‚Äôs new policy. Tyler Winklevoss Says JPMorgan‚Äôs New Policy is Harmful The controversy began when a Bloomberg report revealed that JPMorgan plans to implement fees for fintech firms that require access to bank data for their services. This includes apps and services that help users buy crypto, manage finances, or use digital wallets. Winklevoss called this policy ‚Äúanti-competitive‚Äù and warned that it could hurt innovation in fintech and cryptocurrency. Although JPMorgan has not yet publicly addressed the recent allegations, this situation has raised worries for the fintech and crypto sectors. They fear that new fees could make it harder for smaller companies to compete and may strengthen the hold of traditional banks. Notably, Winklevoss‚Äôs comments reflect a growing conflict between traditional banks and new financial technologies. As more people adopt crypto, partnerships between banks and crypto platforms have become essential. However, moves like JPMorgan‚Äôs could hinder this growth, particularly for platforms like Gemini that depend on easy banking connections. JPMorgan Discusses Blockchain‚Äôs Role in Capital Markets Meanwhile, JPMorgan has taken a proactive step in shaping digital asset regulation by meeting with the SEC‚Äôs Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, also known as the Crypto Task Force. As reported by TheCoinRise, executives from JPMorgan and members of the crypto division discussed the broader implications of blockchain adoption in traditional markets. Topics included risk assessment, benefits of decentralization, and how firms like JPMorgan could position themselves competitively in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. The bank also highlighted its current presence in the crypto ecosystem. Its digital platform facilitates repurchase agreements, a critical segment of short-term lending under its ‚ÄúDigital Financing‚Äù and ‚ÄúDigital Debt Services‚Äù categories. Donald Trump Connection and Regulatory Shadows Recall that the cryptocurrency exchange has taken a significant step towards an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Gemini has filed a confidential draft registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Beyond its market ambitions, Gemini has also garnered political attention . The Winklevoss twins, prominent figures in both crypto and politics, each contributed $1 million to President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign. Though political affiliations aren‚Äôt directly tied to the IPO, such connections add a layer of public scrutiny and regulatory sensitivity. The confidential filing structure may be a strategic move to minimize premature exposure and potential backlash. Nonetheless, the firm‚Äôs decision to move forward indicates growing optimism within the crypto sector.

Until now, neither GPT nor any of its subsidiaries had included digital assets in their balance sheets. ‚ÄúIn order to efficiently manage surplus funds generated from existing businesses, diversify our asset portfolio to strengthen our financial base, preserve value over the medium- to long-term, and reduce foreign exchange risks, we have decided to add bitcoin to our reserve assets,‚Äù the company wrote.

The alert follows increasing reports of fraudulent accounts impersonating Ripple and its executives, with the aim of tricking users into sending their XRP. Ripple Warns Investors Of Rising XRP Scams On July 23, Garlinghouse took to X social media to raise the alarm on a sharp rise in XRP scams, urging investors and community members to stay alert. According to the Ripple CEO, scammers are capitalizing on market momentum and community excitement to ramp up impersonation schemes, particularly targeting unsuspecting XRP holders. Related Reading: How Ripple Is Taking On SWIFT To Grab 14% Market Share As XRP Price Surges One of the most notable developments flagged by Garlinghouse is a recent surge in fraudulent activity on YouTube, where scammers have taken over existing channels, rebranded them to resemble recognized Ripple accounts, and begun promoting misleading content that impersonates the crypto company and its executives. In its official X account, the Ripple team stressed that these YouTube accounts are legitimate and do not belong to the crypto firm, despite appearing convincing. In many cases, the usernames have been altered to mimic the company‚Äôs official handles, often making it difficult for unsuspecting users to identify the deception. These scam videos frequently promise giveaways, rewards, or investment multipliers, usually asking users and investors to send XRP in exchange for a larger return. Garlinghouse has emphasized that neither he nor Ripple will ever request XRP from anyone under any circumstances. To combat the growing threat of skyrocketing crypto scams, Ripple is actively and aggressively reporting these fraudulent accounts and encouraging its community to do the same. The company has reiterated that its official channels remain the only trusted sources of communication and provides a direct reminder to always verify account handles and links before engaging. Notably, Garlinghouse concluded his post with an important reminder to stay vigilant against avoidable losses. He warned that ‚Äúif it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.‚Äù Ripple Alert Highlights Broader Threat Amid Market Recovery Beyond the immediate focus on the YouTube impersonation scams, Garlinghouse‚Äôs report touches on a broader trend of escalating crypto fraud that tends to spike during periods of market recovery or growing optimism. This pattern, described by the Ripple CEO as ‚Äúlike clockwork,‚Äù suggests that malicious actors closely monitor community sentiment and time their campaigns to exploit emotional and financial excitement.

In a broader context, the rise in XRP scams has coincided with the recent surge in the altcoin‚Äôs price to above $3.6.

As the XRP price inches closer to ATH levels and gains more momentum, bad actors are leveraging this wave of optimism to cast a wider net, targeting investors through sophisticated scams and fraudulent schemes.

Should Holders Be Worried?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-approaching-overbought-territory-should-holders-be-worried/,"XRP has experienced a strong upward surge in recent weeks, hitting an intraday high of $3.21 before settling around $3.18 at the time of writing. While this momentum has excited many in the crypto space, popular analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has flagged a potentially cautionary signal: XRP is entering overbought territory on the weekly Stochastic RSI. This raises an important question: Should holders be concerned? Weekly Stoch RSI Suggests a Cooling Phase May Be Ahead STEPH IS CRYPTO‚Äôs technical analysis highlights that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index on the weekly timeframe is now at 90.31 and 81.99‚Äîwell above the 80 mark that signals overbought conditions. Historically, when XRP‚Äôs Stoch RSI reaches this range, the price tends to experience short-term pullbacks or sideways consolidation. In previous cycles, these conditions preceded brief corrections before XRP resumed its upward trajectory. The current setup appears similar, with the indicator flashing red-hot momentum and suggesting that the asset might soon take a breather. #XRP is approaching ‚Äòoverbought‚Äô territory.. Should we be worried? pic.twitter.com/xX9thFJYTf ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 26, 2025 What‚Äôs Fueling XRP‚Äôs Price Action? Beyond the charts, XRP‚Äôs recent price rally is being driven by a mix of strong fundamentals, positive sentiment, and speculation. Excitement continues to build around the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF , while Ripple‚Äôs aggressive push into real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and CBDC adoption is keeping investor interest high. The launch of Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin and the expanding use of the XRP Ledger for global payments are reinforcing the bullish narrative. However, the market was recently rattled by a massive transfer of $175 million worth of XRP by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen to centralized exchanges. This sparked concerns over possible sell pressure and led to over $105 million in long position liquidations. XRP briefly dipped to $3.11, but the market quickly stabilized, suggesting underlying strength despite the shakeout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Should Holders Be Worried? From a technical standpoint, XRP is undeniably overbought on the weekly chart. This doesn‚Äôt guarantee a crash, but it often signals that upward momentum may slow down, at least temporarily. For short-term traders, it might be wise to monitor price action closely, reduce risk exposure, or consider partial profit-taking. For long-term investors, however, the broader picture remains encouraging. XRP is widely believed to be in Wave 3 of an Elliott Wave structure, a phase typically marked by powerful gains. With regulatory clarity in the U.S., growing utility, and expanding partnerships, XRP appears well-positioned for continued growth beyond the short-term noise. Final Thoughts XRP‚Äôs entry into overbought territory is a valid technical concern, but not necessarily a reason for alarm. As STEPH IS CRYPTO rightly points out, indicators like the Stoch RSI often precede pauses in price action, not full trend reversals. With strong fundamentals and ongoing institutional interest, XRP‚Äôs longer-term outlook remains positive. Holders would do well to stay informed, manage risk appropriately, and view any short-term dips as potential setups for the next major move.

49007177,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=774424,1753564231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49007177.jpeg,S√£o Paulo faces major job and economic losses if the U.S. goes ahead with a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/brazil-governors-blame-lula-for-mishandling-u-s-relations-amid-tariff-risk/,"Faced with the looming prospect of a 50% U.S. tariff set for Aug.‚ÄØ1, officials in Brazil‚Äôs richest state are rushing to soften the blow on local companies and jobs. Governor Tarc√≠sio de‚ÄØFreitas said on Saturday that as many as 120,000 positions could disappear and gross state product might fall 2.7‚ÄØ% if the U.S. goes ahead with the tariff. Speaking at a forum hosted by XP‚ÄØInc. in the state capital, he warned that ‚Äúthe possibility of Caterpillar moving its output to another country‚Äù is worrisome, along with the ripple effects on small coffee growers, the orange sector, and aircraft maker Embraer. According to a Bloomberg report state will give five‚Äëyear loans to help firms with cash needs. The governor said his team is also talking to U.S. lawmakers, companies, and officials to explain the danger and push for changes. Brazilian governors criticize Lula over tariff dispute Freitas shared the stage with governors Ratinho‚ÄØJunior of Paran√° and Ronaldo‚ÄØCaiado of Goi√°s. They asked the federal government to talk with the U.S., saying the tariff could hurt meat plants and organic sugar producers in their states. They criticized President Luiz‚ÄØIn√°cio Lula‚ÄØda‚ÄØSilva‚Äôs handling of relations with U.S. President Donald‚ÄØTrump, noting they had not been consulted before key decisions. ‚ÄúGovernors were not consulted by the federal government on these decisions,‚Äù Caiado said. Ratinho‚ÄØJunior added that former president Jair‚ÄØBolsonaro ‚Äúis not more important than the trade relationship between Brazil and the U.S.‚Äù All three leaders are seen as potential challengers to Lula in next year‚Äôs election. Meanwhile in the U.S the Trump administration is preparing a fresh emergency declaration to justify the tariff, according to people familiar with internal discussions. Because Brazil runs a goods trade deficit with the United States, unlike most targets of earlier tariff actions, officials are said to be seeking a different legal basis. Staff from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative briefed congressional aides this week on the plan, the sources said. Neither USTR nor the White House commented publicly. The news sent the Brazilian real down as much as 1% against the dollar on the day. Lula urges calm before the U.S tariff storm President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva spoke lightly about the threat of U.S. duties, saying Brazil will respond if the tariffs take effect but won‚Äôt pick fights it doesn‚Äôt need. At a July event in S√£o Paulo , he stressed the need to safeguard Brazil‚Äôs sovereignty and economy. If Washington imposes its planned charges, Lula said Brazil will act, yet always in keeping with its values and global partnerships. His new finance minister echoed former President Haddad‚Äôs assurance that Brazil will not go after U.S. firms on Brazilian soil. He added that Brazil‚Äôs aim is fair trade, not tit‚Äëfor‚Äëtat retaliation. The tariff threat, first aired earlier this month, is widely viewed as support for Bolsonaro, who faces trial over an alleged effort to overturn his 2022 loss. Trump has urged Lula to drop what he calls a ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù against his ally. Lula, for his part, has insisted the judiciary is independent and has hinted at retaliatory steps if duties are imposed. In a Friday address, the Brazilian president said Trump had been ‚Äúmisled‚Äù about the case. ‚ÄúIf President Trump had called me, I certainly would have explained to him what‚Äôs happening with the former president,‚Äù Lula said. ‚ÄúBolsonaro is not being persecuted; he is being tried.‚Äù Two Brazilian officials familiar with the situation argue that drafting a new emergency order shows the 50% rate is ‚Äúa sanction in search of legal justification.‚Äù While Trump could still alter the number, the levy, if enacted, would take effect in less than a week, keeping state and federal authorities on both sides of the dispute working against the clock.

With more pro-crypto bills on the way, the markets have responded. Altcoins are rallying, and Cardano and Solana have returned to the spotlight. As the attention of institutional and retail investors converges on these major Layer‚Äë1 blockchains, a newcomer, MAGACOIN‚ÄØFINANCE , is quietly stealing the show with an explosive early performance on the cusp of exchange listings. Cardano (ADA): Technical Revival Amid On-Chain Slowdown Cardano has reasserted itself as a chart darling in July 2025, climbing from a dip at $0.73 to hover near $0.85. Recent institutional signals add to the optimism with ADA spiking 15% on July 17 following news of new partnerships and integration upgrades. Key among them is interoperability with the XRP Ledger via Tokeo Wallet and EMURGO‚Äôs rollout of a ‚ÄúCardano Card‚Äù for real-world spending. The network‚Äôs ecosystem also expanded to 2,005 active decentralized applications, which indicates that developer and user interest remain robust. Even as the on-chain metrics remain soft for Cardano with slow transaction growth, slump in DeFi TVL, and declining fee revenue, a regulatory tailwind and upcoming ETF clarity suggest ADA may be poised for another breakout. Solana (SOL): Outpacing the Competition Solana continues to show strength. Despite retracing to around $141 recently, SOL has rebounded sharply‚Äîup about 35% in July to trade near $177‚Äîand now targets a $220 resistance zone. Fundamentals also favor SOL. Solana leads in memecoin and NFT transaction volumes, accounting for nearly 60% of blockchain memecoin activity. Institutional interest is accelerating with more companies building SOL Treasury, and the debut of the first Solana‚Äëfocused ETF (SSK) in the US has brought more mainstream access to SOL, as everyone waits for the first spot SOL ETFs. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Grabbing Attention MAGACOIN‚ÄØFINANCE has fast‚Äëemerged as a dark‚Äëhorse player in Crypto Week‚Äôs renewed frenzy. With its presale-to-exchange gains already past 175% , it‚Äôs proving its narrative has more than hype to it. The project has already drawn in a serious user base and engaged community by laying the groundwork for explosive liquidity once it hits listings on the centralized and decentralized exchange, which is on its roadmap. What‚Äôs Fueling the Current Altcoin Boom? We‚Äôre witnessing a post‚Äëlegislation rally. President Donald Trump‚Äôs signing of the GENIUS Act into law and the other pro-crypto legislative efforts in the US have unlocked fresh capital as regulatory clarity now supports market re-entry. In this shift, established altcoins Cardano and Solana are benefiting directly, but narrative-rich, utility-driven community projects like MAGACOIN‚ÄØFINANCE stand to gain even more. Final Thoughts ADA and SOL are surging on technicals and institutional tailwinds amidst major wins for the crypto sector. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs presale-to-exchange momentum and vibrant community signal a fresh contender and the Next Big Listing Play?

The losses amount to tens of millions, and it‚Äôs expected that more will be identified. An Elaborate Scheme The U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office in the Western District of Washington filed a civil action on Tuesday, demanding the forfeiture of cryptocurrency assets valued at roughly $7.1 million.¬†The funds were seized during an investigation into a scheme involving fraudulent investment in oil and gas, which Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller announced. The assets are only a fraction of the $97 million obtained by coconspirators between June 2022 and July 2024, which Homeland Security Investigations seized in December last year. ‚ÄúThe co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims,‚Äù said Attorney Miller. ‚ÄúFederal investigators and prosecutors in our office moved as quickly as possible to trace and seize the cryptocurrency so that some of the losses can be returned to victims.‚Äù According to the filing and other case records, the plot was presented as escrow accounts for purchasing oil tank storage in either Rotterdam, the Netherlands, or Houston, which spanned from at least August 2022 through August 2024. The victims were convinced to send money to these accounts, where the conspirators indicated that investors could make significant profits by renting out the oil tank storage to others. At least seven separate entities have been marked where funds were sent. However, the good news ended there, as once the funds were sent, no further information on the investment was provided, and the co-schemers just stopped replying. How The Funds Were Moved A resident from Newcastle, Washington, Geoffrey K. Auyeung, 47, was indicted as a coconspirator in the U.S in August 2024, being charged with receiving the majority of the funds generated by the deceptive plan. The money was quickly shuffled to one or more of at least 81 accounts at various institutions, either offshore or not, or to one of the at least 19 different crypto accounts. The assets were then funneled into various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, USDT, USDC, and Ethereum, the majority of which was further transferred to accounts at the Binance exchange. The forfeiture filing further states that the crypto accounts, which were seized, were linked to individuals in Russia and Nigeria, where some of the victims‚Äô funds, used to purchase digital assets, were also sent to exchanges in those countries. At least one of the money markets in Russia or Nigeria is alleged to have facilitated money laundering for transnational criminal organizations, including terrorist organizations and other parties that have been known to violate international trade sanctions. At the time of Auyeung‚Äôs arrest, $2.3 million was seized from his bank accounts, which is in addition to the $7.1 million in crypto the government is seeking to forfeit. If the court approves the forfeiture, the funds will be distributed accordingly to the victims.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC‚Äôs price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin‚Äôs role in the so-called ‚ÄúTrump trade,‚Äù with the president-elect‚Äôs positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: ‚ÄúDoes Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWill Bitcoin go up?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere will Bitcoin be in 5 years?‚Äù Let‚Äôs answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $114,519, beginning a bearish trend to $107,425. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. This pushed the BTC price toward $118,100. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its ‚Äúhalving‚Äù events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we‚Äôll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin‚Äôs price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin‚Äôs price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan‚Äôs Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of ‚ÄúBitcoin bubble‚Äù in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin‚Äôs future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year‚Äôs start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October‚Äôs Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 21:40:00

A new Gallup survey found that just 14% of U.S. adults own crypto, a figure that has been growing but still represents a small slice of the investing public. The study, conducted in mid-June, revealed deep skepticism about cryptocurrencies. 60% of respondents said they have no interest in ever buying cryptocurrency, and just 17% admitted they‚Äôre intrigued. Only 4% of respondents said they plan on buying crypto in the near future. Gallup also found that among U.S. investors owning more than $10,000 in stocks, bonds or mutual funds, 55% considered the asset class ‚Äúvery risky.‚Äù Still, ownership rates skyrocketed from 2% in 2018 to 17%. This skepticism isn't surprising, despite the U.S. having a pro-crypto president and clearer regulations that have recently been rolling in. While the 2021 bull run ushered in extreme volatility and made crypto a mainstream topic, the subsequent brutal crypto winter, which saw many high-profile bankruptcies, such as FTX, as well as scams and exploits, soured retail investors' sentiment. Although crypto has since then seen institutional investors jumping into the market, helping it become more legitimate, many retail investors, burned by the past losses, are likely still staying vigilant. Four years ago, Gallup found that 6% of U.S. investors owned cryptocurrency. That figure has since risen but may be conservative, as a Fed survey revealed 12% ownership among U.S. investors. Diving deeper into the ownership, the demographic divide is stark. While one in four men aged 18 to 49 owns crypto, the survey found that ownership drops sharply among women and older adults. College graduates and high-income earners report above-average participation, but seniors and low-income households remain largely absent from the space, the survey shows. Knowledge gaps also persist. Nearly everyone surveyed had heard of crypto, but only 35% said they actually understood how it works. Familiarity was highest among younger men and the wealthier. Even among those who claim to understand crypto, most still call it a risky bet. Among U.S. investors, 64% see the asset class as ‚Äúvery risky,‚Äù up from 60% in 2021. The survey found that about one in seven Americans owns crypto, while nearly six in 10 own stocks or real estate. Only 4% of adults said crypto is the best long-term investment.",Finance|Gallup|Bitcoin|Survey|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-26 22:00:00

49010656,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=794443,1753569007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49010656.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Holds Above $115,000 ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why This Level Is Significant",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-hold-above-115000-why/,"After surging to a record high around $123,000 in the second week of July, the Bitcoin price action for the rest of the month has been largely choppy. However, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped to a level just above $115,000 on Friday, July 25. This abrupt decline came with the expected question in the market: Is the rally over? Here‚Äôs How $115,000 Could Be Critical To BTC‚Äôs Price In a recent post on the social media platform X, crypto pundit Burak Tama√ß highlighted the relevance of the region below the $115,000 level for the price of BTC. This on-chain observation, which is based on the BTC Supply Distribution URPD, showed how the Bitcoin price could play out in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Bounce off This Support Level In Reversal Campaign For $121,000 The Supply Distribution URPD metric tracks the amount of Bitcoin supply last moved or transferred at particular price levels. This metric is specifically useful in identifying potential support (demand) and resistance (supply) zones. Tama√ß pointed out on X that there is a significant void in Bitcoin‚Äôs Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) distribution just around the $110,000 and $115,000 bracket. What this means is that there have been relatively fewer significant transactions around this price region in the recent past. However, this UTXO gap sits above a price region ($90,000 to $110,000) thick with significant investor activity. Considering the level of activity within this zone, there is an increased likelihood of the premier cryptocurrency finding a support cushion just within the UTXO gap. In this context, the support is to be above the $110,000 price level. As mentioned earlier, after Bitcoin reached a new all-time-high price, the premier cryptocurrency entered a consolidatory phase, where it has moved mostly sideways in the second half of July. During this period of indecisive price action, it can be observed that the Bitcoin price has not gone below the $115,000 price. What this means is that the $110,000 and $115,000 zone is likely where a new UTXO support has been established. If Bitcoin prevails above this price level, we can expect to see continued bullish momentum. On the flip side, if the $110,000 ‚Äî 115,000 support zone fails, the flagship cryptocurrency might experience a severe sell-off. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $118,050, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

Meme coins still trigger fast moves, but long-term energy is moving toward coins with working features, updates, and useful systems. Here are four top trending cryptos drawing strong attention for different reasons. BlockDAG brings a unique network design and major presale results. Cronos stands out for its DeFi tools and supply cuts. BONK is pushing growth plans, and Kaspa speeds up with parallel block handling. Each one tells a different story for what matters in 2025, whether it‚Äôs usage, speed, or structure. 1. BlockDAG: Fast Tech, Big Rewards, and Built for Daily Buyers BlockDAG isn‚Äôt based on old projects or forks. It is a fresh Layer 1 built on DAG-style tech. That setup allows faster moves, no delays, and much better scaling than older blockchains. It‚Äôs made for daily activity, not just quick trading. But what really makes BlockDAG (BDAG) different is how it treats buyers. The project runs Buyer Battles, where each day‚Äôs top BDAG buyer gets all leftover coins from a 25 million BDAG pool. It‚Äôs a strong daily challenge that rewards bold entries. There‚Äôs also a Referral Program. Anyone who brings new people into the presale earns 25% of the referred value right away. Whether leading the day or helping it grow, buyers stay at the center of the setup. All this is backed by real numbers: $353 million raised, 24.3 billion coins sold, and a locked price of $0.0016 until August 11. In a space where early supporters often get left out, BlockDAG gives them more ways to stay ahead before the launch. 2. Cronos: DeFi Strength With Real-World Reach Cronos is gaining quiet traction in 2025‚Äôs list of top trending cryptos, not just for its price near $0.076. Though low-cost, it powers a strong network. Built by Crypto.com, Cronos can process up to 100,000 transactions each second and supports a DeFi system with over $500 million in total value locked. Its role in NFTs and Visa-linked partnerships gives it wider usability and brand appeal. A large-scale burn in 2024 removed 25% of its 30 billion supply, creating room for scarcity over time. CRO avoids meme hype by offering features for payments, staking, and smart contracts. That keeps it steady even when trends shift. 3. Bonk: Memecoin That Actually Has a Use Bonk (BONK) has gained notice by doing what few meme coins can: giving people more than hype. It runs on Solana and connects to its DeFi and NFT tools through BonkSwap and BonkBot, helping it work inside a real ecosystem. Over 1.6 trillion coins were burned this year, reducing supply just as buzz around a Solana ETF grows. While price dips have come and gone, charts suggest BONK may recover again. Among top trending cryptos, BONK is rare as a meme coin with use, tools, and plans for staying active. 4. Kaspa: Smart Design and Support From Developers Kaspa is rising fast among top trending cryptos because of its blend of deep tech and a strong support base. With a price near $0.08, it stands out by using a blockDAG layout instead of standard chains. That makes it faster and allows many blocks at once, with nearly instant finality. The GHOSTDAG setup lets it grow without hurting decentralization, a tough goal in the space. No pre-mining and open supply rules brought in many developers, and a 350% jump in 2024 added more eyes. Some call for $1 in 2025, but even without that, the tech story is enough to stay on the radar. BlockDAG Brings It All Together in One Place All four of these projects earn their place as top trending cryptos, with each offering something different. Cronos builds on DeFi tools. Kaspa changes how networks scale. BONK blends memes with real features. But BlockDAG hits all three points at once. It mixes fast Layer 1 tech, buyer-focused rewards, and a 3025% return from the presale. While others shine in one area, BlockDAG moves across many fronts. With strong daily traction and growing community numbers, it offers more than hype. It may be the best crypto to buy now , before its price changes for good.

Bitcoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche are quietly posting strong price movements amid renewed accumulation across multiple tiers of the market. However, while blue-chip assets are steadily climbing, the biggest opportunity may lie in a low-cap political meme coin that‚Äôs gaining serious traction: Magacoin Finance. Bitcoin (BTC): Quiet Climb, Strong Foundation Bitcoin remains the backbone of the current market structure, climbing from below $100K to a peak of $123,236 before entering a controlled consolidation phase. A bearish engulfing candle near the top suggests some profit-taking, but higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart confirm that bulls are still in control. Support is now building around the $115,000 level, with strategic buyers eyeing this zone for re-entry. A confirmed breakout above $120,000 would likely accelerate momentum back toward the $123K mark and potentially new all-time highs. For many institutions, BTC‚Äôs stability is setting the tone for a broader crypto rebound. Uniswap (UNI): Breaking Resistance, Reclaiming Momentum Uniswap recently shattered a key resistance zone between $9.60 and $10.80, signaling a shift in market structure that analysts believe could unlock a 77% upside. With the token now trading above $10.30, the reclaim of this horizontal band marks the end of a prolonged consolidation period that began in early 2024. Volume remains steady, and technical indicators, particularly the Bollinger Band Power (BBP), suggest increased bullish volatility. If UNI continues to hold above the mid-Bollinger Band ($8.22), price targets between $12.83 and $18.40 remain valid in the coming weeks. For traders seeking blue-chip DeFi exposure, Uniswap is now back on the radar. Avalanche (AVAX): A Chain With Real-World Use and DeFi Inflows Avalanche has surged over 40% this month, recently breaking above $24 after reclaiming resistance near the $20 mark. With daily net inflows topping $120 million, surpassing SEI, Sui, and Aptos, AVAX has become the third-highest blockchain in terms of net capital movement. This level of investor activity reflects more than just hype; it shows confidence. Fueling the narrative is real-world utility. The U.S. state of Wyoming recently tested its Avalanche-powered stablecoin pilot, using the network to automate government payments and eliminate 45-day invoice delays. Built on AvaCloud infrastructure, Avalanche‚Äôs chain enables smart contract automation for approvals, compliance, and payments, highlighting its institutional appeal. MAGACOIN Finance: The Narrative-Powered Sleeper That May Explode Analysts are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a high-upside altcoin amid major token rallies. Fully decentralized and backed by whale investors, it features audit-verified contracts (HashEx, CertiK) and wallet integration with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet. With over 5,234 verified holders, MAGACOIN is moving from fringe meme to serious contender for Q4 2025. Its capped supply, rapid Telegram growth, and bold branding are attracting those who missed early PEPE and SHIB gains. The final presale phase is almost closed, giving early adopters access to staking multipliers and governance perks before launch. Conclusion: Rotation Season Is Underway Bitcoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche are quietly rallying, signaling renewed market strength, but the real alpha may lie in undervalued tokens yet to break out. MAGACOIN FINANCE gives retail investors a rare mix of decentralization, a potent political narrative, and audited security. As institutions crowd into blue chips, early-stage plays like MAGACOIN offer massive upside. With the presale closing fast and top analysts eyeing up to 75x returns, this could be 2025‚Äôs most talked-about breakout.

The prominent altcoin presently trades around $24, keeping in line with a long-standing range-bound movement. Meanwhile, popular market analyst Ali Martinez has shared some insights on the present AVAX market, highlighting a potential bullish scenario. Incoming AVAX Breakout? Here Are The Levels To Watch In an X post on July 25, Martinez provides a technical analysis on the AVAX market tipping the altcoin for a major price surge; Using the daily AVAX/USDT chart, the renowned analyst identified a constant trading range that has remained active from February to date. Related Reading: TRON Drops Q2 Report: Revenue, USDT Dominance Lead Multi-Quarter Highs This price range shows that AVAX prices have consistently moved between $15 and $27, forming a pivotal support and resistance in these price regions, respectively. Most notably, AVAX made another surge towards $27 following the crypto rebound in early July. However, the altcoin soon experienced another solid rejection for the third time in six months at the rather effective price barrier. Following this most recent rejection, AVAX found quick support around $23, another important price level in this trading range, which has previously acted as support or resistance depending on the price trend. If the market bulls can sustain the current buying pressure at this price zone, AVAX is likely to return to retest the $27 region. Interestingly, Ali Martinez explains that a successful breakout beyond $27 would pave the way for a quick climb to an immediate price target of $36 based on the Fibonacci retracement levels. This prediction presents a potential 46% price gain from current market prices and 38% from the breakout zone. On the other hand, failure to hold above the $23 price level may result in a bearish return to $15, marking a potentially catastrophic 34.78% decline from the support zone. Therefore, AVAX market forces must view the $23 as a critical region, which could influence a decisive breakout or breakdown in the mid-term. Related Reading: Wall Street‚Äôs Bold Bet: Bitcoin Could Hit $200K By December, Banking Giant Says AVAX Price Overview At the time of writing, AVAX trades at $24.81 following a slight 3.71% gain in the last seven days. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 31,84% indicating a significant decline in market interest and transaction volume. With the altseason reportedly underway, AVAX also remains one of the many altcoins in investors‚Äô consideration as a potential outperformer following an estimated 1,150% gain in the last bull run in 2021. With a market cap of $10.1 billion, AVAX continues to rank as the 17th largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Each of these top performing cryptos brings something different. BlockDAG focuses on mobile-friendly mining, VeChain is known for tracking supply chains, ONDO works on linking real-world assets to crypto, and FET uses AI tools to improve automation. BlockDAG‚Äôs X1 App has passed 2 million users, and its dual miner demo is now complete. The other three projects are all priced below $1 and are also moving forward quickly. Whether it‚Äôs expanding networks, teaming up with strong partners, or launching new features, these four projects are becoming more noticeable in the crypto space. 1. BlockDAG Gains 2M+ Users as X10 Miner Demo Wraps Up BlockDAG stands out among top performing cryptos thanks to its mobile-first approach. Over 2 million people are now using the X1 mining app, which lets users mine directly from their phones without needing extra hardware. The dual mining system, pairing the X1 app with the hardware-based X10 miner, has completed its demo, showing a smooth upgrade path for users who want more power. At $0.0016, BlockDAG has set its launch price at $0.05, pointing to a possible 3,025% return. The coin supply is fixed, which helps prevent the kind of value loss that happens in high-emission systems. The roadmap is already clear, and with the GLOBAL LAUNCH release happening on August 11, activity around the project is expected to grow even more. Alongside its pricing model, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining attention with real progress. It has already raised $353 million in presale and sold 24.3 billion coins. While the real market test will come after launch, the current scale suggests it‚Äôs ready for fast adoption. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release now less than a month away, BlockDAG is being watched closely for its combination of strong tech, growing user base, and low entry price. 2. VeChain: Expanding Reach Through Enterprise Solutions VeChain is trading below $0.024 and keeps building trust in supply chain tracking, product authentication, and carbon management. Its practical focus has helped it form partnerships with several well-known global companies. Among top performing cryptos with real-world utility, VeChain is notable for its dual-coin design, VET and VTHO, which supports smooth operations and contract execution. The recent VIP-202 update is aimed at improving governance and increasing scalability. Though it has not seen sharp price jumps, VeChain‚Äôs steady upgrades and low-inflation approach make it a stable choice for long-term use in its ecosystem. 3. Ondo Finance: Bridging Real Assets with DeFi Growth With a price close to $1, ONDO brings real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries onto the blockchain, making it an important name in institutional-grade DeFi. Its model appeals to traditional finance, working to connect off-chain value with on-chain liquidity. Supported by Coinbase Ventures, ONDO has gained listings on major exchanges, boosting its trading activity and reach. Among current top performing cryptos, ONDO is known for its focus on RWA integration and its capped supply of 10 billion. While rules for tokenized assets are still evolving, ONDO‚Äôs early efforts in this field give it a strong position for the next phase of adoption.. 4. Fetch.ai: ASI Alliance Drives AI-Powered Expansion FET trades just under $0.73 and is seen as one of the top performing cryptos with a focus on AI technology. Now part of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI), it works with SingularityNET and Ocean Protocol to build shared AI systems for decentralized platforms. Originally created to run autonomous agents for tasks like trading, logistics, and optimization, FET is now expanding its role under the ASI framework. Although AI-driven crypto tools are still growing, this partnership has improved visibility and combined technical expertise, strengthening its long-term outlook. Which Crypto Could Lead 2025 BlockDAG, VeChain, Ondo, and Fetch.ai each bring unique strengths, ranging from mining and supply solutions to AI and real-world finance. They all fall within the top performing crypto group, giving broader entry to the market. Among them, BlockDAG‚Äôs mobile-first mining model, large user base, and low starting price make it stand out as the GLOBAL LAUNCH release draws closer. At the same time, VeChain‚Äôs enterprise links, ONDO‚Äôs RWA strategy, and FET‚Äôs AI tools keep this list forward-looking and diverse. As these projects evolve, the key leaders will be defined by real progress and practical use cases.

The post came from crypto analyst Ted Pillows, who pointed to global liquidity metrics‚Äîespecially the M2 money supply‚Äîto argue that ETH should already be trading above $8,000. Trump, who reposted the claim on X, added just two words: ‚ÄúI agree.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the first time Trump‚Äôs son has shared bullish views on crypto. He‚Äôs previously revealed investments in Bitcoin, Solana, and other altcoins. His growing commentary reflects the increasing alignment between political figures and digital assets‚Äîespecially as Ethereum‚Äôs role expands within the broader financial system. That growing momentum has also spotlighted emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project quietly building steam among early adopters eager to catch the next wave of altcoin growth. Ethereum‚Äôs Fundamentals Are Strengthening Despite current price levels, Ethereum‚Äôs use cases are deepening. From DeFi applications to tokenized assets and institutional staking, its foundation is more robust than ever. Analyst Ted Pillows connected ETH‚Äôs lagging price to global monetary expansion, making the case that it‚Äôs significantly behind its potential value. While institutions are gradually warming up to Ethereum, retail investors may be asking whether they‚Äôve already missed the biggest gains. That‚Äôs why growing attention is shifting toward newer projects that offer high growth from a low base. The Golden Ticket to 26x Returns One of the projects drawing serious attention right now is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could deliver 26x returns for high-conviction investors. With early rounds selling out quickly and rising demand from crypto communities, the project is gaining comparisons to the early days of SHIBA INU‚Äîbut with a stronger development roadmap and real-time traction. Strategic investors are lining up for early access, hoping to capture exponential gains before major exchange listings go live. As the market seeks the next explosive altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming a top contender. Trump‚Äôs Endorsement Reflects a Wider Shift Eric Trump‚Äôs remarks aren‚Äôt just about Ethereum‚Äîthey represent a broader cultural and financial shift. Crypto is no longer a fringe movement; it‚Äôs increasingly part of mainstream financial discussion. As digital assets become more intertwined with politics, global economics, and innovation, the search for undervalued gems‚Äîboth large and small‚Äîwill only intensify. For investors, Ethereum remains a core piece of the puzzle. But with projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging and gaining momentum, those looking for the next big opportunity may want to consider acting before the window closes.

This sharp 6.7% decline comes after four straight weeks of bullish momentum, raising questions about whether the recent rally has finally run out of steam. Bitcoin, which had climbed past $120,000, retreated to $115,300, a 2.6% drop in just 24 hours. Ethereum dipped 1.3% to $3,596, while XRP suffered a more severe 3.6% decline, now hovering near $3.07. The sell-off appears linked to a combination of massive liquidations , shifting sentiment, and aggressive moves by major institutional players. Some early-stage tokens, however, are drawing fresh attention from investors seeking outsized returns. One such project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has surfaced on the radar after recent analyst reports identified a 12,300% ROI potential for early adopters. With demand surging and supply access still limited, the project is increasingly being compared to the early growth phases of coins like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN. Galaxy Digital Sell-Off Intensifies Market Pressure Concerns escalated when Galaxy Digital reportedly dumped 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.18 billion, on the market. On-chain data also showed the firm withdrawing $370 million in USDT from exchanges like Binance and Bybit‚Äîmoves often viewed as preparation for further selling. Shortly after, another 2,850 BTC (worth over $330 million) was transferred to centralized platforms, amplifying fears that the sell-off was far from over. This sparked a wave of panic selling and triggered a series of margin calls across the market. Leverage Wipeout Across Top Coins Over $721 million in leveraged positions were liquidated in just 24 hours. Ethereum led the cascade with $163.9 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin at $155.5 million, and XRP with nearly $49 million wiped out. Within a 12-hour stretch, $273 million in long positions were cleared, including a single liquidation on OKX valued at $17.35 million. These forced sell-offs accelerated the downturn and exposed the fragility of overleveraged trading strategies in volatile markets. Sentiment Split: Fearless Buyers or Fools Rushing In? Despite the chaos, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in ‚ÄúGreed‚Äù territory, hinting that many retail investors still see this dip as a buy-the-dip opportunity , not the beginning of a larger downturn. Analysts warn, however, that misplaced optimism could deepen the fall if key support zones fail. Technical Breakdown and Institutional Rotation Bitcoin has slipped below a critical support level at $116,000, a zone traders are closely watching for signs of stabilization. Ethereum is facing headwinds from rising validator queues, while XRP risks falling to $2.72 if current momentum persists. Institutional reshuffling may also be adding fuel to the volatility. Firms like BlackRock and Fidelity are reportedly adjusting allocations, triggering short-term market shocks even as they maintain broader long-term exposure through Bitcoin ETFs. Some altcoins, however, managed to buck the trend. Vine, The Innovation Game, and Pepecoin each posted gains of over 30%, indicating that selective risk appetite still exists within the market. Conclusion Friday‚Äôs sell-off was a wake-up call for many overconfident bulls. Still, the broader outlook remains mixed‚Äîsome interpret this as a healthy cooldown, while others brace for deeper losses. As investors scan the market for resilient opportunities, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, backed by a forecasted 12,300% ROI , are fast becoming focal points for those seeking early-stage upside during uncertain times.
