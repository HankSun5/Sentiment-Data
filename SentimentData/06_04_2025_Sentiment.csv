In a development that suggests something significant may be underway, four identical transfers of XRP—each comprising 66,964,285 XRP—have been executed in rapid succession, totaling 267,857,140 XRP, worth approximately $572 million at current market rates. The insight was shared by prominent crypto watcher Amelie on X, who noted the matching size and timing of the transactions, adding, “Something’s brewing.” BREAKING: #XRP WHALES ARE ACTIVE: 4x THE SAME AMOUNT OF XRP WAS TRANSFERRED, 267,857,140 XRP WORTH $572,238,240 IN TOTAL! SOMETHING‘S BREWING pic.twitter.com/RbsEg1ct7O — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) April 4, 2025 Whale Movements and Market Implications Whale transactions —typically defined as large movements of cryptocurrency by individuals or entities holding vast amounts—are often interpreted as early signals of market shifts. Whether it’s preparation for institutional redistribution, strategic exchange positioning, or internal liquidity movements, the symmetry and scale of these XRP transfers are hard to ignore. The fact that all four transfers carried precisely the same amount of XRP points to calculated intent rather than random movement. This kind of coordination suggests a sophisticated strategy behind the scenes, possibly linked to upcoming developments in the broader Ripple ecosystem or macro market shifts surrounding XRP. XRP’s Price Action and Market Sentiment Amid this surge in whale activity, XRP continues to demonstrate strong price behavior, with Rowen Exchange highlighting that the digital asset has repeatedly rebounded after testing the $2.00 level. The repeated support at this key price threshold is leading many to speculate that $2.00 has effectively become XRP’s new floor—an idea backed by increasing trading volume and institutional interest. The timing of these whale transfers—occurring just as XRP flirts with this key support level—raises the possibility that large players are positioning themselves in anticipation of a significant breakout or strategic announcement. It’s not uncommon for such transactions to precede major market moves, either upward or downward, depending on the intent of the stakeholders involved. Speculation Over What’s Brewing While the source or purpose of the transfers remains unknown, the crypto community is alive with speculation. Some analysts believe this activity may be related to internal liquidity reshuffling by Ripple-affiliated institutions, while others suggest that a possible resolution to the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case could be driving high-stakes maneuvering. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adding to the intrigue is the broader regulatory and institutional context. Ripple’s recent strides—such as its expansion into stablecoin offerings and continued enterprise partnerships—have positioned XRP as a core asset with growing utility in real-world finance. Against this backdrop, large transfers could also reflect onboarding activities for new corridors or enterprise users. The activity of XRP whales is often a precursor to heightened volatility or significant price moves, and this latest sequence of identical, high-volume transactions is no exception. With a total of 267,857,140 XRP shuffled deliberately, and XRP consistently finding footing at $2.00, both technical and on-chain data suggest that the digital asset is entering a critical phase. Whether this is the calm before a bullish storm or a strategic recalibration ahead of regulatory milestones remains to be seen. But one thing is clear— whales are moving , and the market is watching closely. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Qubetics Presale Gains Traction While Polkadot and Render Power the Web3 Stack,https://thecoinrise.com/top-cryptos-to-hold-for-short-term-qubetics-presale-gains-traction-while-polkadot-and-render-power-the-web3-stack/,"Crypto opportunities come in waves. Some are lightning-quick and speculative. Others, well-planned and packed with technical firepower. For early adopters and seasoned participants alike, timing isn’t everything—but it sure counts for a lot. That’s why short-term holds with high-upside utility are gaining ground, especially across Latin America where flexibility and access matter. Scanning for the top cryptos to hold for short term means more than just chasing trending coins. It’s about spotting projects with traction, relevance, and tools that solve real-world problems. Right now, Qubetics (TICS) is one of the sharpest names in that category. With Polkadot and Render also staying competitive, this trio forms a compelling snapshot of what short-term strength can look like in 2025. Qubetics (TICS): Pioneering Real-World Tokenization Qubetics is earning its position as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term , but it’s not doing it through hype. It’s doing it by launching real-world tools—starting with its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace , designed to bring physical and financial assets into the blockchain ecosystem. Here’s where it clicks. Businesses in Peru or freelancers in Brazil can tokenize property, contracts, or unpaid invoices, then trade or fractionalize them on-chain. Instead of waiting weeks for settlements or dealing with third-party red tape, they gain liquidity and access in real-time. For professionals juggling local and cross-border work, this tool changes the game. Not theoretical. Fully functional. Another major feature solidifying Qubetics as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term is TICSScan . This blockchain explorer lets users monitor the full stack—from validator performance and block data to smart contract tracking and transaction analytics. It brings a transparency-first design that’s critical for any community-driven network. Whether you’re a developer deploying contracts or a backer following token flow, TICSScan puts everything within reach. Presale Performance and Analysts’ Predictions for $TICS What truly sets Qubetics apart is how it bundles utility and opportunity. The crypto presale is in Stage 28 , with over 506 million $TICS tokens sold to 24,300+ holders , raising $15.8 million . At a current price of $0.1430 , it’s drawing major buzz. This isn’t just another early-stage token. It’s a tech-forward asset in an accessible price window. Analysts are eyeing multiple price outcomes. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that’s a 599% ROI . At $5, it jumps to 3396% ROI . Further estimates range up to $6 ( 4095% ), $10 ( 6892% ), and a massive $15 after mainnet launch, translating to a 10,388% ROI . For short-term buyers who want both vision and real entry points, Qubetics makes a hard-to-ignore case. Polkadot (DOT): Cross-Chain Interoperability at Web3 Scale Polkadot has proven it’s not just another Layer 1—it’s the backbone of a multi-chain future. Designed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot enables cross-chain data and asset transfers through its relay chain and parachain system. That makes it one of the most technically advanced blockchains in the space. For the short term, what gives Polkadot strong potential is its parachain auction mechanism and growing ecosystem of specialized chains. Projects can build tailor-made blockchains that plug into the Polkadot relay chain, gaining security and interoperability from day one. With dozens of active parachains already running DeFi, identity, gaming, and real-world asset use cases, the network is maturing fast. From a token perspective, DOT is critical for governance, bonding parachains, and staking. It sees constant usage across governance votes and crowdloans, providing utility beyond speculative trading. Polkadot also benefits from major integrations and updates like asynchronous backing and XCM (cross-consensus messaging), which are set to improve performance and composability. For short-term holders looking for infrastructure-level tokens with proven ecosystems, Polkadot stands out. Its steady growth, large developer community, and multichain vision continue to position it as a leader—especially as cross-chain apps begin dominating in 2025. Render (RNDR): GPU Power for the Decentralized AI Era Render is where high-performance graphics meet blockchain. Originally created to decentralize GPU rendering for artists, Render has now evolved into a core piece of the AI + blockchain fusion stack . It allows developers, researchers, and content creators to access GPU resources on-demand through a decentralized marketplace, powered by the RNDR token. As AI workloads increase and demand for GPU compute skyrockets, Render is riding a second wave of adoption. Its integration with OctaneRender, support for Hollywood-level VFX workflows, and now machine learning processing make RNDR one of the most in-demand utility tokens in the short term. Render doesn’t just appeal to creatives—it’s being actively adopted by AI startups, DePIN projects, and decentralized cloud networks that need scalable GPU rendering at a fraction of centralized costs. The protocol incentivizes node operators to contribute idle GPUs, creating an open compute layer without reliance on Nvidia resellers or data center bottlenecks. What makes RNDR a solid short-term hold is its dual exposure to both Web3 infrastructure and AI growth. It’s rare for a token to sit at the intersection of two explosive markets—and Render pulls it off with tech already in production. With demand forecasted to grow throughout 2025, Render’s short-term potential feels like it’s just warming up. Final Thoughts Not every project that promises gains actually delivers. But when it comes to real-world function, strong backing, and usability, Qubetics, Polkadot, and Render each offer different flavors of value. Polkadot delivers scalable cross-chain infrastructure. Render unlocks decentralized GPU compute. And Qubetics? It’s bringing asset tokenization to the street-level with tools that anyone can use. Still, only Qubetics currently offers a live presale and a price point that leaves room for massive upside. It’s not just about the numbers. It’s about access—and Qubetics is making that part easy for now. For those on the hunt for the top cryptos to hold for short term , this is the moment to move before windows close and prices rise. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1: Why is Qubetics one of the top cryptos to hold for short term? Qubetics combines a real-world asset tokenization marketplace, detailed blockchain explorer (TICSScan), and a live presale priced at $0.1430. With over 506 million tokens sold and $15.8M raised, it offers both utility and entry. 2: What makes Polkadot suitable for short-term holding? Polkadot supports a thriving multi-chain ecosystem and lets developers launch scalable parachains for DeFi, gaming, and real-world assets.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-battles-major-resistance-heres-the-implication/,"Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal moment in its market journey, now confronting a critical resistance cluster that could define its near-term trajectory. According to crypto market analyst Ali, BTC is grappling with the $87,000 level—a zone where three significant technical barriers converge: the 50-day moving average (MA), the 200-day MA, and a descending trendline originating from its all-time high. This confluence of resistance levels marks a crucial battleground for Bitcoin bulls and bears alike. Historically, when such technical indicators overlap, the resulting price action tends to be highly volatile and often decisive in determining whether a breakout or breakdown will occur. #Bitcoin $BTC is up against a major resistance cluster at $87,000, where the 50-day MA, 200-day MA, and the descending trendline from the all-time high all converge. pic.twitter.com/llxPXsfQDY — Ali (@ali_charts) April 5, 2025 Triple Resistance Threatens BTC Momentum The $87,000 mark is not just another psychological barrier—it is now loaded with technical weight. The 50-day MA typically serves as a short- to mid-term trend indicator, while the 200-day MA signals longer-term momentum and investor sentiment. When both converge at the same level, it usually highlights a zone of heightened resistance or support, depending on the direction of the price approach. Adding to the complexity is the presence of a descending trendline drawn from Bitcoin’s previous all-time high. This trendline has repeatedly served as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s rallies in recent months. A confluence of this trendline with the 50- and 200-day MAs creates what traders often call a “technical choke point”—a level where strong conviction is needed for the price to break through. Ali, known for his precision in technical market analysis, emphasized in his post on X that this specific confluence makes $87,000 a “ major resistance cluster ” that Bitcoin must decisively clear to unlock further upside potential. Contextualizing BTC in the Broader Crypto Market This development in Bitcoin’s chart comes at a time when the broader crypto market is exhibiting signs of divergence between digital assets and traditional equities. As Rowen Exchange recently pointed out, assets like XRP have been holding strong at their key support levels—particularly around the $2.00 mark—demonstrating resilience even as macroeconomic concerns weigh on U.S. stocks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin’s confrontation with its resistance cluster adds another layer of complexity to this dynamic. A decisive breakout above $87,000 could act as a bullish signal not just for BTC, but for altcoins like XRP that are already poised for upward moves. On the other hand, failure to breach this zone might invite another period of consolidation or even a deeper correction. What Comes Next? Market participants are now watching closely to see how Bitcoin handles the pressure. A clean break and sustained close above $87,000 would likely trigger renewed bullish momentum, potentially pushing BTC toward new highs in the coming months. However, if resistance holds firm, Bitcoin may retreat to test lower support zones, potentially dragging sentiment across the broader market with it. As traders analyze the technical landscape, attention remains fixed on volume, RSI divergence, and other market signals to anticipate whether the bulls have the strength to overcome this pivotal wall. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s encounter with the $87,000 resistance cluster is more than just a chart pattern—it’s a critical test of market conviction and trend direction. With key indicators now overlapping at this juncture, the next few days could be instrumental in shaping the next chapter of Bitcoin’s journey.

It is now leveraging a tactic known as “ClickFix” to target job seekers in the cryptocurrency sector, particularly within centralized finance (CeFi). This approach marks an adaptation of the group’s earlier “Contagious Interview” campaign, which was previously aimed at developers and engineers in artificial intelligence and crypto-related roles. Lazarus Exploits Crypto Hiring In the newly observed campaign , Lazarus has shifted its focus to non-technical professionals, such as marketing and business development personnel, by impersonating major crypto firms like Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and even stablecoin issuer Tether. The attackers build fraudulent websites mimicking job application portals and lure candidates with fake interview invitations. These sites often include realistic application forms and even requests for video introductions, fostering a sense of legitimacy. However, when a user attempts to record a video, they are shown a fabricated error message, which typically suggests a webcam or driver malfunction. The page then prompts the user to run PowerShell commands under the guise of troubleshooting, thereby triggering the malware download. This ClickFix method, though relatively new, is becoming more prevalent due to its psychological simplicity – since users believe they are resolving a technical issue, and not executing malicious code. According to Sekoia, the campaign draws on materials from 184 fake interview invitations, referencing at least 14 prominent companies to bolster credibility. As such, the latest tactic demonstrates Lazarus’s growing sophistication in social engineering and its ability to exploit the professional aspirations of individuals in the competitive crypto job market. Interestingly, this shift also suggests that the group is expanding its targeting criteria by aiming not just at those with access to code or infrastructure but also at those who might handle sensitive internal data or be in a position to facilitate breaches inadvertently. Despite the emergence of ClickFix, Sekoia reported that the original Contagious Interview campaign remains active. This parallel deployment of strategies suggests that North Korea’s state-sponsored collective may be testing their relative effectiveness or tailoring tactics to different target demographics. In both cases, the campaigns share a consistent goal – delivering info-stealing malware through trusted channels and manipulating victims into self-infection. Lazarus Behind Bybit Hack The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officially attributed the $1.5 billion attack on Bybit to the Lazarus Group. Hackers targeting the crypto exchange employed fake job offers to trick staff into installing tainted trading software known as “TraderTraitor.” Although crafted to look authentic through cross-platform JavaScript and Node.js development, the applications embedded malware designed to steal private keys and execute illicit transactions on the blockchain.

However, this minor uptick only follows the largely negative performance earlier seen in the week. Notably, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez postulates the ninth-largest cryptocurrency could still experience steeper market losses if certain technical support fails to hold. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Marks 1 Billion Transactions Milestone, But Why Is SHIB Price Still Struggling? Cardano Critical Support Break Could Lead To 36% Decline In a recent post on X, Martinez shares a cautionary insight on the current ADA market structure hinting at a potential price fall. Based on the Fibonacci retracement levels, Martinez’s analysis indicates that Cardano still trades near a vital support zone despite recent gains. The Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines commonly used to identify potential support and resistance zones. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence and are widely used in anticipating a price fall, gain, consolidation, or reversal. Looking at the chart below, ADA currently trades at $0.66 which is just above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.63 – a price zone that has acted as a resilient support level in recent weeks. Ali Martinez warns a daily close below $0.63 would signal a bearish shift in market control at this level paving the way for a further decline. In this case, Cardano could fall to test the next significant support at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level around $0.53. If the selling pressure prevails at this zone, ADA prices could potentially slide to $0.42 representing the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level.

Cardano has struggled to maintain a prolonged bullish form after reaching a local peak of $1.30 in early December 2024. Since then, ADA prices have been in a corrective phase alongside the broader crypto market. For ADA bulls, defending the $0.63 price level is crucial to sustaining any valid bullish outlook. However, a successful price reclaim of the $0.78-$0.80 price zone would signal an impending price rally and market rebound for the altcoin. At the time of writing, Cardano trades at $0.66 as earlier stated. Amid recent gains, ADA is down by 5.00% on its weekly chart and 33.58% on its monthly chart reflecting a domineering bearish influence in recent weeks. Meanwhile, daily trading volume has gained by 19.56% in the past 24 hours indicating a rise in market interest. This development suggests the recent price rally might be sustainable due to a strong conviction among buyers.

For the first time, certain stablecoins, now called covered stablecoins, might not be treated as securities. This change could give companies like Tether’s USTD and USDC more freedom, but it also means they must follow strict rules. What Are Covered Stablecoin Assets? According to the SEC, covered stablecoins are not meant to be investments. Instead, they must be stable, fast, and reliable ways to send or store money. They should not promise any profits, voting rights, or ownership. To be a covered stablecoin, the token must be fully backed 1:1 by the U.S. dollar, supported by low-risk, accessible assets, and always be able to be redeemed at full value. This makes covered stablecoins different from investment products, which aim to make people money. The SEC says these stablecoins will not be treated as securities under U.S. law because they are sold as “digital dollars,” not investments. David Sacks, a key White House crypto advisor, supports the change. He said it would ease rules for dollar-backed stablecoins backed by low-risk assets. Tether’s Response to the New Guidelines Tether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin , is already considering adjusting to the SEC’s new rules. Various assets, including cash, U.S. Treasuries, Bitcoin, and gold back USDT. However, the SEC’s new rules require stablecoins to be backed only by cash or safe assets. This means USDT might not qualify as a covered stablecoin. Tether is considering launching a new stablecoin that would only be backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries. This new coin would be designed to meet all the SEC’s rules. Meanwhile, USDT would likely continue to be used in markets with less stringent regulatory policies . While many welcome the new rules, not everyone in the SEC agrees. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has expressed concern that the new guidelines may oversimplify how stablecoins work. She believes the risks of these tokens are being ignored, and the new rules might confuse people about how stablecoins function. The Growing Role of Stablecoins Despite some uncertainty, the stablecoin market is growing quickly. In the first quarter of 2025, the market added over $30 billion. This shows that the demand for stablecoins is strong, even though the crypto market faces challenges. The SEC’s clarifying the rules around stablecoins could help these digital currencies become more trusted and widely used. It could also lead to more companies creating stablecoins that comply with U.S. regulations.

The company believes that this situation has historically been a precursor to major price movements and trend changes. “Bitcoin-altcoin correlation has fallen again, a sign that a major surge is approaching,” Alphractal said in his analysis, adding that historical data has shown that declines in altcoin-Bitcoin correlation often coincide with local peaks, strong bullish reactions, or periods of increased volatility. Related News: Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin Holders Should Love Tariffs, Explains Why According to the analytics firm, whales have once again started shorting Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many altcoins compared to retail investors. This trend is observed in the ratio known as the “Whale vs. Retail Investor Ratio.” Alphractal recalled that this ratio has previously increased before significant market fluctuations. On the other hand, according to the “Supply Age Bands” data, which classifies Bitcoin supply according to its age, Short-Term Investor Supply (Short-Term Holders – STH), which represents BTCs purchased in the last 3 months, is decreasing significantly. This indicates that investors' interest in accumulating and purchasing Bitcoin has decreased.

Kalshi uses the standard criteria of a recession, two business quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth, as reported by the United States Department of Commerce. Odds of a US recession on the prediction platform have nearly doubled since March 20 and mirror the current 2025 US recession odds on Polymarket, which traders on the platform currently place at 60%. The macroeconomic outlook for 2025 deteriorated rapidly following US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff order and the ensuing sell-off in capital markets, sparking fears of a prolonged bear market.

Source: kalshi Related: Bitcoin bulls defend $80K support as ‘World War 3 of trade wars’ crushes US stocks Trump's executive order throws markets in disarray The US President's executive order established a 10% baseline tariff rate for all countries and different ""reciprocal"" tariff rates on trading partners with existing tariffs on US import goods. Trump's announcement triggered an immediate stock market sell-off , wiping away over $5 trillion in shareholder value in a matter of days. Fears of a recession continue to grow as market analysts warn of a potentially protracted trade war that negatively impacts global markets and suppresses risk asset prices, including cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, President Trump has expressed confidence that the tariffs will strengthen the US economy long-term and correct any trade imbalances. ""The markets are going to boom,"" the President said on April 3, describing the current market sell-off as an expected part of the process. The stock market sell-off continues as stocks shed trillions in shareholder value. Source: TradingView Asset manager Anthony Pompliano recently speculated that President Trump deliberately crashed markets to bring down interest rates. Pompliano cited the reduction in 10-year US Treasury bonds as evidence that the President's strategy of forcing a recession to impact rates is working. Interest rates on 10-year US Treasury bonds declined from approximately 4.66% in January 2025 to just 4.00% on April 5. President Trump is also pressuring Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell to lower short-term interest rates.

Based on Fibonacci retracement levels and trend indicators, the analysis suggests that the digital asset could be approaching a critical period where a strong breakout might occur. #XRP – Short-Term Analysis: 1⃣Closing above $2.24: First sign of strength (21 EMA) 2⃣Closing above $2.30: Second sign of strength (Fib 0.382) 3⃣Closing above $2.47: Third sign of strength (Fib 0.5) – a strong signal! 4⃣Closing above $2.70: Yellow trend line and above… pic.twitter.com/6oW9rZgp4h — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 4, 2025 Critical Resistance Levels The analysis identifies multiple price levels that could indicate increasing bullish momentum for XRP. The first sign of strength would be a daily close above $2.24, which aligns with the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Moving beyond this level would suggest that the cryptocurrency is gaining upward momentum. A second important level is $2.30, which corresponds to the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. This would confirm that buyers are stepping in and defending higher support zones. A close above $2.47 (the 0.5 Fibonacci level) would be a strong confirmation that the price trend is shifting toward a potential breakout. The Key Breakout Zone The most critical resistance level in EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis is $2.70, which is aligned with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. Notably, another prominent analyst recently drew attention to $2.70 as a crucial resistance . If the cryptocurrency can close above this level, it would indicate a break above a key trendline, significantly increasing the likelihood of a sustained rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A breakout above $2.70 would suggest that market sentiment is shifting bullish, potentially paving the way for XRP to target the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, which is positioned around $5.04. This would represent a substantial increase from the current price of $2.11 and a new all-time high for the digital asset. Technical Outlook EGRAG CRYPTO shows that XRP has been trading within a ranging box, consolidating between support and resistance levels. The equilibrium level, identified at $2.00, serves as a psychological support zone where price action has frequently stabilized. If XRP fails to hold above this level, it could risk further downside movement toward $1.63, the next major support. However, a head-and-shoulder pattern recently formed on the chart suggests it could fall further if a bearish trend begins. The 21 EMA will play a crucial role in determining short-term momentum. As long as XRP stays above this moving average, bullish momentum remains intact. The most significant bullish confirmation investors should look out for is a daily close above $2.70, as this would indicate a potential breakout to a new all-time high.

As SHIB benefits from a renewal in market optimism, driven by changing market dynamics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has entered the spotlight with a presale that has sped through its presale to raise $6.2 million and staking 7,800 holders. Currently at stage 4 for $0.025 and expected to increase 20% to $0.03 in phase 5, early purchasers can be assured of a 140% profit at the eventual listing price of up to $0.06. Post-launch, analysts anticipate a surge will push MUTM to $3.50, making it one of the highest potential contenders for the crypto market in 2025. A Change in Perception of Shiba Inu Triggers Empires Theory Based on Shiba Inu’s most recent metrics, long-term holders make up 76% of its v ownership, provided the leading imposition by Bitcoin (74% ownership long-term) and Ethereum (74% ownership long-term). That kind of loyalty reflects the growing conviction that SHIB is truly beyond its meme origins (though its use as a meme lives on). Daily burns — peaking at 12,000% this week — and a growing Shibarium network reinforce its deflationary approach. SHIB rebounded off the aforementioned trendline and seems on course to complete a falling wedge double-bottom pattern, a bull reversal setup according to technical charts. A jump above $0.00001570 is the main hurdle to a 165% upward push, while a fall under $0.00001080 opens up deeper falls. As speculative momentum builds, experts warn SHIB’s dependence on community hype makes it potentially more vulnerable to volatility than utility-driven projects. Mutuum Finance Presale Fires Up With its structured lending model and presale incentives, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps attracting investors. Phase 4 is still live at $0.025, with buyers already putting their sights on a 20% leap to $0.03 in phase 5. The project’s tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at launch, but predictions reach further still — with post-listing bullish targets of $3.50 offering life-changing returns for early investors. Whereas meme coins have no real utility, MUTM’s decentralized lending platform gives the ability to create collateralized loans, allows passive income through mtTokens, and includes a buy-back system which creates continuous demand. Market confidence is further reinforced by over $6.2 million raised, and with $100,000 worth of GIVEAWAY, new entrants are faced with a sense of urgency. The Mutuum Finance team operates under a Certik audit of their smart contracts which demonstrates their initiative to validate the platform for potential investors. Mutuum Finance will soon publish its results on its social channels to prove the reliability of the platform’s technology. MUTM stands apart from most meme tokens through its high degree of transparency which highlights its goal of enduring long term success. Future releases of an overcollateralized stablecoin together with dynamic interest rates will unite financial common sense with DeFi innovation in MUTM. Market timing the next big movement Shiba Inu’s short-term technical patterns highlight temporary upside potential, whereas Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers the calculated gateway to the next evolution of crypto. Given that phase 4 is flying out the door and price rises are locked into each presale phase, delays risk missing out on the $0.025 floor. Buyers can secure immediate paper profits and prepare for exponential gains as the MUTM ecosystem activates. With the Certik audit only nearing its end & exchange listings approach, the opportunity for maximum returns reduce exponentially. Wealth-building potential in cryptocurrency rarely comes with such clarity. A Key to Success In the world of decentralized finance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides both quick presale success and a roadmap for long-term dominance. For those looking to buy 2025’s breakout pop stars, joining the presale now could be the one that gets away. Head over to the Mutuum Finance site now to join before phase 4 ends and the prices increase.

SUI has gained traction since its March low, but broader skepticism still limits confidence. The SUI price prediction is inching upward but remains dependent on sustained buying and stronger signals from the overall market. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has seen renewed interest as volume spikes, though it remains boxed in by mixed funding and a neutral trend. Where these trends remain unclear, BlockDAG is building momentum with user participation. Keynote 3 confirmed that over 1.2 million users are already mining through the X1 App and TG Tap Miner. With $211.5 million raised in presale and BDAG priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, attention is shifting to BlockDAG as one of the top crypto coins for real usage ahead of mainnet. SUI Price Prediction Eyes $3 After 25% Climb SUI has gained 25% from its March low, currently trading around $2.49. The price chart shows an inverse head and shoulders formation, often interpreted as a bullish sign. If it holds, the next major test sits around $2.85 to $3.00. One reason for the optimism is the network”s Total Value Locked (TVL), which rose by 19.4% in just three weeks, climbing from $1.03 billion to $1.23 billion. That increase supports a positive SUI price prediction—but only if trading volumes continue to follow and larger market sentiment stays positive. Resistance from the 100- and 200-day EMAs could stall momentum. If buyers remain consistent, though, the $3 mark is reachable in the near term. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Recovers as Volume Rises The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price dipped to $0.0000122 recently but bounced back to trade near $0.00001267. That modest rebound follows a volume jump of 39.78%, now reaching $261 million. This could reflect growing interest, but whether it holds depends on several technical and sentiment-based metrics. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has returned to 50.45 after nearly falling into oversold territory, and the MACD recently crossed into a short-term bullish zone. Yet the broader SHIB trend remains neutral. Funding rates have shifted back and forth since February, suggesting that confidence among futures traders is still limited. For now, the SHIB price may consolidate in this range unless another large catalyst shifts the trend either way. BlockDAG Hits 1.2M Users on Mining Tools BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 added clarity on user growth and confirmed what many in the space had already noticed—mass adoption has started before the mainnet even goes live. The X1 Miner App alone has onboarded over 800,000 daily users, offering simple mining functionality directly from mobile devices. Add to that the TG Tap Miner, a Telegram-based play-to-earn tool with more than 400,000 sign-ups and over 100,000 active daily players. These tools make it easy for everyday users to mine BDAG tokens without technical knowledge. BlockDAG has raised $211.5 million during its presale, and over 19.1 billion BDAG coins have already been sold. With the current token price at $0.0248 in Batch 27, the price has already increased by 2,380% since the beginning. Analysts forecast BDAG could hit $20 by 2027, driven by real utility and adoption. These numbers paint a picture: early miners are building strong positions before the network fully launches. With more user-friendly tools planned and ongoing community events, the growth path seems set. BlockDAG’s structure and execution suggest it may become one of the best crypto coins for the future. Final Thoughts SUI has risen 25% since March and aims for $3 if its bullish pattern holds and TVL support continues. The SUI price prediction is cautiously optimistic but still needs volume confirmation. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has rebounded modestly with improved volume, though sentiment remains uncertain. While those two coins battle for trend confirmation, BlockDAG is gaining actual traction. With over 1.2 million miners, $211.5 million raised, and BDAG priced at $0.0248, early participation may offer the highest return potential. Its mix of real usage, steady growth, and expanding access could position it as one of the top crypto coins to watch this year and beyond.

The 4-hour Relative Strength Index dropped below 10, which typically suggests a possible technical bounce. However, opinions differ as some analysts view this as a sign of weakness rather than a rebound signal. Meanwhile, the PI coin price is currently hovering near $0.68 after facing yet another rejection at $0.76. The RSI stands at 39.97, indicating slow momentum with limited buyer interest. While traders monitor charts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is focusing on building long-term value. In its third keynote, the network provided updates that reflect a shift toward meaningful adoption. One major highlight was the explanation behind its partnerships with Inter Milan and UFC star Alex Pereira. Instead of surface-level promotions, these tie-ins serve as structured entry points for everyday users to connect with the platform. BlockDAG’s total presale has already reached $211.5 million, with expectations that its value could reach $30 by 2030. For those entering during Batch 27, currently priced at $0.0248, this translates to a projected return many are calling one of the most attractive in today’s crypto space. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Outlook: Oversold Territory but Uncertain Path The latest readings from technical charts show the Dogecoin (DOGE) price outlook resting in rare territory. The RSI dropping below 10 on the 4-hour timeframe indicates severe overselling. This could attract short-term buyers looking for a bounce, but long-term signals remain mixed. There is a 30% to 40% probability that DOGE may fall below the key $0.165 level. If that support fails, the next target could be $0.155. While some whale activity suggests accumulation, the broader market remains skeptical. Factors such as Elon Musk’s influence and speculation about integration with social media platforms continue to create unpredictable price swings. PI Coin Price: Sluggish Momentum as Resistance Holds The PI coin price is sitting at $0.70 after another failed attempt to break $0.76. This repeated rejection has left traders cautious. Technical indicators are not showing strong support for a turnaround. With an RSI of 39.97 and the MACD leaning bearish, momentum looks weak. If the current $0.68 level gives way, the next zone of interest could fall as low as $0.50. Although some previous setups have resulted in modest rebounds, the lack of volume this time raises questions about sustained recovery. BlockDAG Pushes Forward: $5M Added in 48 Hours, $30 Forecast by 2030 BlockDAG’s third keynote offered key updates that point to rapid growth and network preparation. The presale jumped by $5 million within two days of the announcement, bringing the total raised to $211.5 million. Over 19.1 billion BDAG tokens have been sold without institutional backers. A key announcement included the BlockDAG Academy—a three-tiered educational program aimed at bringing users from basic blockchain understanding to full-stack development using BlockDAG’s tools. This strategic focus on user knowledge and accessibility could help solidify its place among the best crypto for the future. Additionally, the platform’s Beta Testnet V1 is already live, and over 170,000 holders have started receiving 10,000 testnet BDAG through a structured vesting schedule. Engagement is growing through mobile apps like X1 Miner and TG Tap Miner, which now boast a combined 1.1 million users. With the coin priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, and a forecasted peak of $30 by 2030, BlockDAG is capturing the attention of those seeking substantial upside with real ecosystem backing. Final Take: Best Crypto for the Future? The Dogecoin (DOGE) price outlook remains complicated. Despite being technically oversold, risks still weigh heavily on short-term prospects. The PI coin price also faces a fragile setup, with bearish indicators and weak demand clouding recovery hopes. In contrast, BlockDAG is gaining traction through product rollout, mobile mining adoption, and targeted partnerships. With a forecast of $30 and a proven growth structure, BDAG stands out as a strong pick among top-performing altcoins. For those evaluating the best crypto for the future, BlockDAG offers more than just potential—it provides a roadmap backed by consistent delivery.

UFC champion and political candidate Conor McGregor launches token UFC champion fighter and Irish political candidate Conor McGregor launched a memecoin called ""REAL"" on April 5 in collaboration with the Real World Gaming decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Spokespeople for the project characterized the release of the token, which was launched through a sealed-bid auction, as fairer for retail buyers and a bulwark against bots and snipers hijacking the token price. Source: Conor McGregor In a statement to Cointelegraph, McGregor said, ""This is about transparency — we are showing the world how it is done with integrity.” At the time of this writing, the token has only managed to attract approximately $144,530 of the $3,600,000 auction target. Satoshi Nakamoto turns 50 as Bitcoin becomes US reserve asset Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, marks their 50th birthday amid a year of rising institutional and geopolitical adoption of the world’s first cryptocurrency. The identity of Nakamoto remains one of the biggest mysteries in crypto, with speculation ranging from cryptographers like Adam Back and Nick Szabo to broader theories involving government intelligence agencies. While Nakamoto’s identity remains anonymous, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) creator is believed to have turned 50 on April 5 based on details shared in the past. According to archived data from his P2P Foundation profile, Nakamoto once claimed to be a 37-year-old man living in Japan and listed his birthdate as April 5, 1975. Source: Web.archive.org Nakamoto’s anonymity has played a vital role in maintaining the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network, which has no central authority or leadership. The Bitcoin wallet associated with Nakamoto, which holds over 1 million BTC, has laid dormant for more than 16 years despite BTC rising from $0 to an all-time high above $109,000 in January. SEC paints ‘a distorted picture’ of USD-stablecoin market — Crenshaw US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner and vocal crypto critic Caroline Crenshaw has accused the US regulator of downplaying risks and misrepresenting the US stablecoin market in its newly published guidelines. However, many in the crypto industry see the SEC’s decision as a step in the right direction. In an April 4 statement, Crenshaw, who is widely known for opposing the spot Bitcoin ETFs, said that the SEC's statement on stablecoins contained ""legal and factual errors that paint a distorted picture of the USD-stablecoin market that drastically understates its risks."" Under the new SEC guidelines, stablecoins that meet certain criteria are now considered ""non-securities"" and are exempt from transaction reporting requirements. Crenshaw disputed the accuracy of the analysis made by the SEC in arriving at that decision. She pushed back on the SEC for reiterating issuer actions ""that supposedly stabilize price, ensure redeemability, and otherwise reduce risk.""",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ZK|WLD|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-05 22:01:06

According to latest reports, these three cryptocurrencies are now leading the charts as the most trending coins in the market after the crash. Related Reading: XRP Breakout Alert! Could This Surge Send The Altcoin To $3? Santiment Unveils Top Trending Cryptos The crypto market took a significant hit after fears of new tariffs implemented by United States President Donald Trump rattled investors and sent digital assets plunging across the board. However, while US stock markets closed, signs of recovery began to emerge across specific cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano leading the post-crash chatter. According to an X (formerly Twitter) post by Santiment, a market intelligence platform, Solana is now back in the headlines as market analysts closely watch its price action following its crash. The popular meme coin is seeing an increased level of speculative predictions, market trends, and technical chart breakdowns. As a result, SOL is recapturing the attention of retail and institutional investors. There’s also been notable activity within the Solana network as anticipation for a price rebound or breakout keeps spreading. Ethereum is also trending in the crypto market, not just for its prolonged price slump and reaction to the crypto crash, but its ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 — a key upgrade focused on scalability and energy efficiency. Santiment notes that analysts are highlighting Ethereum’s network performance during the market stress, showcasing an increase in discussions about the cryptocurrency’s market analysis. There have also been increased price predictions, technical evaluations, and talks about the cryptocurrency’s scalability and adoption. Just like Solana and Ethereum, Cardano is seeing renewed attention as traders assess the cryptocurrency’s position in the broader market. There has been an influx of mentions surrounding Cardano’s market trends, with users speculating on its future price action and potential investments. Forecasts for the ADA price also range widely, with social media buzz and speculative posts fueling the cryptocurrency’s presence on trending charts. While not as widely discussed as ETH, SOL, and ADA, Binance Coin (BNB) has also been showing up in technical forecasts. Santiment reveals that analysts are tracking BNB’s trading ranges and potential price movements, making it a focal point for investors and traders. Related Reading: Solana Slammed By Whale Dump—Can It Recover Or Is More Pain Ahead? Stablecoins Join List Of Trending Assets In addition to the altcoins above, Santiment has disclosed that stablecoins have also joined the list of top trending assets. While Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano experienced major declines after the crypto crash, stablecoins, as their names imply, remained stable against the dollar. Ripple’s newly launched stablecoin RLUSD is trending due to its association with the crypto payments company, which gained significant attention following the completion of its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The stablecoin has been integrated into Ripple’s payment system, improving cross-border transactions and attracting institutional interest. There has also been a significant increase in adoption and trading volume, with crypto exchange Kraken reporting an 87% surge in the latter and a $10 billion growth in the former.

These projects aren’t stuck in hype cycles. They’re pushing forward with real-world applications and strong communities. Qubetics, especially, is stealing the spotlight with its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace.

Qubetics ($TICS): Best Crypto to Join for Short Term Profits with Real World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics isn’t here playing games.

The cryptocurrency, currently priced at $0.6484, has shown a 2.45% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, technical indicators suggest that ADA price is heading towards its first “death cross” of 2025. Cardano Technical Indicators Point to Bearish Momentum Cardano’s recent price action suggests that the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is likely to cross below the 200-day SMA in the coming days. This crossover, known as the death cross, is typically seen as a bearish signal. As per our recent Cardano price analysis , should the death cross occur, ADA could dip 25%. ADA/USD price chart (source: TradingView) At the time of writing, the 50-day SMA stands at $0.74, while the 200-day SMA is at $0.734. As the 50-day SMA continues to decline, it indicates that the short-term momentum of Cardano is underperforming compared to its long-term trend. A death cross often leads to a further decline in price, although the extent of the drop can vary. Despite the approaching death cross, it is important to note that such technical indicators are not always reliable predictors of future price action. While historical patterns may provide insight into market sentiment, they do not guarantee that prices will follow the same trajectory. This means that ADA price could experience a reversal even after the death cross forms, depending on other market factors. Recent Price Trends and Market Conditions ADA price has seen a notable decrease in Cardano price over the past week, with a 7.67% drop. After peaking at $1.19 in early March 2025, the coin has struggled to maintain its momentum, particularly as broader market concerns weigh on investor sentiment. On top of this, Cardano’s trading volume has been decreasing. The daily trade volume has dropped by 58.72%, with just under $394 million traded in the last 24 hours. A decrease in trading volume typically suggests that market participants are losing interest or that there is waning demand for ADA. Despite these challenges, there have been some positive developments surrounding Cardano. Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano, recently confirmed that Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin would be launching on the Cardano network. This news was met with some optimism, sparking interest in ADA. Additionally, Hoskinson teased the possibility of Cardano playing a role in Bitcoin’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. These announcements could potentially help Cardano regain momentum, but for now, the technical indicators suggest a cautious outlook. What Could Happen Next for ADA Price? As Cardano approaches the death cross, the primary question is whether the price will continue its downward trend or if there will be a reversal. The chart shows a pattern of consolidation, with ADA price action fluctuating within certain support and resistance zones. According to crypto analyst Seth fin, strong support is seen around the $0.6000 –$0.6500 range, while resistance lies near the $0.7000–$0.7500 levels. If ADA fails to break through the resistance, the price could continue its decline towards these support zones. One potential scenario is that price could experience a bounce if the Cardano price holds at these support levels, particularly the $0.6000 zone. This would signal that the market is still interested in buying ADA at lower prices. On the other hand, if the price fails to hold these support zones and breaks below them, further downside may follow, potentially leading to a retest of lower support zones in the $0.3000–$0.4000 range.

Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia all lose $3 trillion valuation as Trump tariffs Wipe Out $1 trillion in 3 days As Trump announced fresh tariffs on Wednesday, global Markets reacted swiftly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 3000 points plunging 7.4%, while Crude Oil (WTI) also tumbled more than 10% as manufacturers and commodities traders brace for a blip in global commerce. But the most dramatic losses came from the United States’ technology sector. Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA —three of the most valuable companies globally—shed more than $1 trillion in market capitalization combined after Trump announced the sweeping tariffs on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined 15.9%, extending its weekly loss to the steepest seen since October.

Historically, such synchronized declines among the biggest U.S. corporations suggest investors are reacting to systemic market risks rather than, individual stock performance outlook. This affirms that China’s swift retaliation—announcing new tariffs on U.S. exports within 48 hours—has sparked fears of a sustained trade war. The looming supply chain risks has prompted investors to pivot away from US stocks towards alternative markets like private credit and cryptocurrencies. Altcoins Brace for Breakout as Crypto Market Cap Holds at $2.7T Amid Trade War Concerns Bitcoin price has held firmly above the $80,000 mark, despite US Trade tariffs sparking intense market turbulence across global financial markets over the past week. BTC’s resilient price action has caught investor’s attention, with the positive sentiment extending towards altcoins. On Wednesday, the White House triggered widespread investor anxiety by unveiling sweeping new tariffs on imports from multiple trading partners, including China, India, Mexico, and the European Union. Early market reactions show that cryptocurrencies withstood the sell-pressure while US Stocks, and manufacturing commodities markets nose-dived. Crypto Spot Market Performance, April 5 2025 | Source: Coingecko As seen in the Coingecko chart above, the aggregate crypto market capitalization stands at $2.7 trillion at press time, keeping weekly timeframe losses below the 8% mark. Not only has Bitcoin price held above the $82,000, the resilient performance extended to the crypto sector as a whole. As seen in the chart, top ranked altcoins like XRP, BNB and Cardano are holding key support levels around $2, $590 and $0.65 respectively, as global markets saw major sell-off response to Trump’s tarrfis. But in the crypto-sector as weak hands exited, and BTC held steady, altcoin found new buyers as as investors exiting us stocks sought assets unexposed to trade tensions.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Might Offer Even Bigger Returns,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-the-xrp-600-surge-magacoin-finance-might-offer-even-bigger-returns/,"XRP ran over 600% between November 2024 and January 2025 . It got a lot of attention from investors looking to gain from the rally. However, many investors were priced out and missed the pump. Now, these investors are looking for the next big opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the next potential mooner that has gained a lot of attention recently on 4th April 2025. XRP is currently trading at mere $2.04 . On the other hand, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised $5 million in no time despite being a fresh presale. This coin is promising to hit a milestone of $5 by the end of 2025 . But could it go even higher than that? Let’s analyze that. XRP’s Impressive Run: A 600% Surge XRP went up by 600% between November 2024 and January 2024. It is quite an impressive pump. In this rally, it went from $0.52 to $3.10 according to blockchain data. Eventually it stabilized at a price of $2.04 after a 30% correction. Credit for this major pump goes to Trump’s pro crypto stance and SEC settlement during which a $125 million fine got cut to only $50 million according to reports. Analysts predict a $5.81 target by 2025 —a 185% gain—with a potential XRP ETF approval ( 73% likelihood, per Polymarket) driving $5 billion in inflows, per web forecasts. Whales accumulated 453.3 million tokens ( $526 million ) in 1 week , per web data, but XRP’s 100 billion supply and regulatory risks—like Better Markets’ challenge—may cap its upside, per web sources. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Explosive Potential: A $5 Target MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads, raising $5 million in its freshly launched presale by April 04 , 2025 . Stage 6 sold out at $0.000266 , with a listing price of $0.007 securing a 2,500% ROI, per web reports. Analysts project a $5 milestone by 2025 , a 71,329% jump from listing, turning $100 into $714,000 , per posts on X. Backed by a Hashex audit, its 50,000 supporters grow by 10,000 weekly across 30 + countries, and Stage 7 is 90% sold out in days . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s DeFi lending model, potentially yielding 20% + annually, offers utility, making it a high-growth contender, per web insights. XRP vs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Returns Battle XRP’s 185% potential to $5.81 is solid, with 1,500 transactions per second at 0.00001 XRP per transaction, per web data, and ETF prospects boosting sentiment, per Polymarket. However, its $120 billion market cap and regulatory uncertainty—like the SEC’s appeal of its non-security ruling—may slow its climb, per web reports. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 target offers a 71,329% ROI, with a potential $50 million valuation at listing, per posts on X. While XRP’s 600% rally was impressive, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s low-cap agility and DeFi utility could deliver even bigger returns, per web forecasts. Why Investors Are Switching to MAGACOIN FINANCE LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH CODE MAGA50X XRP’s 600% surge left latecomers seeking the next big opportunity, and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits the bill, per posts on X predicting a 60,000% surge. XRP’s $526 million whale accumulation shows strength, but its 30% correction and regulatory baggage—like competition from RLUSD ( $170 million cap)—dampen its appeal, per web data. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 million presale and 90% Stage 7 sellout signal momentum, per web reports. Investors who missed XRP’s rally see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a chance to catch a 2025 breakout, potentially outpacing XRP’s 185% upside with a 71,329% return, per web insights.

The PI coin price continues to slide, dropping 61% in just a month and flirting with its all-time low as concerns about unlocks and weak exchange support grow. The Chainlink (LINK) price prediction trends are telling a similar story. After getting knocked back from $14, LINK has slipped under $13. But while Pi and LINK are losing momentum, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining it nonstop. The BDAG team took the spotlight in Keynote 3 with a clear message: security isn’t a bonus—it’s the foundation. Between top-tier audits, a fault-tolerant design, and serious backing from holders, confidence in BDAG is growing fast. With over $212 million raised and the price already up 2,380%, analysts now say it could hit $20 by 2027. Will Pi Coin Price Hit a New Low After 61% Monthly Decline? The PI coin price has suffered a sharp decline, falling 61% over the past month and 18% in just the last week. This sustained downward trend has brought the token alarmingly close to its all-time low of $0.6157. Currently trading at $0.6655, Pi is down nearly 77% from its all-time high of $2.99. The lack of a strong recovery signal, along with upcoming token unlocks and limited exchange listings, adds to the selling pressure. If the PI coin price breaks below its key $0.65 support, analysts warn it could test new lows in the weeks ahead. Chainlink Price Prediction Shifts After Drop Below $13 The current Chainlink (LINK) price prediction suggests short-term uncertainty as the token struggles to maintain support above $13. After being rejected near $14, sellers pushed the price lower, even as trading volume spiked over 50% to $620 million. Despite PayPal expanding LINK availability in the U.S., the market response remained muted. Technical indicators, including an RSI of 38, reflect persistent bearish pressure. However, some forecasts point to a possible 23.27% increase by late April. Until stronger buyer activity materialises, the Chainlink price prediction leans toward caution, especially with ongoing volatility and fading investor confidence. Keynote 3: BlockDAG Doubles Down on Security! BlockDAG’s third keynote placed a sharp spotlight on a core priority: security. From the start, the network has been built to handle real-world threats, not just technical demands. Chief Security Officer Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj summed it up best during the event: “Security is not a feature—it’s the bedrock upon which we’ve built everything.” That message came with proof. Smart contract systems and treasury mechanisms have already passed audits from both CertiK and Halborn —two of the most respected names in blockchain security. These early validations send a strong message ahead of BlockDAG’s mainnet launch. Behind the scenes, the technical framework supports this cautious approach. Financial operations are protected using Multi-Party Computation (MPC), which spreads risk and keeps treasury funds secure. BlockDAG’s infrastructure is also built to stay online no matter what, thanks to fault-tolerant design and a globally distributed setup. The goal is simple: no centralised weak spots and no single points of failure. These measures help protect uptime and maintain confidence, even under pressure. Market response to the Keynote’s security updates has been anything but quiet. BlockDAG has raised over $212 million so far, selling more than 19.1 billion BDAG coins. The current price sits at $0.0248 in batch 27—up 2,380% since launch. As new buyers rush in before batch 28, BDAG is already being seen as one of the top crypto coins right now. Some analysts see the price reaching $20 by 2027, largely because the project is moving fast and built on fundamentals others are still trying to figure out. Final Takeaways The PI coin price remains under pressure, and unless major exchanges step in or sentiment shifts, its slide toward a new low may continue. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price prediction reflects a token caught between potential and hesitation—volume is climbing, but conviction hasn’t followed. Then came BlockDAG’s Keynote 3, shifting the conversation entirely. While others tread water, BlockDAG is stacking momentum—bolstered by a security framework already earning top audit credentials. Its infrastructure is built to last, and with over $212 million raised, a 2,380% price surge, and a $20 target on the horizon, BDAG is quickly climbing the ranks among the top crypto coins right now.

Confidence is harder. As the quarter ends, the gap between the two is starting to show. Filecoin still leans on infrastructure logic—decentralized storage, IPFS integration, institutional relevance—but trades at $2.78, a fraction of its $237 peak. Translation: FIL’s future looks weighed down by utility no one’s paying for. Kaspa, meanwhile, sits at $0.06538, with an all-time high of $0.2075 in the rearview. Yes, it”s fast. But fast hasn’t translated into committed capital. Then there”s BlockDAG (BDAG) . No exchange listing yet, no VC safety net, and still: $212 million raised, 19.1 billion coins sold, and over 170,000 holders already participating in a live beta testnet. BDAG has climbed 2,380% since Batch 1. At this pace, it may reach $1 before KAS even gets close. Filecoin”s Future Hangs Between Utility & Market Fatigue Filecoin isn’t short on ambition. As a decentralized storage network built on IPFS, it offers an alternative to traditional cloud platforms. Yet for all its technical credibility, FIL’s current price—hovering near $2.78—is a long way from its $237 peak in 2021. The short-term forecast points to resistance at $3.61, with some models projecting a push to $4.92 by the end of 2025. But the floor is equally defined: if momentum falters, $1.92 remains a plausible bottom. The Filecoin future depends on whether that indecision turns into renewed demand or prolonged drift. For now, FIL’s future remains a high-potential idea weighed down by market hesitation. KAS price forecast: Chart Says Oversold, Market Says Wait Kaspa claims speed, and to its credit, it delivers. However, at $0.06538, the market seems more focused on KAS’s price forecast than throughput. After peaking at $0.2075 in 2024, KAS now trades beneath key technical markers, forming a descending triangle while sitting below its 50-day MA. The Kaspa (KAS) price forecast for 2025 splits cleanly: strength could push it toward $0.11408, while another stall sends it to $0.04262. RSI sits deep in oversold territory, which could prompt a bounce—but sentiment remains fragile. The real test isn’t whether Kaspa can move fast; it’s whether the market still believes speed alone matters. Beta Testnet’s Live, Miners Are Shipping—How Soon Until BlockDAG Explodes? “Today marks another significant milestone. We’re excited to announce the official launch of our first Beta Testnet,” said BlockDAG’s CEO Antony Turner in the project’s recently launched Keynote 3 . Not “coming soon,” not locked behind closed devnets—live, functional, and being tested by over 170,000 holders. Every BDAG holder will also receive 10,000 testnet BDAG through a fixed vesting schedule that mirrors mainnet dynamics. And that detail matters. Participation levels, user velocity, and mining incentives are already shaping what BlockDAG’s mainnet will function like once it goes public. That kind of clarity before launch is rare. Rarer still when backed by hard numbers: $212 million raised and 19.1 billion coins sold—all without touching venture capital. Where most projects use testnets as PR events, BlockDAG has turned it into a functioning onboarding layer. And while that’s happening, the network is also preparing to start shipping its mining hardware—10,000 custom-built X30 and X100 ASIC miners—ahead of its 2025 mainnet rollout. BlockDAG’s native coin, BDAG, has already surged 2,380% since Batch 1, now priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. That’s the kind of movement the market hasn’t seen in a long time—structured, not spiked. The mainnet is already on the calendar for this year. So the question isn’t if the price moves again, but how far. More conservative forecasts place BDAG above $1 post-launch. Others are throwing around double digits. Either way, the math doesn’t look optional for much longer. Which Is the Top Performing Crypto Today? Filecoin has the infrastructure but not the price action to match. Kaspa has the speed but little conviction behind it. Both Filecoin’s future and KAS’s price forecast sit in familiar limbo—technically sound, commercially uncertain. BlockDAG, on the other hand, isn’t promising momentum—it’s delivering it in real time. The network’s Beta Testnet is now live, while the BDAG coin has already surged 2,380% since Batch 1. With a $1 target now widely considered realistic post-mainnet, BDAG remains the top-performing crypto in the market today. Filecoin and Kaspa are waiting for traction. BlockDAG is already showing what most projects hope to prove much later in their timeline. The only thing that matters now? Getting in as early as possible because its current Batch 27 price of $0.0248 will soon be history!

ADA Price Outlook Bearish",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/solana-drops-11-while-blockdag-announces-1000-dapps-by-2026-experts-forecast-800x-returns-ada-price-outlook-bearish/,"Cardano (ADA) has been feeling massive downward pressure lately, with support at $0.63. If it falls below this level, Cardano price predictions point to further declines. The Solana (SOL) price is also struggling, down over 11% this week, and with a bearish triangle forming, it looks like the downtrend could continue. As these big players struggle, many traders are eyeing the presale gem BlockDAG (BDAG) as the best crypto to buy right now. With over 19.1 billion coins sold and a massive $212 million raised, BlockDAG is one of the fastest-growing projects today. The network has revealed ambitious plans to roll out 1,000 decentralized apps (dApps) by 2026, expanding into industries like finance, healthcare, and gaming. With a solid expansion plan in place, BlockDAG is on track for an exciting future. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: What’s Next for ADA? Cardano (ADA) has been under downward pressure lately, hovering between $0.65 and $0.68. Cardano price predictions suggest the key support level to watch is $0.63, and if ADA breaks below this, it could slide further toward the $0.60-$0.61 mark. The RSI and MACD point to a neutral to bearish trend, while the Falling Wedge pattern suggests a possible reversal. For those looking at long-term Cardano price predictions, the outlook remains uncertain. As ADA consolidates around $0.65, the next moves will depend on whether bulls can push above $0.70 or if bears will drive the price below $0.63. Solana (SOL) Price Drops 11.7%: Critical Support Ahead The Solana (SOL) price has dropped 11.7% over the past week, currently trading around $117. This comes as the coin recently broke through a critical support level at $128. Solana’s price is now forming a bearish triangle pattern, suggesting the possibility of further downward movement. Bollinger Bands also indicate increased volatility, with support at $116. If this level fails to hold, Solana’s price could test lower levels at $113, $110, or even $99. On the upside, key resistance levels are at $135, $147, and $152. Traders are closely monitoring the $118 support zone. BlockDAG: The Next Big Crypto with 1,000 dApps & 800x Growth Potential! BlockDAG’s recent Keynote 3 highlighted the network’s impressive progress and offered an exciting preview of its plans for adoption and growth. The outlook for BlockDAG is brighter than ever as it aims to reshape the use of blockchain technology across various industries. By 2026, the platform plans to launch over 1,000 decentralized applications (dApps), targeting sectors like finance, healthcare, gaming, identity, and governance—aiming to integrate blockchain into more aspects of everyday life. Another key part of BlockDAG’s roadmap is the introduction of account abstraction, which will provide users with more flexibility by eliminating the need to directly manage private keys. The platform is also venturing into artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized identity, reinforcing its commitment to staying at the forefront of technology. “We’re exploring new frontiers like AI, self-sovereign identity, data personhood, and decentralized governance,” said CTO Jeremy Harkness, emphasizing the ambitious scope of the plans ahead. BDAG adoption is already at an all-time high, with over 19.1 billion coins sold and the presale raising a historic $212 million. Given this growth, analysts predict that BDAG, currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, could reach $20 by 2027, offering over 800x potential returns. Plus, with the network’s ongoing expansion, many believe that BlockDAG will meet its $600 million presale target ahead of schedule. So, for anyone looking for the best crypto to buy right now, acting quickly is critical, as batch 27 is nearing a sell-out. Looking Ahead The Cardano (ADA) price prediction remains uncertain, with key support at $0.63; the coin’s next move will depend on whether bulls push it above $0.70 or bears drive it lower. Meanwhile, Solana’s price faces potential further declines, with key support at $116 and resistance at $135, as it forms a bearish triangle pattern. However, for those seeking the best crypto to buy right now , BlockDAG is a standout choice. Priced at just $0.0248 in batch 27, BDAG is forecasted to deliver over 800x returns by 2027! Plus, with the platform’s planned ecosystem expansion, increased adoption, and growing utility, demand for BDAG is expected to rise rapidly. So, traders looking for maximum crypto returns at the lowest cost should act quickly, as once batch 27 sells out, BDAG will not be priced this low again.

PayPal announced on Friday that users of both payment platforms could now buy, sell, hold and transfer SOL and LINK , the native asset for the decentralized oracle platform Chainlink. LINK jumped by more than 1% on Friday and is trading at $13.00 at time of writing. Meanwhile, SOL rose from $117.15 to a high of $124 before closing the trading day at $122.78. By comparison, the overall crypto market cap dipped by nearly 1% in the past 24 hours and nearly 2% in the past week, per data from CoinGecko . Crypto prices have dropped as President Donald Trump’s new wave of tariffs rattles global markets. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that slapped a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods entering the US, with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. He also issued a proclamation detailing “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of specific countries effective April 9th, with rates totaling up to 54% on China. PayPal acquired Venmo’s parent company, Braintree, back in 2013 for $800 million.

According to Bit Bull, the ETH decline will see it sink to lows of $1,600 in the near future. Ethereum Price Hurtles Toward $1,600 Cryptocurrency analyst Bit Bull has shared a prediction on X for Ethereum price movement in the near-term. According to Bit Bull, Ethereum looks set to continue its decline and can fall as low as $1,600. Bit Bull hinges his prediction on Ethereum breaking down from a symmetrical triangle after prices fell below $1,820. The decline below the triangle pattern signals a bearish sentiment, continuing the previous decline. ETH price remains stuck below $2,000 since the drop below the psychological level was driven by a raft of unsavory fundaments and technicals. The latest is the Ethereum price dropping beneath the triangle pattern, triggering new short entries on the asset. A breakdown and a retest followed by low trading volumes confirm fears of a steeper ETH correction. “However, after the breakdown and a retest, ETH is now looking bearish,” said Bit Bull. “Technically, there’s a strong possibility for further downside.” Apart from the symmetrical triangle, a further confirmation of bearish sentiments is seen in ETH dominance. According to his analysis, Bit Bull notes the ETH dominance chart has formed a descending triangle to signal further bearishness. “A retest toward the upper trendline is likely, but after that, we could see another move down,” added Bit Bull. On-chain Metrics Confirm Bearish Sentiments For ETH While technicals are largely pessimistic, on-chain data are telling a similar story for Ethereum price. Right out of the bat, active addresses on Ethereum have taken a major hit in recent months, exacerbating the issue of falling prices. There is also a decline in Ethereum fees burnt while fees burnt per transaction face a similar slump. Perhaps the biggest indicator for long-term bearishness is an increase in ETH supply after the Merge event. Despite the negative sentiments, ETH to $4,000 is still in play given the show of as strong support at $1,800. Standard Chartered analyst opines that Ethereum will finish the year at $4,000 after slashing its earlier prediction of $10,000 by 60%. Ethereum price currently exchanges hands at $1,803, falling by less than 1% over the last day. Weekly charts indicate a similar ETH decline of around 1%, confirming a strong consolidation base for the bruised and battered altcoin. Ethereum’s trading volume stands at nearly $7 billion with whales creating a chunk of market activity for the asset.

Based on this, Ripple’s native crypto is eyeing a rebound, with crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicting that the XRP price could rebound to as high as $2.60 if it holds the $2 support. XRP’s Open Interest Surges Above $3 Billion CoinGlass data shows that XRP’s open interest has surged in the last 24 hours, rising to as high as $3.61 billion, indicating huge interest in the altcoin at the moment. This provides a bullish outlook for the altcoin, seeing as traders are heavily betting on it. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also suggested that Ripple’s native crypto could rebound soon. In an X post, he stated that if XRP can stay above the key $2 level, a 30% move toward the channel’s upper boundary at $2.60 could be next. Crypto analyst CasiTrades’s prediction also showed that the altcoin could surge to $2.70 if it breaks above $2.24. This could eventually pave the way for Ripple’s native crypto to rally to a new all-time high (ATH). However, there is still the possibility that the altcoin could also drop to new lows. A CoinGape market analysis revealed that Ripple’s price is at a crossroads, as a wedge pattern signals a 70% crash or 700% surge. Crypto analyst Rex also predicted that XRP could soon witness a bullish reversal. He stated that a breakout is coming and that this is the most obvious play of the cycle. His accompanying chart showed that XRP could rally to as high as $2.9. Two Paths For Ripple’s Native Crypto Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto stated that the XRP price could drop to $0.65 or rally to $17. This is based on an Ascending Broadening Wedge, which is currently forming for the altcoin. The analyst remarked that XRP first needs to close above $3.50 for a solid start. He claimed that if the altcoin hits the $5 range but doesn’t close above it convincingly, this formation has a higher chance of playing out. Egrag Crypto asserted that XRP must retest $1.90 after being rejected from the $5 range. Once that happens, the altcoin will need another attempt to close above $5, ideally hitting $6 and closing above that level. The analyst affirmed that XRP will likely blast to double digits within two to three weeks if that happens. The target move for this Ascending Broadening Wedge is a potential $17.50. This aligns with another prediction in which he stated that the XRP price could rally to double digits by the July 21 cycle peak . However, Egrag Crypto warned that there is still a 70% chance that XRP breaks to the downside and only a 30% chance for an upside breakout. If the altcoin breaks down, the analyst claims the measured move would take Ripple’s native crypto back to $0.65.

With the four-month downtrend in ETH that started in April now being compared to similar price movements in 2018, some analysts are suggesting that a parabolic rally might carry the price of ETH as high as $3,000 by mid-2025. However, XRP enthusiasts have thrown around a $7 price target, and established investors are becoming increasingly interested in altcoins that bring utility and the possibility of explosive growth. MUTM, token of Mutuum Finance is another one grabbing attention and accelerating its presale momentum with $6.2 million raised and 7,900 holders onboard as its Phase 4 approaches capacity. Ethereum’s Rebound Struggles for Momentum Ethereum surge to $64 billion in monthly DEX volumes signals waning institutional interest, yet whale selling and ETF outflow-saturation casts a shadow over its near-term outlook. ETH is “extremely undervalued” after consecutive monthly losses, a rarity since 2018, says well known analyst Crypto Rover. According to historical data, Q2 could bring gains of at least 60%, which would see ETH price be propelled above the resistance at $2,062. Even though some technical indicators like rounding bottom pattern and bullish AO bars suggest a bounce back, the road forward for Ethereum is rocky. Mutuum Finance Token Presale Races Ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has reached Phase 4 with its 11-phase presale, charging $0.025 per token, 20% below the $0.03 price in Phase 5. Tokens at this price represent a guaranteed 140% return from its $0.06 exchange listing when it goes live. As much as 9,900% return-on-investment (ROI) for Phase 4 buyers, with prospects of hitting $2.50 by post-listing through the roof above launch. By redirecting platform revenue to stakers, the project’s lending model, which combines mtTokens and overcollateralized loans, generates sustained buy pressure. Couple this with a $100,000 presale giveaway and urgency grows as slots fill fast. Mathematical certainty fuels the allure of Mutuum Finance: an example $1,000 investment today acquires 40,000 tokens at $0.025, and reaches $100,000 should MUTM achieve $2.50. These projections are based on its system of hybrid DeFi, which has combined peer-to-peer lending with variable interest rates. Unlike meme coins, which often spread as quickly as they crash, with their prices determined by market whims, MUTM employs a buy-and-distribute process that ensures a steady and indelible demand, making the token impervious to the fickle whims of the market. With 7,900 holders already onboard, presale velocity highlights its marketers’ view as a high-yield, low-key entry point into DeFi. Security Audits at Final Stages The Mutuum Finance team is currently finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts — a significant step forward that will improve investor confidence in the project. You will be notified through the official channels once the development is done, as it is the DNA of the platform to be transparent. This recruitment, essential to long-term adoption, is coupled with mtToken interoperability and overcollateralized stablecoins, and these also speak in favor of the assertion that MUTM will not be a passing trend, but a DeFi staple. Timing the Market Shift Amid the buzz of XRP’s $7 ambition and the resurgence of Ethereum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings a clear roadmap to 100X potential. The presale structure, audited security framework, and revenue-driven tokenomics form a compelling argument for prioritizing MUTM over established giants. The presale for Mutuum Finance is moving swiftly, with each phase driving demand. Those investors who overlook this opportunity will not only miss out on a 140% gain at launch but a potential 9,900% explosion as the platform grows. Go to Mutuum Finance’s official site to get involved before Phase 5 upcoming price raise. In an era where innovation trumps legacy in the crypto market space, MUTM could well be the tactical coin of choice for 2025.

Ripple (XRP) price holds $2 support as altcoins mirror Bitcoin’s resilience to Trade War Triggers Ripple (XRP) price initially plunged to 30-day lows around $1.80 with hours after Trump announced sweeping tariffs during the liberation speech on Friday. However, the momentum swung positive in recent days as BTC holds firm above $82,000 after China retaliatory 34% tariffs on Thursday, reinforcing investor confidence in the crypto markets as a crisis resistant asset class. Ripple (XRP) price action, April 5 | Source: TradingView Ripple price rebounded 12.5% since Thursday, rising as as $2.15 at press time according to CoinMarketCap data. As seen above, Ripple price continues to consolidate well-above the $2 mark, mirroring the likes of ETH, BTC and SOL , which have also defended key psychological support levels around $1,800, $80,000 and $110 respectively over the past week. Meanwhile, top-ranked US stocks such as Apple, NVIDIA and Microsoft all recorded 15% losses a piece before the week’s trading closed on Friday. Derivative Market Analysis: Crypto Buying Pressure Could Slow Down this Weekend With top-ranked crypto assets including XRP all consolidating around key psychological price points this weekend, it signal market-wide buying support, amid capital inflows from investors exiting stocks amid US trade war tensions. However, considering that US markets are now closed, the volume of transitional capital flows could slow down significant until pre-market trading begin. Validating this stance, Coinglass derivatives market data shows evidence of short-term bearish trading signals. Crypto Derivatives Markets Analysis, BTC, ETH see combined losses of $50M, April 5. | Source: Coinglass Derivatives data from Coinglass reinforces this stance. Over the past 24 hours, crypto markets saw a total of $110.65 million in liquidations, with long positions accounting for $85.10 million—over 76% of the total. Bitcoin and Ethereum alone alone recorded nearly $50 million combined, with BTC traders booking $36.32 million in liquidations, followed by Ethereum at $13.61 million. The bearish imbalance, especially the outsized long wipeouts in the last 12 hours ($67.11M longs vs $13.48M shorts), points to a rising number of over-leveraged bullish positions being flushed out. This suggests short-term exhaustion in buying momentum, increasing the likelihood of a minor pullback or sideways action through the weekend. With high leverage being unwound and external demand on pause, weekend trading may turn defensive with XRP markets and other prominent altcoins. Strategic altcoin traders woould watch for support retests, especially if funding rates begin to flip or volume declines further ahead of Monday’s open. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls facing Resistance at $2.20, Amid Weekend Caution As the week closes on April 5, XRP price forecast charts on TradingView reflect signs of short-term exhaustion following its rebound to $2.15. Despite five consecutive green candles, XRP price remains below the 50-day EMA at $2.21 and the 100-day EMA at $2.28. This reflects supply-side pressure still outweighing momentum, even as bulls attempt a recovery from March’s lows. XRP Price Forecast Notably, the 200-day EMA near $1.95 is acting as a key anchor. A breach below this could trigger stop runs and reopen downside risk toward $1.80. True Strength Index (TSI) remains in bearish territory at -0.80, yet is flattening, hinting that the selling momentum is decelerating. Volume has weakened across recent sessions, confirming the rally lacks conviction. A clear break above $2.22 would be required to invalidate near-term bearish bias. Until that happens, XRP remains vulnerable to weekend drawdowns. Bulls must defend $1.95 or risk deeper losses into next week’s open. A close below $2.00 would reassert sellers’ control short-term.

In response, the EU—America’s largest trading partner—warned it would retaliate with its own countermeasures, including possible taxes on certain US services and targeting American tech firms. Lombard said the European response should “inevitably” have “consequences” for both European and American businesses, but he emphasized that Brussels does not plan to punish all imports. “It is not a question of taxing all American imports, that would be counterproductive, penalizing our economy as much as theirs,” he said. Instead, the minister explained , the EU will carefully “target certain industrial segments, in a precise manner,” while keeping the door open for negotiations that could lead to the tariffs being lifted. He noted that if the two sides strike a balanced agreement “within a reasonable time frame,” it would boost confidence among French companies and households. EU rules already regulate data usage through mechanisms like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Lombard did not elaborate on how any new rules might look. Still, he underlined that all fiscal and regulatory avenues remain under discussion. Musk wants the US and EU to consider a zero-tariff arrangement Meanwhile, entrepreneur Elon Musk expressed hope that Washington and Brussels can forge a “zero-tariff” arrangement. Speaking on Saturday via video link to Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini at a League party event in Florence, Musk said, “Both Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America.” Musk gave his remarks through a videolink at a Saturday League part event in Florence. Source: The Associated Press His remarks came after global markets reacted to Trump’s trade measures. Musk, who has served as a key adviser to the president since January and was a major donor during the campaign, voiced a contrasting stance. He suggested a deeper partnership between the US and Europe, plus greater mobility for workers. “That’s certainly been my advice to the president,” he said, without clarifying whether the guidance focused on tariffs, freedom of movement, or both. Lombard concluded that the EU is keeping fiscal, customs, and regulatory measures on the table if the US fails to roll back the tariffs. But he also expressed optimism about reaching a solution through dialogue, adding that a fair deal built on trust could head off a larger trade conflict.

Cardano is dealing with a confidence crisis after whales offloaded 120 million ADA, dragging price action closer to critical support at $0.64. Solana has dipped to $112, clinging to a year-long support zone. Despite strong ecosystem growth—rising TVL, leading DEX volumes, and cross-chain adoption—its price still reflects market-wide uncertainty. But one project is cutting through the noise with actual execution: BlockDAG . With over $212 million raised, 19 billion tokens sold, and a fully live testnet already enabling dApp deployment and token creation, BlockDAG isn’t waiting for market approval—it’s already building. Add in no-code tools, CertiK and Halborn audits, and over 800,000 miners via the X1 app, and the gap between theory and delivery becomes impossible to ignore. In a space full of potential, BlockDAG is where utility and traction already meet. Cardano Whales Dump 120M ADA—Will Price Crash Before the $1 Breakout? Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.6472 after slipping from an intraday high of $0.6562. Market-wide fear has pushed trading volume down by nearly 29%, with $3 million in ADA liquidated. Whale wallets holding 1M–10M ADA have offloaded 120M tokens in just 48 hours, signaling lowered confidence. Technical indicators are flashing red. The MACD remains below the zero line, CMF sits at -0.15, and the RSI is at 43.59—suggesting bearish momentum. A continued drop could push ADA to support levels near $0.6332 if $0.6402 breaks. Still, long-term investors may see this dip as a chance to enter before any future rally. If buyers return, ADA must clear resistance at $0.6538 and $0.66 to reclaim momentum. Given ADA’s past recovery patterns, some see this pullback as a possible setup for a rebound toward the long-awaited $1 mark. Solana Drops Below $118—But Is Network Growth Signaling a Surprise Rebound? Solana (SOL) is trading below its key $118 support, slipping to $112 amid broad market pressure. This level has held strong since March 2024, but recent technicals remain bearish. However, the ecosystem tells a different story. Solana’s total value locked has surged to 65 million SOL, nearly four times its November level. Daily DEX volume also leads the market at $2.4 billion—outpacing Ethereum. Institutional activity hints at a possible bottom. Binance, after previous selloffs, has resumed buying SOL, suggesting accumulation. Still, SOL must reclaim $115 before any recovery toward $130 can begin. Over $550 million in bridged assets and a spike in token launches also show rising demand. If Solana holds current levels, long-term buyers may see this as a rare entry point backed by strong fundamentals. But if it breaks further, $100 could be next. BlockDAG’s $212M Surge and Live Testnet Puts It Ahead of Every Altcoin in 2025 BlockDAG isn’t just promising change—it’s already delivering. With its Keynote 3, BlockDAG confirmed it’s beyond whitepapers and hype. Its Beta Testnet is live, allowing developers to build dApps, launch tokens, and interact with a real, functioning blockchain. This isn’t a test—it’s happening now. The platform features no-code deployment tools, a developer academy, and real-world use cases across finance, healthcare, and more. It’s also been audited by both Halborn and CertiK, giving it credibility that most early-stage projects can’t claim. Importantly, there’s no VC control, giving BlockDAG a more community-driven feel. So far, over $212 million has been raised in presale, with 19 billion coins sold and more than 800,000 users mining on the X1 App. The BDAG price has soared by 2,380% since Batch 1, and thousands of X-series miners are ready to ship ahead of the mainnet. With all these signs of real traction, analysts are targeting $1 for BDAG in 2025, with room for more. Unlike many projects still in development limbo, BlockDAG is live, fast, and growing. If you”re hunting for the next major altcoin breakout, BlockDAG is already miles ahead of the pack. What’s Next? As Cardano fights to break through $0.66 and Solana clings to $115 amid institutional repositioning, investors are left weighing signals against sentiment. ADA’s RSI hovers near bearish levels, and SOL needs momentum just to reclaim ground it held months ago. BlockDAG, however, is moving on its own timeline. Its $212M presale isn’t built on promises—it’s backed by a working product. Developers are actively building on a live beta testnet. Users are mining in real time. Audits are done. Tools are ready. And the ecosystem is growing without VC oversight. In a cycle where many altcoins are reacting to macro shifts, BlockDAG is creating its own gravity. If 2025 is about separating hype from impact, BDAG is already ahead. It’s not just a top contender—it’s the blueprint for how serious crypto projects should launch and scale. Investors looking for clarity may find it here.

42970880,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63079,1743904836,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"SHIB Dips, PEPE’s Whale Sell-Off: MAGACOIN FINANCE Aims Toward Record Growth with 2927% Potential",https://timestabloid.com/shib-dips-pepes-whale-sell-off-magacoin-finance-aims/,"Have you been keeping up with the rollercoaster of the crypto market lately? One minute, everyone’s losing their minds over the latest meme coin, and the next, everyone’s scrambling to find the next big thing with real utility. Have you had your eyes on the charts? Well, you’ve probably noticed that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE are struggling to keep their heads above water. But hold on—here comes a serious contender that’s shaking things up: MAGACOIN FINANCE . (And nope, it’s NOT just another crypto coin, folks!) MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate the market while SHIB and PEPE attempt to rebuild their positions. This altcoin stands as the best crypto under a penny because it demonstrates a 2927% potential growth rate which you read correctly. MAGACOIN FINANCE operates to modernize decentralized finance while providing practical decentralized finance tools which might transform business and everyday user settings. So, if you’re looking to make a move in the crypto space, you might want to think twice about those meme coins and take a closer look at MAGACOIN FINANCE . SHIB: A Meme Coin’s Struggle for Survival The cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains popular among fans who have supported it for quite some time. The combination of hype from the community and its meme culture enabled SHIB to reach its position among leading meme coins. SHIB’s value has declined by more than 55% from its previous year’s rate, and its burning process has also decreased substantially since then. It’s down by a staggering 99.29%. Ouch. The SHIB trading value at $0.00001278 presents difficulties for meme coin enthusiasts to view it as anything other than a wishful investment. The growth prospects of SHIB should be evaluated. For SHIB to reach a price of $1 it would require a phenomenal increase of 7.7 million percent. (Is that even mathematically possible? Doubt it!) The intense meme popularity of SHIB has given way to an unforgiving understanding of its actual market restrictions. Any serious investor should avoid using SHIB as their main investment vehicle since it operates mainly as a crypto-world novelty rather than a profitable option. The real growth potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE makes it the best crypto under a penny . PEPE: Whale Sell-Off Wrecks the Fun The ongoing difficulties of PEPE should prompt everyone to question their decisions about investing in meme coins. A whale transferred 150 billion PEPE tokens to the market which resulted in a loss of around $1.14 million. The whale acquired 1.5 trillion tokens with a purchase of just over $2,000 dollars which should have made people take notice. The PEPE token hit its maximum value at $43 million before the ‘whale’ trader sold tokens worth $1.14 million which strengthened the negative outlook on this altcoin. The downward path of PEPE demonstrates that meme coins remain extraordinarily risky since their lack of practical uses makes them highly prone to complete collapse. (Not the kind of road you want to drive down if you’re looking for serious crypto gains, right?) The attention PEPE receives initially will not guarantee its survival because it faces a challenging journey going forward. Driving on this path will not lead to substantial crypto gains according to right protocols. Those seeking genuine growth opportunities and stability should consider investing in MAGACOIN FINANCE since it presents a 2927% growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Crypto with Real Utility (And That 2927% Potential) Even though SHIB and PEPE are busy entertaining us with their ups and downs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly making its move as a top contender. You see, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t some fly-by-night crypto coin—it’s a serious cryptocurrency with massive growth potential, and it’s just getting started. With its presale already raking in over $5 million and a projected ROI of 2927%, MAGACOIN FINANCE is on a mission to be the best crypto under a penny. MAGACOIN FINANCE Sets Itself Apart with 2927% Growth Opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE operates through a program which enhances international payment operations with reduced expenses and accelerated transaction speeds for small business owners and freelancers and e-commerce operators. (Can you say game-changer?) Huge Growth Potential Massive Market Demand Real-Life Example The MAGACOIN FINANCE Train Offers a Chance for Investment (Before Its Value Skyrockets) The best penny cryptocurrency today is MAGACOIN FINANCE yet this position will not remain stable for long. The price of MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to rise because the presale shows rapid development which attracts more investors to the project. The time to join the next major crypto development is now because it will only last for a short period. The volatile market does not change the fact that MAGACOIN FINANCE offers real-world applications alongside strong growth predictions and restricted presale periods. Conclusion: The Smart Move in a Shaky Market The crypto market shows wild volatility yet MAGACOIN FINANCE maintains its position above the market turbulence. MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates staying power because meme coins like SHIB and PEPE show signs of short-lived market trends (we apologize again). This cryptocurrency is designed for the long run since it combines utility with growth opportunities that could reach 2927% in value. Are you looking for the best crypto under a penny ? MAGACOIN FINANCE is where it’s at. Don’t sleep on this incredible opportunity – So, go right now and join the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale and lock in your place in the future of crypto!

The drop has ETH testing support near $1,750, with a possible slide to $1,200 if buyers fail to step in. Meanwhile, XRP is gaining steam with Coinbase filing for futures approval and Kraken listing Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. If technicals hold, XRP could rally to $3.51. But the most critical development? BlockDAG’s final testnet is now live—fully EVM-compatible and already pushing over 2,000 TPS. While ETH struggles with congestion and XRP hinges on regulatory wins, BlockDAG is operational and developer-ready. With real smart contract deployment and a no-code dApp builder, it’s not speculation—it’s execution. For buyers looking at practical use and future value, BlockDAG isn’t just part of the conversation—it’s leading it. Ethereum Drops to $1,777: Is a Major Q2 2025 Rally Coming? Ethereum has dropped sharply to around $1,777, down 5% in the last 24 hours. The entire crypto market is reeling after President Trump’s tariff move wiped out $140B in value. ETH is now testing support near $1,750, and if it breaks, it could fall further toward $1,200. Despite this, big buyers are buying. Wallets holding 10,000–100,000 ETH have been quietly increasing their positions since January. Analysts say this mirrors ETH’s price pattern from 2020, right before a major bull run. Technical charts show resistance at $1,820 and $1,880. A clean break above $1,920 could trigger a move toward $2,050. But for now, bearish signals remain strong. Still, long-term buyers might see this dip as an entry point before a possible Q2 rebound. History shows ETH has bounced back from similar levels—and whales seem to be betting on it. XRP Futures Coming to Coinbase? Analysts Eye $3.51 Price Surge Coinbase is seeking CFTC approval to list XRP futures by April 21, a move that could boost institutional interest in Ripple. If approved, this would mark a big step in XRP’s push into regulated crypto markets. XRP is also gaining traction through Kraken’s listing of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, strengthening its ecosystem. Traders are watching closely. XRP is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the charts, typically a sign of a breakout. If momentum builds, analysts see short-term targets at $2.40 and possibly a full rally to $3.51—about a 73% gain from current levels. Market analysts like Dark Defender expect the correction to end soon, while others highlight price compression as a bullish signal. With futures, stablecoin growth, and chart patterns aligning, some buyers may see this as a timely entry point before XRP’s next big move. BlockDAG’s Testnet Goes Live: Is BDAG the Next Ethereum? BlockDAG is quietly stealing the spotlight. Its final beta testnet is now live—fast, dev-ready, and fully compatible with Ethereum. With over 2,000 transactions per second, real smart contract deployment, and tools like a no-code dApp builder, BlockDAG isn’t just preparing—it’s already working. This live testnet isn’t about hype—it’s proof. Developers can already build and deploy using Solidity, without the bottlenecks Ethereum users face. BlockDAG also offers features like a built-in IDE and no high gas fees, creating a frictionless environment for both new and seasoned developers. For early buyers, this changes the game. BDAG isn’t a promise of future tech—it’s the native token of a functioning network, already in use. With over $212 million raised and 19.2 billion coins sold, the presale momentum speaks for itself. Now in batch 27 at $0.0248, BDAG is up 2,380% since launch. BlockDAG is already moving forward. This might be one of the last chances to get in before listings. If you’re looking for the next big crypto , this could be it. Best Cryptos For 2025 Ethereum’s whale accumulation and XRP’s futures push show potential—but both rely on speculation and regulatory clarity. ETH needs to break $1,920 to reverse its trend, while XRP depends on CFTC approval and technical momentum. BlockDAG, however, has already delivered. Its beta testnet isn’t a demo—it’s a fully functioning platform, attracting real development. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 and already up 2,380% from its presale launch, it’s offering tangible value and unmatched upside. While ETH and XRP move on what could happen, BlockDAG is building what’s already happening. The numbers speak: $212 million raised, over 19.2 billion coins sold, and a working network before listings. In a market filled with narratives, BlockDAG offers a rare reality—utility, growth, and entry before mass adoption. For buyers deciding between momentum and infrastructure, the smart bet in 2025 may already be live.

42969950,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146772,1743904844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Dogecoin Whale Buys in, Pi Coin Cracks Below $0.60 But BlockDAG’s $212M Testnet Run May Outshine Both in 2025",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dogecoin-whale-buys-in-pi-coin-cracks-below-0-60-but-blockdags-212m-testnet-run-may-outshine-both-in-2025/,"Dogecoin is attempting to rebound after whales scooped up 220 million DOGE, hinting at renewed interest around the $0.16 level. Pi Coin, however, faces pressure from within—community criticism, a stalled ecosystem, and no exchange listings have dragged it down nearly 20% this week. It now teeters near $0.60, with little support unless sentiment shifts. But amid the noise, BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a different story. With a $212M presale haul, a live testnet already running, and a 2,380% price climb since Batch 1, BDAG is functioning where others are floundering. It’s not just attracting hype—it’s proving utility with EVM and WASM compatibility, over 100 testnet nodes, and major dev partnerships. In a landscape filled with speculation, BlockDAG is quietly laying the foundation of what could be 2025’s biggest altcoin success story. Dogecoin Whales Buy 220M DOGE—Is a Breakout Above $0.174 Next? Dogecoin is holding above $0.16 after a volatile week that saw prices swing between $0.179 and $0.156. The spike in volatility—reaching 86.3%—came after a sharp sell-off, pushing DOGE down to $0.155 before a slight recovery. Now trading near $0.168, the token is testing resistance around the 50% Fibonacci level. If it clears $0.174, bulls could target the $0.18 mark. On-chain data shows whale wallets bought 220 million DOGE in the past month—about $36 million—hinting at growing confidence despite short-term uncertainty. Key support lies between $0.158 and $0.160. If this zone holds, a V-shaped recovery could strengthen. Indicators like the RSI rising above 50 and weakening MACD bearishness add to that possibility. For long-term investors, this whale activity may suggest a hidden opportunity before any potential breakout, especially if Bitcoin supports broader recovery. Pi Coin Sinks 20%—Can It Break Free From the $0.60 Trap This April? Pi Coin has dropped sharply, falling below $0.70 with heavy selling pushing its price closer to $0.60. Trading volume has plunged 52% to $148 million, and the recent token unlock has added pressure. While the Pi Network promoted real-world use with PiFest, community feedback remains critical. Whale trades are rare, and ecosystem trading has stalled. Technical charts show a falling wedge pattern, with a possible breakout above $0.72 that could trigger a short-term move toward $0.75. However, many still doubt Pi’s future, citing poor communication from the team and lack of major exchange listings. Bybit’s founder even refused to list it, citing ongoing concerns. Despite this, some investors see Pi’s long-term potential, especially if Bitcoin recovers and Pi breaks resistance. Until then, Pi Coin remains a high-risk play stuck in a tight range, with key support at $0.60. BlockDAG’s 2,380% Surge and $212M Presale: Is This the Next $1 Crypto in 2025? BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about cryptos of 2025—and for good reason. Its Layer 1 design combines Proof-of-Work security with DAG architecture, allowing transactions to be processed simultaneously. This removes the bottlenecks seen in networks like Ethereum, making BlockDAG faster and more scalable. So far, the project has raised over $212 million in its presale, with more than 19.2 billion BDAG coins sold. Early investors who bought in at $0.001 are already sitting on gains of 2,380%, as the current price hits $0.0248. Analysts believe BDAG could touch $1 by year’s end, fueled by its successful beta testnet launch, upcoming exchange listings, and key partnerships with SpaceDev and HackerEarth. BlockDAG supports both EVM and WASM environments, giving developers the tools to build everything from DeFi protocols to AI dApps and NFT marketplaces. With a $30 million grant fund and over 100 testnet nodes live, its ecosystem is growing fast. In a market flooded with hype, BlockDAG is proving it’s more than a promise—it’s a functioning, fast-moving project. If you’re looking for the next big altcoin with real potential, BlockDAG might just be it. Takeaway Dogecoin’s whale-backed support and Pi Coin’s potential breakout from a falling wedge show signs of life—but both remain tied to uncertain narratives. DOGE relies on Bitcoin’s momentum to hold gains, while Pi Coin still struggles with a trust deficit and limited ecosystem usage. BlockDAG, meanwhile, has already cleared several hurdles. It isn’t promising testnets—it launched one. It’s not hinting at growth—it’s funding it with $30M in grants and onboarding developers now. The difference is clear: while DOGE and PI are waiting for momentum, BDAG is building it in real time. Analysts eye $1 targets based not on hype, but on working infrastructure, proven adoption, and clear deliverables.

What began as a playful experiment in 2013 morphed into a phenomenon, with early adopters reaping massive gains as its price soared to an all-time high of $0.6905 in May 2021. While those who missed Dogecoin’s meteoric rise might feel that the opportunity to turn a small investment into a fortune is lost, a new promising AI-powered crypto project currently in its presale phase is poised to offer a second chance at life-changing returns. With its innovative features and explosive growth potential, this new altcoin could be the ticket for those kicking themselves over missing Dogecoin’s golden days. The Dogecoin Rise, Fall, and Fading Momentum Dogecoin’s early days were nothing short of remarkable. Launched as a joke, it quickly gained traction, hitting its first all-time high of $0.00234 in January 2014 after a stunning climb from obscurity. While the initial bull run showcased Dogecoin’s potential, it wasn’t until the 2021 crypto frenzy, fueled by endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, that Dogecoin truly shone, surging to $0.6905. Following the 2021 rally, early investors who bought in at fractions of a cent saw gains exceeding 100,000%. However, today, the story has shifted. As of April 1, 2025, Dogecoin price sat at $0.1738, down 74.82% from its peak, despite an 8% uptick in 24 hours. Technical indicators paint a bearish picture, with most signaling “sell” and the price struggling below key exponential moving averages. Also, forecasts suggest a modest $1.13 by year-end 2025, with a long-term climb to $2.34 by 2030, which, though respectable, remains a far cry from the explosive momentum of its youth. For those dreaming of Dogecoin-level gains, its growth engine appears to be slowing, leaving latecomers searching for the next big thing. RCO Finance Presale Offers a Chance to Those Who Missed DOGE While Dogecoin’s early magic fades, RCO Finance emerges as a compelling alternative. Currently in its fifth presale stage, the RCOF token has already surged 684% from its initial price to $0.10, signaling the potential for further gains post-presale. The presale journey doesn’t stop there, though. The sixth presale stage will see the price rise to $0.13, before continuing to climb towards the final presale price of $0.2142 in the final round. Upon listing on exchanges, the team expected RCOF to debut at between $0.4 and $0.6, with the potential to explode past $1 within days. For context, a $1,000 investment in the early presale stages will have ballooned to $30,000 at listing, a 3,000% return reminiscent of Dogecoin’s heyday. Notably, as the presale comes to a close, the RCO Finance team has already launched a beta platform , attracting over 10,000 users, and is now refining its alpha version for an imminent release. Also, this presale isn’t just a token sale; it’s a gateway to a revolutionary ecosystem, offering a second chance for those who missed Dogecoin’s initial surge. With a deflationary model burning unsold tokens and a smart contract audited by SolidProof , RCO Finance’s foundation is built for stability and growth. Why RCO Finance Could Outshine Dogecoin’s Legacy Besides its ongoing token presale, what sets RCO Finance apart is its cutting-edge features, blending AI innovation with user-centric design. At its core is the AI-powered Robo Advisor, a game-changer that crafts personalized investment strategies based on real-time market data, user goals, and risk tolerance. Imagine using the Robo Advisor to spot the next trending altcoins like Compound (COMP), which has soared by almost 100% following its listing on Upbit , or to dodge losses with precise buy and sell signals. Unlike Dogecoin, which thrives on hype, RCO Finance offers utility across over 120,000 assets, from stocks and ETFs to tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and cryptocurrencies, all tradable with up to 1,000x leverage. Also, its KYC-free ecosystem prioritizes privacy, slashing onboarding hassles and appealing to DeFi enthusiasts. Post-alpha platform launch, analysts predict the RCOF token could skyrocket past $10 within months, driven by its real-world asset tokenization and community governance via RCOF tokens. Notably, RCOF isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a sophisticated platform poised to redefine retail investing, potentially eclipsing Dogecoin’s legacy with tangible value. As Dogecoin’s growth slows, RCO Finance (RCOF) stands ready to capture the imagination of investors seeking that elusive second chance. For those who missed Dogecoin’s early days, RCO Finance could be the key to rewriting the script, turning regret into riches in 2025 and beyond.

The new token, ‘REAL,’ was only launched through an auction to prevent snipers and bots from taking over the launch. The asset was also developed closely by Real World Gaming decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and will provide staking incentives and governance rights for its holders. McGregor assures users that his new token will change the crypto ecosystem McGregor defended the token’s release, claiming this isn’t your ordinary celebrity-backed meme-coin. He tried to assure users that assets will bring real change to the crypto industry and the world. In an X post on April 5, he commented, ‘I changed the FIGHT game. I changed the WHISKEY game. I changed the STOUT game. Now it’s time to change the CRYPTO game. This is just the beginning.” Speaking in an interview, the MMA champion also insisted that the REAL token is centered on transparency and that they are demonstrating how it’s done with integrity to the world. According to the project’s tokenomics, the DAO treasury will get 31.5% of the token supply while the community will receive almost 17%. Meanwhile, the developer team and advisors will each get 10% and 1%, respectively. Moreover, the token’s whitepaper reveals that holders who pour in large investments and participate regularly in staking will earn higher status and possibly more revenue shares. Additionally, the token aims to redefine the gambling industry by aligning it more closely with real-life experiences and mainstream consumers — indicating that McGregor and his team intend to channel the funds into launching ventures tied to sports and gaming. Nicolai Sondergaard believes meme coin traders could easily leave their positions for quick gains The perception around meme coins has not changed much, despite Donald Trump and his family introducing new tokens to the market. According to Nansen research analyst Nicolai Sondergaard, “smart money” traders are still seeking meme coin trades but are just as likely to sell their assets for quick profits. Sondergaard believes the rise in meme coin activity at the moment is due to traders trying out the market as they wait for the overall macroeconomic environment to settle. Trump’s new reciprocal tariffs have made it even more challenging for stock markets to thrive, forcing investors to look into other projects like meme coins. US stocks have already lost more than $5 trillion in value just two days after Trump announced his tariffs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

It’s the worst. Some people watched Bitcoin explode past $60,000 from just a few dollars. Others saw Ethereum climb from under $1 to thousands. Now, Cosmos and Bitcoin Cash are making serious moves, grabbing attention with their latest developments. But while these two giants are evolving, a new name—Qubetics—is stepping into the spotlight, aiming to solve real-world problems that no other blockchain has tackled efficiently. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another token; it’s the first-ever Web3 aggregator uniting leading blockchains into one seamless ecosystem. Unlike Cosmos, which focuses on interoperability between blockchains, and Bitcoin Cash, which aims for faster transactions, Qubetics goes beyond by integrating next-level decentralization solutions. Its Decentralized VPN (dVPN) is already proving how blockchain can revolutionize digital privacy. As one of the top rated crypto projects gaining serious momentum, Qubetics is setting a new standard for security and interoperability. The kicker? The Qubetics presale is already raising millions, and early buyers are in before the next price jump. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN: A New Era for Digital Privacy Internet privacy is a joke these days. Big tech tracks every click, government surveillance is at an all-time high, and traditional VPNs? They promise security but still operate on centralized servers, making them vulnerable. This is exactly where Qubetics steps in with its game-changing Decentralized VPN (dVPN), offering true anonymity and security through blockchain technology. Unlike conventional VPNs that depend on single control points, Qubetics’ dVPN runs on a fully decentralized peer-to-peer network. That means no single entity can track, monitor, or restrict online activity. Whether it’s an activist in a censorship-heavy country, a journalist protecting sources, or a business securing sensitive data, Qubetics’ dVPN ensures total online freedom. For businesses, especially those handling confidential client information, Qubetics provides an edge. Imagine a law firm dealing with high-profile cases. Traditional VPNs still leave data at risk, but with Qubetics’ dVPN, secure multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption make data leaks practically impossible. As one of the top rated crypto projects focusing on privacy and security, Qubetics is redefining how sensitive data is protected in the digital age. Similarly, financial institutions needing airtight security can integrate dVPN for truly anonymous and untraceable transactions, reducing fraud risks. Even for everyday users, the benefits are massive. Picture a remote worker accessing company files from a public WiFi network. With traditional VPNs, there’s still a chance of data exposure if the provider’s servers get compromised. Qubetics eliminates that risk by ensuring data never flows through a centralized server, making it impossible to trace or exploit. The best part? Users don’t need technical expertise—just plug into the Qubetics ecosystem, and they’re good to go. Qubetics Presale: The Most Anticipated Top Rated Crypto Investment Opportunity Qubetics isn’t just about innovation—it’s also about wealth-building opportunities. Community members who get in early are locking in one of the most promising presales of the year. Right now, Qubetics presale is in its 28th stage, with each $TICS token priced at $0.1430. Over $15.8 million has already been raised, and with more than 24,300 token holders securing their positions, over 506 million $TICS tokens have been sold. Unlike most projects where presales drag on forever, Qubetics has a clear system—each presale stage lasts only 7 days, ending every Sunday at 12 AM, followed by a 10% price increase. This means anyone getting in now will have a direct advantage over those who wait even a week. Plus, with the Qubetics mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, this isn’t just speculation—real adoption is on the horizon. For those wondering about potential gains, the numbers speak for themselves. But let’s talk real numbers—what happens if Qubetics follows the trajectory of other successful projects? If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, that’s a 599.21% return. At $5, it’s a jaw-dropping 3,396.06% ROI. And for those thinking long-term, if $TICS reaches $10 after the mainnet launch, that’s a 6,892.12% return. Even a conservative investment of $1,000 today could potentially turn into $69,000 at this rate. With the best crypto presale rapidly gaining traction, those who act fast could be looking at one of the highest return opportunities in 2025. As Qubetics continues to revolutionize blockchain utility with real-world applications, it’s positioning itself as a top rated crypto that could deliver massive gains for early adopters. Cosmos: The Future of Blockchain Interoperability While Qubetics is setting the stage for Web3 aggregation, Cosmos is still one of the leading names in blockchain interoperability. The project’s main selling point is its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which allows different blockchains to talk to each other seamlessly. Recently, Cosmos has been making waves with new upgrades that aim to enhance security and efficiency across its network. The biggest update revolves around the ATOM 2.0 proposal, which introduces improved staking mechanisms and better economic incentives for validators. This could significantly impact how staking rewards work, making Cosmos even more appealing for those looking to earn passive income through crypto. Another major milestone is Cosmos’ increasing integration with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Developers are now able to build cross-chain applications with ease, making Cosmos a key player in the expanding multi-chain future. Given how interoperability is shaping the next generation of blockchain, Cosmos remains a project worth watching closely. Bitcoin Cash: Fast, Scalable, and Ready for Adoption Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was born out of a simple idea—make Bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. And it’s been doing just that. With its larger block size compared to Bitcoin, transactions are quicker and cost a fraction of what BTC transactions do. In recent months, Bitcoin Cash has been pushing adoption harder than ever. Several major retailers and payment platforms have started accepting BCH, making it a practical currency for real-world transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, which is often seen as digital gold, BCH is positioning itself as digital cash—a cryptocurrency designed to be spent, not just held. There’s also been major progress on the SmartBCH network, which allows developers to create smart contracts on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. This gives BCH more utility beyond just payments, opening doors for DeFi applications, NFTs, and even Web3 gaming. With crypto adoption increasing worldwide, Bitcoin Cash’s focus on usability could help it maintain strong relevance in the coming years. Conclusion: Which Top Rated Crypto Will Lead the Next Bull Run? Qubetics, Cosmos, and Bitcoin Cash each bring something unique to the table. Cosmos is ensuring that different blockchains can work together seamlessly, making it a strong contender for long-term infrastructure development. Bitcoin Cash continues to solidify itself as a true digital currency, offering fast, low-cost transactions with increasing real-world adoption. But among these three, Qubetics is the one changing the game entirely—with its Decentralized VPN, interoperability, and an ongoing Qubetics presale that’s already attracting thousands of early buyers. With its mainnet launch set for Q2 2025 and the chance to join this crypto presale before the next price increase, those looking for the next top rated crypto to ride into the future might not need to look any further.

BofA customer Brandon Wilson was leaving a bar in Chicago on Labor Day in September of 2024 when he was accosted by thugs, reports ABC 7 Chicago. “As I was waiting for my Uber outside, a group of people surrounded me. They threatened me. They asked me to empty my wallet, to give them my phone, to unlock my phone… I was beyond terrified. I followed what they said, because I thought I was going to have my life taken from me.” After getting home and finding $4,446 had been transferred out of his Bank of America account via multiple Zelle transactions, Wilson called the trillion-dollar lender and reported the fraudulent activity. Bank of America temporarily credited his account and Wilson assumed that would be the end of it. “At that point I thought I was good.” The week after, however, Bank of America sent Wilson a letter claiming he had authorized or permitted the transactions. “Brandon, we’re unable to approve your recent claim. The charge was authorized by you or made by someone who has permission to use the card or account.” Wilson, who has been with Bank of America since he was 14, submitted another fraud claim but the trillion-dollar lender again rejected his claim. After ABC 7 Chicago reached out to Bank of America, a spokesperson for second-largest bank in the US after JPMorgan Chase said the case would be reviewed. Wilson is now hoping Bank of America will reimburse him. “It’s clear as day that I didn’t make these charges.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The most watched tokens in this space right now include Cardano (ADA) that uses integration tactics to recover momentum and XRP that stays within restricted price ranges despite legal success while Remittix (RTX) emerges as a promising payment asset that experts favor for this year’s investments. The real-world focus of the market presents itself through these three assets which demonstrate evolving crypto market development patterns. Cardano’s Strategic Vision Continues to Unfold The most recent Cardano news shows that this project aims to prove its lasting financial value contribution. ADA maintains its position as one of the high-capitalized altcoins through trading at $0.6501 on April 5, 2025 despite recent periods of decreased market speculation. Technical indicators indicate ADA maintains support among the price range of $0.635 to $0.682 before analysts predict a breakout opportunity at $0.69. A successful market surge over $0.69 would lift ADA to a price range above $0.80 to $0.85 whereas a downward movement below $0.635 could trigger an ADA decline to test the $0.45 support level. The technical framework of ADA has gained support from ongoing projects which target additional ADA applications. Cardano has created excitement in developer circles because its developers plan an implementation of Bitcoin connectivity through sidechain architecture. The proposed idea seeks to enable Bitcoin digital assets to cross between networks by using Cardano infrastructure while upholding decentralized operations. Such successful implementation of innovative features will contribute to ADA’s development as a high-assurance platform for smart contracts and institutional applications, which it initiated at its start. XRP Holds Ground While Waiting for Momentum XRP maintains uncertain investor perceptions as it persists in its current trading area of $2.09 to $2.17. XRP maintains its position between $2.09 and $2.17 in the current market, while trading near $2.14. The token has failed to leverage the 2024 SEC resolution that defined XRP as non-security, despite the long-awaited decision being reached. The initial price rally of XRP after the ruling shows limited continued momentum in the market. Analysts now find themselves split. Some XRP analysts support a price rise toward $2.80 to $3.00 during the mid-year period because they believe institutions will increase demand as Ripple expands its banking operations into African markets and Latin America. The pessimistic view maintains that XRP faces risks because of market volatility and the weak interest from retail investors. The analysts believe XRP’s price might fall down to $1.90 and below if critical support points break. Remittix Emerges as a Utility-Driven Disruptor The clear consumer-friendly model of Remittix (RTX) attracts investors since it differs from Cardano’s infrastructure-first approach and XRP’s institutional focus. Through Remittix users can perform instant cryptocurrency-to-fiat conversions while their funds get automatically deposited into any worldwide supported bank account. RTX stands out as a special token that integrates blockchain innovation together with immediate practical application due to its capability to enable fast money transfers across borders. Remittix gives people from areas with steep remittance fees and limited bank access a suitable and relatively inexpensive option to send money internationally. The token RTX exists during its pre-sale period with current market value at $0.0734. The RTX project successfully acquired over $14.3 million from its market sales while distributing 526 million tokens to investors. The increasing numbers demonstrate both market curiosity and strengthening belief that the platform will survive in the long run. Remittix earns standing among 2025 projects set for fifty-times or higher returns according to analysts provided that adoption reaches extensive markets like Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. Utility, Timing, and Long-Term Vision The crypto market displays a key difference which becomes evident through current conditions. Cardano maintains its focus on technical advancements while needing to achieve greater user popularity from this technology. XRP fights against depleted investor interest because of its recent legal breakthroughs and institutional relationship developments. The market demonstrates interest in agile products when companies like Remittix present simple usage solutions together with an optimized structure. The evolution of Cardano news and XRP stability indicates that Remittix and similar tokens signify an upcoming crypto timeline focused on resolving problems instead of speculative investments.

With 2025 shaping up to be the ultimate year for explosive crypto growth, investors are hunting for the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Whether it’s the next Shiba Inu, a doge-inspired sensation, or an entirely fresh narrative-driven phenomenon, meme coins are more than just internet jokes—they’re wealth-building opportunities. Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the charge, bringing an epic adventure to the blockchain. Unlike typical meme coins, this one tells a legendary story of exploration, myth, and hidden treasures. Alongside it, Meme Coin and Bonk are also making serious moves, drawing in massive investor interest with their unique value propositions. For those looking to turn a small investment into an enormous payday, now’s the time to jump in. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Mystical Journey to Uncharted Wealth Deep in the icy frontiers of the unknown, Arctic Pablo Coin embarks on a mission unlike anything seen in crypto before. He’s not just another meme—he’s a legend in the making, traveling across mystical frozen lands to unearth the secrets of $APC, a coin imbued with the magic of the Arctic. Every presale phase unlocks a new chapter in Pablo’s journey, revealing hidden locations where wealth and adventure await. Arctic Pablo Coin is revolutionizing crypto investing by turning it into an exhilarating journey. While others follow trends, Pablo is charting his own course—one mystical location at a time. Now at its 17th destination, Glacial Glade, the project has already raised over $2 million, with its current price at just $0.000087. At this stage of Pablo’s location-based presale, a $500 investment grants 5,747,125 APCs. When $APC reaches its launch price of $0.008, that investment skyrockets to $45,977. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin even more irresistible is its burn mechanism. Unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation weekly, ensuring scarcity and increasing value over time. Plus, with a 66% APY staking program, those who stake their coins will see their holdings multiply. Arctic Pablo isn’t just a meme coin—it’s an entire adventure wrapped in a financial powerhouse. It is one of the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Meme Coin: The King of Chaos and Profit Meme Coin is living up to its name, embodying the wild, unpredictable energy that makes meme coins some of the most thrilling investments in the crypto space. Riding the waves of internet culture, Meme Coin taps into virality, ensuring that it stays at the center of every meme-based discussion in the crypto world. Unlike projects that fizzle out, Meme Coin constantly evolves, keeping investors engaged and the market intrigued. But it’s not just hype driving this token—it’s utility and liquidity. Meme Coin’s deflationary tokenomics include scheduled burns and strategic liquidity injections, making it a meme coin that holds weight in the long run. Investors are witnessing parabolic growth, with some projections estimating a 3000% surge before the end of the year. This isn’t just another dog-themed clone—it’s a movement powered by the internet’s most potent force: humor. Bonk: Solana’s Meme Coin Titan with Unmatched Potential Bonk is rewriting the rules of meme coin dominance, proving that Solana isn’t just for DeFi—it’s a breeding ground for high-flying meme coins. Bonk exploded onto the scene as Solana’s answer to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, quickly becoming the network’s top community-driven meme token. But Bonk’s unique integration with Solana’s ecosystem sets it apart, offering more than just speculative gains. Bonk’s liquidity pools and decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations provide yet another edge. Investors can stake, farm, and lend Bonk, opening up multiple revenue streams beyond simple price appreciation. With major Solana projects integrating Bonk as a native payment token, demand is skyrocketing, and analysts predict that a 2000% increase is well within reach. As Solana gains more traction in 2025, Bonk is poised to be one of the biggest meme coin success stories of the year.

Each project offers massive ROI potential, unique market positioning, and strong community support.

Crypto investors looking for high APYs, deflationary tokenomics, and explosive growth can’t afford to overlook these meme coins.

Sacks has been vocal about the AI race since taking on his role following US President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 . Just over a week into the job, Sacks said he is “confident in the US, but we can’t be complacent.” Llama 4 “best in their class for multimodality,” says Meta Sack’s latest comment came after Meta’s AI division said in an X post on the same day that it is introducing the fourth generation of its Llama models, Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick. Source: David Sacks “Our most advanced models yet and the best in their class for multimodality,” Meta said. Meta said its Llama 4 Scout model has 17 billion active parameters and uses 16 experts. The company claims it outperforms rival large language models — Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-lite, and Mistral 3.1 — “across a broad range of widely accepted benchmarks.” Meanwhile, Llama 4 Maverick also has 17 billion active parameters but is configured with 128 experts. Meta claimed the Maverick model can outperform GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash “across a broad range of widely accepted benchmarks.” Llama 4 Maverick instruction-tuned benchmarks.

At the time, Meta said it was “blown away” by the demand, receiving over 100,000 requests for access.

The announcement was made via the game’s official X account. It cited Base’s inability to handle transaction volume during the game’s launch and broader concerns about the scalability of EVM-based chains. Infected Ditches Ethereum’s Layer 2 for Solana “Infected crashed Base,” the team stated , referencing the game’s launch, which attracted 130,000 sign-ups within 48 hours. The sudden demand led to a spike in gas prices and failed transactions, especially in the first 30 minutes. This issue, according to the developers, significantly impacted the game’s momentum and user experience. Describing the incident, they noted that many users were unable to participate and subsequently abandoned the game, which runs on a 7-day cycle reliant on real-time interaction. While the developers acknowledged that the issue was not unique to Base, they framed it as part of a larger, ongoing limitation across all EVM-compatible chains. Despite previously believing Layer 2 solutions were the future of Ethereum scalability, the team said that it now views these bottlenecks as structural and unresolved in the near term. The shift to Solana was also driven by what the team identified as two key advantages: culture and user base. They drew a contrast between Ethereum’s technically advanced but builder-focused ecosystem and Solana’s more user-oriented approach. According to the post, Solana’s developer community is more closely aligned with current consumer behavior, as seen in the success of other Solana-native applications such as Pump.fun and DAOs.fun. Additionally, user feedback played a role in the decision. The Infected team said many players requested a version of the game built on Solana to avoid the need to bridge assets. The post read, “If they are on XRP, we’d go to XRP. If that was Bitcoin mainnet, we’d go there. But today’s users are on Solana.” The team also highlighted that their future games will also launch on Solana, aligning with what they see as the best available infrastructure for high-volume, consumer-facing applications. Response Head of Base and Coinbase Wallet Jesse Pollak responded to Infected’s announcement, saying that while he respected teams building on any platform, he felt compelled to clarify what he described as factual inaccuracies. “Base did not crash – the chain hummed along, just as it should.” He wrote that the technical issues experienced during Infected’s launch were related to frontend problems, which the game’s team had previously acknowledged and discussed with Base. The Infected team, however, denied this claim. Meanwhile, Pollak added that the team behind the Coinbase-incubated network had reached out to Infected immediately after their migration announcement, but had not received a response.

33767162,[object Object],1743910245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Shiba Inu Price In April: ML Algorithm Predicts 96.54% Jump In Shocking Timeline,https://bitcoinist.com/a-shiba-inu-96-54-jump/,"Coincodex , a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, has shared a bullish prediction for the Shiba Inu price in April. Despite being in a prolonged downtrend, CoinCodex boldly forecasts that Shiba Inu can rise by over 96.54% in a few days. Shiba Inu Price To Hit 96.54% In 5 Days CoinCodex has released a shocking short-term Shiba Inu price prediction, expecting a sharp rebound to the upside once bearish conditions subside. Considering how Shiba Inu has been trading sideways for the past few months, the analyst’s timeline for this bullish forecast comes as a surprise. The Machine Learning algorithm predicts that over the next five days, the SHIB price will experience a rally to reach a new target of $0.00002547. This impressive 96.54% surge is expected to occur by April 3 based on the timeline of the forecast. The projected rise would also mark Shiba Inu’s highest price target for the month of April. Despite maintaining a bullish outlook on SHIB , CoinCodex acknowledged that the meme coin had severely underperformed in March , shedding over 9.78% of its already low value. However, this recent dip has not dampened the optimism, as the machine learning algorithm anticipates a quick price recovery. For its general April forecast , CoinCodex has predicted that SHIB will start the second quarter of the year with a potential decrease to $0.0000127 from its previous high. This would represent a 50% decline from the predicted $0.00002547 target and a 12% surge from Shiba Inu’s current market value of $0.0000123. SHIB Technical Indicators Flash Red While CoinCodex’s bullish 5-day prediction for Shiba Inu prediction seemingly brings hope for investors and traders, it has also issued a cautionary note, highlighting that several technical indicators are currently flashing red. The Fear and Greed Index is sitting at a low value of 26, indicating that the market is in a state of uncertainty. This suggests that investors are bearish and may hesitate to enter or hold positions, potentially signaling a further price pullback or consolidation before any significant upward movement. SHIB has also had 15 out of 30 green days in the past month, recording an 8.96% decline during this time, according to CoinMarketCap. SHIB’s market sentiment is also negative, signaling a lack of investor confidence that could lead to reduced buying pressure. For now, Shiba Inu’s 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) , which stands at 46, places it in a neutral zone, indicating that the asset is neither oversold nor overbought. To reach CoinCodex’s projected surge of $0.00002547, Shiba Inu will need to overcome current bearish pressure and generate strong bullish momentum quickly. This would require a significant shift in market sentiment and investor demand.",Altcoins|Shiba Inu|CoinCodex|Coinmarketcap|fear and greed index|machine learning|ML|relative strength index|RSI|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-06 03:30:45

Among these advancements, tokenization stands out as a game-changer, poised to revolutionize asset ownership, investment accessibility and global liquidity. But how exactly is tokenization reshaping the financial markets, and what does the future hold for investors? Let’s explore. Understanding tokenization in finance Tokenization refers to the process of converting RWAs (real-world assets) – such as real estate, stocks, commodities or even fine art – into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent fractional ownership of an asset, allowing for secure, transparent and efficient trading without the need for traditional intermediaries. This concept is not entirely new, but recent advancements in blockchain infrastructure have made tokenized assets more viable than ever. The key benefits include the following. Increased liquidity – Tokenized assets can be traded 24/7, providing liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets like real estate. Fractional ownership – Investors can own a portion of high-value assets, lowering entry barriers and democratizing investment opportunities. Security and transparency – Blockchain ensures that transactions are immutable, reducing fraud and enhancing investor confidence. Faster settlement times – Traditional financial settlements can take days, whereas blockchain-based transactions are nearly instantaneous. Industries leading the tokenization movement Tokenization is disrupting multiple industries, from real estate to fine art and beyond. Here are some notable examples. 1. Real Estate Property tokenization allows investors to purchase fractional ownership in high-value real estate properties. Companies like RealT and Lofty AI are already leveraging blockchain to make real estate investment more accessible. 2. Stock markets Stock exchanges are exploring tokenized securities, which could enable global 24/7 trading without intermediaries. For instance, the Swiss SDX (SIX Digital Exchange) has introduced tokenized bonds and equities. 3. Commodities and precious metals Gold-backed tokens – such as Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT) – provide a digital alternative to physical gold investments with seamless global trading. 4. Alternative assets – Art, collectibles and IP rights Platforms like Masterworks enable investors to own shares of high-value artwork, turning exclusive assets into tradable digital securities. Challenges and regulatory landscape Despite its advantages, tokenization still faces regulatory hurdles. Financial authorities worldwide are grappling with how to classify and oversee tokenized assets. Will they be treated as securities? How will taxation and investor protections evolve? The answers will shape the trajectory of this revolutionary technology. The future of tokenized finance As institutional investors warm up to digital assets, tokenization is likely to become a mainstream financial instrument. In the coming years, we can expect the following. More government-backed tokenized assets – e.g., CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) Integration with traditional finance – hybrid models combining blockchain and conventional banking Wider adoption in emerging markets, where access to traditional banking is limited Conclusion – Are we ready for the tokenized economy Tokenization is no longer a futuristic concept – it’s happening now. The next decade will likely see a profound shift toward digitized financial systems, with blockchain at the core. Investors, institutions and regulators must collaborate to ensure a secure, scalable and inclusive financial ecosystem.

Bitcoin is near its record highs, and fresh altcoins are gaining traction. With this shift, many are now asking—what are the best-performing cryptos to watch today? While long-standing names like Bitcoin and Cardano stay central to the blockchain space, a newer Layer 1 chain is making noise—BlockDAG. With parallel processing power, no congestion issues, and already crossing $211.5 million in presale funds, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a major name in crypto’s future. Here’s a breakdown of the 6 best-performing cryptos in 2025—featuring both trusted names and powerful new players. BlockDAG (BDAG): Presale Gem with Huge Growth Ahead BlockDAG (BDAG) has gained serious attention lately due to more than just its strong presale performance. After bringing in $211.5 million and selling over 19.1 billion BDAG coins across 27 batches, it’s getting picked up quickly by large-scale holders. The current BDAG price sits at $0.0248, with forecasts suggesting a 2,380% increase once exchange listings go live. Its strong architecture makes it stand out. BlockDAG’s system is based on DAG tech, which enables it to process thousands of transactions each second, surpassing older blockchain systems in speed. This tech foundation makes it ideal for powering everything from DeFi apps to wide-scale decentralized services. During Keynote 3, one highlight was BlockDAG’s aim to onboard over 1,000 decentralized apps by 2026. These will cover real-use cases such as payments, NFTs, and AI-powered tools. Additionally, its Token & NFT Wizard makes it simple for people to build projects without needing expert-level coding. BlockDAG has already rolled out a beta version of its Testnet. With more than 100 active nodes and a growing mining network using the X1 app and mining hardware like X30 and X100, BlockDAG is shaping an entire system—not just a coin. Solana (SOL): Fast Execution and Developer-Driven Solana continues to be known for its speed and low cost. Over 400 active dApps are currently running on it, covering everything from DeFi to meme coins in 2025. The network’s focus on high performance makes it a major choice for developers. Recent capital raised for projects on Solana has exceeded $170 million. The network is also pushing harder toward decentralization. While Ethereum faces delays and traffic issues, Solana is becoming the go-to option, making SOL one of the best-performing cryptos right now. Ripple (XRP): Bridging Global Payments XRP’s role in making global transfers faster remains strong, thanks to multiple payment service deals. Major financial players like Unicâmbio are already using Ripple’s technology, helping XRP grow into a link between traditional banks and blockchain tech. Large holders have picked up over 1 billion XRP recently. With the legal case with the SEC close to final steps and real-use expanding, XRP is among the top altcoins that might rise in 2025. Bonk (BONK): More Than Just a Meme Coin Bonk is different from other meme tokens—it brings utility to the Solana chain. The community behind it has burned a portion of tokens, built NFT links, and added BONK to real-use payment tools. Its rise continues as it’s adopted across Solana-based DeFi platforms and staking services. For those open to fun but useful cryptos, Bonk combines both with promising growth potential. Cardano (ADA): Expanding Decentralization Cardano is progressing toward full on-chain control. The upcoming Plomin fork will allow ADA users to vote directly on upgrades, building a truly self-managed blockchain. With plans to allow Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano and make ADA a usable fee currency, the project is expanding beyond early expectations. The possible approval of a Cardano ETF might also bring in more attention and liquidity. Bitcoin (BTC): Still the Foundation Even with price changes, Bitcoin holds its role as a reliable digital store of value. With only 21 million coins ever to be created and more big institutions holding BTC, its position stays strong. The growing use of the Lightning Network and expanding use in daily life help Bitcoin reach beyond its original purpose. For people looking for a more stable crypto, BTC remains one of the best-performing cryptos in 2025. Wrapping Up— 2025’s Best Performing Cryptos! Bitcoin and Cardano still act as key parts of the blockchain space, while Solana and XRP push new tech forward. But BlockDAG is being seen as the future leader among the best-performing cryptos. With a goal to support 1,000+ decentralized apps, tools made for easier creation, and a functioning mining system already out, BlockDAG isn’t waiting for the future—it’s already setting it up. For anyone looking to join early, BDAG is among the best-performing cryptos to keep an eye on now.

The token peaked at $0.7940 on Saturday, up sharply from the year-to-date low of $0.4023. Still, it remains sharply lower than the all-time high of near $3. Why Pi Network price crashed There are a few reasons why the Pi Network price plunged after its highly anticipated mainnet launch in February. First, the crash mirrored that of other recently launched tokens. For example, a token like Grass, jumped initially and then retreated and has never recovered. The same is true with other tokens like Wormhole, Hamster Kombat, and ZkSync. Second, the Pi Network mainnet launch coincided with a difficult period in the market when most tokens were crashing. Bitcoin has remained below $90,000, down sharply from the all-time high of $109,200. Other tokens like Berachain, Polkadot, and Solana have done worse. Third, the Pi Network price crashed as investors reacted to its relatively weak ecosystem. The idea behind Pi was that it would have a highly vibrant ecosystem of applications that will promote commerce, gaming, and other areas. Applications in the network have not done well since then. A good example of this is the recently launched Pi domains, which the developers are auctioning. Pi holders have placed 110,840 bids currently worth $1.84 million. While this is a good number, it means that only a tiny number of pioneers have placed their bid. Pi had over 10 million pioneers during its mainnet launch. Read more: Pi Network price prediction: is it safe to buy the Pi coin dip? Exchange listings, pioneer sales, and dilution There are other reasons why the Pi Network price has imploded. For one, many mainstream exchanges have refused to list it, with some, like Bybit, arguing that it was a scam. Pi’s developers have rejected these claims, and pointed to the network’s transparency. A Pi Network exchange listing by companies like Binance, Coinbase, and Upbit would help to push its price much higher than it is today. Further, there are substantial concerns about its dilution, which are caused by its token unlocks. Over 1.55 billion Pi tokens are expected to be unlocked in the next 12 months, with more billions set for the following years. Pi can allay these fears by simply burning most of its tokens. That’s because the Pi Foundation currently holds over 73 billion tokens with a diluted value of $47 billion, meaning that it can afford to buy some of them. Finally, the Pi Network token crashed as many pioneers who were mining the token for years sold their allocations after the mainnet launch. Pi Network price technical analysis PI token price chart | Source: TradingView The Pi coin price will likely have a sustained recovery in the next few days. That’s because its recent crash happened as it was forming a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. The two-hour chart above shows that the token formed two descending and converging trendlines. Its rebound happened when the two lines neared their confluence levels. Pi coin also formed a bullish divergence pattern, which happens when an asset is dropping as some of its top oscillators rise. Therefore, the token will likely keep rising as bulls target the important psychological point at $1. Such a move would point to a 72% increase from the current level. A drop below last week’s low of $0.4142 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

At the center of attention are Bitcoin, ADA, XRP, and MAGACOINFINANCE, all commanding growing commitment from holders who see 2025 as the year for breakout momentum. Powerhouses like ETH, LINK, and BCH remain crucial to the ecosystem, continuing to power applications and support long-term growth strategies.

With only a 100 billion token supply, no private allocations, and a fully public rollout, the token has stood out in 2025 for its commitment to fairness and transparency. What’s making it even more attractive is timing. Early investors are already seeing returns from pre-listing stages, and wallet activity has grown significantly across key platforms. Its simple distribution model and steady rise in visibility have drawn comparisons to early-phase tokens that went on to become household names in crypto. For many, this is more than a token—it’s one of the few remaining fair-market entries where smaller allocations still carry strong potential.

Chainlink (LINK) continues powering blockchain interoperability with reliable off-chain data feeds. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) maintains its focus on efficient, peer-to-peer digital payments and real-world transaction speed.

Bitcoin (BTC) price held the $83K level with no major gains in the past seven days. Whereas, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP prices mimicked a sluggish action. Notably, the latest announcement by Donald Trump about reciprocal tariffs has rattled global markets, with even risk assets encountering some macro heat. Mentioned below are some of the top market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Crypto Market Faces Macroeconomic Pressure This week saw a couple of concerning macro developments that sparked a cautious sentiment among traders and investors. CoinGape reported that the manufacturing PMI and JOLTS data came in weaker than expected this week. The March PMI data dropped to 49, below expectations of 49.5 and lower than the 50 recorded in February. Also, the U.S. JOLTS job openings for February stood at 7.568 million, coming short of the expected 7.690 million and lower than the 7.762 million recorded in January. This macro data pointed toward a bearish outlook for the broader market. In turn, even the crypto market saw a stalled movement, with Bitcoin & Ether prices negating any major gains over the past seven days. In addition, Donald Trump’s Liberation Day , which is the tagline for his proposed reciprocal tariffs on other countries, has added to the pressure on broader markets. Bitcoin, Ether, & Other Coin Prices Over The Week BTC price witnessed a marginal 0.5% jump in the past seven days and closed in at the $83K level. In the past 7 days, the flagship crypto stooped as low as $81K whilst also touching a $87K high. ETH price saw a drop of nearly 2% weekly and exchanged hands at the $1,800 level. Ethereum hit a bottom of $1,700 whilst also nearing a high of $2,000 this week SOL price fell by roughly 5% over the week to reach $120. The crypto’s weekly high and low was $135 and $112, respectively. XRP price mimicked the broader crypto market trend, dipping over 2% in seven days to $2.13. Ripple’s coin is consolidating despite speculations of an imminent settlement of the lawsuit against the U.S. SEC.

""One would have to imagine that President Donald Trump's phone has been ringing off the hook. The practical reality is that there is insufficient time for him to make deals before the tariffs are scheduled to take effect,"" Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, said in an April 5 X post. Trump may postpone tariffs to make more deals, says Ackman ""I would, therefore, not be surprised to wake up Monday with an announcement from the President that he was postponing the implementation of the tariffs to give him time to make deals,"" Ackman added. On April 2, Trump signed an executive order establishing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from all countries, which took effect on April 5. Harsher reciprocal tariffs on trading partners with which the US has the largest trade deficits are scheduled to kick in on April 9. Ackman — who famously said ""crypto is here to stay"" after the FTX collapse in November 2022 — said Trump captured the attention of the world and US trading partners, backing the tariffs as necessary after what he called an ""unfair tariff regime"" that hurt US workers and economy ""over many decades."" Following Trump’s announcement on April 2, the US stock market shed more value during the April 4 trading session than the entire crypto market is currently worth. The fact that crypto held up better than the US stock market caught the attention of both crypto industry supporters and skeptics. Source: Cameron Winklevoss Prominent crypto voices such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss also recently showed their support for Trump's tariffs. Related: Trump tariffs squeeze already struggling Bitcoin miners — Braiins exec Ackman said a pause would be a logical move by Trump — not just to allow time for closing potential deals but also to give companies of all sizes ""time to prepare for changes."" He added: ""The risk of not doing so is that the massive increase in uncertainty drives the economy into a recession, potentially a severe one."" Ackman said April 7 will be ""one of the more interesting days"" in US economic history.

42977583,https://invezz.com/?p=2656016,1743918300,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"You missed Solana (SOL) at $2, don’t miss Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.025",https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/06/you-missed-solana-sol-at-2-dont-miss-mutuum-finance-mutm-at-0-025/,"Everyone in crypto has a story about the one that got away. For many, Solana (SOL) is at the top of that list. The token traded at just $2 in its early days before exploding in value and earning a place among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap. Those who bought in early didn’t just make profits—they changed their financial future. Fast forward to 2025, and another token is quietly setting the stage for what some believe could be the next big move. That token is MUTM, the native asset of Mutuum Finance, and it’s currently priced at just $0.025. Back when Solana was trading at $2, it was still a relatively unknown name in a crowded market. It offered faster transaction speeds and lower fees than Ethereum, and early investors saw the potential in its tech long before it gained mainstream recognition. What followed was a massive surge that took SOL from $2 to well over $200 at its peak—proving that early exposure to the right project can be life-changing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Now, Mutuum Finance is presenting a similar early-stage opportunity, but with a different focus. Rather than building another blockchain layer, Mutuum is designing a decentralized ecosystem for borrowing and lending crypto. What sets it apart is how it structures participation. The protocol allows users to deposit assets and earn yield, or to lock up assets as collateral to access liquidity—without needing to sell their holdings. The process is handled through smart contracts, which are transparent and fully on-chain. When users deposit funds, they receive mtTokens, which reflect their share of the liquidity plus the interest it earns over time. These tokens grow in value the longer they’re held, allowing users to benefit from passive income without needing to constantly manage their positions. It’s a clean, efficient system that gives users full control while removing the need for intermediaries. Another important component is Mutuum’s overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this one is backed entirely by crypto assets held within the protocol. It’s minted when users lock up collateral and burned when loans are repaid. This approach keeps supply balanced and ensures the stablecoin remains rooted in on-chain activity. It also contributes to Mutuum’s revenue, as interest paid on these stablecoin loans flows directly into the protocol rather than to third-party liquidity pools. So why is there growing interest in MUTM right now? The answer lies in the presale. MUTM is currently being offered at $0.025, with over $6 million raised and a rapidly growing holder base that has already surpassed 7,750 wallets. The token will launch at $0.06, meaning early buyers are already in line for more than 2x gains before trading even begins. But for many, it’s not just about launch day—it’s about what happens after. Analysts watching the project are pointing to its utility-driven design, sustainable reward structure, and low starting market cap as key reasons why the price could climb significantly post-launch. Based on early interest and the strength of its economic model, many believe that MUTM is well-positioned to follow a growth trajectory similar to Solana’s early surge—especially as adoption increases and on-chain activity expands across the protocol. The key takeaway? Solana’s $2 days are gone. But right now, MUTM is sitting in that early phase where the fundamentals are in place, the price is still low, and the wider market hasn’t fully caught on yet. For those who missed out on SOL and are searching for the next high-upside opportunity in crypto, this might be the moment to pay closer attention.

Despite fluctuations, the overarching bearish sentiment continues. Short-Term Bullish Bounce? According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, here’s a short-term bullish divergence showing up. This has led to a bit of a relief rally, which is pretty common when this kind of divergence pops up. It’s happened before over the last few months, so it’s nothing new. What’s Likely to Happen Next? Considering the current support levels and the new bullish divergence, XRP is probably going to see a small bounce or some sideways price action in the coming days—maybe for about a week. It’s the same kind of movement that’s been seen before when similar patterns appeared. Will the U.S. Stock Market Influence XRP? A lot of eyes are on the U.S. stock market, especially with Monday’s opening. If the markets keep dropping, that could spill over into crypto, putting some bearish pressure on XRP. But if the stock market finds a bottom and bounces back, it could give XRP a little more breathing room for that short-term relief. Resistance Levels to Watch In the near term, XRP’s facing some tough resistance between $2.24 and $2.30—exactly where it’s been rejected before. If it manages to break above $230, the next hurdles are at $2.48, $2.56, and then between $2.65 and $2.80. The Day Ahead For the next day or so, the expectation is for XRP to keep that relief going or move sideways.

Despite this short-term recovery, the token has suffered a heavy loss—down 70% since its peak of $2.98 in February, with a sharp 17% drop just over the past week. At the time of writing, Pi coin is trading at $0.64. Why the Sharp Decline? Analysts point to the continuous unlocking of PI tokens as a key factor behind the steep decline. This process increases the token’s supply, while demand has struggled to keep pace, putting downward pressure on its price. Key Resistance Levels to Watch Looking ahead, if Pi can break through resistance levels at $0.80 and $0.90, it could potentially rally past the $1 mark. However, this optimistic scenario comes with caveats. Ongoing token unlocks and the absence of major exchange listings could continue to exert selling pressure. Is This a Real Recovery or a “Dead Cat Bounce”? While the recent price surge might signal a resurgence of investor interest, caution is advised. Some experts warn it could be a “dead cat bounce”—a temporary recovery after a steep decline, often followed by further losses. Speculators might be jumping in to secure quick profits, but history shows that such recoveries can be short-lived. A New Perspective from the Community One user shared a thoughtful take , suggesting that the Pi Network’s price drop, while painful, was a necessary reset. “After an overhyped mainnet launch, the coin surged on speculation, not utility,” the user explained. “The crash flushed out weak hands and forced a reality check—value can’t rely on mining gimmicks or KYC delays alone. It’s a chance for Pi to refocus on building real-world use cases and a sustainable ecosystem.”",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-06 06:08:47

While FOMO Rises, Ruvi AI (RUVI) Offers Next-Level Opportunities to Early Investors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE) has the crypto world buzzing yet again, with analysts predicting a potential 270% price surge in the coming weeks. Elon Musk, Dogecoin’s biggest supporter, remains a key figure propelling the coin’s narrative. However, while traders speculate over DOGE’s next move, a more dynamic, tech-forward project is quietly taking the stage. Meet RUVI . Why Dogecoin’s Forecast is Stirring FOMO Dogecoin’s history as the original “meme coin” has solidified its place in the crypto market. Whether through Elon Musk’s tweets or bullish market waves, DOGE continues to capture attention. Recent predictions suggest the coin could break resistance at $0.21 and climb to $0.65 by late April. This potential rally is invigorating retail and institutional interest alike. Nevertheless, Dogecoin’s volatility and utility limitations leave many investors wondering if there’s a better way to maximize returns in the blockchain space. This is where RUVI steps in with an ecosystem designed for creativity, rewards, and endless growth opportunities. What Sets RUVI Apart RUVI flips the script on traditional cryptocurrency projects by incorporating advanced AI tools integrated with blockchain technology . This groundbreaking ecosystem empowers users to create text, images, audio, and even video content , while earning rewards along the way. RUVI’s platform isn’t just a passive investment; it puts its users at the core of its growth, thanks to user-driven AI training models that continuously evolve to meet the needs of its community. And here’s what truly sets RUVI apart from projects like Dogecoin—its robust tokenized rewards system and VIP bonus structure , which are tailored to incentivize both casual users and dedicated investors. The Benefits of RUVI’s VIP Tier Rewards Unlike Dogecoin, which lacks structured reward systems, RUVI introduces a tiered VIP program for its token presale. Take the VIP 4 tier , for example. With an investment of $2,000 at the current token price of $0.01 , you secure 200,000 RUVI tokens . The VIP 4 tier bonus , a generous 80% , adds an extra 160,000 tokens , bringing your total holdings to 360,000 . At RUVI’s upcoming listing price of $0.07 per token , that $2,000 turns into $25,200 in value. And if analysts’ predictions that RUVI could soar to a token price of $0.50 post-launch come true, your $2,000 could transform into an astonishing $180,000 . This structured and rewarding system provides more immediate value compared to Dogecoin, where gains are largely speculative and dependent on market momentum. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Performers RUVI goes a step further with its Leaderboard Rewards system , offering even greater incentives for its most engaged community members. The top 1,000 token holders are ranked by total holdings and awarded fixed bonuses, with the Top 100 receiving an additional 100,000 RUVI tokens . Stacking this leaderboard reward on top of the VIP bonus, not only maximizes the holdings, but also ensures prime positioning as RUVI’s ecosystem grows and attracts more users. For serious investors, this represents an unparalleled opportunity to secure a leadership position in one of the most innovative blockchain platforms on the market. RUVI vs. Dogecoin Dogecoin’s appeal lies in its simplicity and its meme-inspired ecosystem. However, as the crypto market matures, the focus has shifted toward tangible value and utility. RUVI brilliantly bridges this gap by offering a functionality-driven platform fueled by AI tools and tokenized rewards. While Dogecoin is reliant on price surges driven by sentiment and hype, RUVI provides a structured framework for growth, creativity, and active participation. With RUVI, you’re not just betting on a coin; you’re investing in a platform that serves creators and innovators alike. The Bottom Line Dogecoin’s potential surge to $0.65 has undoubtedly captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts, but RUVI offers something far more compelling. Combining powerful technology with community-first rewards, RUVI is positioning itself as the ideal complement to meme coins like DOGE. For investors eager to catch the next big thing in crypto, the time to act is now. Don’t wait for the market to catch up. Join RUVI today and prepare for a future powered by blockchain innovation and AI-driven creativity.
