In a development that suggests something significant may be underway, four identical transfers of XRP—each comprising 66,964,285 XRP—have been executed in rapid succession, totaling 267,857,140 XRP, worth approximately $572 million at current market rates. The insight was shared by prominent crypto watcher Amelie on X, who noted the matching size and timing of the transactions, adding, “Something’s brewing.” BREAKING: #XRP WHALES ARE ACTIVE: 4x THE SAME AMOUNT OF XRP WAS TRANSFERRED, 267,857,140 XRP WORTH $572,238,240 IN TOTAL! SOMETHING‘S BREWING pic.twitter.com/RbsEg1ct7O — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) April 4, 2025 Whale Movements and Market Implications Whale transactions —typically defined as large movements of cryptocurrency by individuals or entities holding vast amounts—are often interpreted as early signals of market shifts. Whether it’s preparation for institutional redistribution, strategic exchange positioning, or internal liquidity movements, the symmetry and scale of these XRP transfers are hard to ignore. The fact that all four transfers carried precisely the same amount of XRP points to calculated intent rather than random movement. This kind of coordination suggests a sophisticated strategy behind the scenes, possibly linked to upcoming developments in the broader Ripple ecosystem or macro market shifts surrounding XRP. XRP’s Price Action and Market Sentiment Amid this surge in whale activity, XRP continues to demonstrate strong price behavior, with Rowen Exchange highlighting that the digital asset has repeatedly rebounded after testing the $2.00 level. The repeated support at this key price threshold is leading many to speculate that $2.00 has effectively become XRP’s new floor—an idea backed by increasing trading volume and institutional interest. The timing of these whale transfers—occurring just as XRP flirts with this key support level—raises the possibility that large players are positioning themselves in anticipation of a significant breakout or strategic announcement. It’s not uncommon for such transactions to precede major market moves, either upward or downward, depending on the intent of the stakeholders involved. Speculation Over What’s Brewing While the source or purpose of the transfers remains unknown, the crypto community is alive with speculation. Some analysts believe this activity may be related to internal liquidity reshuffling by Ripple-affiliated institutions, while others suggest that a possible resolution to the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case could be driving high-stakes maneuvering. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adding to the intrigue is the broader regulatory and institutional context. Ripple’s recent strides—such as its expansion into stablecoin offerings and continued enterprise partnerships—have positioned XRP as a core asset with growing utility in real-world finance. Against this backdrop, large transfers could also reflect onboarding activities for new corridors or enterprise users. The activity of XRP whales is often a precursor to heightened volatility or significant price moves, and this latest sequence of identical, high-volume transactions is no exception. With a total of 267,857,140 XRP shuffled deliberately, and XRP consistently finding footing at $2.00, both technical and on-chain data suggest that the digital asset is entering a critical phase. Whether this is the calm before a bullish storm or a strategic recalibration ahead of regulatory milestones remains to be seen. But one thing is clear— whales are moving , and the market is watching closely. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Qubetics Presale Gains Traction While Polkadot and Render Power the Web3 Stack,https://thecoinrise.com/top-cryptos-to-hold-for-short-term-qubetics-presale-gains-traction-while-polkadot-and-render-power-the-web3-stack/,"Crypto opportunities come in waves. Some are lightning-quick and speculative. Others, well-planned and packed with technical firepower. For early adopters and seasoned participants alike, timing isn’t everything—but it sure counts for a lot. That’s why short-term holds with high-upside utility are gaining ground, especially across Latin America where flexibility and access matter. Scanning for the top cryptos to hold for short term means more than just chasing trending coins. It’s about spotting projects with traction, relevance, and tools that solve real-world problems. Right now, Qubetics (TICS) is one of the sharpest names in that category. With Polkadot and Render also staying competitive, this trio forms a compelling snapshot of what short-term strength can look like in 2025. Qubetics (TICS): Pioneering Real-World Tokenization Qubetics is earning its position as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term , but it’s not doing it through hype. It’s doing it by launching real-world tools—starting with its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace , designed to bring physical and financial assets into the blockchain ecosystem. Here’s where it clicks. Businesses in Peru or freelancers in Brazil can tokenize property, contracts, or unpaid invoices, then trade or fractionalize them on-chain. Instead of waiting weeks for settlements or dealing with third-party red tape, they gain liquidity and access in real-time. For professionals juggling local and cross-border work, this tool changes the game. Not theoretical. Fully functional. Another major feature solidifying Qubetics as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term is TICSScan . This blockchain explorer lets users monitor the full stack—from validator performance and block data to smart contract tracking and transaction analytics. It brings a transparency-first design that’s critical for any community-driven network. Whether you’re a developer deploying contracts or a backer following token flow, TICSScan puts everything within reach. Presale Performance and Analysts’ Predictions for $TICS What truly sets Qubetics apart is how it bundles utility and opportunity. The crypto presale is in Stage 28 , with over 506 million $TICS tokens sold to 24,300+ holders , raising $15.8 million . At a current price of $0.1430 , it’s drawing major buzz. This isn’t just another early-stage token. It’s a tech-forward asset in an accessible price window. Analysts are eyeing multiple price outcomes. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that’s a 599% ROI . At $5, it jumps to 3396% ROI . Further estimates range up to $6 ( 4095% ), $10 ( 6892% ), and a massive $15 after mainnet launch, translating to a 10,388% ROI . For short-term buyers who want both vision and real entry points, Qubetics makes a hard-to-ignore case. Polkadot (DOT): Cross-Chain Interoperability at Web3 Scale Polkadot has proven it’s not just another Layer 1—it’s the backbone of a multi-chain future. Designed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot enables cross-chain data and asset transfers through its relay chain and parachain system. That makes it one of the most technically advanced blockchains in the space. For the short term, what gives Polkadot strong potential is its parachain auction mechanism and growing ecosystem of specialized chains. Projects can build tailor-made blockchains that plug into the Polkadot relay chain, gaining security and interoperability from day one. With dozens of active parachains already running DeFi, identity, gaming, and real-world asset use cases, the network is maturing fast. From a token perspective, DOT is critical for governance, bonding parachains, and staking. It sees constant usage across governance votes and crowdloans, providing utility beyond speculative trading. Polkadot also benefits from major integrations and updates like asynchronous backing and XCM (cross-consensus messaging), which are set to improve performance and composability. For short-term holders looking for infrastructure-level tokens with proven ecosystems, Polkadot stands out. Its steady growth, large developer community, and multichain vision continue to position it as a leader—especially as cross-chain apps begin dominating in 2025. Render (RNDR): GPU Power for the Decentralized AI Era Render is where high-performance graphics meet blockchain. Originally created to decentralize GPU rendering for artists, Render has now evolved into a core piece of the AI + blockchain fusion stack . It allows developers, researchers, and content creators to access GPU resources on-demand through a decentralized marketplace, powered by the RNDR token. As AI workloads increase and demand for GPU compute skyrockets, Render is riding a second wave of adoption. Its integration with OctaneRender, support for Hollywood-level VFX workflows, and now machine learning processing make RNDR one of the most in-demand utility tokens in the short term. Render doesn’t just appeal to creatives—it’s being actively adopted by AI startups, DePIN projects, and decentralized cloud networks that need scalable GPU rendering at a fraction of centralized costs. The protocol incentivizes node operators to contribute idle GPUs, creating an open compute layer without reliance on Nvidia resellers or data center bottlenecks. What makes RNDR a solid short-term hold is its dual exposure to both Web3 infrastructure and AI growth. It’s rare for a token to sit at the intersection of two explosive markets—and Render pulls it off with tech already in production. With demand forecasted to grow throughout 2025, Render’s short-term potential feels like it’s just warming up. Final Thoughts Not every project that promises gains actually delivers. But when it comes to real-world function, strong backing, and usability, Qubetics, Polkadot, and Render each offer different flavors of value. Polkadot delivers scalable cross-chain infrastructure. Render unlocks decentralized GPU compute. And Qubetics? It’s bringing asset tokenization to the street-level with tools that anyone can use. Still, only Qubetics currently offers a live presale and a price point that leaves room for massive upside. It’s not just about the numbers. It’s about access—and Qubetics is making that part easy for now. For those on the hunt for the top cryptos to hold for short term , this is the moment to move before windows close and prices rise. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1: Why is Qubetics one of the top cryptos to hold for short term? Qubetics combines a real-world asset tokenization marketplace, detailed blockchain explorer (TICSScan), and a live presale priced at $0.1430. With over 506 million tokens sold and $15.8M raised, it offers both utility and entry. 2: What makes Polkadot suitable for short-term holding? Polkadot supports a thriving multi-chain ecosystem and lets developers launch scalable parachains for DeFi, gaming, and real-world assets.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-battles-major-resistance-heres-the-implication/,"Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal moment in its market journey, now confronting a critical resistance cluster that could define its near-term trajectory. According to crypto market analyst Ali, BTC is grappling with the $87,000 level—a zone where three significant technical barriers converge: the 50-day moving average (MA), the 200-day MA, and a descending trendline originating from its all-time high. This confluence of resistance levels marks a crucial battleground for Bitcoin bulls and bears alike. Historically, when such technical indicators overlap, the resulting price action tends to be highly volatile and often decisive in determining whether a breakout or breakdown will occur. #Bitcoin $BTC is up against a major resistance cluster at $87,000, where the 50-day MA, 200-day MA, and the descending trendline from the all-time high all converge. pic.twitter.com/llxPXsfQDY — Ali (@ali_charts) April 5, 2025 Triple Resistance Threatens BTC Momentum The $87,000 mark is not just another psychological barrier—it is now loaded with technical weight. The 50-day MA typically serves as a short- to mid-term trend indicator, while the 200-day MA signals longer-term momentum and investor sentiment. When both converge at the same level, it usually highlights a zone of heightened resistance or support, depending on the direction of the price approach. Adding to the complexity is the presence of a descending trendline drawn from Bitcoin’s previous all-time high. This trendline has repeatedly served as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s rallies in recent months. A confluence of this trendline with the 50- and 200-day MAs creates what traders often call a “technical choke point”—a level where strong conviction is needed for the price to break through. Ali, known for his precision in technical market analysis, emphasized in his post on X that this specific confluence makes $87,000 a “ major resistance cluster ” that Bitcoin must decisively clear to unlock further upside potential. Contextualizing BTC in the Broader Crypto Market This development in Bitcoin’s chart comes at a time when the broader crypto market is exhibiting signs of divergence between digital assets and traditional equities. As Rowen Exchange recently pointed out, assets like XRP have been holding strong at their key support levels—particularly around the $2.00 mark—demonstrating resilience even as macroeconomic concerns weigh on U.S. stocks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin’s confrontation with its resistance cluster adds another layer of complexity to this dynamic. A decisive breakout above $87,000 could act as a bullish signal not just for BTC, but for altcoins like XRP that are already poised for upward moves. On the other hand, failure to breach this zone might invite another period of consolidation or even a deeper correction. What Comes Next? Market participants are now watching closely to see how Bitcoin handles the pressure. A clean break and sustained close above $87,000 would likely trigger renewed bullish momentum, potentially pushing BTC toward new highs in the coming months. However, if resistance holds firm, Bitcoin may retreat to test lower support zones, potentially dragging sentiment across the broader market with it. As traders analyze the technical landscape, attention remains fixed on volume, RSI divergence, and other market signals to anticipate whether the bulls have the strength to overcome this pivotal wall. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s encounter with the $87,000 resistance cluster is more than just a chart pattern—it’s a critical test of market conviction and trend direction. With key indicators now overlapping at this juncture, the next few days could be instrumental in shaping the next chapter of Bitcoin’s journey.

It is now leveraging a tactic known as “ClickFix” to target job seekers in the cryptocurrency sector, particularly within centralized finance (CeFi). This approach marks an adaptation of the group’s earlier “Contagious Interview” campaign, which was previously aimed at developers and engineers in artificial intelligence and crypto-related roles. Lazarus Exploits Crypto Hiring In the newly observed campaign , Lazarus has shifted its focus to non-technical professionals, such as marketing and business development personnel, by impersonating major crypto firms like Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and even stablecoin issuer Tether. The attackers build fraudulent websites mimicking job application portals and lure candidates with fake interview invitations. These sites often include realistic application forms and even requests for video introductions, fostering a sense of legitimacy. However, when a user attempts to record a video, they are shown a fabricated error message, which typically suggests a webcam or driver malfunction. The page then prompts the user to run PowerShell commands under the guise of troubleshooting, thereby triggering the malware download. This ClickFix method, though relatively new, is becoming more prevalent due to its psychological simplicity – since users believe they are resolving a technical issue, and not executing malicious code. According to Sekoia, the campaign draws on materials from 184 fake interview invitations, referencing at least 14 prominent companies to bolster credibility. As such, the latest tactic demonstrates Lazarus’s growing sophistication in social engineering and its ability to exploit the professional aspirations of individuals in the competitive crypto job market. Interestingly, this shift also suggests that the group is expanding its targeting criteria by aiming not just at those with access to code or infrastructure but also at those who might handle sensitive internal data or be in a position to facilitate breaches inadvertently. Despite the emergence of ClickFix, Sekoia reported that the original Contagious Interview campaign remains active. This parallel deployment of strategies suggests that North Korea’s state-sponsored collective may be testing their relative effectiveness or tailoring tactics to different target demographics. In both cases, the campaigns share a consistent goal – delivering info-stealing malware through trusted channels and manipulating victims into self-infection. Lazarus Behind Bybit Hack The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officially attributed the $1.5 billion attack on Bybit to the Lazarus Group. Hackers targeting the crypto exchange employed fake job offers to trick staff into installing tainted trading software known as “TraderTraitor.” Although crafted to look authentic through cross-platform JavaScript and Node.js development, the applications embedded malware designed to steal private keys and execute illicit transactions on the blockchain.

However, this minor uptick only follows the largely negative performance earlier seen in the week. Notably, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez postulates the ninth-largest cryptocurrency could still experience steeper market losses if certain technical support fails to hold. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Marks 1 Billion Transactions Milestone, But Why Is SHIB Price Still Struggling? Cardano Critical Support Break Could Lead To 36% Decline In a recent post on X, Martinez shares a cautionary insight on the current ADA market structure hinting at a potential price fall. Based on the Fibonacci retracement levels, Martinez’s analysis indicates that Cardano still trades near a vital support zone despite recent gains. The Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines commonly used to identify potential support and resistance zones. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence and are widely used in anticipating a price fall, gain, consolidation, or reversal. Looking at the chart below, ADA currently trades at $0.66 which is just above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.63 – a price zone that has acted as a resilient support level in recent weeks. Ali Martinez warns a daily close below $0.63 would signal a bearish shift in market control at this level paving the way for a further decline. In this case, Cardano could fall to test the next significant support at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level around $0.53. If the selling pressure prevails at this zone, ADA prices could potentially slide to $0.42 representing the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level.

Cardano has struggled to maintain a prolonged bullish form after reaching a local peak of $1.30 in early December 2024. Since then, ADA prices have been in a corrective phase alongside the broader crypto market. For ADA bulls, defending the $0.63 price level is crucial to sustaining any valid bullish outlook. However, a successful price reclaim of the $0.78-$0.80 price zone would signal an impending price rally and market rebound for the altcoin. At the time of writing, Cardano trades at $0.66 as earlier stated. Amid recent gains, ADA is down by 5.00% on its weekly chart and 33.58% on its monthly chart reflecting a domineering bearish influence in recent weeks. Meanwhile, daily trading volume has gained by 19.56% in the past 24 hours indicating a rise in market interest. This development suggests the recent price rally might be sustainable due to a strong conviction among buyers.

For the first time, certain stablecoins, now called covered stablecoins, might not be treated as securities. This change could give companies like Tether’s USTD and USDC more freedom, but it also means they must follow strict rules. What Are Covered Stablecoin Assets? According to the SEC, covered stablecoins are not meant to be investments. Instead, they must be stable, fast, and reliable ways to send or store money. They should not promise any profits, voting rights, or ownership. To be a covered stablecoin, the token must be fully backed 1:1 by the U.S. dollar, supported by low-risk, accessible assets, and always be able to be redeemed at full value. This makes covered stablecoins different from investment products, which aim to make people money. The SEC says these stablecoins will not be treated as securities under U.S. law because they are sold as “digital dollars,” not investments. David Sacks, a key White House crypto advisor, supports the change. He said it would ease rules for dollar-backed stablecoins backed by low-risk assets. Tether’s Response to the New Guidelines Tether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin , is already considering adjusting to the SEC’s new rules. Various assets, including cash, U.S. Treasuries, Bitcoin, and gold back USDT. However, the SEC’s new rules require stablecoins to be backed only by cash or safe assets. This means USDT might not qualify as a covered stablecoin. Tether is considering launching a new stablecoin that would only be backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries. This new coin would be designed to meet all the SEC’s rules. Meanwhile, USDT would likely continue to be used in markets with less stringent regulatory policies . While many welcome the new rules, not everyone in the SEC agrees. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has expressed concern that the new guidelines may oversimplify how stablecoins work. She believes the risks of these tokens are being ignored, and the new rules might confuse people about how stablecoins function. The Growing Role of Stablecoins Despite some uncertainty, the stablecoin market is growing quickly. In the first quarter of 2025, the market added over $30 billion. This shows that the demand for stablecoins is strong, even though the crypto market faces challenges. The SEC’s clarifying the rules around stablecoins could help these digital currencies become more trusted and widely used. It could also lead to more companies creating stablecoins that comply with U.S. regulations.

The company believes that this situation has historically been a precursor to major price movements and trend changes. “Bitcoin-altcoin correlation has fallen again, a sign that a major surge is approaching,” Alphractal said in his analysis, adding that historical data has shown that declines in altcoin-Bitcoin correlation often coincide with local peaks, strong bullish reactions, or periods of increased volatility. Related News: Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin Holders Should Love Tariffs, Explains Why According to the analytics firm, whales have once again started shorting Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many altcoins compared to retail investors. This trend is observed in the ratio known as the “Whale vs. Retail Investor Ratio.” Alphractal recalled that this ratio has previously increased before significant market fluctuations. On the other hand, according to the “Supply Age Bands” data, which classifies Bitcoin supply according to its age, Short-Term Investor Supply (Short-Term Holders – STH), which represents BTCs purchased in the last 3 months, is decreasing significantly. This indicates that investors' interest in accumulating and purchasing Bitcoin has decreased.

Kalshi uses the standard criteria of a recession, two business quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth, as reported by the United States Department of Commerce. Odds of a US recession on the prediction platform have nearly doubled since March 20 and mirror the current 2025 US recession odds on Polymarket, which traders on the platform currently place at 60%. The macroeconomic outlook for 2025 deteriorated rapidly following US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff order and the ensuing sell-off in capital markets, sparking fears of a prolonged bear market.

Source: kalshi Related: Bitcoin bulls defend $80K support as ‘World War 3 of trade wars’ crushes US stocks Trump's executive order throws markets in disarray The US President's executive order established a 10% baseline tariff rate for all countries and different ""reciprocal"" tariff rates on trading partners with existing tariffs on US import goods. Trump's announcement triggered an immediate stock market sell-off , wiping away over $5 trillion in shareholder value in a matter of days. Fears of a recession continue to grow as market analysts warn of a potentially protracted trade war that negatively impacts global markets and suppresses risk asset prices, including cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, President Trump has expressed confidence that the tariffs will strengthen the US economy long-term and correct any trade imbalances. ""The markets are going to boom,"" the President said on April 3, describing the current market sell-off as an expected part of the process. The stock market sell-off continues as stocks shed trillions in shareholder value. Source: TradingView Asset manager Anthony Pompliano recently speculated that President Trump deliberately crashed markets to bring down interest rates. Pompliano cited the reduction in 10-year US Treasury bonds as evidence that the President's strategy of forcing a recession to impact rates is working. Interest rates on 10-year US Treasury bonds declined from approximately 4.66% in January 2025 to just 4.00% on April 5. President Trump is also pressuring Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell to lower short-term interest rates.

Based on Fibonacci retracement levels and trend indicators, the analysis suggests that the digital asset could be approaching a critical period where a strong breakout might occur. #XRP – Short-Term Analysis: 1⃣Closing above $2.24: First sign of strength (21 EMA) 2⃣Closing above $2.30: Second sign of strength (Fib 0.382) 3⃣Closing above $2.47: Third sign of strength (Fib 0.5) – a strong signal! 4⃣Closing above $2.70: Yellow trend line and above… pic.twitter.com/6oW9rZgp4h — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 4, 2025 Critical Resistance Levels The analysis identifies multiple price levels that could indicate increasing bullish momentum for XRP. The first sign of strength would be a daily close above $2.24, which aligns with the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Moving beyond this level would suggest that the cryptocurrency is gaining upward momentum. A second important level is $2.30, which corresponds to the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. This would confirm that buyers are stepping in and defending higher support zones. A close above $2.47 (the 0.5 Fibonacci level) would be a strong confirmation that the price trend is shifting toward a potential breakout. The Key Breakout Zone The most critical resistance level in EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis is $2.70, which is aligned with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. Notably, another prominent analyst recently drew attention to $2.70 as a crucial resistance . If the cryptocurrency can close above this level, it would indicate a break above a key trendline, significantly increasing the likelihood of a sustained rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A breakout above $2.70 would suggest that market sentiment is shifting bullish, potentially paving the way for XRP to target the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, which is positioned around $5.04. This would represent a substantial increase from the current price of $2.11 and a new all-time high for the digital asset. Technical Outlook EGRAG CRYPTO shows that XRP has been trading within a ranging box, consolidating between support and resistance levels. The equilibrium level, identified at $2.00, serves as a psychological support zone where price action has frequently stabilized. If XRP fails to hold above this level, it could risk further downside movement toward $1.63, the next major support. However, a head-and-shoulder pattern recently formed on the chart suggests it could fall further if a bearish trend begins. The 21 EMA will play a crucial role in determining short-term momentum. As long as XRP stays above this moving average, bullish momentum remains intact. The most significant bullish confirmation investors should look out for is a daily close above $2.70, as this would indicate a potential breakout to a new all-time high.

As SHIB benefits from a renewal in market optimism, driven by changing market dynamics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has entered the spotlight with a presale that has sped through its presale to raise $6.2 million and staking 7,800 holders. Currently at stage 4 for $0.025 and expected to increase 20% to $0.03 in phase 5, early purchasers can be assured of a 140% profit at the eventual listing price of up to $0.06. Post-launch, analysts anticipate a surge will push MUTM to $3.50, making it one of the highest potential contenders for the crypto market in 2025. A Change in Perception of Shiba Inu Triggers Empires Theory Based on Shiba Inu’s most recent metrics, long-term holders make up 76% of its v ownership, provided the leading imposition by Bitcoin (74% ownership long-term) and Ethereum (74% ownership long-term). That kind of loyalty reflects the growing conviction that SHIB is truly beyond its meme origins (though its use as a meme lives on). Daily burns — peaking at 12,000% this week — and a growing Shibarium network reinforce its deflationary approach. SHIB rebounded off the aforementioned trendline and seems on course to complete a falling wedge double-bottom pattern, a bull reversal setup according to technical charts. A jump above $0.00001570 is the main hurdle to a 165% upward push, while a fall under $0.00001080 opens up deeper falls. As speculative momentum builds, experts warn SHIB’s dependence on community hype makes it potentially more vulnerable to volatility than utility-driven projects. Mutuum Finance Presale Fires Up With its structured lending model and presale incentives, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps attracting investors. Phase 4 is still live at $0.025, with buyers already putting their sights on a 20% leap to $0.03 in phase 5. The project’s tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at launch, but predictions reach further still — with post-listing bullish targets of $3.50 offering life-changing returns for early investors. Whereas meme coins have no real utility, MUTM’s decentralized lending platform gives the ability to create collateralized loans, allows passive income through mtTokens, and includes a buy-back system which creates continuous demand. Market confidence is further reinforced by over $6.2 million raised, and with $100,000 worth of GIVEAWAY, new entrants are faced with a sense of urgency. The Mutuum Finance team operates under a Certik audit of their smart contracts which demonstrates their initiative to validate the platform for potential investors. Mutuum Finance will soon publish its results on its social channels to prove the reliability of the platform’s technology. MUTM stands apart from most meme tokens through its high degree of transparency which highlights its goal of enduring long term success. Future releases of an overcollateralized stablecoin together with dynamic interest rates will unite financial common sense with DeFi innovation in MUTM. Market timing the next big movement Shiba Inu’s short-term technical patterns highlight temporary upside potential, whereas Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers the calculated gateway to the next evolution of crypto. Given that phase 4 is flying out the door and price rises are locked into each presale phase, delays risk missing out on the $0.025 floor. Buyers can secure immediate paper profits and prepare for exponential gains as the MUTM ecosystem activates. With the Certik audit only nearing its end & exchange listings approach, the opportunity for maximum returns reduce exponentially. Wealth-building potential in cryptocurrency rarely comes with such clarity. A Key to Success In the world of decentralized finance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides both quick presale success and a roadmap for long-term dominance. For those looking to buy 2025’s breakout pop stars, joining the presale now could be the one that gets away. Head over to the Mutuum Finance site now to join before phase 4 ends and the prices increase.

SUI has gained traction since its March low, but broader skepticism still limits confidence. The SUI price prediction is inching upward but remains dependent on sustained buying and stronger signals from the overall market. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has seen renewed interest as volume spikes, though it remains boxed in by mixed funding and a neutral trend. Where these trends remain unclear, BlockDAG is building momentum with user participation. Keynote 3 confirmed that over 1.2 million users are already mining through the X1 App and TG Tap Miner. With $211.5 million raised in presale and BDAG priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, attention is shifting to BlockDAG as one of the top crypto coins for real usage ahead of mainnet. SUI Price Prediction Eyes $3 After 25% Climb SUI has gained 25% from its March low, currently trading around $2.49. The price chart shows an inverse head and shoulders formation, often interpreted as a bullish sign. If it holds, the next major test sits around $2.85 to $3.00. One reason for the optimism is the network”s Total Value Locked (TVL), which rose by 19.4% in just three weeks, climbing from $1.03 billion to $1.23 billion. That increase supports a positive SUI price prediction—but only if trading volumes continue to follow and larger market sentiment stays positive. Resistance from the 100- and 200-day EMAs could stall momentum. If buyers remain consistent, though, the $3 mark is reachable in the near term. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Recovers as Volume Rises The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price dipped to $0.0000122 recently but bounced back to trade near $0.00001267. That modest rebound follows a volume jump of 39.78%, now reaching $261 million. This could reflect growing interest, but whether it holds depends on several technical and sentiment-based metrics. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has returned to 50.45 after nearly falling into oversold territory, and the MACD recently crossed into a short-term bullish zone. Yet the broader SHIB trend remains neutral. Funding rates have shifted back and forth since February, suggesting that confidence among futures traders is still limited. For now, the SHIB price may consolidate in this range unless another large catalyst shifts the trend either way. BlockDAG Hits 1.2M Users on Mining Tools BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 added clarity on user growth and confirmed what many in the space had already noticed—mass adoption has started before the mainnet even goes live. The X1 Miner App alone has onboarded over 800,000 daily users, offering simple mining functionality directly from mobile devices. Add to that the TG Tap Miner, a Telegram-based play-to-earn tool with more than 400,000 sign-ups and over 100,000 active daily players. These tools make it easy for everyday users to mine BDAG tokens without technical knowledge. BlockDAG has raised $211.5 million during its presale, and over 19.1 billion BDAG coins have already been sold. With the current token price at $0.0248 in Batch 27, the price has already increased by 2,380% since the beginning. Analysts forecast BDAG could hit $20 by 2027, driven by real utility and adoption. These numbers paint a picture: early miners are building strong positions before the network fully launches. With more user-friendly tools planned and ongoing community events, the growth path seems set. BlockDAG’s structure and execution suggest it may become one of the best crypto coins for the future. Final Thoughts SUI has risen 25% since March and aims for $3 if its bullish pattern holds and TVL support continues. The SUI price prediction is cautiously optimistic but still needs volume confirmation. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has rebounded modestly with improved volume, though sentiment remains uncertain. While those two coins battle for trend confirmation, BlockDAG is gaining actual traction. With over 1.2 million miners, $211.5 million raised, and BDAG priced at $0.0248, early participation may offer the highest return potential. Its mix of real usage, steady growth, and expanding access could position it as one of the top crypto coins to watch this year and beyond.

The 4-hour Relative Strength Index dropped below 10, which typically suggests a possible technical bounce. However, opinions differ as some analysts view this as a sign of weakness rather than a rebound signal. Meanwhile, the PI coin price is currently hovering near $0.68 after facing yet another rejection at $0.76. The RSI stands at 39.97, indicating slow momentum with limited buyer interest. While traders monitor charts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is focusing on building long-term value. In its third keynote, the network provided updates that reflect a shift toward meaningful adoption. One major highlight was the explanation behind its partnerships with Inter Milan and UFC star Alex Pereira. Instead of surface-level promotions, these tie-ins serve as structured entry points for everyday users to connect with the platform. BlockDAG’s total presale has already reached $211.5 million, with expectations that its value could reach $30 by 2030. For those entering during Batch 27, currently priced at $0.0248, this translates to a projected return many are calling one of the most attractive in today’s crypto space. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Outlook: Oversold Territory but Uncertain Path The latest readings from technical charts show the Dogecoin (DOGE) price outlook resting in rare territory. The RSI dropping below 10 on the 4-hour timeframe indicates severe overselling. This could attract short-term buyers looking for a bounce, but long-term signals remain mixed. There is a 30% to 40% probability that DOGE may fall below the key $0.165 level. If that support fails, the next target could be $0.155. While some whale activity suggests accumulation, the broader market remains skeptical. Factors such as Elon Musk’s influence and speculation about integration with social media platforms continue to create unpredictable price swings. PI Coin Price: Sluggish Momentum as Resistance Holds The PI coin price is sitting at $0.70 after another failed attempt to break $0.76. This repeated rejection has left traders cautious. Technical indicators are not showing strong support for a turnaround. With an RSI of 39.97 and the MACD leaning bearish, momentum looks weak. If the current $0.68 level gives way, the next zone of interest could fall as low as $0.50. Although some previous setups have resulted in modest rebounds, the lack of volume this time raises questions about sustained recovery. BlockDAG Pushes Forward: $5M Added in 48 Hours, $30 Forecast by 2030 BlockDAG’s third keynote offered key updates that point to rapid growth and network preparation. The presale jumped by $5 million within two days of the announcement, bringing the total raised to $211.5 million. Over 19.1 billion BDAG tokens have been sold without institutional backers. A key announcement included the BlockDAG Academy—a three-tiered educational program aimed at bringing users from basic blockchain understanding to full-stack development using BlockDAG’s tools. This strategic focus on user knowledge and accessibility could help solidify its place among the best crypto for the future. Additionally, the platform’s Beta Testnet V1 is already live, and over 170,000 holders have started receiving 10,000 testnet BDAG through a structured vesting schedule. Engagement is growing through mobile apps like X1 Miner and TG Tap Miner, which now boast a combined 1.1 million users. With the coin priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, and a forecasted peak of $30 by 2030, BlockDAG is capturing the attention of those seeking substantial upside with real ecosystem backing. Final Take: Best Crypto for the Future? The Dogecoin (DOGE) price outlook remains complicated. Despite being technically oversold, risks still weigh heavily on short-term prospects. The PI coin price also faces a fragile setup, with bearish indicators and weak demand clouding recovery hopes. In contrast, BlockDAG is gaining traction through product rollout, mobile mining adoption, and targeted partnerships. With a forecast of $30 and a proven growth structure, BDAG stands out as a strong pick among top-performing altcoins. For those evaluating the best crypto for the future, BlockDAG offers more than just potential—it provides a roadmap backed by consistent delivery.

According to latest reports, these three cryptocurrencies are now leading the charts as the most trending coins in the market after the crash. Related Reading: XRP Breakout Alert! Could This Surge Send The Altcoin To $3? Santiment Unveils Top Trending Cryptos The crypto market took a significant hit after fears of new tariffs implemented by United States President Donald Trump rattled investors and sent digital assets plunging across the board. However, while US stock markets closed, signs of recovery began to emerge across specific cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano leading the post-crash chatter. According to an X (formerly Twitter) post by Santiment, a market intelligence platform, Solana is now back in the headlines as market analysts closely watch its price action following its crash. The popular meme coin is seeing an increased level of speculative predictions, market trends, and technical chart breakdowns. As a result, SOL is recapturing the attention of retail and institutional investors. There’s also been notable activity within the Solana network as anticipation for a price rebound or breakout keeps spreading. Ethereum is also trending in the crypto market, not just for its prolonged price slump and reaction to the crypto crash, but its ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 — a key upgrade focused on scalability and energy efficiency. Santiment notes that analysts are highlighting Ethereum’s network performance during the market stress, showcasing an increase in discussions about the cryptocurrency’s market analysis. There have also been increased price predictions, technical evaluations, and talks about the cryptocurrency’s scalability and adoption. Just like Solana and Ethereum, Cardano is seeing renewed attention as traders assess the cryptocurrency’s position in the broader market. There has been an influx of mentions surrounding Cardano’s market trends, with users speculating on its future price action and potential investments. Forecasts for the ADA price also range widely, with social media buzz and speculative posts fueling the cryptocurrency’s presence on trending charts. While not as widely discussed as ETH, SOL, and ADA, Binance Coin (BNB) has also been showing up in technical forecasts. Santiment reveals that analysts are tracking BNB’s trading ranges and potential price movements, making it a focal point for investors and traders. Related Reading: Solana Slammed By Whale Dump—Can It Recover Or Is More Pain Ahead? Stablecoins Join List Of Trending Assets In addition to the altcoins above, Santiment has disclosed that stablecoins have also joined the list of top trending assets. While Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano experienced major declines after the crypto crash, stablecoins, as their names imply, remained stable against the dollar. Ripple’s newly launched stablecoin RLUSD is trending due to its association with the crypto payments company, which gained significant attention following the completion of its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The stablecoin has been integrated into Ripple’s payment system, improving cross-border transactions and attracting institutional interest. There has also been a significant increase in adoption and trading volume, with crypto exchange Kraken reporting an 87% surge in the latter and a $10 billion growth in the former.

Community members know profits often come to those who spot solid projects early. Not every token’s worth jumping into, but there are a few making serious moves right now that could pay off fast. For Latin American backers hunting real opportunities, the focus is shifting toward projects blending utility with growth potential. Three names stand out—Qubetics ($TICS), VeChain (VET), and SUI. These projects aren’t stuck in hype cycles. They’re pushing forward with real-world applications and strong communities. Qubetics, especially, is stealing the spotlight with its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. This one’s raising eyebrows for anyone checking out the best cryptos to join for short term profits right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Best Crypto to Join for Short Term Profits with Real World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics isn’t here playing games. This project is rolling out a Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace, changing the way businesses, professionals, and individuals manage assets. Imagine turning real estate, cars, or even art into tradable digital tokens. That’s what Qubetics delivers—and it’s already turning heads among community members scanning the best cryptos to join for short term profits. Think of a real estate developer in Buenos Aires needing faster liquidity. Instead of waiting months for sales to close, they tokenize properties, sell portions globally, and get funded in days. Or a professional artist in Medellín turning physical artwork into tokens, giving collectors worldwide a chance to buy a stake. That’s where Qubetics stands tall—offering simple, secure, and fully decentralized asset tokenization. The platform doesn’t stop at tokenization. It throws in QubeQode IDE, AI-driven tools, and a Decentralized VPN. For community members chasing the best cryptos to join for short term profits, Qubetics checks every box—utility, accessibility, and serious growth potential. Qubetics Presale Milestones and Analysts’ Predictions Right now, Qubetics is smashing presale milestones in its 28th stage. Over 506 million $TICS tokens are sold, pulling in more than 24,300 token holders and raking up $15.8 million. At just $0.1430 per token, early buyers know the upside is massive. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $1 after the crypto presale for a 599% ROI. Others push forecasts to $5 for 3396%, $6 for 4095%, and $10 bringing in 6892%. Some even see $15 post-mainnet, shooting potential ROI to a wild 10,388%. Numbers like that are why Qubetics dominates any conversation around the best cryptos to join for short term profits . VeChain (VET): Enterprise-Grade Blockchain VeChain isn’t new to the game. This project carved out its niche tackling supply chain problems with blockchain solutions. It’s spent years partnering with major corporations and building tech that tracks goods from production to delivery—all on-chain. For community members eyeing practical projects, VeChain delivers. Its tech is used in industries like luxury goods, automotive, agriculture, and healthcare. Imagine a vineyard in Chile using VeChain to prove every bottle’s authenticity or a car factory in Mexico tracking parts to avoid fraud. That’s VeChain’s strength: real-world use cases with measurable impact. VeChain runs a dual-token model with VET fueling the network and VTHO paying for transactions. This design keeps fees predictable, making it easier for enterprises to jump on board. Latin American backers respect that stability, especially in volatile markets. That’s why VeChain sticks around every list of the best cryptos to join for short term profits. VeChain’s enterprise adoption, partnerships, and consistent delivery make it more than a speculative asset. It’s infrastructure in the making, and community members see the upside. Especially now, with blockchain adoption growing fast in Latin America, VeChain’s ready to ride that wave. SUI: Scalable, Developer-Friendly, and One of the Best Cryptos to Join for Short Term Profits SUI is another project grabbing attention, especially among developers hunting for scalability and speed. Built by former Meta engineers, SUI delivers a high-performance Layer 1 platform designed for decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, and gaming projects. For backers tracking the best cryptos to join for short term profits, SUI stands out because it’s built to handle thousands of transactions per second with low fees. Imagine remittance platforms or Latin American fintech startups tapping into SUI’s network for cheaper, faster transactions. That’s the edge SUI offers—a network ready to support real-world applications, not just trading hype. SUI uses a unique object-centric model, which boosts performance and security. Its Move-based programming language also makes it easier for developers to build secure, efficient apps. This tech mix positions SUI as a go-to platform for those tired of dealing with congested networks and unpredictable gas fees. SUI’s partnerships and growing developer base signal strong momentum. Community members who understand tech-driven projects know SUI has staying power. That’s why it’s consistently named one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits—it’s built for action, not just headlines. Final Thoughts The search for short-term gains in crypto isn’t about jumping on every shiny new token. It’s about spotting projects solving real problems with strong fundamentals and community backing. Qubetics, VeChain, and SUI hit that mark—each offering something unique with serious upside. Qubetics leads the pack with its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace, offering businesses, professionals, and individuals new ways to unlock value.

The cryptocurrency, currently priced at $0.6484, has shown a 2.45% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, technical indicators suggest that ADA price is heading towards its first “death cross” of 2025. Cardano Technical Indicators Point to Bearish Momentum Cardano’s recent price action suggests that the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is likely to cross below the 200-day SMA in the coming days. This crossover, known as the death cross, is typically seen as a bearish signal. As per our recent Cardano price analysis , should the death cross occur, ADA could dip 25%. ADA/USD price chart (source: TradingView) At the time of writing, the 50-day SMA stands at $0.74, while the 200-day SMA is at $0.734. As the 50-day SMA continues to decline, it indicates that the short-term momentum of Cardano is underperforming compared to its long-term trend. A death cross often leads to a further decline in price, although the extent of the drop can vary. Despite the approaching death cross, it is important to note that such technical indicators are not always reliable predictors of future price action. While historical patterns may provide insight into market sentiment, they do not guarantee that prices will follow the same trajectory. This means that ADA price could experience a reversal even after the death cross forms, depending on other market factors. Recent Price Trends and Market Conditions ADA price has seen a notable decrease in Cardano price over the past week, with a 7.67% drop. After peaking at $1.19 in early March 2025, the coin has struggled to maintain its momentum, particularly as broader market concerns weigh on investor sentiment. On top of this, Cardano’s trading volume has been decreasing. The daily trade volume has dropped by 58.72%, with just under $394 million traded in the last 24 hours. A decrease in trading volume typically suggests that market participants are losing interest or that there is waning demand for ADA. Despite these challenges, there have been some positive developments surrounding Cardano. Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano, recently confirmed that Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin would be launching on the Cardano network. This news was met with some optimism, sparking interest in ADA. Additionally, Hoskinson teased the possibility of Cardano playing a role in Bitcoin’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. These announcements could potentially help Cardano regain momentum, but for now, the technical indicators suggest a cautious outlook. What Could Happen Next for ADA Price? As Cardano approaches the death cross, the primary question is whether the price will continue its downward trend or if there will be a reversal. The chart shows a pattern of consolidation, with ADA price action fluctuating within certain support and resistance zones. According to crypto analyst Seth fin, strong support is seen around the $0.6000 –$0.6500 range, while resistance lies near the $0.7000–$0.7500 levels. If ADA fails to break through the resistance, the price could continue its decline towards these support zones. One potential scenario is that price could experience a bounce if the Cardano price holds at these support levels, particularly the $0.6000 zone. This would signal that the market is still interested in buying ADA at lower prices. On the other hand, if the price fails to hold these support zones and breaks below them, further downside may follow, potentially leading to a retest of lower support zones in the $0.3000–$0.4000 range.

Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia all lose $3 trillion valuation as Trump tariffs Wipe Out $1 trillion in 3 days As Trump announced fresh tariffs on Wednesday, global Markets reacted swiftly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 3000 points plunging 7.4%, while Crude Oil (WTI) also tumbled more than 10% as manufacturers and commodities traders brace for a blip in global commerce. But the most dramatic losses came from the United States’ technology sector.

Historically, such synchronized declines among the biggest U.S. corporations suggest investors are reacting to systemic market risks rather than, individual stock performance outlook. This affirms that China’s swift retaliation—announcing new tariffs on U.S. exports within 48 hours—has sparked fears of a sustained trade war. The looming supply chain risks has prompted investors to pivot away from US stocks towards alternative markets like private credit and cryptocurrencies. Altcoins Brace for Breakout as Crypto Market Cap Holds at $2.7T Amid Trade War Concerns Bitcoin price has held firmly above the $80,000 mark, despite US Trade tariffs sparking intense market turbulence across global financial markets over the past week. BTC’s resilient price action has caught investor’s attention, with the positive sentiment extending towards altcoins. On Wednesday, the White House triggered widespread investor anxiety by unveiling sweeping new tariffs on imports from multiple trading partners, including China, India, Mexico, and the European Union. Early market reactions show that cryptocurrencies withstood the sell-pressure while US Stocks, and manufacturing commodities markets nose-dived.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Might Offer Even Bigger Returns,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-the-xrp-600-surge-magacoin-finance-might-offer-even-bigger-returns/,"XRP ran over 600% between November 2024 and January 2025 . It got a lot of attention from investors looking to gain from the rally. However, many investors were priced out and missed the pump. Now, these investors are looking for the next big opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the next potential mooner that has gained a lot of attention recently on 4th April 2025. XRP is currently trading at mere $2.04 . On the other hand, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised $5 million in no time despite being a fresh presale. This coin is promising to hit a milestone of $5 by the end of 2025 . But could it go even higher than that? Let’s analyze that. XRP’s Impressive Run: A 600% Surge XRP went up by 600% between November 2024 and January 2024. It is quite an impressive pump. In this rally, it went from $0.52 to $3.10 according to blockchain data. Eventually it stabilized at a price of $2.04 after a 30% correction. Credit for this major pump goes to Trump’s pro crypto stance and SEC settlement during which a $125 million fine got cut to only $50 million according to reports. Analysts predict a $5.81 target by 2025 —a 185% gain—with a potential XRP ETF approval ( 73% likelihood, per Polymarket) driving $5 billion in inflows, per web forecasts. Whales accumulated 453.3 million tokens ( $526 million ) in 1 week , per web data, but XRP’s 100 billion supply and regulatory risks—like Better Markets’ challenge—may cap its upside, per web sources. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Explosive Potential: A $5 Target MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads, raising $5 million in its freshly launched presale by April 04 , 2025 . Stage 6 sold out at $0.000266 , with a listing price of $0.007 securing a 2,500% ROI, per web reports. Analysts project a $5 milestone by 2025 , a 71,329% jump from listing, turning $100 into $714,000 , per posts on X. Backed by a Hashex audit, its 50,000 supporters grow by 10,000 weekly across 30 + countries, and Stage 7 is 90% sold out in days . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s DeFi lending model, potentially yielding 20% + annually, offers utility, making it a high-growth contender, per web insights. XRP vs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Returns Battle XRP’s 185% potential to $5.81 is solid, with 1,500 transactions per second at 0.00001 XRP per transaction, per web data, and ETF prospects boosting sentiment, per Polymarket. However, its $120 billion market cap and regulatory uncertainty—like the SEC’s appeal of its non-security ruling—may slow its climb, per web reports. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 target offers a 71,329% ROI, with a potential $50 million valuation at listing, per posts on X. While XRP’s 600% rally was impressive, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s low-cap agility and DeFi utility could deliver even bigger returns, per web forecasts. Why Investors Are Switching to MAGACOIN FINANCE LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH CODE MAGA50X XRP’s 600% surge left latecomers seeking the next big opportunity, and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits the bill, per posts on X predicting a 60,000% surge. XRP’s $526 million whale accumulation shows strength, but its 30% correction and regulatory baggage—like competition from RLUSD ( $170 million cap)—dampen its appeal, per web data. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 million presale and 90% Stage 7 sellout signal momentum, per web reports. Investors who missed XRP’s rally see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a chance to catch a 2025 breakout, potentially outpacing XRP’s 185% upside with a 71,329% return, per web insights.

The PI coin price continues to slide, dropping 61% in just a month and flirting with its all-time low as concerns about unlocks and weak exchange support grow. The Chainlink (LINK) price prediction trends are telling a similar story. After getting knocked back from $14, LINK has slipped under $13. But while Pi and LINK are losing momentum, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining it nonstop. The BDAG team took the spotlight in Keynote 3 with a clear message: security isn’t a bonus—it’s the foundation. Between top-tier audits, a fault-tolerant design, and serious backing from holders, confidence in BDAG is growing fast. With over $212 million raised and the price already up 2,380%, analysts now say it could hit $20 by 2027. Will Pi Coin Price Hit a New Low After 61% Monthly Decline? The PI coin price has suffered a sharp decline, falling 61% over the past month and 18% in just the last week. This sustained downward trend has brought the token alarmingly close to its all-time low of $0.6157. Currently trading at $0.6655, Pi is down nearly 77% from its all-time high of $2.99. The lack of a strong recovery signal, along with upcoming token unlocks and limited exchange listings, adds to the selling pressure. If the PI coin price breaks below its key $0.65 support, analysts warn it could test new lows in the weeks ahead. Chainlink Price Prediction Shifts After Drop Below $13 The current Chainlink (LINK) price prediction suggests short-term uncertainty as the token struggles to maintain support above $13. After being rejected near $14, sellers pushed the price lower, even as trading volume spiked over 50% to $620 million. Despite PayPal expanding LINK availability in the U.S., the market response remained muted. Technical indicators, including an RSI of 38, reflect persistent bearish pressure. However, some forecasts point to a possible 23.27% increase by late April. Until stronger buyer activity materialises, the Chainlink price prediction leans toward caution, especially with ongoing volatility and fading investor confidence. Keynote 3: BlockDAG Doubles Down on Security! BlockDAG’s third keynote placed a sharp spotlight on a core priority: security. From the start, the network has been built to handle real-world threats, not just technical demands. Chief Security Officer Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj summed it up best during the event: “Security is not a feature—it’s the bedrock upon which we’ve built everything.” That message came with proof. Smart contract systems and treasury mechanisms have already passed audits from both CertiK and Halborn —two of the most respected names in blockchain security. These early validations send a strong message ahead of BlockDAG’s mainnet launch. Behind the scenes, the technical framework supports this cautious approach. Financial operations are protected using Multi-Party Computation (MPC), which spreads risk and keeps treasury funds secure. BlockDAG’s infrastructure is also built to stay online no matter what, thanks to fault-tolerant design and a globally distributed setup. The goal is simple: no centralised weak spots and no single points of failure. These measures help protect uptime and maintain confidence, even under pressure. Market response to the Keynote’s security updates has been anything but quiet. BlockDAG has raised over $212 million so far, selling more than 19.1 billion BDAG coins. The current price sits at $0.0248 in batch 27—up 2,380% since launch. As new buyers rush in before batch 28, BDAG is already being seen as one of the top crypto coins right now. Some analysts see the price reaching $20 by 2027, largely because the project is moving fast and built on fundamentals others are still trying to figure out. Final Takeaways The PI coin price remains under pressure, and unless major exchanges step in or sentiment shifts, its slide toward a new low may continue. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price prediction reflects a token caught between potential and hesitation—volume is climbing, but conviction hasn’t followed. Then came BlockDAG’s Keynote 3, shifting the conversation entirely. While others tread water, BlockDAG is stacking momentum—bolstered by a security framework already earning top audit credentials. Its infrastructure is built to last, and with over $212 million raised, a 2,380% price surge, and a $20 target on the horizon, BDAG is quickly climbing the ranks among the top crypto coins right now.

The RSI and MACD point to a neutral to bearish trend, while the Falling Wedge pattern suggests a possible reversal. For those looking at long-term Cardano price predictions, the outlook remains uncertain. As ADA consolidates around $0.65, the next moves will depend on whether bulls can push above $0.70 or if bears will drive the price below $0.63. Solana (SOL) Price Drops 11.7%: Critical Support Ahead The Solana (SOL) price has dropped 11.7% over the past week, currently trading around $117. This comes as the coin recently broke through a critical support level at $128. Solana’s price is now forming a bearish triangle pattern, suggesting the possibility of further downward movement. Bollinger Bands also indicate increased volatility, with support at $116. If this level fails to hold, Solana’s price could test lower levels at $113, $110, or even $99. On the upside, key resistance levels are at $135, $147, and $152. Traders are closely monitoring the $118 support zone. BlockDAG: The Next Big Crypto with 1,000 dApps & 800x Growth Potential! BlockDAG’s recent Keynote 3 highlighted the network’s impressive progress and offered an exciting preview of its plans for adoption and growth. The outlook for BlockDAG is brighter than ever as it aims to reshape the use of blockchain technology across various industries. By 2026, the platform plans to launch over 1,000 decentralized applications (dApps), targeting sectors like finance, healthcare, gaming, identity, and governance—aiming to integrate blockchain into more aspects of everyday life. Another key part of BlockDAG’s roadmap is the introduction of account abstraction, which will provide users with more flexibility by eliminating the need to directly manage private keys. The platform is also venturing into artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized identity, reinforcing its commitment to staying at the forefront of technology. “We’re exploring new frontiers like AI, self-sovereign identity, data personhood, and decentralized governance,” said CTO Jeremy Harkness, emphasizing the ambitious scope of the plans ahead. BDAG adoption is already at an all-time high, with over 19.1 billion coins sold and the presale raising a historic $212 million. Given this growth, analysts predict that BDAG, currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, could reach $20 by 2027, offering over 800x potential returns. Plus, with the network’s ongoing expansion, many believe that BlockDAG will meet its $600 million presale target ahead of schedule. So, for anyone looking for the best crypto to buy right now, acting quickly is critical, as batch 27 is nearing a sell-out. Looking Ahead The Cardano (ADA) price prediction remains uncertain, with key support at $0.63; the coin’s next move will depend on whether bulls push it above $0.70 or bears drive it lower. Meanwhile, Solana’s price faces potential further declines, with key support at $116 and resistance at $135, as it forms a bearish triangle pattern. However, for those seeking the best crypto to buy right now , BlockDAG is a standout choice. Priced at just $0.0248 in batch 27, BDAG is forecasted to deliver over 800x returns by 2027! Plus, with the platform’s planned ecosystem expansion, increased adoption, and growing utility, demand for BDAG is expected to rise rapidly. So, traders looking for maximum crypto returns at the lowest cost should act quickly, as once batch 27 sells out, BDAG will not be priced this low again.

Confidence is harder. As the quarter ends, the gap between the two is starting to show. Filecoin still leans on infrastructure logic—decentralized storage, IPFS integration, institutional relevance—but trades at $2.78, a fraction of its $237 peak. Translation: FIL’s future looks weighed down by utility no one’s paying for. Kaspa, meanwhile, sits at $0.06538, with an all-time high of $0.2075 in the rearview. Yes, it”s fast. But fast hasn’t translated into committed capital. Then there”s BlockDAG (BDAG) . No exchange listing yet, no VC safety net, and still: $212 million raised, 19.1 billion coins sold, and over 170,000 holders already participating in a live beta testnet. BDAG has climbed 2,380% since Batch 1. At this pace, it may reach $1 before KAS even gets close. Filecoin”s Future Hangs Between Utility & Market Fatigue Filecoin isn’t short on ambition. As a decentralized storage network built on IPFS, it offers an alternative to traditional cloud platforms. Yet for all its technical credibility, FIL’s current price—hovering near $2.78—is a long way from its $237 peak in 2021. The short-term forecast points to resistance at $3.61, with some models projecting a push to $4.92 by the end of 2025. But the floor is equally defined: if momentum falters, $1.92 remains a plausible bottom. The Filecoin future depends on whether that indecision turns into renewed demand or prolonged drift. For now, FIL’s future remains a high-potential idea weighed down by market hesitation. KAS price forecast: Chart Says Oversold, Market Says Wait Kaspa claims speed, and to its credit, it delivers. However, at $0.06538, the market seems more focused on KAS’s price forecast than throughput. After peaking at $0.2075 in 2024, KAS now trades beneath key technical markers, forming a descending triangle while sitting below its 50-day MA. The Kaspa (KAS) price forecast for 2025 splits cleanly: strength could push it toward $0.11408, while another stall sends it to $0.04262. RSI sits deep in oversold territory, which could prompt a bounce—but sentiment remains fragile. The real test isn’t whether Kaspa can move fast; it’s whether the market still believes speed alone matters. Beta Testnet’s Live, Miners Are Shipping—How Soon Until BlockDAG Explodes? “Today marks another significant milestone. We’re excited to announce the official launch of our first Beta Testnet,” said BlockDAG’s CEO Antony Turner in the project’s recently launched Keynote 3 . Not “coming soon,” not locked behind closed devnets—live, functional, and being tested by over 170,000 holders. Every BDAG holder will also receive 10,000 testnet BDAG through a fixed vesting schedule that mirrors mainnet dynamics. And that detail matters. Participation levels, user velocity, and mining incentives are already shaping what BlockDAG’s mainnet will function like once it goes public. That kind of clarity before launch is rare. Rarer still when backed by hard numbers: $212 million raised and 19.1 billion coins sold—all without touching venture capital. Where most projects use testnets as PR events, BlockDAG has turned it into a functioning onboarding layer. And while that’s happening, the network is also preparing to start shipping its mining hardware—10,000 custom-built X30 and X100 ASIC miners—ahead of its 2025 mainnet rollout. BlockDAG’s native coin, BDAG, has already surged 2,380% since Batch 1, now priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. That’s the kind of movement the market hasn’t seen in a long time—structured, not spiked. The mainnet is already on the calendar for this year. So the question isn’t if the price moves again, but how far. More conservative forecasts place BDAG above $1 post-launch. Others are throwing around double digits. Either way, the math doesn’t look optional for much longer. Which Is the Top Performing Crypto Today? Filecoin has the infrastructure but not the price action to match. Kaspa has the speed but little conviction behind it. Both Filecoin’s future and KAS’s price forecast sit in familiar limbo—technically sound, commercially uncertain. BlockDAG, on the other hand, isn’t promising momentum—it’s delivering it in real time. The network’s Beta Testnet is now live, while the BDAG coin has already surged 2,380% since Batch 1. With a $1 target now widely considered realistic post-mainnet, BDAG remains the top-performing crypto in the market today. Filecoin and Kaspa are waiting for traction. BlockDAG is already showing what most projects hope to prove much later in their timeline. The only thing that matters now? Getting in as early as possible because its current Batch 27 price of $0.0248 will soon be history!

According to Bit Bull, the ETH decline will see it sink to lows of $1,600 in the near future. Ethereum Price Hurtles Toward $1,600 Cryptocurrency analyst Bit Bull has shared a prediction on X for Ethereum price movement in the near-term. According to Bit Bull, Ethereum looks set to continue its decline and can fall as low as $1,600. Bit Bull hinges his prediction on Ethereum breaking down from a symmetrical triangle after prices fell below $1,820. The decline below the triangle pattern signals a bearish sentiment, continuing the previous decline. ETH price remains stuck below $2,000 since the drop below the psychological level was driven by a raft of unsavory fundaments and technicals. The latest is the Ethereum price dropping beneath the triangle pattern, triggering new short entries on the asset. A breakdown and a retest followed by low trading volumes confirm fears of a steeper ETH correction. “However, after the breakdown and a retest, ETH is now looking bearish,” said Bit Bull. “Technically, there’s a strong possibility for further downside.” Apart from the symmetrical triangle, a further confirmation of bearish sentiments is seen in ETH dominance. According to his analysis, Bit Bull notes the ETH dominance chart has formed a descending triangle to signal further bearishness. “A retest toward the upper trendline is likely, but after that, we could see another move down,” added Bit Bull. On-chain Metrics Confirm Bearish Sentiments For ETH While technicals are largely pessimistic, on-chain data are telling a similar story for Ethereum price. Right out of the bat, active addresses on Ethereum have taken a major hit in recent months, exacerbating the issue of falling prices. There is also a decline in Ethereum fees burnt while fees burnt per transaction face a similar slump. Perhaps the biggest indicator for long-term bearishness is an increase in ETH supply after the Merge event. Despite the negative sentiments, ETH to $4,000 is still in play given the show of as strong support at $1,800. Standard Chartered analyst opines that Ethereum will finish the year at $4,000 after slashing its earlier prediction of $10,000 by 60%. Ethereum price currently exchanges hands at $1,803, falling by less than 1% over the last day. Weekly charts indicate a similar ETH decline of around 1%, confirming a strong consolidation base for the bruised and battered altcoin. Ethereum’s trading volume stands at nearly $7 billion with whales creating a chunk of market activity for the asset.

Based on this, Ripple’s native crypto is eyeing a rebound, with crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicting that the XRP price could rebound to as high as $2.60 if it holds the $2 support. XRP’s Open Interest Surges Above $3 Billion CoinGlass data shows that XRP’s open interest has surged in the last 24 hours, rising to as high as $3.61 billion, indicating huge interest in the altcoin at the moment. This provides a bullish outlook for the altcoin, seeing as traders are heavily betting on it. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also suggested that Ripple’s native crypto could rebound soon. In an X post, he stated that if XRP can stay above the key $2 level, a 30% move toward the channel’s upper boundary at $2.60 could be next. Crypto analyst CasiTrades’s prediction also showed that the altcoin could surge to $2.70 if it breaks above $2.24. This could eventually pave the way for Ripple’s native crypto to rally to a new all-time high (ATH). However, there is still the possibility that the altcoin could also drop to new lows. A CoinGape market analysis revealed that Ripple’s price is at a crossroads, as a wedge pattern signals a 70% crash or 700% surge. Crypto analyst Rex also predicted that XRP could soon witness a bullish reversal. He stated that a breakout is coming and that this is the most obvious play of the cycle. His accompanying chart showed that XRP could rally to as high as $2.9. Two Paths For Ripple’s Native Crypto Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto stated that the XRP price could drop to $0.65 or rally to $17. This is based on an Ascending Broadening Wedge, which is currently forming for the altcoin. The analyst remarked that XRP first needs to close above $3.50 for a solid start. He claimed that if the altcoin hits the $5 range but doesn’t close above it convincingly, this formation has a higher chance of playing out. Egrag Crypto asserted that XRP must retest $1.90 after being rejected from the $5 range. Once that happens, the altcoin will need another attempt to close above $5, ideally hitting $6 and closing above that level. The analyst affirmed that XRP will likely blast to double digits within two to three weeks if that happens. The target move for this Ascending Broadening Wedge is a potential $17.50. This aligns with another prediction in which he stated that the XRP price could rally to double digits by the July 21 cycle peak . However, Egrag Crypto warned that there is still a 70% chance that XRP breaks to the downside and only a 30% chance for an upside breakout. If the altcoin breaks down, the analyst claims the measured move would take Ripple’s native crypto back to $0.65.

With the four-month downtrend in ETH that started in April now being compared to similar price movements in 2018, some analysts are suggesting that a parabolic rally might carry the price of ETH as high as $3,000 by mid-2025. However, XRP enthusiasts have thrown around a $7 price target, and established investors are becoming increasingly interested in altcoins that bring utility and the possibility of explosive growth. MUTM, token of Mutuum Finance is another one grabbing attention and accelerating its presale momentum with $6.2 million raised and 7,900 holders onboard as its Phase 4 approaches capacity. Ethereum’s Rebound Struggles for Momentum Ethereum surge to $64 billion in monthly DEX volumes signals waning institutional interest, yet whale selling and ETF outflow-saturation casts a shadow over its near-term outlook. ETH is “extremely undervalued” after consecutive monthly losses, a rarity since 2018, says well known analyst Crypto Rover. According to historical data, Q2 could bring gains of at least 60%, which would see ETH price be propelled above the resistance at $2,062. Even though some technical indicators like rounding bottom pattern and bullish AO bars suggest a bounce back, the road forward for Ethereum is rocky. Mutuum Finance Token Presale Races Ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has reached Phase 4 with its 11-phase presale, charging $0.025 per token, 20% below the $0.03 price in Phase 5. Tokens at this price represent a guaranteed 140% return from its $0.06 exchange listing when it goes live. As much as 9,900% return-on-investment (ROI) for Phase 4 buyers, with prospects of hitting $2.50 by post-listing through the roof above launch. By redirecting platform revenue to stakers, the project’s lending model, which combines mtTokens and overcollateralized loans, generates sustained buy pressure. Couple this with a $100,000 presale giveaway and urgency grows as slots fill fast. Mathematical certainty fuels the allure of Mutuum Finance: an example $1,000 investment today acquires 40,000 tokens at $0.025, and reaches $100,000 should MUTM achieve $2.50. These projections are based on its system of hybrid DeFi, which has combined peer-to-peer lending with variable interest rates. Unlike meme coins, which often spread as quickly as they crash, with their prices determined by market whims, MUTM employs a buy-and-distribute process that ensures a steady and indelible demand, making the token impervious to the fickle whims of the market. With 7,900 holders already onboard, presale velocity highlights its marketers’ view as a high-yield, low-key entry point into DeFi. Security Audits at Final Stages The Mutuum Finance team is currently finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts — a significant step forward that will improve investor confidence in the project. You will be notified through the official channels once the development is done, as it is the DNA of the platform to be transparent. This recruitment, essential to long-term adoption, is coupled with mtToken interoperability and overcollateralized stablecoins, and these also speak in favor of the assertion that MUTM will not be a passing trend, but a DeFi staple. Timing the Market Shift Amid the buzz of XRP’s $7 ambition and the resurgence of Ethereum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings a clear roadmap to 100X potential. The presale structure, audited security framework, and revenue-driven tokenomics form a compelling argument for prioritizing MUTM over established giants. The presale for Mutuum Finance is moving swiftly, with each phase driving demand. Those investors who overlook this opportunity will not only miss out on a 140% gain at launch but a potential 9,900% explosion as the platform grows. Go to Mutuum Finance’s official site to get involved before Phase 5 upcoming price raise. In an era where innovation trumps legacy in the crypto market space, MUTM could well be the tactical coin of choice for 2025.

Ripple (XRP) price holds $2 support as altcoins mirror Bitcoin’s resilience to Trade War Triggers Ripple (XRP) price initially plunged to 30-day lows around $1.80 with hours after Trump announced sweeping tariffs during the liberation speech on Friday. However, the momentum swung positive in recent days as BTC holds firm above $82,000 after China retaliatory 34% tariffs on Thursday, reinforcing investor confidence in the crypto markets as a crisis resistant asset class. Ripple (XRP) price action, April 5 | Source: TradingView Ripple price rebounded 12.5% since Thursday, rising as as $2.15 at press time according to CoinMarketCap data. As seen above, Ripple price continues to consolidate well-above the $2 mark, mirroring the likes of ETH, BTC and SOL , which have also defended key psychological support levels around $1,800, $80,000 and $110 respectively over the past week. Meanwhile, top-ranked US stocks such as Apple, NVIDIA and Microsoft all recorded 15% losses a piece before the week’s trading closed on Friday. Derivative Market Analysis: Crypto Buying Pressure Could Slow Down this Weekend With top-ranked crypto assets including XRP all consolidating around key psychological price points this weekend, it signal market-wide buying support, amid capital inflows from investors exiting stocks amid US trade war tensions. However, considering that US markets are now closed, the volume of transitional capital flows could slow down significant until pre-market trading begin. Validating this stance, Coinglass derivatives market data shows evidence of short-term bearish trading signals. Crypto Derivatives Markets Analysis, BTC, ETH see combined losses of $50M, April 5. | Source: Coinglass Derivatives data from Coinglass reinforces this stance. Over the past 24 hours, crypto markets saw a total of $110.65 million in liquidations, with long positions accounting for $85.10 million—over 76% of the total. Bitcoin and Ethereum alone alone recorded nearly $50 million combined, with BTC traders booking $36.32 million in liquidations, followed by Ethereum at $13.61 million. The bearish imbalance, especially the outsized long wipeouts in the last 12 hours ($67.11M longs vs $13.48M shorts), points to a rising number of over-leveraged bullish positions being flushed out. This suggests short-term exhaustion in buying momentum, increasing the likelihood of a minor pullback or sideways action through the weekend. With high leverage being unwound and external demand on pause, weekend trading may turn defensive with XRP markets and other prominent altcoins. Strategic altcoin traders woould watch for support retests, especially if funding rates begin to flip or volume declines further ahead of Monday’s open. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls facing Resistance at $2.20, Amid Weekend Caution As the week closes on April 5, XRP price forecast charts on TradingView reflect signs of short-term exhaustion following its rebound to $2.15. Despite five consecutive green candles, XRP price remains below the 50-day EMA at $2.21 and the 100-day EMA at $2.28. This reflects supply-side pressure still outweighing momentum, even as bulls attempt a recovery from March’s lows. XRP Price Forecast Notably, the 200-day EMA near $1.95 is acting as a key anchor. A breach below this could trigger stop runs and reopen downside risk toward $1.80. True Strength Index (TSI) remains in bearish territory at -0.80, yet is flattening, hinting that the selling momentum is decelerating. Volume has weakened across recent sessions, confirming the rally lacks conviction. A clear break above $2.22 would be required to invalidate near-term bearish bias. Until that happens, XRP remains vulnerable to weekend drawdowns. Bulls must defend $1.95 or risk deeper losses into next week’s open. A close below $2.00 would reassert sellers’ control short-term.

In response, the EU—America’s largest trading partner—warned it would retaliate with its own countermeasures, including possible taxes on certain US services and targeting American tech firms. Lombard said the European response should “inevitably” have “consequences” for both European and American businesses, but he emphasized that Brussels does not plan to punish all imports. “It is not a question of taxing all American imports, that would be counterproductive, penalizing our economy as much as theirs,” he said. Instead, the minister explained , the EU will carefully “target certain industrial segments, in a precise manner,” while keeping the door open for negotiations that could lead to the tariffs being lifted. He noted that if the two sides strike a balanced agreement “within a reasonable time frame,” it would boost confidence among French companies and households. EU rules already regulate data usage through mechanisms like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Lombard did not elaborate on how any new rules might look. Still, he underlined that all fiscal and regulatory avenues remain under discussion. Musk wants the US and EU to consider a zero-tariff arrangement Meanwhile, entrepreneur Elon Musk expressed hope that Washington and Brussels can forge a “zero-tariff” arrangement. Speaking on Saturday via video link to Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini at a League party event in Florence, Musk said, “Both Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America.” Musk gave his remarks through a videolink at a Saturday League part event in Florence. Source: The Associated Press His remarks came after global markets reacted to Trump’s trade measures. Musk, who has served as a key adviser to the president since January and was a major donor during the campaign, voiced a contrasting stance. He suggested a deeper partnership between the US and Europe, plus greater mobility for workers. “That’s certainly been my advice to the president,” he said, without clarifying whether the guidance focused on tariffs, freedom of movement, or both. Lombard concluded that the EU is keeping fiscal, customs, and regulatory measures on the table if the US fails to roll back the tariffs. But he also expressed optimism about reaching a solution through dialogue, adding that a fair deal built on trust could head off a larger trade conflict.

Cardano is dealing with a confidence crisis after whales offloaded 120 million ADA, dragging price action closer to critical support at $0.64. Solana has dipped to $112, clinging to a year-long support zone. Despite strong ecosystem growth—rising TVL, leading DEX volumes, and cross-chain adoption—its price still reflects market-wide uncertainty. But one project is cutting through the noise with actual execution: BlockDAG . With over $212 million raised, 19 billion tokens sold, and a fully live testnet already enabling dApp deployment and token creation, BlockDAG isn’t waiting for market approval—it’s already building. Add in no-code tools, CertiK and Halborn audits, and over 800,000 miners via the X1 app, and the gap between theory and delivery becomes impossible to ignore. In a space full of potential, BlockDAG is where utility and traction already meet. Cardano Whales Dump 120M ADA—Will Price Crash Before the $1 Breakout? Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.6472 after slipping from an intraday high of $0.6562. Market-wide fear has pushed trading volume down by nearly 29%, with $3 million in ADA liquidated. Whale wallets holding 1M–10M ADA have offloaded 120M tokens in just 48 hours, signaling lowered confidence. Technical indicators are flashing red. The MACD remains below the zero line, CMF sits at -0.15, and the RSI is at 43.59—suggesting bearish momentum. A continued drop could push ADA to support levels near $0.6332 if $0.6402 breaks. Still, long-term investors may see this dip as a chance to enter before any future rally. If buyers return, ADA must clear resistance at $0.6538 and $0.66 to reclaim momentum. Given ADA’s past recovery patterns, some see this pullback as a possible setup for a rebound toward the long-awaited $1 mark. Solana Drops Below $118—But Is Network Growth Signaling a Surprise Rebound? Solana (SOL) is trading below its key $118 support, slipping to $112 amid broad market pressure. This level has held strong since March 2024, but recent technicals remain bearish. However, the ecosystem tells a different story. Solana’s total value locked has surged to 65 million SOL, nearly four times its November level. Daily DEX volume also leads the market at $2.4 billion—outpacing Ethereum. Institutional activity hints at a possible bottom. Binance, after previous selloffs, has resumed buying SOL, suggesting accumulation. Still, SOL must reclaim $115 before any recovery toward $130 can begin. Over $550 million in bridged assets and a spike in token launches also show rising demand. If Solana holds current levels, long-term buyers may see this as a rare entry point backed by strong fundamentals. But if it breaks further, $100 could be next. BlockDAG’s $212M Surge and Live Testnet Puts It Ahead of Every Altcoin in 2025 BlockDAG isn’t just promising change—it’s already delivering. With its Keynote 3, BlockDAG confirmed it’s beyond whitepapers and hype. Its Beta Testnet is live, allowing developers to build dApps, launch tokens, and interact with a real, functioning blockchain. This isn’t a test—it’s happening now. The platform features no-code deployment tools, a developer academy, and real-world use cases across finance, healthcare, and more. It’s also been audited by both Halborn and CertiK, giving it credibility that most early-stage projects can’t claim. Importantly, there’s no VC control, giving BlockDAG a more community-driven feel. So far, over $212 million has been raised in presale, with 19 billion coins sold and more than 800,000 users mining on the X1 App. The BDAG price has soared by 2,380% since Batch 1, and thousands of X-series miners are ready to ship ahead of the mainnet. With all these signs of real traction, analysts are targeting $1 for BDAG in 2025, with room for more. Unlike many projects still in development limbo, BlockDAG is live, fast, and growing. If you”re hunting for the next major altcoin breakout, BlockDAG is already miles ahead of the pack. What’s Next? As Cardano fights to break through $0.66 and Solana clings to $115 amid institutional repositioning, investors are left weighing signals against sentiment. ADA’s RSI hovers near bearish levels, and SOL needs momentum just to reclaim ground it held months ago. BlockDAG, however, is moving on its own timeline. Its $212M presale isn’t built on promises—it’s backed by a working product. Developers are actively building on a live beta testnet. Users are mining in real time. Audits are done. Tools are ready. And the ecosystem is growing without VC oversight. In a cycle where many altcoins are reacting to macro shifts, BlockDAG is creating its own gravity. If 2025 is about separating hype from impact, BDAG is already ahead. It’s not just a top contender—it’s the blueprint for how serious crypto projects should launch and scale.

MAGACOIN FINANCE operates to modernize decentralized finance while providing practical decentralized finance tools which might transform business and everyday user settings. So, if you’re looking to make a move in the crypto space, you might want to think twice about those meme coins and take a closer look at MAGACOIN FINANCE . SHIB: A Meme Coin’s Struggle for Survival The cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains popular among fans who have supported it for quite some time. The combination of hype from the community and its meme culture enabled SHIB to reach its position among leading meme coins. SHIB’s value has declined by more than 55% from its previous year’s rate, and its burning process has also decreased substantially since then. It’s down by a staggering 99.29%. Ouch. The SHIB trading value at $0.00001278 presents difficulties for meme coin enthusiasts to view it as anything other than a wishful investment. The growth prospects of SHIB should be evaluated. For SHIB to reach a price of $1 it would require a phenomenal increase of 7.7 million percent. (Is that even mathematically possible? Doubt it!) The intense meme popularity of SHIB has given way to an unforgiving understanding of its actual market restrictions. Any serious investor should avoid using SHIB as their main investment vehicle since it operates mainly as a crypto-world novelty rather than a profitable option. The real growth potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE makes it the best crypto under a penny . PEPE: Whale Sell-Off Wrecks the Fun The ongoing difficulties of PEPE should prompt everyone to question their decisions about investing in meme coins. A whale transferred 150 billion PEPE tokens to the market which resulted in a loss of around $1.14 million. The whale acquired 1.5 trillion tokens with a purchase of just over $2,000 dollars which should have made people take notice. The PEPE token hit its maximum value at $43 million before the ‘whale’ trader sold tokens worth $1.14 million which strengthened the negative outlook on this altcoin. The downward path of PEPE demonstrates that meme coins remain extraordinarily risky since their lack of practical uses makes them highly prone to complete collapse. (Not the kind of road you want to drive down if you’re looking for serious crypto gains, right?) The attention PEPE receives initially will not guarantee its survival because it faces a challenging journey going forward. Driving on this path will not lead to substantial crypto gains according to right protocols. Those seeking genuine growth opportunities and stability should consider investing in MAGACOIN FINANCE since it presents a 2927% growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Crypto with Real Utility (And That 2927% Potential) Even though SHIB and PEPE are busy entertaining us with their ups and downs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly making its move as a top contender. You see, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t some fly-by-night crypto coin—it’s a serious cryptocurrency with massive growth potential, and it’s just getting started. With its presale already raking in over $5 million and a projected ROI of 2927%, MAGACOIN FINANCE is on a mission to be the best crypto under a penny. MAGACOIN FINANCE Sets Itself Apart with 2927% Growth Opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE operates through a program which enhances international payment operations with reduced expenses and accelerated transaction speeds for small business owners and freelancers and e-commerce operators. (Can you say game-changer?) Huge Growth Potential Massive Market Demand Real-Life Example The MAGACOIN FINANCE Train Offers a Chance for Investment (Before Its Value Skyrockets) The best penny cryptocurrency today is MAGACOIN FINANCE yet this position will not remain stable for long. The price of MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to rise because the presale shows rapid development which attracts more investors to the project. The time to join the next major crypto development is now because it will only last for a short period. The volatile market does not change the fact that MAGACOIN FINANCE offers real-world applications alongside strong growth predictions and restricted presale periods. Conclusion: The Smart Move in a Shaky Market The crypto market shows wild volatility yet MAGACOIN FINANCE maintains its position above the market turbulence. MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates staying power because meme coins like SHIB and PEPE show signs of short-lived market trends (we apologize again). This cryptocurrency is designed for the long run since it combines utility with growth opportunities that could reach 2927% in value. Are you looking for the best crypto under a penny ? MAGACOIN FINANCE is where it’s at. Don’t sleep on this incredible opportunity – So, go right now and join the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale and lock in your place in the future of crypto!

The drop has ETH testing support near $1,750, with a possible slide to $1,200 if buyers fail to step in. Meanwhile, XRP is gaining steam with Coinbase filing for futures approval and Kraken listing Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. If technicals hold, XRP could rally to $3.51. But the most critical development? BlockDAG’s final testnet is now live—fully EVM-compatible and already pushing over 2,000 TPS. While ETH struggles with congestion and XRP hinges on regulatory wins, BlockDAG is operational and developer-ready. With real smart contract deployment and a no-code dApp builder, it’s not speculation—it’s execution. For buyers looking at practical use and future value, BlockDAG isn’t just part of the conversation—it’s leading it. Ethereum Drops to $1,777: Is a Major Q2 2025 Rally Coming? Ethereum has dropped sharply to around $1,777, down 5% in the last 24 hours. The entire crypto market is reeling after President Trump’s tariff move wiped out $140B in value. ETH is now testing support near $1,750, and if it breaks, it could fall further toward $1,200. Despite this, big buyers are buying. Wallets holding 10,000–100,000 ETH have been quietly increasing their positions since January. Analysts say this mirrors ETH’s price pattern from 2020, right before a major bull run. Technical charts show resistance at $1,820 and $1,880. A clean break above $1,920 could trigger a move toward $2,050. But for now, bearish signals remain strong. Still, long-term buyers might see this dip as an entry point before a possible Q2 rebound. History shows ETH has bounced back from similar levels—and whales seem to be betting on it. XRP Futures Coming to Coinbase? Analysts Eye $3.51 Price Surge Coinbase is seeking CFTC approval to list XRP futures by April 21, a move that could boost institutional interest in Ripple. If approved, this would mark a big step in XRP’s push into regulated crypto markets. XRP is also gaining traction through Kraken’s listing of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, strengthening its ecosystem. Traders are watching closely. XRP is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the charts, typically a sign of a breakout. If momentum builds, analysts see short-term targets at $2.40 and possibly a full rally to $3.51—about a 73% gain from current levels. Market analysts like Dark Defender expect the correction to end soon, while others highlight price compression as a bullish signal. With futures, stablecoin growth, and chart patterns aligning, some buyers may see this as a timely entry point before XRP’s next big move. BlockDAG’s Testnet Goes Live: Is BDAG the Next Ethereum? BlockDAG is quietly stealing the spotlight. Its final beta testnet is now live—fast, dev-ready, and fully compatible with Ethereum. With over 2,000 transactions per second, real smart contract deployment, and tools like a no-code dApp builder, BlockDAG isn’t just preparing—it’s already working. This live testnet isn’t about hype—it’s proof. Developers can already build and deploy using Solidity, without the bottlenecks Ethereum users face. BlockDAG also offers features like a built-in IDE and no high gas fees, creating a frictionless environment for both new and seasoned developers. For early buyers, this changes the game. BDAG isn’t a promise of future tech—it’s the native token of a functioning network, already in use. With over $212 million raised and 19.2 billion coins sold, the presale momentum speaks for itself. Now in batch 27 at $0.0248, BDAG is up 2,380% since launch. BlockDAG is already moving forward. This might be one of the last chances to get in before listings. If you’re looking for the next big crypto , this could be it. Best Cryptos For 2025 Ethereum’s whale accumulation and XRP’s futures push show potential—but both rely on speculation and regulatory clarity. ETH needs to break $1,920 to reverse its trend, while XRP depends on CFTC approval and technical momentum. BlockDAG, however, has already delivered. Its beta testnet isn’t a demo—it’s a fully functioning platform, attracting real development. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 and already up 2,380% from its presale launch, it’s offering tangible value and unmatched upside. While ETH and XRP move on what could happen, BlockDAG is building what’s already happening. The numbers speak: $212 million raised, over 19.2 billion coins sold, and a working network before listings. In a market filled with narratives, BlockDAG offers a rare reality—utility, growth, and entry before mass adoption. For buyers deciding between momentum and infrastructure, the smart bet in 2025 may already be live.

42969950,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146772,1743904844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Dogecoin Whale Buys in, Pi Coin Cracks Below $0.60 But BlockDAG’s $212M Testnet Run May Outshine Both in 2025",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dogecoin-whale-buys-in-pi-coin-cracks-below-0-60-but-blockdags-212m-testnet-run-may-outshine-both-in-2025/,"Dogecoin is attempting to rebound after whales scooped up 220 million DOGE, hinting at renewed interest around the $0.16 level. Pi Coin, however, faces pressure from within—community criticism, a stalled ecosystem, and no exchange listings have dragged it down nearly 20% this week. It now teeters near $0.60, with little support unless sentiment shifts. But amid the noise, BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a different story. With a $212M presale haul, a live testnet already running, and a 2,380% price climb since Batch 1, BDAG is functioning where others are floundering. It’s not just attracting hype—it’s proving utility with EVM and WASM compatibility, over 100 testnet nodes, and major dev partnerships. In a landscape filled with speculation, BlockDAG is quietly laying the foundation of what could be 2025’s biggest altcoin success story. Dogecoin Whales Buy 220M DOGE—Is a Breakout Above $0.174 Next? Dogecoin is holding above $0.16 after a volatile week that saw prices swing between $0.179 and $0.156. The spike in volatility—reaching 86.3%—came after a sharp sell-off, pushing DOGE down to $0.155 before a slight recovery. Now trading near $0.168, the token is testing resistance around the 50% Fibonacci level. If it clears $0.174, bulls could target the $0.18 mark. On-chain data shows whale wallets bought 220 million DOGE in the past month—about $36 million—hinting at growing confidence despite short-term uncertainty. Key support lies between $0.158 and $0.160. If this zone holds, a V-shaped recovery could strengthen. Indicators like the RSI rising above 50 and weakening MACD bearishness add to that possibility. For long-term investors, this whale activity may suggest a hidden opportunity before any potential breakout, especially if Bitcoin supports broader recovery. Pi Coin Sinks 20%—Can It Break Free From the $0.60 Trap This April? Pi Coin has dropped sharply, falling below $0.70 with heavy selling pushing its price closer to $0.60. Trading volume has plunged 52% to $148 million, and the recent token unlock has added pressure. While the Pi Network promoted real-world use with PiFest, community feedback remains critical. Whale trades are rare, and ecosystem trading has stalled. Technical charts show a falling wedge pattern, with a possible breakout above $0.72 that could trigger a short-term move toward $0.75. However, many still doubt Pi’s future, citing poor communication from the team and lack of major exchange listings. Bybit’s founder even refused to list it, citing ongoing concerns. Despite this, some investors see Pi’s long-term potential, especially if Bitcoin recovers and Pi breaks resistance. Until then, Pi Coin remains a high-risk play stuck in a tight range, with key support at $0.60. BlockDAG’s 2,380% Surge and $212M Presale: Is This the Next $1 Crypto in 2025? BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about cryptos of 2025—and for good reason. Its Layer 1 design combines Proof-of-Work security with DAG architecture, allowing transactions to be processed simultaneously. This removes the bottlenecks seen in networks like Ethereum, making BlockDAG faster and more scalable. So far, the project has raised over $212 million in its presale, with more than 19.2 billion BDAG coins sold. Early investors who bought in at $0.001 are already sitting on gains of 2,380%, as the current price hits $0.0248. Analysts believe BDAG could touch $1 by year’s end, fueled by its successful beta testnet launch, upcoming exchange listings, and key partnerships with SpaceDev and HackerEarth. BlockDAG supports both EVM and WASM environments, giving developers the tools to build everything from DeFi protocols to AI dApps and NFT marketplaces. With a $30 million grant fund and over 100 testnet nodes live, its ecosystem is growing fast. In a market flooded with hype, BlockDAG is proving it’s more than a promise—it’s a functioning, fast-moving project. If you’re looking for the next big altcoin with real potential, BlockDAG might just be it. Takeaway Dogecoin’s whale-backed support and Pi Coin’s potential breakout from a falling wedge show signs of life—but both remain tied to uncertain narratives. DOGE relies on Bitcoin’s momentum to hold gains, while Pi Coin still struggles with a trust deficit and limited ecosystem usage. BlockDAG, meanwhile, has already cleared several hurdles. It isn’t promising testnets—it launched one. It’s not hinting at growth—it’s funding it with $30M in grants and onboarding developers now. The difference is clear: while DOGE and PI are waiting for momentum, BDAG is building it in real time. Analysts eye $1 targets based not on hype, but on working infrastructure, proven adoption, and clear deliverables.

What began as a playful experiment in 2013 morphed into a phenomenon, with early adopters reaping massive gains as its price soared to an all-time high of $0.6905 in May 2021. While those who missed Dogecoin’s meteoric rise might feel that the opportunity to turn a small investment into a fortune is lost, a new promising AI-powered crypto project currently in its presale phase is poised to offer a second chance at life-changing returns. With its innovative features and explosive growth potential, this new altcoin could be the ticket for those kicking themselves over missing Dogecoin’s golden days. The Dogecoin Rise, Fall, and Fading Momentum Dogecoin’s early days were nothing short of remarkable. Launched as a joke, it quickly gained traction, hitting its first all-time high of $0.00234 in January 2014 after a stunning climb from obscurity. While the initial bull run showcased Dogecoin’s potential, it wasn’t until the 2021 crypto frenzy, fueled by endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, that Dogecoin truly shone, surging to $0.6905. Following the 2021 rally, early investors who bought in at fractions of a cent saw gains exceeding 100,000%. However, today, the story has shifted. As of April 1, 2025, Dogecoin price sat at $0.1738, down 74.82% from its peak, despite an 8% uptick in 24 hours. Technical indicators paint a bearish picture, with most signaling “sell” and the price struggling below key exponential moving averages. Also, forecasts suggest a modest $1.13 by year-end 2025, with a long-term climb to $2.34 by 2030, which, though respectable, remains a far cry from the explosive momentum of its youth. For those dreaming of Dogecoin-level gains, its growth engine appears to be slowing, leaving latecomers searching for the next big thing. RCO Finance Presale Offers a Chance to Those Who Missed DOGE While Dogecoin’s early magic fades, RCO Finance emerges as a compelling alternative. Currently in its fifth presale stage, the RCOF token has already surged 684% from its initial price to $0.10, signaling the potential for further gains post-presale. The presale journey doesn’t stop there, though. The sixth presale stage will see the price rise to $0.13, before continuing to climb towards the final presale price of $0.2142 in the final round. Upon listing on exchanges, the team expected RCOF to debut at between $0.4 and $0.6, with the potential to explode past $1 within days. For context, a $1,000 investment in the early presale stages will have ballooned to $30,000 at listing, a 3,000% return reminiscent of Dogecoin’s heyday. Notably, as the presale comes to a close, the RCO Finance team has already launched a beta platform , attracting over 10,000 users, and is now refining its alpha version for an imminent release. Also, this presale isn’t just a token sale; it’s a gateway to a revolutionary ecosystem, offering a second chance for those who missed Dogecoin’s initial surge. With a deflationary model burning unsold tokens and a smart contract audited by SolidProof , RCO Finance’s foundation is built for stability and growth. Why RCO Finance Could Outshine Dogecoin’s Legacy Besides its ongoing token presale, what sets RCO Finance apart is its cutting-edge features, blending AI innovation with user-centric design. At its core is the AI-powered Robo Advisor, a game-changer that crafts personalized investment strategies based on real-time market data, user goals, and risk tolerance. Imagine using the Robo Advisor to spot the next trending altcoins like Compound (COMP), which has soared by almost 100% following its listing on Upbit , or to dodge losses with precise buy and sell signals. Unlike Dogecoin, which thrives on hype, RCO Finance offers utility across over 120,000 assets, from stocks and ETFs to tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and cryptocurrencies, all tradable with up to 1,000x leverage. Also, its KYC-free ecosystem prioritizes privacy, slashing onboarding hassles and appealing to DeFi enthusiasts. Post-alpha platform launch, analysts predict the RCOF token could skyrocket past $10 within months, driven by its real-world asset tokenization and community governance via RCOF tokens. Notably, RCOF isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a sophisticated platform poised to redefine retail investing, potentially eclipsing Dogecoin’s legacy with tangible value. As Dogecoin’s growth slows, RCO Finance (RCOF) stands ready to capture the imagination of investors seeking that elusive second chance. For those who missed Dogecoin’s early days, RCO Finance could be the key to rewriting the script, turning regret into riches in 2025 and beyond.

The new token, ‘REAL,’ was only launched through an auction to prevent snipers and bots from taking over the launch. The asset was also developed closely by Real World Gaming decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and will provide staking incentives and governance rights for its holders. McGregor assures users that his new token will change the crypto ecosystem McGregor defended the token’s release, claiming this isn’t your ordinary celebrity-backed meme-coin. He tried to assure users that assets will bring real change to the crypto industry and the world. In an X post on April 5, he commented, ‘I changed the FIGHT game. I changed the WHISKEY game. I changed the STOUT game. Now it’s time to change the CRYPTO game. This is just the beginning.” Speaking in an interview, the MMA champion also insisted that the REAL token is centered on transparency and that they are demonstrating how it’s done with integrity to the world. According to the project’s tokenomics, the DAO treasury will get 31.5% of the token supply while the community will receive almost 17%. Meanwhile, the developer team and advisors will each get 10% and 1%, respectively. Moreover, the token’s whitepaper reveals that holders who pour in large investments and participate regularly in staking will earn higher status and possibly more revenue shares. Additionally, the token aims to redefine the gambling industry by aligning it more closely with real-life experiences and mainstream consumers — indicating that McGregor and his team intend to channel the funds into launching ventures tied to sports and gaming. Nicolai Sondergaard believes meme coin traders could easily leave their positions for quick gains The perception around meme coins has not changed much, despite Donald Trump and his family introducing new tokens to the market. According to Nansen research analyst Nicolai Sondergaard, “smart money” traders are still seeking meme coin trades but are just as likely to sell their assets for quick profits. Sondergaard believes the rise in meme coin activity at the moment is due to traders trying out the market as they wait for the overall macroeconomic environment to settle. Trump’s new reciprocal tariffs have made it even more challenging for stock markets to thrive, forcing investors to look into other projects like meme coins. US stocks have already lost more than $5 trillion in value just two days after Trump announced his tariffs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

It’s the worst. Some people watched Bitcoin explode past $60,000 from just a few dollars. Others saw Ethereum climb from under $1 to thousands. Now, Cosmos and Bitcoin Cash are making serious moves, grabbing attention with their latest developments. But while these two giants are evolving, a new name—Qubetics—is stepping into the spotlight, aiming to solve real-world problems that no other blockchain has tackled efficiently. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another token; it’s the first-ever Web3 aggregator uniting leading blockchains into one seamless ecosystem. Unlike Cosmos, which focuses on interoperability between blockchains, and Bitcoin Cash, which aims for faster transactions, Qubetics goes beyond by integrating next-level decentralization solutions. Its Decentralized VPN (dVPN) is already proving how blockchain can revolutionize digital privacy. As one of the top rated crypto projects gaining serious momentum, Qubetics is setting a new standard for security and interoperability. The kicker? The Qubetics presale is already raising millions, and early buyers are in before the next price jump. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN: A New Era for Digital Privacy Internet privacy is a joke these days. Big tech tracks every click, government surveillance is at an all-time high, and traditional VPNs? They promise security but still operate on centralized servers, making them vulnerable. This is exactly where Qubetics steps in with its game-changing Decentralized VPN (dVPN), offering true anonymity and security through blockchain technology. Unlike conventional VPNs that depend on single control points, Qubetics’ dVPN runs on a fully decentralized peer-to-peer network. That means no single entity can track, monitor, or restrict online activity. Whether it’s an activist in a censorship-heavy country, a journalist protecting sources, or a business securing sensitive data, Qubetics’ dVPN ensures total online freedom. For businesses, especially those handling confidential client information, Qubetics provides an edge. Imagine a law firm dealing with high-profile cases. Traditional VPNs still leave data at risk, but with Qubetics’ dVPN, secure multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption make data leaks practically impossible. As one of the top rated crypto projects focusing on privacy and security, Qubetics is redefining how sensitive data is protected in the digital age. Similarly, financial institutions needing airtight security can integrate dVPN for truly anonymous and untraceable transactions, reducing fraud risks. Even for everyday users, the benefits are massive. Picture a remote worker accessing company files from a public WiFi network. With traditional VPNs, there’s still a chance of data exposure if the provider’s servers get compromised. Qubetics eliminates that risk by ensuring data never flows through a centralized server, making it impossible to trace or exploit. The best part? Users don’t need technical expertise—just plug into the Qubetics ecosystem, and they’re good to go. Qubetics Presale: The Most Anticipated Top Rated Crypto Investment Opportunity Qubetics isn’t just about innovation—it’s also about wealth-building opportunities. Community members who get in early are locking in one of the most promising presales of the year. Right now, Qubetics presale is in its 28th stage, with each $TICS token priced at $0.1430. Over $15.8 million has already been raised, and with more than 24,300 token holders securing their positions, over 506 million $TICS tokens have been sold. Unlike most projects where presales drag on forever, Qubetics has a clear system—each presale stage lasts only 7 days, ending every Sunday at 12 AM, followed by a 10% price increase. This means anyone getting in now will have a direct advantage over those who wait even a week. Plus, with the Qubetics mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, this isn’t just speculation—real adoption is on the horizon. For those wondering about potential gains, the numbers speak for themselves. But let’s talk real numbers—what happens if Qubetics follows the trajectory of other successful projects? If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, that’s a 599.21% return. At $5, it’s a jaw-dropping 3,396.06% ROI. And for those thinking long-term, if $TICS reaches $10 after the mainnet launch, that’s a 6,892.12% return. Even a conservative investment of $1,000 today could potentially turn into $69,000 at this rate. With the best crypto presale rapidly gaining traction, those who act fast could be looking at one of the highest return opportunities in 2025. As Qubetics continues to revolutionize blockchain utility with real-world applications, it’s positioning itself as a top rated crypto that could deliver massive gains for early adopters. Cosmos: The Future of Blockchain Interoperability While Qubetics is setting the stage for Web3 aggregation, Cosmos is still one of the leading names in blockchain interoperability. The project’s main selling point is its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which allows different blockchains to talk to each other seamlessly. Recently, Cosmos has been making waves with new upgrades that aim to enhance security and efficiency across its network. The biggest update revolves around the ATOM 2.0 proposal, which introduces improved staking mechanisms and better economic incentives for validators. This could significantly impact how staking rewards work, making Cosmos even more appealing for those looking to earn passive income through crypto. Another major milestone is Cosmos’ increasing integration with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Developers are now able to build cross-chain applications with ease, making Cosmos a key player in the expanding multi-chain future. Given how interoperability is shaping the next generation of blockchain, Cosmos remains a project worth watching closely. Bitcoin Cash: Fast, Scalable, and Ready for Adoption Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was born out of a simple idea—make Bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. And it’s been doing just that. With its larger block size compared to Bitcoin, transactions are quicker and cost a fraction of what BTC transactions do. In recent months, Bitcoin Cash has been pushing adoption harder than ever. Several major retailers and payment platforms have started accepting BCH, making it a practical currency for real-world transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, which is often seen as digital gold, BCH is positioning itself as digital cash—a cryptocurrency designed to be spent, not just held. There’s also been major progress on the SmartBCH network, which allows developers to create smart contracts on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. This gives BCH more utility beyond just payments, opening doors for DeFi applications, NFTs, and even Web3 gaming. With crypto adoption increasing worldwide, Bitcoin Cash’s focus on usability could help it maintain strong relevance in the coming years. Conclusion: Which Top Rated Crypto Will Lead the Next Bull Run? Qubetics, Cosmos, and Bitcoin Cash each bring something unique to the table. Cosmos is ensuring that different blockchains can work together seamlessly, making it a strong contender for long-term infrastructure development. Bitcoin Cash continues to solidify itself as a true digital currency, offering fast, low-cost transactions with increasing real-world adoption. But among these three, Qubetics is the one changing the game entirely—with its Decentralized VPN, interoperability, and an ongoing Qubetics presale that’s already attracting thousands of early buyers. With its mainnet launch set for Q2 2025 and the chance to join this crypto presale before the next price increase, those looking for the next top rated crypto to ride into the future might not need to look any further.

BofA customer Brandon Wilson was leaving a bar in Chicago on Labor Day in September of 2024 when he was accosted by thugs, reports ABC 7 Chicago. “As I was waiting for my Uber outside, a group of people surrounded me. They threatened me. They asked me to empty my wallet, to give them my phone, to unlock my phone… I was beyond terrified. I followed what they said, because I thought I was going to have my life taken from me.” After getting home and finding $4,446 had been transferred out of his Bank of America account via multiple Zelle transactions, Wilson called the trillion-dollar lender and reported the fraudulent activity. Bank of America temporarily credited his account and Wilson assumed that would be the end of it. “At that point I thought I was good.” The week after, however, Bank of America sent Wilson a letter claiming he had authorized or permitted the transactions. “Brandon, we’re unable to approve your recent claim. The charge was authorized by you or made by someone who has permission to use the card or account.” Wilson, who has been with Bank of America since he was 14, submitted another fraud claim but the trillion-dollar lender again rejected his claim. After ABC 7 Chicago reached out to Bank of America, a spokesperson for second-largest bank in the US after JPMorgan Chase said the case would be reviewed. Wilson is now hoping Bank of America will reimburse him. “It’s clear as day that I didn’t make these charges.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

ADA maintains its position as one of the high-capitalized altcoins through trading at $0.6501 on April 5, 2025 despite recent periods of decreased market speculation. Technical indicators indicate ADA maintains support among the price range of $0.635 to $0.682 before analysts predict a breakout opportunity at $0.69. A successful market surge over $0.69 would lift ADA to a price range above $0.80 to $0.85 whereas a downward movement below $0.635 could trigger an ADA decline to test the $0.45 support level. The technical framework of ADA has gained support from ongoing projects which target additional ADA applications. Cardano has created excitement in developer circles because its developers plan an implementation of Bitcoin connectivity through sidechain architecture. The proposed idea seeks to enable Bitcoin digital assets to cross between networks by using Cardano infrastructure while upholding decentralized operations. Such successful implementation of innovative features will contribute to ADA’s development as a high-assurance platform for smart contracts and institutional applications, which it initiated at its start. XRP Holds Ground While Waiting for Momentum XRP maintains uncertain investor perceptions as it persists in its current trading area of $2.09 to $2.17. XRP maintains its position between $2.09 and $2.17 in the current market, while trading near $2.14. The token has failed to leverage the 2024 SEC resolution that defined XRP as non-security, despite the long-awaited decision being reached. The initial price rally of XRP after the ruling shows limited continued momentum in the market. Analysts now find themselves split. Some XRP analysts support a price rise toward $2.80 to $3.00 during the mid-year period because they believe institutions will increase demand as Ripple expands its banking operations into African markets and Latin America. The pessimistic view maintains that XRP faces risks because of market volatility and the weak interest from retail investors. The analysts believe XRP’s price might fall down to $1.90 and below if critical support points break. Remittix Emerges as a Utility-Driven Disruptor The clear consumer-friendly model of Remittix (RTX) attracts investors since it differs from Cardano’s infrastructure-first approach and XRP’s institutional focus. Through Remittix users can perform instant cryptocurrency-to-fiat conversions while their funds get automatically deposited into any worldwide supported bank account. RTX stands out as a special token that integrates blockchain innovation together with immediate practical application due to its capability to enable fast money transfers across borders. Remittix gives people from areas with steep remittance fees and limited bank access a suitable and relatively inexpensive option to send money internationally. The token RTX exists during its pre-sale period with current market value at $0.0734. The RTX project successfully acquired over $14.3 million from its market sales while distributing 526 million tokens to investors. The increasing numbers demonstrate both market curiosity and strengthening belief that the platform will survive in the long run. Remittix earns standing among 2025 projects set for fifty-times or higher returns according to analysts provided that adoption reaches extensive markets like Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. Utility, Timing, and Long-Term Vision The crypto market displays a key difference which becomes evident through current conditions. Cardano maintains its focus on technical advancements while needing to achieve greater user popularity from this technology. XRP fights against depleted investor interest because of its recent legal breakthroughs and institutional relationship developments. The market demonstrates interest in agile products when companies like Remittix present simple usage solutions together with an optimized structure. The evolution of Cardano news and XRP stability indicates that Remittix and similar tokens signify an upcoming crypto timeline focused on resolving problems instead of speculative investments.

With 2025 shaping up to be the ultimate year for explosive crypto growth, investors are hunting for the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Whether it’s the next Shiba Inu, a doge-inspired sensation, or an entirely fresh narrative-driven phenomenon, meme coins are more than just internet jokes—they’re wealth-building opportunities. Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the charge, bringing an epic adventure to the blockchain. Unlike typical meme coins, this one tells a legendary story of exploration, myth, and hidden treasures. Alongside it, Meme Coin and Bonk are also making serious moves, drawing in massive investor interest with their unique value propositions. For those looking to turn a small investment into an enormous payday, now’s the time to jump in. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Mystical Journey to Uncharted Wealth Deep in the icy frontiers of the unknown, Arctic Pablo Coin embarks on a mission unlike anything seen in crypto before. He’s not just another meme—he’s a legend in the making, traveling across mystical frozen lands to unearth the secrets of $APC, a coin imbued with the magic of the Arctic. Every presale phase unlocks a new chapter in Pablo’s journey, revealing hidden locations where wealth and adventure await. Arctic Pablo Coin is revolutionizing crypto investing by turning it into an exhilarating journey. While others follow trends, Pablo is charting his own course—one mystical location at a time. Now at its 17th destination, Glacial Glade, the project has already raised over $2 million, with its current price at just $0.000087. At this stage of Pablo’s location-based presale, a $500 investment grants 5,747,125 APCs. When $APC reaches its launch price of $0.008, that investment skyrockets to $45,977. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin even more irresistible is its burn mechanism. Unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation weekly, ensuring scarcity and increasing value over time. Plus, with a 66% APY staking program, those who stake their coins will see their holdings multiply. Arctic Pablo isn’t just a meme coin—it’s an entire adventure wrapped in a financial powerhouse. It is one of the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Meme Coin: The King of Chaos and Profit Meme Coin is living up to its name, embodying the wild, unpredictable energy that makes meme coins some of the most thrilling investments in the crypto space. Riding the waves of internet culture, Meme Coin taps into virality, ensuring that it stays at the center of every meme-based discussion in the crypto world. Unlike projects that fizzle out, Meme Coin constantly evolves, keeping investors engaged and the market intrigued. But it’s not just hype driving this token—it’s utility and liquidity. Meme Coin’s deflationary tokenomics include scheduled burns and strategic liquidity injections, making it a meme coin that holds weight in the long run. Investors are witnessing parabolic growth, with some projections estimating a 3000% surge before the end of the year. This isn’t just another dog-themed clone—it’s a movement powered by the internet’s most potent force: humor. Bonk: Solana’s Meme Coin Titan with Unmatched Potential Bonk is rewriting the rules of meme coin dominance, proving that Solana isn’t just for DeFi—it’s a breeding ground for high-flying meme coins. Bonk exploded onto the scene as Solana’s answer to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, quickly becoming the network’s top community-driven meme token. But Bonk’s unique integration with Solana’s ecosystem sets it apart, offering more than just speculative gains. Bonk’s liquidity pools and decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations provide yet another edge. Investors can stake, farm, and lend Bonk, opening up multiple revenue streams beyond simple price appreciation. With major Solana projects integrating Bonk as a native payment token, demand is skyrocketing, and analysts predict that a 2000% increase is well within reach. As Solana gains more traction in 2025, Bonk is poised to be one of the biggest meme coin success stories of the year.

Sacks has been vocal about the AI race since taking on his role following US President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 . Just over a week into the job, Sacks said he is “confident in the US, but we can’t be complacent.” Llama 4 “best in their class for multimodality,” says Meta Sack’s latest comment came after Meta’s AI division said in an X post on the same day that it is introducing the fourth generation of its Llama models, Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick. Source: David Sacks “Our most advanced models yet and the best in their class for multimodality,” Meta said. Meta said its Llama 4 Scout model has 17 billion active parameters and uses 16 experts. The company claims it outperforms rival large language models — Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-lite, and Mistral 3.1 — “across a broad range of widely accepted benchmarks.” Meanwhile, Llama 4 Maverick also has 17 billion active parameters but is configured with 128 experts. Meta claimed the Maverick model can outperform GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash “across a broad range of widely accepted benchmarks.” Llama 4 Maverick instruction-tuned benchmarks.

At the time, Meta said it was “blown away” by the demand, receiving over 100,000 requests for access.

The announcement was made via the game’s official X account. It cited Base’s inability to handle transaction volume during the game’s launch and broader concerns about the scalability of EVM-based chains. Infected Ditches Ethereum’s Layer 2 for Solana “Infected crashed Base,” the team stated , referencing the game’s launch, which attracted 130,000 sign-ups within 48 hours. The sudden demand led to a spike in gas prices and failed transactions, especially in the first 30 minutes. This issue, according to the developers, significantly impacted the game’s momentum and user experience. Describing the incident, they noted that many users were unable to participate and subsequently abandoned the game, which runs on a 7-day cycle reliant on real-time interaction. While the developers acknowledged that the issue was not unique to Base, they framed it as part of a larger, ongoing limitation across all EVM-compatible chains. Despite previously believing Layer 2 solutions were the future of Ethereum scalability, the team said that it now views these bottlenecks as structural and unresolved in the near term. The shift to Solana was also driven by what the team identified as two key advantages: culture and user base. They drew a contrast between Ethereum’s technically advanced but builder-focused ecosystem and Solana’s more user-oriented approach. According to the post, Solana’s developer community is more closely aligned with current consumer behavior, as seen in the success of other Solana-native applications such as Pump.fun and DAOs.fun. Additionally, user feedback played a role in the decision. The Infected team said many players requested a version of the game built on Solana to avoid the need to bridge assets. The post read, “If they are on XRP, we’d go to XRP. If that was Bitcoin mainnet, we’d go there. But today’s users are on Solana.” The team also highlighted that their future games will also launch on Solana, aligning with what they see as the best available infrastructure for high-volume, consumer-facing applications. Response Head of Base and Coinbase Wallet Jesse Pollak responded to Infected’s announcement, saying that while he respected teams building on any platform, he felt compelled to clarify what he described as factual inaccuracies. “Base did not crash – the chain hummed along, just as it should.” He wrote that the technical issues experienced during Infected’s launch were related to frontend problems, which the game’s team had previously acknowledged and discussed with Base. The Infected team, however, denied this claim. Meanwhile, Pollak added that the team behind the Coinbase-incubated network had reached out to Infected immediately after their migration announcement, but had not received a response.

Among these advancements, tokenization stands out as a game-changer, poised to revolutionize asset ownership, investment accessibility and global liquidity. But how exactly is tokenization reshaping the financial markets, and what does the future hold for investors? Let’s explore. Understanding tokenization in finance Tokenization refers to the process of converting RWAs (real-world assets) – such as real estate, stocks, commodities or even fine art – into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent fractional ownership of an asset, allowing for secure, transparent and efficient trading without the need for traditional intermediaries. This concept is not entirely new, but recent advancements in blockchain infrastructure have made tokenized assets more viable than ever. The key benefits include the following. Increased liquidity – Tokenized assets can be traded 24/7, providing liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets like real estate. Fractional ownership – Investors can own a portion of high-value assets, lowering entry barriers and democratizing investment opportunities. Security and transparency – Blockchain ensures that transactions are immutable, reducing fraud and enhancing investor confidence. Faster settlement times – Traditional financial settlements can take days, whereas blockchain-based transactions are nearly instantaneous. Industries leading the tokenization movement Tokenization is disrupting multiple industries, from real estate to fine art and beyond. Here are some notable examples. 1. Real Estate Property tokenization allows investors to purchase fractional ownership in high-value real estate properties. Companies like RealT and Lofty AI are already leveraging blockchain to make real estate investment more accessible. 2. Stock markets Stock exchanges are exploring tokenized securities, which could enable global 24/7 trading without intermediaries. For instance, the Swiss SDX (SIX Digital Exchange) has introduced tokenized bonds and equities. 3. Commodities and precious metals Gold-backed tokens – such as Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT) – provide a digital alternative to physical gold investments with seamless global trading. 4. Alternative assets – Art, collectibles and IP rights Platforms like Masterworks enable investors to own shares of high-value artwork, turning exclusive assets into tradable digital securities. Challenges and regulatory landscape Despite its advantages, tokenization still faces regulatory hurdles. Financial authorities worldwide are grappling with how to classify and oversee tokenized assets. Will they be treated as securities? How will taxation and investor protections evolve? The answers will shape the trajectory of this revolutionary technology. The future of tokenized finance As institutional investors warm up to digital assets, tokenization is likely to become a mainstream financial instrument. In the coming years, we can expect the following. More government-backed tokenized assets – e.g., CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) Integration with traditional finance – hybrid models combining blockchain and conventional banking Wider adoption in emerging markets, where access to traditional banking is limited Conclusion – Are we ready for the tokenized economy Tokenization is no longer a futuristic concept – it’s happening now. The next decade will likely see a profound shift toward digitized financial systems, with blockchain at the core. Investors, institutions and regulators must collaborate to ensure a secure, scalable and inclusive financial ecosystem.

Bitcoin is near its record highs, and fresh altcoins are gaining traction. With this shift, many are now asking—what are the best-performing cryptos to watch today? While long-standing names like Bitcoin and Cardano stay central to the blockchain space, a newer Layer 1 chain is making noise—BlockDAG. With parallel processing power, no congestion issues, and already crossing $211.5 million in presale funds, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a major name in crypto’s future. Here’s a breakdown of the 6 best-performing cryptos in 2025—featuring both trusted names and powerful new players. BlockDAG (BDAG): Presale Gem with Huge Growth Ahead BlockDAG (BDAG) has gained serious attention lately due to more than just its strong presale performance. After bringing in $211.5 million and selling over 19.1 billion BDAG coins across 27 batches, it’s getting picked up quickly by large-scale holders. The current BDAG price sits at $0.0248, with forecasts suggesting a 2,380% increase once exchange listings go live. Its strong architecture makes it stand out. BlockDAG’s system is based on DAG tech, which enables it to process thousands of transactions each second, surpassing older blockchain systems in speed. This tech foundation makes it ideal for powering everything from DeFi apps to wide-scale decentralized services. During Keynote 3, one highlight was BlockDAG’s aim to onboard over 1,000 decentralized apps by 2026. These will cover real-use cases such as payments, NFTs, and AI-powered tools. Additionally, its Token & NFT Wizard makes it simple for people to build projects without needing expert-level coding. BlockDAG has already rolled out a beta version of its Testnet. With more than 100 active nodes and a growing mining network using the X1 app and mining hardware like X30 and X100, BlockDAG is shaping an entire system—not just a coin. Solana (SOL): Fast Execution and Developer-Driven Solana continues to be known for its speed and low cost. Over 400 active dApps are currently running on it, covering everything from DeFi to meme coins in 2025. The network’s focus on high performance makes it a major choice for developers. Recent capital raised for projects on Solana has exceeded $170 million. The network is also pushing harder toward decentralization. While Ethereum faces delays and traffic issues, Solana is becoming the go-to option, making SOL one of the best-performing cryptos right now. Ripple (XRP): Bridging Global Payments XRP’s role in making global transfers faster remains strong, thanks to multiple payment service deals. Major financial players like Unicâmbio are already using Ripple’s technology, helping XRP grow into a link between traditional banks and blockchain tech. Large holders have picked up over 1 billion XRP recently. With the legal case with the SEC close to final steps and real-use expanding, XRP is among the top altcoins that might rise in 2025. Bonk (BONK): More Than Just a Meme Coin Bonk is different from other meme tokens—it brings utility to the Solana chain. The community behind it has burned a portion of tokens, built NFT links, and added BONK to real-use payment tools. Its rise continues as it’s adopted across Solana-based DeFi platforms and staking services. For those open to fun but useful cryptos, Bonk combines both with promising growth potential. Cardano (ADA): Expanding Decentralization Cardano is progressing toward full on-chain control. The upcoming Plomin fork will allow ADA users to vote directly on upgrades, building a truly self-managed blockchain. With plans to allow Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano and make ADA a usable fee currency, the project is expanding beyond early expectations. The possible approval of a Cardano ETF might also bring in more attention and liquidity. Bitcoin (BTC): Still the Foundation Even with price changes, Bitcoin holds its role as a reliable digital store of value. With only 21 million coins ever to be created and more big institutions holding BTC, its position stays strong. The growing use of the Lightning Network and expanding use in daily life help Bitcoin reach beyond its original purpose. For people looking for a more stable crypto, BTC remains one of the best-performing cryptos in 2025. Wrapping Up— 2025’s Best Performing Cryptos! Bitcoin and Cardano still act as key parts of the blockchain space, while Solana and XRP push new tech forward. But BlockDAG is being seen as the future leader among the best-performing cryptos. With a goal to support 1,000+ decentralized apps, tools made for easier creation, and a functioning mining system already out, BlockDAG isn’t waiting for the future—it’s already setting it up. For anyone looking to join early, BDAG is among the best-performing cryptos to keep an eye on now.

The token peaked at $0.7940 on Saturday, up sharply from the year-to-date low of $0.4023. Still, it remains sharply lower than the all-time high of near $3. Why Pi Network price crashed There are a few reasons why the Pi Network price plunged after its highly anticipated mainnet launch in February. First, the crash mirrored that of other recently launched tokens. For example, a token like Grass, jumped initially and then retreated and has never recovered. The same is true with other tokens like Wormhole, Hamster Kombat, and ZkSync. Second, the Pi Network mainnet launch coincided with a difficult period in the market when most tokens were crashing. Bitcoin has remained below $90,000, down sharply from the all-time high of $109,200. Other tokens like Berachain, Polkadot, and Solana have done worse. Third, the Pi Network price crashed as investors reacted to its relatively weak ecosystem. The idea behind Pi was that it would have a highly vibrant ecosystem of applications that will promote commerce, gaming, and other areas. Applications in the network have not done well since then. A good example of this is the recently launched Pi domains, which the developers are auctioning. Pi holders have placed 110,840 bids currently worth $1.84 million. While this is a good number, it means that only a tiny number of pioneers have placed their bid. Pi had over 10 million pioneers during its mainnet launch. Read more: Pi Network price prediction: is it safe to buy the Pi coin dip? Exchange listings, pioneer sales, and dilution There are other reasons why the Pi Network price has imploded. For one, many mainstream exchanges have refused to list it, with some, like Bybit, arguing that it was a scam. Pi’s developers have rejected these claims, and pointed to the network’s transparency. A Pi Network exchange listing by companies like Binance, Coinbase, and Upbit would help to push its price much higher than it is today. Further, there are substantial concerns about its dilution, which are caused by its token unlocks. Over 1.55 billion Pi tokens are expected to be unlocked in the next 12 months, with more billions set for the following years. Pi can allay these fears by simply burning most of its tokens. That’s because the Pi Foundation currently holds over 73 billion tokens with a diluted value of $47 billion, meaning that it can afford to buy some of them. Finally, the Pi Network token crashed as many pioneers who were mining the token for years sold their allocations after the mainnet launch. Pi Network price technical analysis PI token price chart | Source: TradingView The Pi coin price will likely have a sustained recovery in the next few days. That’s because its recent crash happened as it was forming a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. The two-hour chart above shows that the token formed two descending and converging trendlines. Its rebound happened when the two lines neared their confluence levels. Pi coin also formed a bullish divergence pattern, which happens when an asset is dropping as some of its top oscillators rise. Therefore, the token will likely keep rising as bulls target the important psychological point at $1. Such a move would point to a 72% increase from the current level. A drop below last week’s low of $0.4142 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

At the center of attention are Bitcoin, ADA, XRP, and MAGACOINFINANCE, all commanding growing commitment from holders who see 2025 as the year for breakout momentum. Powerhouses like ETH, LINK, and BCH remain crucial to the ecosystem, continuing to power applications and support long-term growth strategies. CLICK HERE TO JOIN THE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT MAGACOINFINANCE – Clean Structure, Real Momentum MAGACOINFINANCE has passed $5.3 million raised and is now entering its final offering stage.

What’s making it even more attractive is timing. Early investors are already seeing returns from pre-listing stages, and wallet activity has grown significantly across key platforms. Its simple distribution model and steady rise in visibility have drawn comparisons to early-phase tokens that went on to become household names in crypto.

Bitcoin (BTC) price held the $83K level with no major gains in the past seven days. Whereas, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP prices mimicked a sluggish action. Notably, the latest announcement by Donald Trump about reciprocal tariffs has rattled global markets, with even risk assets encountering some macro heat. Mentioned below are some of the top market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Crypto Market Faces Macroeconomic Pressure This week saw a couple of concerning macro developments that sparked a cautious sentiment among traders and investors. CoinGape reported that the manufacturing PMI and JOLTS data came in weaker than expected this week. The March PMI data dropped to 49, below expectations of 49.5 and lower than the 50 recorded in February. Also, the U.S. JOLTS job openings for February stood at 7.568 million, coming short of the expected 7.690 million and lower than the 7.762 million recorded in January. This macro data pointed toward a bearish outlook for the broader market. In turn, even the crypto market saw a stalled movement, with Bitcoin & Ether prices negating any major gains over the past seven days. In addition, Donald Trump’s Liberation Day , which is the tagline for his proposed reciprocal tariffs on other countries, has added to the pressure on broader markets. Bitcoin, Ether, & Other Coin Prices Over The Week BTC price witnessed a marginal 0.5% jump in the past seven days and closed in at the $83K level. In the past 7 days, the flagship crypto stooped as low as $81K whilst also touching a $87K high. ETH price saw a drop of nearly 2% weekly and exchanged hands at the $1,800 level. Ethereum hit a bottom of $1,700 whilst also nearing a high of $2,000 this week SOL price fell by roughly 5% over the week to reach $120. The crypto’s weekly high and low was $135 and $112, respectively. XRP price mimicked the broader crypto market trend, dipping over 2% in seven days to $2.13.

""One would have to imagine that President Donald Trump's phone has been ringing off the hook. The practical reality is that there is insufficient time for him to make deals before the tariffs are scheduled to take effect,"" Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, said in an April 5 X post. Trump may postpone tariffs to make more deals, says Ackman ""I would, therefore, not be surprised to wake up Monday with an announcement from the President that he was postponing the implementation of the tariffs to give him time to make deals,"" Ackman added. On April 2, Trump signed an executive order establishing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from all countries, which took effect on April 5. Harsher reciprocal tariffs on trading partners with which the US has the largest trade deficits are scheduled to kick in on April 9. Ackman — who famously said ""crypto is here to stay"" after the FTX collapse in November 2022 — said Trump captured the attention of the world and US trading partners, backing the tariffs as necessary after what he called an ""unfair tariff regime"" that hurt US workers and economy ""over many decades."" Following Trump’s announcement on April 2, the US stock market shed more value during the April 4 trading session than the entire crypto market is currently worth. The fact that crypto held up better than the US stock market caught the attention of both crypto industry supporters and skeptics. Source: Cameron Winklevoss Prominent crypto voices such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss also recently showed their support for Trump's tariffs.

He added: ""The risk of not doing so is that the massive increase in uncertainty drives the economy into a recession, potentially a severe one."" Ackman said April 7 will be ""one of the more interesting days"" in US economic history.

42977583,https://invezz.com/?p=2656016,1743918300,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"You missed Solana (SOL) at $2, don’t miss Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.025",https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/06/you-missed-solana-sol-at-2-dont-miss-mutuum-finance-mutm-at-0-025/,"Everyone in crypto has a story about the one that got away. For many, Solana (SOL) is at the top of that list. The token traded at just $2 in its early days before exploding in value and earning a place among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap. Those who bought in early didn’t just make profits—they changed their financial future. Fast forward to 2025, and another token is quietly setting the stage for what some believe could be the next big move. That token is MUTM, the native asset of Mutuum Finance, and it’s currently priced at just $0.025. Back when Solana was trading at $2, it was still a relatively unknown name in a crowded market. It offered faster transaction speeds and lower fees than Ethereum, and early investors saw the potential in its tech long before it gained mainstream recognition. What followed was a massive surge that took SOL from $2 to well over $200 at its peak—proving that early exposure to the right project can be life-changing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Now, Mutuum Finance is presenting a similar early-stage opportunity, but with a different focus. Rather than building another blockchain layer, Mutuum is designing a decentralized ecosystem for borrowing and lending crypto. What sets it apart is how it structures participation. The protocol allows users to deposit assets and earn yield, or to lock up assets as collateral to access liquidity—without needing to sell their holdings. The process is handled through smart contracts, which are transparent and fully on-chain. When users deposit funds, they receive mtTokens, which reflect their share of the liquidity plus the interest it earns over time. These tokens grow in value the longer they’re held, allowing users to benefit from passive income without needing to constantly manage their positions. It’s a clean, efficient system that gives users full control while removing the need for intermediaries. Another important component is Mutuum’s overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this one is backed entirely by crypto assets held within the protocol. It’s minted when users lock up collateral and burned when loans are repaid. This approach keeps supply balanced and ensures the stablecoin remains rooted in on-chain activity. It also contributes to Mutuum’s revenue, as interest paid on these stablecoin loans flows directly into the protocol rather than to third-party liquidity pools. So why is there growing interest in MUTM right now? The answer lies in the presale. MUTM is currently being offered at $0.025, with over $6 million raised and a rapidly growing holder base that has already surpassed 7,750 wallets. The token will launch at $0.06, meaning early buyers are already in line for more than 2x gains before trading even begins. But for many, it’s not just about launch day—it’s about what happens after. Analysts watching the project are pointing to its utility-driven design, sustainable reward structure, and low starting market cap as key reasons why the price could climb significantly post-launch. Based on early interest and the strength of its economic model, many believe that MUTM is well-positioned to follow a growth trajectory similar to Solana’s early surge—especially as adoption increases and on-chain activity expands across the protocol. The key takeaway? Solana’s $2 days are gone. But right now, MUTM is sitting in that early phase where the fundamentals are in place, the price is still low, and the wider market hasn’t fully caught on yet. For those who missed out on SOL and are searching for the next high-upside opportunity in crypto, this might be the moment to pay closer attention.

Despite fluctuations, the overarching bearish sentiment continues. Short-Term Bullish Bounce? According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, here’s a short-term bullish divergence showing up. This has led to a bit of a relief rally, which is pretty common when this kind of divergence pops up. It’s happened before over the last few months, so it’s nothing new. What’s Likely to Happen Next? Considering the current support levels and the new bullish divergence, XRP is probably going to see a small bounce or some sideways price action in the coming days—maybe for about a week. It’s the same kind of movement that’s been seen before when similar patterns appeared. Will the U.S. Stock Market Influence XRP? A lot of eyes are on the U.S. stock market, especially with Monday’s opening. If the markets keep dropping, that could spill over into crypto, putting some bearish pressure on XRP. But if the stock market finds a bottom and bounces back, it could give XRP a little more breathing room for that short-term relief. Resistance Levels to Watch In the near term, XRP’s facing some tough resistance between $2.24 and $2.30—exactly where it’s been rejected before. If it manages to break above $230, the next hurdles are at $2.48, $2.56, and then between $2.65 and $2.80. The Day Ahead For the next day or so, the expectation is for XRP to keep that relief going or move sideways. No major bearish moves are expected right now, so the short-term outlook is slightly positive—but nothing too dramatic.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-06 05:46:22

Trader who made $10M on Dogecoin Betting Big on These 3 Low-Cap Meme Cryptos Before June!,https://timestabloid.com/from-10-to-1-million-trader-who-made-10m-on-dogecoin-betting/,"A trader who transformed $10 into an astounding $10 million with Dogecoin is now backing three lesser-known meme cryptocurrencies. These low-cap coins are catching attention as potential hidden gems before June. Could they be the next breakout stars in the crypto market? The investment world watches to see if history will repeat itself. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges FLOKI Unleashed: From Meme Coin to Real-World Impact It all started with a tweet from Elon Musk in June 2021. He announced his pet Shiba Inu would be named “Floki,” sparking the creation of the Floki Inu coin. But this coin is more than just a meme. Now known simply as FLOKI, it aims to make a difference in the real world. FLOKI is building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria, showing that a cryptocurrency can have a heart. FLOKI offers more than charity. It has its own NFT metaverse game called Valhalla and a DeFi service named FlokiFi. These projects give FLOKI real utility within and beyond its ecosystem. Partnerships like the one with NOWPayments and the introduction of the prepaid Floki Card mean you can use FLOKI tokens for everyday purchases. In a market crowded with meme coins, FLOKI aims to stand out by offering actual value and use cases. As the crypto market evolves, projects that focus on utility and real-world impact may gain more attention. FLOKI’s diversification into NFTs, DeFi, and charitable initiatives highlights its efforts to be more than just a speculative asset. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Shaking Up the Solana Ecosystem Meet BONK, the memecoin that’s making waves on the Solana blockchain. With a playful Shiba Inu mascot, BONK aims to empower the community by shifting power away from big investors. It soared over 100% after being listed on Coinbase. To become a true “community coin,” BONK airdropped half of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi projects. Despite its rapid rise, BONK faces challenges like a huge total supply and the unpredictable nature of memecoins. Yet, its active role in the growing world of decentralized apps, including the launch of BonkSwap, sets it apart. In today’s market, where community-driven projects are on the rise, BONK’s potential is notable. Compared to other memecoins that often lack real utility, BONK is integrating into a thriving ecosystem. For those watching trends in decentralized finance and community tokens, BONK might be an attractive option. Conclusion While FLOKI and BONK show promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) aims for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans in a community-driven memecoin leading the bull run.

Despite this short-term recovery, the token has suffered a heavy loss—down 70% since its peak of $2.98 in February, with a sharp 17% drop just over the past week. At the time of writing, Pi coin is trading at $0.64. Why the Sharp Decline? Analysts point to the continuous unlocking of PI tokens as a key factor behind the steep decline. This process increases the token’s supply, while demand has struggled to keep pace, putting downward pressure on its price. Key Resistance Levels to Watch Looking ahead, if Pi can break through resistance levels at $0.80 and $0.90, it could potentially rally past the $1 mark. However, this optimistic scenario comes with caveats. Ongoing token unlocks and the absence of major exchange listings could continue to exert selling pressure. Is This a Real Recovery or a “Dead Cat Bounce”? While the recent price surge might signal a resurgence of investor interest, caution is advised. Some experts warn it could be a “dead cat bounce”—a temporary recovery after a steep decline, often followed by further losses. Speculators might be jumping in to secure quick profits, but history shows that such recoveries can be short-lived. A New Perspective from the Community One user shared a thoughtful take , suggesting that the Pi Network’s price drop, while painful, was a necessary reset. “After an overhyped mainnet launch, the coin surged on speculation, not utility,” the user explained. “The crash flushed out weak hands and forced a reality check—value can’t rely on mining gimmicks or KYC delays alone. It’s a chance for Pi to refocus on building real-world use cases and a sustainable ecosystem.”",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-06 06:08:47

Arctic Pablo Coin is the New Opportunity for Investors,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-how-early-believers-in-trump-meme-coin-reaped-huge-gains-arctic-pablo-coin-is-the-new-opportunity-for-investors/,"Cryptocurrency has taken the world by storm, with meme coins leading the charge in a space that’s both thrilling and unpredictable. A notable success story that many cryptocurrency enthusiasts often reflect on is the rise of Trump Meme Coin. Its explosive growth from humble beginnings to massive returns for early investors has become a shining example of what the crypto world is capable of. However, not everyone managed to jump in during its initial days, missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime. Today, with the introduction of Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), investors now have another shot at entering a presale that could offer them similar gains. Could this be the next big meme coin? Let’s dive into the exciting world of Arctic Pablo Coin and why it’s one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in This Week. The Early Days of Trump Meme Coin: A Lesson in Crypto Timing Trump Meme Coin started as a small meme coin in the early days of the crypto wave. Many saw it as just another joke coin, but those who took the leap early on witnessed massive growth. The coin’s price was incredibly low during its presale, making it an attractive option for early investors who saw potential in the meme culture surrounding it. At the time, no one could have predicted how high Trump Meme Coin would climb. Its value skyrocketed in a matter of months, turning modest investments into huge profits. As of now, Trump Meme Coin’s early investors are reaping the rewards of their decision, with the coin’s market capitalization in the billions. The initial low-entry price, now a distant memory, stands in stark contrast to the value it has achieved today. If you missed that opportunity, you’re not alone—but there’s a new coin making waves in the presale stage, and it might just be your chance to capitalize on the same kind of momentum. Why Arctic Pablo Coin Is the Next Big Thing: The Presale Success You Can’t Miss The presale of Arctic Pablo Coin has been nothing short of exceptional. If you missed out on the early days of Trump Meme Coin, now is the time to act. Arctic Pablo Coin is creating a buzz for all the right reasons, with its presale seeing remarkable interest and success. This meme coin offers a chance to enter at an incredibly low price, just like Trump Meme Coin did back in the day. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Glacial Glade presale is heating up at $0.000087 per token.

While FOMO Rises, Ruvi AI (RUVI) Offers Next-Level Opportunities to Early Investors",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/while-fomo-rises-ruvi-ai-offers-opportunities-to-early-investors/,"The post Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Primed for a 270% Surge? While FOMO Rises, Ruvi AI (RUVI) Offers Next-Level Opportunities to Early Investors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE) has the crypto world buzzing yet again, with analysts predicting a potential 270% price surge in the coming weeks. Elon Musk, Dogecoin’s biggest supporter, remains a key figure propelling the coin’s narrative. However, while traders speculate over DOGE’s next move, a more dynamic, tech-forward project is quietly taking the stage. Meet RUVI . Why Dogecoin’s Forecast is Stirring FOMO Dogecoin’s history as the original “meme coin” has solidified its place in the crypto market. Whether through Elon Musk’s tweets or bullish market waves, DOGE continues to capture attention. Recent predictions suggest the coin could break resistance at $0.21 and climb to $0.65 by late April. This potential rally is invigorating retail and institutional interest alike. Nevertheless, Dogecoin’s volatility and utility limitations leave many investors wondering if there’s a better way to maximize returns in the blockchain space. This is where RUVI steps in with an ecosystem designed for creativity, rewards, and endless growth opportunities. What Sets RUVI Apart RUVI flips the script on traditional cryptocurrency projects by incorporating advanced AI tools integrated with blockchain technology . This groundbreaking ecosystem empowers users to create text, images, audio, and even video content , while earning rewards along the way. RUVI’s platform isn’t just a passive investment; it puts its users at the core of its growth, thanks to user-driven AI training models that continuously evolve to meet the needs of its community. And here’s what truly sets RUVI apart from projects like Dogecoin—its robust tokenized rewards system and VIP bonus structure , which are tailored to incentivize both casual users and dedicated investors. The Benefits of RUVI’s VIP Tier Rewards Unlike Dogecoin, which lacks structured reward systems, RUVI introduces a tiered VIP program for its token presale. Take the VIP 4 tier , for example. With an investment of $2,000 at the current token price of $0.01 , you secure 200,000 RUVI tokens . The VIP 4 tier bonus , a generous 80% , adds an extra 160,000 tokens , bringing your total holdings to 360,000 . At RUVI’s upcoming listing price of $0.07 per token , that $2,000 turns into $25,200 in value. And if analysts’ predictions that RUVI could soar to a token price of $0.50 post-launch come true, your $2,000 could transform into an astonishing $180,000 . This structured and rewarding system provides more immediate value compared to Dogecoin, where gains are largely speculative and dependent on market momentum. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Performers RUVI goes a step further with its Leaderboard Rewards system , offering even greater incentives for its most engaged community members. The top 1,000 token holders are ranked by total holdings and awarded fixed bonuses, with the Top 100 receiving an additional 100,000 RUVI tokens . Stacking this leaderboard reward on top of the VIP bonus, not only maximizes the holdings, but also ensures prime positioning as RUVI’s ecosystem grows and attracts more users. For serious investors, this represents an unparalleled opportunity to secure a leadership position in one of the most innovative blockchain platforms on the market. RUVI vs. Dogecoin Dogecoin’s appeal lies in its simplicity and its meme-inspired ecosystem. However, as the crypto market matures, the focus has shifted toward tangible value and utility. RUVI brilliantly bridges this gap by offering a functionality-driven platform fueled by AI tools and tokenized rewards. While Dogecoin is reliant on price surges driven by sentiment and hype, RUVI provides a structured framework for growth, creativity, and active participation. With RUVI, you’re not just betting on a coin; you’re investing in a platform that serves creators and innovators alike. The Bottom Line Dogecoin’s potential surge to $0.65 has undoubtedly captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts, but RUVI offers something far more compelling. Combining powerful technology with community-first rewards, RUVI is positioning itself as the ideal complement to meme coins like DOGE. For investors eager to catch the next big thing in crypto, the time to act is now. Don’t wait for the market to catch up. Join RUVI today and prepare for a future powered by blockchain innovation and AI-driven creativity.

At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001223, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This reflects a 0.18% decline in the past 24 hours, a 6.23% drop over the past week, and a 7.23% slide over the past month. These figures illustrate a cautious environment among traders, with SHIB struggling to maintain upward momentum amid broader market fluctuations. ChatGPT Forecasts Modest Recovery by April 30 Despite the recent bearish trend, ChatGPT has issued a short-term prediction pointing to a potential rebound. According to the AI model, “SHIB would climb approximately 2.2% to $0.0000125 by April 30, 2025.” The forecast reflects a cautiously optimistic sentiment, grounded in current technical data and market conditions. ChatGPT’s prediction, while conservative in comparison to more speculative outlooks, offers a potentially achievable target as market sentiment stabilizes and investor focus shifts toward utility-driven assets. Developer Confidence and Long-Term Vision Adding context to this projection, a recent report from Times Tabloid sheds light on the long-term outlook held by SHIB’s development team. According to the publication , the Shiba Inu team supports a forecast predicting a 12x increase in SHIB’s value over time. “The Shiba Inu team backs a 12x price surge prediction,” the report stated, reflecting internal optimism about the token’s growth potential. While such a projection is ambitious, it emphasizes the community’s broader strategic vision rather than short-term price movements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Token Burns and Shibarium: Supporting Price Growth Fundamental developments within the SHIB ecosystem continue to play a vital role in shaping price forecasts. Shibarium has seen consistent growth in usage, with increasing numbers of decentralized applications (dApps) and users engaging with the platform. Moreover, the ongoing burn strategy —where large amounts of SHIB tokens are permanently removed from circulation—aims to support long-term price appreciation by reducing the overall token supply. These mechanisms are critical for SHIB’s positioning in the market as more than just a meme coin. They provide utility and a deflationary element that could eventually drive upward price movement. A 2% Climb Within Reach? While the crypto market remains unpredictable, ChatGPT’s prediction of a 2.2% price increase by April 30 is grounded in current indicators. A rise to $0.0000125 would mark a modest but notable reversal from recent losses. It could signal the beginning of a broader recovery trend—provided that positive developments in the ecosystem continue.

The current market downturn likely reflects changing fundamentals, not a buying opportunity, with institutional investors selling and a negative medium-term outlook for BTC-USD. Bitcoin's speculative nature and sensitivity to interest rates make it unlikely to rise in a risk-off environment, suggesting a bearish medium-term outlook. Introduction For a long time, crypto enthusiasts have claimed that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a safe haven kind of asset, while crypto enemies referred to the high correlation between the two assets. Nevertheless, this week, crypto, especially Bitcoin, stayed flat while markets crashed, raising the question of why this is and what the implications are. Historic correlation As I have already mentioned, Bitcoin has always been somewhat correlated to the market. Figure 1 shows the correlation of BTC-USD and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( NYSEARCA: SPY ) during the crashes in 2020 and 2022. Additionally, it shows the performance of both BTC-USD and SPY. Although the correlation is not very high, the returns show that BTC-USD has historically crashed when SPY fell. Figure 1 - Correlation and Performance of BTC and SPY During 2020 and 2022 (Data Source: Yahoo Finance; Table Self-Created ) What Happened This Week And Its Implications This week, however, this historical trend has not continued, as Figure 2 shows. While the market fell almost 10%, Bitcoin even gained 1.7% and did not show enhanced volatility. Figure 2 - Correlation and Performance of BTC and SPY Last Week (Data Source: Yahoo Finance; Table Self-Created ) Another difference between the assets can be seen in the different Fear & Greed Indices shown in Figures 3 and 4. While stock markets are at the bottom range of extreme fear at a value of 4, cryptos are at an F&G level of 30, suggesting only a bit of fear. Figure 3 - Stock Market Fear and Greed Index (CNN) Figure 4 - Crypto Fear and Greed Index ( Alternative.me ) So what are the implications of this? The facts presented clearly show that, as crazy as it sounds, we are not in a risk-off environment at the moment, or at least the market does not perceive it as such. From this particular view, the current downturn in stock only reflects changing fundamentals as the likelihood of a continued trade war has increased, which should not impact cryptos. This interpretation can also be seen in credit spreads shown in Figure 5, which are up but still historically low. Also, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( NASDAQ: TLT ) as a proxy for bonds is barely above its 200d moving average, showing that there currently is at least no strong flight to safety happening. All of this leaves two conclusions: either some market segments, such as bonds and crypto, do not correctly reflect the current risk of a bear market, or the current market crash is not a buying opportunity but simply reflects the worst outlook. As I have already shown in my recent article on why we are likely in a crash, I believe more in the first theory due to many factors, such as (still) high valuations. Also, volatility is autocorrelated, meaning that volatile days are often followed by more volatile (mostly down) days. Another factor in favor of this thesis is that retail investors have already bought stocks 2 days ago, while the market still lost more than 6% yesterday. This leaves the conclusion that institutional investors are selling at the moment, making a quick rebound unlikely. What follows from this is a negative medium-term outlook for BTC-USD and other cryptos as risk-on assets. The same goes for stocks, although they are less at risk since they already fell by 10% this week and might experience a short-term rally. Should the second thesis be correct, it would still not mean something positive for the crypto sector but rather a continuation of its current sideways trend. BTC-USD is still below its 200d simple moving average, suggesting lower returns and higher volatility. For stocks, the second thesis could mean the same. Nevertheless, it implies that a quick recovery is unlikely. Figure 5 - BBB Bond Treasury Spreads ( Longtermtrends ) Could BTC-USD Be a Safe Haven This Time? At this point, many crypto enthusiasts will likely say that BTC-USD could rise even in a high-risk environment. In my opinion, this is highly unlikely, as Bitcoin is considered a speculation for many. In times when people see their portfolios fall 6% in one day, they often tend to try to negate risk, not increase it. Also, a rising crypto market during a crash would imply that investors still have cash, which they often do not have as the market would not crash otherwise. Additionally, crashes often coincide with high valuations, again proving the point of low cash reserves. The last factor is interest rates. As we have learned during the 2020 and 2022 crashes, Bitcoin is interest rate sensitive. Nevertheless, likely, the FED will not start cutting rates due to the possible inflationary impacts that Jerome Powell himself has acknowledged recently. Conclusion While the current divergence of Bitcoin could be seen as bullish, it might rather be bearish over the medium term. As the market falls, they will try to offset risk, which will likely decrease the price of Bitcoin. For SPY, the news might either mean that the recent crash was only a change in fundamentals, which would mean no crash but also no buying opportunity, or it could lead to a bear market, in which case SPY would still be a better hold than BTC-USD.",SPY|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-06 06:22:38

Traders Eyes on $2.60 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, Ripple’s native token, is strongly holding its key support level at $1.95, even after a major price drop in recent days. The daily chart shows that XRP has retested this level more than eight times, and each time, it has bounced back with strong upward momentum. XRP Price Action and Technical Analysis However, this time, the asset’s price has failed to show upside momentum due to the ongoing bearish market sentiment and is instead consolidating within a tight range, which is still better than breaking below this key level. Amid the current market uncertainty, several other assets have failed to hold their key levels and have experienced significant declines XRP Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, XRP appears neutral, as the overall sentiment is bearish, making it unreasonable to label it as bullish. Currently, the asset’s price is near a key support level of $1.95 and has been consolidating within a tight range between $1.95 and $2.20 for over a week. On the smaller timeframe, XRP has formed a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern, and the price is on the verge of a breakout. Based on recent price momentum, if XRP breaks out of the pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $2.22 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 16% to reach the $2.60 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View However, on the daily timeframe, XRP has already formed a bearish head and shoulders pattern, but its neckline is receiving support from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which appears to be helping the asset stay above the key level.

His analysis, which was posted on social media, suggests that XRP follows a specific market pattern, with historical data supporting his projection. He also notes that if an observed 110-day offset holds, the peak could extend to November 9, 2025. #XRP – July 21, 2025 Cycle Peak I've shared a complete thread in the Subscription group outlining my theory and technical analysis. So far, it seems to be on track for #XRP to reach its cycle peak by July 21, 2025. If the 110-day offset still holds, then the cycle peak could… pic.twitter.com/qTyFBmTefl — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 4, 2025 Analysis of XRP’s Market Cycle Egrag Crypto’s analysis is based on historical price movements, particularly how XRP has behaved with the 21-weekly exponential Moving Average (EMA). He explains that it took time for the 21 Weekly EMA to align with the price action before XRP entered its final upward phase. He highlights that, based on previous cycles, once XRP touches the 21-weekly EMA, it takes 147 days to complete the last leg of the cycle, followed by a 21-day surge leading to the cycle peak. His attached chart visualizes this pattern and outlines his expectations for XRP’s price movement between now and July 21, 2025. The chart indicates a projected increase in XRP’s value, aligning with past trends. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Insights and Market Factors Egrag Crypto also references M2 (global liquidity), suggesting that macroeconomic conditions and liquidity trends could aid XRP’s price action. He acknowledges the work of Dig Perspectives, who recently featured his analysis in a YouTube video , providing further exposure to his prediction. He has posted a thread in his subscription group, providing more details on his methodology and reasoning behind the forecast. By linking his analysis to broader financial trends, he argues that XRP’s movement aligns with historical liquidity cycles and technical indicators. A Confident Projection Egrag Crypto ends his post by challenging his audience, asking if they would consider him the “KING OF XRP TA” (technical analysis) if his date and price target are met. This statement reflects his confidence in the accuracy of his model. His prediction has attracted attention within the XRP community, as traders and investors assess the possibility of XRP reaching its peak within the expected timeframe. While technical analysis provides valuable insights, external factors such as regulatory developments, market sentiment, and macroeconomic conditions could influence XRP’s trajectory throughout 2025.

The altcoins are also quite sluggish on a daily scale, aside from PI, which has maintained its recovery session. BTC Calm at $83K The primary cryptocurrency went through a highly volatile trading week , which began with a price slip to $81,600 on Monday. It bounced off almost immediately and went on the offensive hard by Wednesday. At the time, reports that Elon Musk might leave US President Trump’s inner circle sent the asset flying and BTC touched $88,500 for the first time in about a week. Later that day, though, the POTUS introduced the latest tariffs against countless countries, which had an immediate and violent effect on bitcoin’s price. In just an hour or so, the cryptocurrency plunged to $82,400 and to $81,200 by Thursday. Another volatile session transpired on Friday when China responded with tariffs on its own, and BTC went from $84,800 to $81,600 in minutes. It recovered some ground by the time the weekend had arrived and has remained relatively still since then at just over $83,000, despite a minor correction yesterday. As of now, its market cap is $1.650 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is 59.8% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView PI Recovers Hard After the recent price slide, PI finally started to recover some ground on Friday evening, and it has continued ever since. Following the ATL marked two days ago, the asset has regained more than 50% of its value and now sits at around $0.65. OKB is the other notable gainer from the larger-cap alts, having surged by another 5.5% to $54. In contrast, most other alts are with minor losses today. AVAX has dumped the most (over 4%), followed by CRO, HBAR, LTC, XLM, DOGE, TON, and ADA. ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, LEO, and LINK are also in the red but in a less painful manner. The total crypto market cap has lost around $20 billion daily and is below $2.770 trillion on CG now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Now in Stage 5 of its presale, PepeX has raised over $1,249,000, and the token price will increase from $0.0243 to $0.0255 in two days. This rising demand stands in contrast to the Pepe token, which is down over 65% in 2025 following a peak last December. While PEPE rode viral waves with no underlying utility, PepeX presents itself as a functional launchpad platform with anti-rug protections and a structured presale model for long-term token stability. Price gains as presale enters new stage PepeX is structured over 30 stages, increasing the price by 5% at each level. The presale began in late March with a token price of $0.02, and the current price sits at $0.0243 during Stage 5. In two days, the price will move up to $0.0255 as the sale progresses into Stage 6. If the entire presale sells out, the token will launch on public exchanges at approximately $0.085, offering early buyers a strong entry price advantage. The current fundraising total stands at $1,249,035, reflecting growing traction as more buyers enter before the next price jump. The presale is scheduled to run for 90 days, giving the project a fixed window to attract interest before launch. Key differences between PepeX and Pepe Unlike PEPE, which launched in 2023 purely as a meme coin with no functionality, PepeX is built as a launchpad for new meme tokens. The platform plans to use artificial intelligence to vet and deploy new meme coins, allowing creators to launch tokens with features like automated liquidity locks and anti-sniper protection. PepeX also caps developer token allocations at 5%, reserving 95% for the community. This mechanism, combined with liquidity lock requirements, is designed to prevent token manipulation, unfair distribution, or early dumping by insiders—common issues in meme coin launches. Pepe, in contrast, rose and fell on market hype. It reached an all-time high of $0.00002803 in December 2024, but its current price has dropped to $0.0 5 7041, down around 75% from its peak. No platform or ecosystem was ever attached to it, making it more vulnerable to speculative swings. What could drive PepeX in 2025 Price forecasts for PEPE remain narrow. Analysts suggest a range between $0.000006 and $0.000015 by year-end, largely driven by meme momentum and speculative sentiment. PepeX , however, introduces utility into the meme coin space. If it attracts meme creators looking for a safe, fast way to launch tokens—and investors seeking early-stage access—demand for PEPX may increase as the platform scales. It also borrows the presale model from previous success stories, offering pre-launch gains as the token climbs through the staged price structure. A successful listing at $0.085 would already reflect a more than fourfold gain from the opening presale price. Its potential also ties to the broader meme ecosystem. Platforms like Pump.fun have generated over $500 million in meme coin value. If PepeX manages to capture a slice of that market, it may drive additional trading activity once the token goes live.

As the global crypto market capitalization soared past the $2.7 trillion mark on Saturday, April 5, traditional equity markets faced heavy losses, highlighting a broader shift in investor sentiment. Major U.S. technology companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA, lost over $1 trillion in combined market value in three days. The market rout was triggered by former President Trump’s announcement of fresh tariffs on imports, which sparked a rapid global selloff. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged over 3,000 points, falling 7.4%, while Crude Oil (WTI) prices slipped by more than 10% as concerns mounted over a potential slowdown in global trade. The sell-off in tech stocks, particularly heavyweights like Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA—each down around 15% for the week—reveals deep-rooted fears of prolonged supply chain disruptions and a possible global economic blip. Analysts note that such synchronized declines in corporate giants point to systemic market risks rather than company-specific issues. Meanwhile, China’s swift retaliation with new tariffs on U.S. exports only amplified these concerns, reinforcing fears of a prolonged trade war. A new wave: Investors pivot to crypto and PEPEX With traditional markets under pressure, attention is rapidly shifting towards private credit, alternative assets, and cryptocurrencies—particularly early-stage projects with strong growth potential like PEPEX . PEPEX is not just another meme coin. It is an AI-powered meme coin launchpad, currently in its early presale stages, designed to tap into the booming intersection of artificial intelligence and decentralized finance (DeFi). As investors seek fresh opportunities outside traditional equities, PEPEX stands out by offering innovation, community-driven growth, and the appeal of early-mover advantage. The project has already seen explosive momentum during its presale, now entering stage four of its 30-stage rollout. It has raised more than $1.2M so far. Currently, the token price stands at $0.0243. The next stage price will be $0.0255. The buzz surrounding PEPEX suggests a growing confidence in projects that blend cutting-edge technology with cultural trends, especially at a time when market uncertainty is pushing investors to diversify. Why PEPEX could be worth watching The crypto market rally and the growing demand for alternative investments are creating the perfect environment for platforms like PEPEX . With AI becoming an increasingly integral part of the tech landscape and meme coins consistently dominating crypto conversations, PEPEX combines two of the most powerful trends into a single, accessible platform. Moreover, early investors often stand to benefit the most when projects with strong fundamentals and active communities gain wider traction. Given its innovative approach and strong early-stage performance, PEPEX could present a unique opportunity for those looking to hedge against traditional market risks while participating in the next wave of crypto innovation. As trade war fears shake traditional markets, the spotlight is turning toward cryptocurrencies and DeFi projects offering fresh prospects. PEPEX, with its AI-driven vision and early presale momentum, is positioning itself as a name to watch in 2025 and beyond.

CEO Announces Emergency Plan,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-will-happen-if-tether-usdt-is-delisted-in-the-us-ceo-announces-emergency-plan/,"Tether, the world's largest stablecoin issuer, may launch a new US-compliant stablecoin if impending American regulations push USDT out of the market, according to CEO Paolo Ardoino. In an interview, Ardoino downplayed the impact of U.S. regulatory developments on the company’s global operations. Despite speculation that Tether may be forced to exit the U.S. market, Ardoino said the company is currently exploring contingency plans, including the creation of a new stablecoin specifically designed for U.S. compliance. “We believe our main stablecoin is perfect for emerging markets, but we can create a payments stablecoin that works for the US,” Ardoino said. “We need to have two products with two different value propositions.” Related News: “The Signal Has Come, There's Huge Volatility Ahead,” Analytics Firm Says, Predicting What Could Happen to Bitcoin and Altcoins However, bipartisan efforts in the US Congress are raising questions about the future of foreign-issued stablecoins. The House’s STABLE Act and the Senate’s GENIUS Act propose strict requirements for stablecoin issuers, including compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, regular audits, and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. Tether, headquartered in El Salvador, would fall under these provisions. While critics have long questioned Tether’s reserve transparency, arguing that the company has never undergone a full audit, Ardoino claimed that the firm is in talks with “Big Four” accounting firms about conducting an audit. Addressing speculation that Tether would exit the U.S. entirely to avoid regulatory scrutiny, Ardoino described such claims as “the whiff of desperation” from rivals hoping to sideline Tether. “Here I am,” he said from the New York offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, a major custodian of Tether’s U.S. Treasury reserves. *This is not investment advice.

In a post on the social media platform X, Hayes says that President Trump was partially elected by Americans who feel that they didn’t share in the alleged “prosperity” stemming from going off the gold standard in 1971. Hayes says that if the White House follows through on reducing its debt and current account deficit, then other countries will be forced to finance their economies by selling their US stocks and bonds, creating a permanent change in the global financial order since finance ministers around the world won’t take a chance that Trump will change his mind. “THE END: Of US Treasuries and, to a lesser extent, US stocks as the global reserve asset. If the US current account deficit is eliminated, then foreigners do not have dollars to buy bonds and stocks. If foreigners have to juice up their own nations’ economies, they will sell what they own, US bonds and stocks, to fund their nation-first policies.” The crypto investor also notes that he believes gold and Bitcoin will emerge as the winners of a shifting global financial order. “THE RETURN: Of gold as the neutral reserve asset. The dollar will still be the reserve currency, but nations will hold reserves in gold to settle global trade. Trump hinted at this because gold is tariff-exempt! Gold must flow freely and cheaply in the new world monetary order. A lot of those who had it good are in the denial stage, and share a delusion that somehow things will return to ‘normal’… For those who want to adapt to a return to pre-1971 trade relationships, buy gold, gold miners and BTC.” Hayes also suggests that the Trump-induced economic shockwaves may have finally broken the correlation between BTC and the Nasdaq. “BTC hodlers need to learn to love tariffs, maybe we finally broke the correlation with Nasdaq, and can move onto the purest form of a fiat liquidity smoke alarm.” Source: Arthur Hayes/X At time of writing, BTC is trading at $83,322.

Are you watching or still sleeping?” XRP x U.S. Treasury This ain’t hype, it’s infrastructure Ripple might gift $XRP as code to the gov They won’t buy it… they’ll use it Are you watching or still sleeping? pic.twitter.com/gKuzzs1BiZ — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) April 3, 2025 The Concept of a Gratis Vendor Squire’s message was accompanied by a short video clip of an interview in which an unidentified speaker described the process of becoming a “gratis vendor” for the U.S. government. The speaker explained that a gratis vendor is an approved entity that gives, rather than sells, a product or service to the federal government. According to this explanation, when a vendor provides a product as a gift—especially if offered to an entity under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which includes the executive branch—the product may be accepted without going through standard procurement procedures. In the interview, the first speaker said, “What is a gratis vendor? A gratis vendor is an approved vendor for the United States of America that gives product to the government, doesn’t sell it. Therefore, I don’t have to go through the whole process of becoming a proper vendor because you’re giving it to us.” The speaker went on to say that if the product is gifted to a government department, it bypasses much of the bureaucracy typically involved in federal acquisitions. Implications for XRP and Ripple Squire used this segment to suggest that Ripple Labs could utilize the gratis vendor model to offer XRP or XRP-related code to the U.S. government as a non-commercial resource. The core implication in Squire’s statement is that Ripple would not sell XRP to the government but provide it or its infrastructure freely for governmental use. The tweet did not contain any formal confirmation from Ripple or any government entity that such an arrangement is currently in place. However, it aligns with previous conversations in the digital asset space about the potential role of XRP in the modernization of governmental and financial systems . Squire’s emphasis on the infrastructure aspect of the tweet indicates that he sees this potential move not as a marketing strategy or speculative hype but as a functional step toward broader adoption of distributed ledger technology within federal agencies. Current Status and Outlook If Ripple pursues this approach, it could theoretically allow government entities to evaluate or deploy XRP-powered systems without needing to engage in standard procurement or regulatory clearance typically required for financial acquisitions. While speculative, Squire’s commentary underscores the view held by some in the digital asset community that XRP’s real-world utility could extend into official public-sector functions.

By the end of the previous year, Bitcoin had surpassed the $100,000 mark, but this milestone was short-lived as the price quickly fell. Since then, Bitcoin has been on a downward trend, even dipping below $80,000. Adding to the market’s struggles, President Trump’s tariff announcement put additional pressure on the crypto space, causing most cryptocurrencies to suffer alongside Bitcoin. According toCryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, Bitcoin bull market appears to be over, based on on-chain data analysis. The key metric is Realized Cap, which measures the actual capital entering the market by tracking when BTC is bought (entered a wallet) and sold (left a wallet). “But when sell pressure is high, even large purchases fail to move the price. There are simply too many sellers. For example, when Bitcoin was trading near $100K, the market saw massive volumes, but the price barely moved,” he explained. When the Realized Cap grows but the Market Cap (based on the latest trading price) stays flat or drops, it signals that money is flowing in, but prices aren’t responding—this is a bearish sign. Right now, that’s exactly what’s happening. In contrast, if small amounts of new capital push prices up, it’s a bullish market. But currently, even large amounts of capital aren’t enough to move Bitcoin’s price, indicating a bear market. Historically, real market reversals take at least six months, so a quick recovery is unlikely. “In short: when small capital drives prices up, it’s a bull market. When even large capital can’t push prices upward, it’s a bear. Current data clearly points to the latter. Sell pressure could ease anytime, but historically, real reversals take at least six months—so a short-term rally seems unlikely,” he concluded.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-06 07:17:34

Investors Trust This Token To Get There,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-doge-surge-to-a-100b-market-cap-from-under-30b-today-investors-trust-this-token-to-get-there/,"Elon Musk’s recent comments have clouded speculative momentum for Dogecoin. Musk said during a March 30 town hall in Wisconsin that the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) — a federal project that aims to cut down on bureaucracy — has nothing to do with the meme-fied cryptocurrency. Despite the sudden 14% price increase in late February when D.O.G.E.’s site temporarily featured Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu mascot, DOGE currently trades down 3.3% to $0.1654 for a $29.8 billion market cap. Musk doubles down on crypto detours while DOGE investors eye to return to $58 billion ATH. With this uncertainty in mind, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become a hotbed for traders diverting capital to more concrete returns. Currently in the 4th of 11 phases of its presale, tokens for MUTM are selling for $0.025 each and $6.2 million has already been pledged from a total of 7,800 holders. Booming Presale Before Spike in Price As Phase 4 continues, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is witnessing an accelerating demand. With an impending price surge from $0.025 to $0.03 expected during this next phase, investors buying now will have little time before it becomes even more expensive to get in. This tiered structure ensures that early buyers secure immediate profits — those purchasing at $0.025 face a 140% return on listing at $0.060 on exchanges. Even more projections are circulating post-launch, with some analysts predicting a move toward $3.50 — a 13,900% increase from where we are now! This optimism is fueled by the protocol’s lending model. In contrast to the viral trends leveraged by Dogecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has utilized a combination of decentralized borrowing, liquidity pools, and mtTokens — interest-bearing assets that represent user deposits. As interest accrues, each mtToken appreciates in value, generating passive income streams while maintaining a balanced liquidity supply for the platform. A buy-and-distribute mechanism also concurrently diverts a part of the revenue to repurchasing MUTM tokens, generating a constant buying pressure in the market and rewarding long-time stakers. Tokenomics: How a Roadmap Is Propelling Growth Thanks to overcollateralized loans and programmatic interest rates, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does away with speculative drawbacks. Borrowers have to pledge collateral worth more than 140% of the amount being borrowed, greatly reducing the chances of default. Lenders on the other hand receive real-time market yield adjusted before the loans, which attracts both conservative and yield seeking participants. The resulting equilibrium has led to presale traction, with Phase 4 participation rates indicating another swift sellout. Phase 1 early birds, who bought tokens for $0.01 each, now anticipate a 6x return on investment when launching. The biggest rewards, however, are post-listing, a $1,000 investment today could turn into $14,000 if MUTM touches $3.50. Confident through Security and Transparency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is completing an audit of its smart contracts with Certik, a move likely to further reassure investors. The platform’s technical rigor will be validated soon as results will be shared via official channels. Plus, a $100K giveaway for presale participants creates momentum, encouraging the start of contributors to enter ahead of the pricing shift in Phase 5. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) embodies this through real-world utility while Dogecoin struggles with waning institutional curiosity Its presale structure—methodical, but competitive—replicates the logical scaling that eludes meme-implored assets. The impending exchange listings and mounting buy pressure are a world apart from what has become the staling narrative of DOGE. Taking the Window of Opportunity As Dogecoin’s $100 billion dream flickers, MUTM phase 4’s $0.025 price point allows a final access tier below the $0.03 price threshold, a structural difference that is likely to not repeat again. Those investors, who are focusing on measurable returns against the ephemeral excitement of the viral sensation are quickly moving reserves, knowing that a refusal to participate now means being rewarded with a fractional share of future profits. The clock ticks. This begs the question of not whether DOGE can run again, but which asset — risky meme coin or utility altcoin — will prevail in 2025’s portfolios. For thousands already taking advantage of MUTM’s presale, the answer is clearly yes.

From community chatter to wallet activity, the belief in outsized potential from micro investments is heating up again. Meanwhile, consistent projects like Solana (SOL), Stellar (XLM), and Hedera (HBAR) are continuing to build, with long-term adoption growing even as newer tokens gain attention. CLICK HERE TO JOIN THE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT MAGACOINFINANCE – One of the Last Early-Stage Opportunities MAGACOINFINANCE has now reached a trading price of $0.0002757, climbing sharply from its launch value. Backed by more than $5.3 million in funding, the token is quickly closing in on final availability as it prepares for broader listing exposure. Its strength lies in its structure: a fixed 100 billion token supply, full public access from day one, and no insider advantages. This design has resonated with everyday investors who are looking for a clean, equal-access model in a space that often favors early insiders. Community support continues to expand across major platforms, and the conversation has shifted from whether to invest to how much time is left before the current pricing disappears. For many, it’s not about whether MAGACOINFINANCE could deliver a life-changing return—but whether they’re early enough to catch it. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH CO-DE MAGA50X LIMITED TIME BONUS – USE CO-DE MAGA50X Buyers can still use promo co-de MAGA50X to secure a 50% token bonus. This offer won’t be extended much longer and is expected to close as the final tokens are allocated ahead of listing. SOL, XLM, and HBAR Continue Providing Stability and Scale Solana (SOL) trades at $119.20, leading the pack in transaction speed and scalable Layer 1 capabilities. Stellar (XLM) holds at $0.12, continuing to power global, low-cost remittance options. Hedera (HBAR) is priced at $0.11, targeting energy-efficient enterprise adoption with growing support. JOIN A BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT — THIS IS YOUR EARLY ENTRY BEFORE EXCHANGE LAUNCH Conclusion In a market defined by timing and access, both MAGACOINFINANCE and XRP are showing signs of becoming this year’s most surprising performers. With transparent fundamentals and early pricing, MAGACOINFINANCE continues to offer a rare window before broader adoption hits. While SOL, XLM, and HBAR remain steady forces, the spotlight is shifting toward tokens that still have room to run—and this may be the moment to move.

They are mostly concerned about the political and economic state of the United States under the influence of President Donald Trump. Leading UK wealth groups repor t so aring demand from US-based investors as clients seek to protect their funds by transferring them to more stable systems. The phenomenon is growing rapidly. UK companies describe it as “unlike anything we have seen for years.” Rathbones, RBC Brewin Dolphin, Evelyn Partners, and Schroders Cazenove say that more US clients were looking to move a greater portion of their wealth to the UK while others had already done so. Schroder US Wealth Management chief executive Toby Glover sai d ne w client inquiries and assets had surged over the last year. Interest from US clients is “markedly higher” than when Trump first took office, said Nick Ritchie, a senior director at RBC Wealth Management. He said some US clients would shift as much as 50% of their wealth to the UK or Channel Islands. Still, the majority are moving between 5% and 20% of their riches. Others are moving money into trusts, too. Ritchie said this provides “an extra layer of protection” against future legal or political risks in the US. Wealthy Americans are seeking a safer place for their wealth James Blosse-Lynch, investment director at Rathbones, sai d cl ients increasingly saw the UK as a “getaway” option. He cited one client who increased the share of their wealth managed in the UK from negligible levels to a full quarter of their portfolio. He added that clients had been seeking a plan B, and the UK w as the first stop for many. Other alternatives clients are looking at include Italy, Switzerland, or Dubai. But they are “parking” their money in the UK as they strategize their next move. Nick Reeves, a financial planner at Evelyn Partners, said that one of his clients was considering buying property in the UK to move money outside the US legal system. He said the client was concerned about potential asset seizures. While these concerns are not new, they have become increasingly pronounced amid fears of political instability. Trump-era decisions fuel financial fears Recent measures taken by Trump’s administration have stoked the flames . The administration announced a new series of tariffs on US imports just a few days ago. The market reacted badly. In two days, American stocks lost $5.4 trillion in value. Investors are becoming more jittery, with Roy Clouse, senior investment director at Canaccord Wealth, sayin g th ere is increasing worry that Donald Trump is operating outside the normal rules. He added that Trump could alter laws determining where and how Americans can invest, which was alarming enough for clients. Others worry that Americans may find investing in foreign currencies or markets more difficult under Trump. That prompts them to move quickly while still having the means. Even with the UK’s recent abolition of its “non-dom” tax benefits, US interest continues to run high. Foreigners can live in the UK and suffer no tax on foreign income for four years under new rules — as long as they haven’t lived here in the last ten. Some experts think this four-year gap has allowed Americans to dip their toes in the water. For now, UK wealth managers are positioning themselves as the calm amid the storm—welcoming US millions with open arms and carefully tailored tax solutions.

Deaton has published a detailed response to Coinbase Institutional’s recent announcement regarding its move to offer regulated XRP futures contracts. The exchange stated it had “filed with the CFTC to self-certify $XRP futures—bringing a regulated, capital-efficient way to gain exposure to one of the most liquid digital assets.” The platform further noted that it anticipates the contract to go live on April 21, 2025. Coinbase’s Legal Due Diligence in 2019 In a lengthy post, Deaton provided extensive context around Coinbase’s history with XRP, its interactions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the implications of Coinbase’s decision to offer XRP derivatives under Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight. Let’s do an XRP/Coinbase recap: In January 2019, the @coinbase team went to the @SECGov and informed the SEC that Coinbase had run XRP through its digital asset Framework and determined XRP NOT a security. The Coinbase team was made up of some of the most experienced securities… https://t.co/cZteJy17uw pic.twitter.com/qFmHbPQNBH — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) April 4, 2025 His post emphasized that Coinbase’s decision to list XRP in 2019 was based on legal analysis conducted by its in-house counsel, some of whom he described as among the most experienced securities attorneys in the country. Deaton stated that in January 2019, before listing XRP, Coinbase approached the SEC to inform them of its internal conclusion: XRP did not meet the definition of a security under U.S. law. Coinbase shared with the SEC that this determination was based on their application of the exchange’s digital asset framework. According to Deaton, the SEC was fully aware of XRP’s history at that point, including its settlement with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in 2015. That agreement resulted in detailed audits of all XRP sales between 2015 and 2020, shared with FinCEN and the SEC. The XRP Howey Memo and SEC Inaction Deaton underscored the significance of an internal SEC document known as the “XRP Howey Analysis Memo,” which he said was authored by SEC enforcement staff and dated June 13, 2018—just one day before former SEC Director William Hinman’s widely discussed speech declaring that Ethereum was no longer considered a security. According to Deaton, the XRP memo did not recommend enforcement action or a cease-and-desist order, which he interpreted as a signal that the SEC staff at the time did not conclude that XRP was a security. At the January 2019 meeting, Coinbase reportedly made it clear to the SEC that it intended to list XRP unless the agency explicitly disagreed with the exchange’s analysis. Deaton asserted that the SEC neither raised objections nor attempted to dissuade Coinbase from listing the asset. XRP was listed on February 26, 2019, and shortly afterward, Coinbase promoted XRP and USDC as a cost-effective solution for cross-border payments. SEC Enforcement and Legal Fallout Deaton pointed to the contradiction between the SEC’s silence in 2019 and its decision nearly two years later to file suit against Ripple Labs and its executives on December 22, 2020. He emphasized that the SEC’s complaint took the unprecedented position that all XRP, regardless of its origin or acquisition method, constituted unregistered securities. In Deaton’s view, the agency’s approach constituted bad faith and overreach. He also highlighted that over 75,000 XRP holders joined the lawsuit as amici curiae. He credited Judge Analisa Torres’s July 2023 ruling , which found that XRP was not a security, as vindication for retail holders, Coinbase, and Ripple. That decision led to Coinbase and other platforms re-listing XRP within hours. XRP Futures Under CFTC Oversight With Coinbase actively pursuing a CFTC-regulated XRP futures product, Deaton sees the move as a culmination of a years-long battle. He described the development as a reflection of XRP’s legal clarity, particularly as a non-security asset in the secondary market. Referring to the years of litigation, regulatory uncertainty, and the cost imposed on stakeholders, Deaton concluded his post with a pointed remark: “Imagine the massive waste of money, resources and time. But we won.” Coinbase’s filing to self-certify XRP futures with the CFTC marks a significant development in the broader regulatory narrative surrounding XRP. While the product remains subject to approval, its path to listing under the oversight of the CFTC, not the SEC, underscores the continuing evolution of XRP’s regulatory status and market positioning.

The cryptocurrency space is buzzing with new projects, and investors are constantly searching for the most promising tokens that could generate massive returns. Among the contenders, Dogecoin and Popcat have already made their mark, but now, a new challenger has entered the arena— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). Arctic Pablo Coin is turning heads with its innovative approach, unique incentives, and a presale that is attracting significant attention. If you’re looking for the Top New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential, this article will cover the developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, Dogecoin, and Popcat. Arctic Pablo Coin Climbs Higher in Glacial Glade Phase with 9,000%+ ROI Potential Arctic Pablo Coin is more than just another meme token—it’s an ecosystem designed for long-term sustainability and rewarding investors. A standout feature of Arctic Pablo Coin is its staking rewards, which allow holders to earn passive income simply by holding and staking their APC tokens. Unlike other meme coins that rely purely on hype, Arctic Pablo Coin integrates real value creation by offering competitive staking yields, incentivizing long-term holding, and stabilizing market movement. With the increasing demand for passive income in crypto, APC’s staking model positions it as a game-changer among Top New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential. Additionally, Arctic Pablo Coin’s referral program amplifies its earning potential. By inviting others to participate, investors can earn additional rewards, making it an enticing option for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers. As the crypto market evolves, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out by ensuring its holders can grow their wealth effortlessly. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: The Window to Early Profits is Closing Fast Arctic Pablo Coin has made its way into Glacial Glade , the 17th phase in its steadily growing presale, and tokens are currently priced at just $0.000087. With a listing price locked at $0.008, the calculated ROI sits at 9,084.48%, drawing a surge of new buyers. Over $2 million has already been raised, demonstrating strong investor conviction.

But Arctic Pablo isn’t just another presale pump—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem in the making. From automatic burns that limit supply to staking programs that reward holding, every element is geared toward long-term growth. While meme coins come and go, Arctic Pablo is building toward legacy status in the space. Dogecoin: The Pioneer of Meme Cryptos Still Holds Strong Dogecoin, the meme coin that started it all, continues to maintain its position as one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. Originating as a joke, Dogecoin has evolved into a serious digital asset with backing from influential figures and a dedicated community. With its wide acceptance, strong liquidity, and ongoing development efforts, Dogecoin remains a favorite in the meme coin sector. While newer projects like Arctic Pablo Coin offer innovative features, Dogecoin’s status as the original meme coin ensures it continues to have a place in the crypto market. Popcat: The Viral Crypto with Community Power Popcat, inspired by an internet-famous meme, has rapidly gained traction due to its strong online following. This meme coin thrives on viral trends, engaging social media communities, and interactive campaigns that keep the hype alive. While Popcat does not offer extensive utility like Arctic Pablo Coin, its success demonstrates the power of community-driven momentum in the cryptocurrency space. As meme coins continue to dominate speculative trading, Popcat’s future largely depends on sustaining its virality. Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge in the Meme Coin Frenzy As meme coins continue to generate excitement in the crypto world, Arctic Pablo Coin emerges as a promising contender with its staking rewards, referral incentives, and surging presale.

42982235,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63109,1743926019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Complementary Relationship Between XRP and Stellar (XLM),https://timestabloid.com/the-complementary-relationship-between-xrp-and-stellar-xlm/,"Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, has emphasized the long-standing complementary relationship between XRP and XLM. In an article posted on X, Aljarrah explained that these digital assets share a unified goal: transforming the global financial system. While they pursue this mission differently, their roles are interdependent and equally vital to the future of finance. XRP: Connecting Traditional Finance to the Digital Age Aljarrah describes XRP as the bridge between traditional financial infrastructure and the tokenized economy. With its capacity for fast, low-cost, cross-border transactions, XRP is positioned to improve liquidity and scalability across financial systems. RippleNet, the enterprise-grade infrastructure built around XRP, connects banks and financial institutions through a compliant and open network. XRP also supports interoperability with other blockchain networks, positioning it as a key asset for institutions navigating the shift to digital finance. XLM: Advancing Financial Inclusion Globally In contrast, XLM is designed to bring financial services to the underbanked and unbanked . As the native asset of the Stellar network, XLM supports peer-to-peer payments, cross-border remittances, and the issuance of digital assets and stablecoins. Aljarrah pointed to Stellar’s partnerships with institutions such as the IMF and the United Nations as evidence of its commitment to inclusion. Projects like Starlink enable access to financial services in remote areas, making XLM a practical tool for everyday users worldwide. Ripple’s Investment in Stellar-Aligned Infrastructure Aljarrah highlighted Ripple’s involvement in strengthening the Stellar ecosystem through investments in SHX (Stronghold) and the VELO Protocol. Stronghold focuses on secure asset storage, while VELO enables decentralized borrowing and lending, increasing liquidity within the Stellar network. These efforts support both Ripple’s broader infrastructure goals and Stellar’s mission of financial empowerment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP as a Gateway to the Stellar Economy According to Aljarrah, XRP also functions as a liquidity gateway into the XLM ecosystem. Institutional funds often enter the digital space through XRP, which ensures liquidity and regulatory compliance. Once capital is onboarded, XLM takes over to enable efficient, small-scale transactions. This system creates a dual-tiered ecosystem where institutions and individuals can operate seamlessly. Aljarrah described the relationship between XRP and XLM as an infinite cycle. XRP provides liquidity for large-scale movements, while XLM ensures access at the individual level. He sees this structure aligning with the Bank for International Settlements’ vision for a two-tiered monetary system, where traditional and decentralized finance operate side by side. RLUSD and the Path to Tokenized Money Aljarrah also emphasized the importance of stablecoin regulation and the introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD. Pegged to the U.S. dollar, RLUSD represents a major step toward tokenized fiat. It provides a compliant, efficient model for integrating stablecoins into the global economy. With XRP facilitating the liquidity behind RLUSD, the foundation is being laid for a future where digital and fiat currencies coexist in a unified framework. Aljarrah concluded by reinforcing the need to understand XRP and XLM not as competitors but as cooperative forces reshaping finance. Together, they are building an inclusive, compliant, and efficient system for moving value across borders and between people. According to Aljarrah, repetition of these principles is essential—not to restate the obvious, but to ensure clarity as the financial system moves into its next phase.

According to him, XRP might increasingly mirror ETH in price dynamics, as both now function primarily as gas tokens and to support the infrastructure of their ecosystems. With #RLUSD now integrated into Ripple Payments, it’ll be interesting to see if #XRP price dynamics begin to resemble #ETH (aside from sector correlation), as both primarily function as infra/gas now. — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) April 4, 2025 Tokenomics and Fee Structures Compared Vet (@Vet_X0), an XRPL dUNL validator, responded with a comparison of token models. He explained that Ethereum’s fee burn mechanism creates upward price pressure during congestion. XRP, in contrast, uses fee escalation, but not as severe as Ethereum, which could mean lower demand during high-traffic periods. WrathofKahneman noted that XRP could still see high transaction volume if adoption grows rapidly. According to him, “exchanges become the governor before the network,” indicating a different bottleneck compared to Ethereum. Vet agreed but added that significantly more volume than ETH might be required to offset XRP’s more moderate fee dynamics. RLUSD’s Role and Impact on XRP Usage One user questioned XRP’s relevance now that RLUSD offers the same network advantages with less volatility. RLUSD currently has a limited supply, but the commenter asked why anyone would prefer XRP. In response , WrathofKahneman acknowledged a short-term shift but emphasized that XRP’s role as a neutral transfer mechanism remains. He pointed out that the digital asset “powers the network” and that its auto-bridging feature provides valuable liquidity across pairs, especially as more participants join the ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has previously highlighted auto-bridging as an important technological advantage of the digital asset . The CTO noted that if the asset had no advantages and could easily be replaced by RLUSD, it would also lose to other stablecoins regardless of RLUSD’s presence or success. Concerns About Long-Term Utility Another user expressed concern over XRP’s future utility, stating that RLUSD’s introduction made him uneasy. WrathofKahneman replied , stating, “Long run, I think it helps.” He argued that XRP’s current valuation stemmed from limited retail speculation rather than real-world usage. If the network begins seeing real volume, demand for the digital asset could increase substantially. He also addressed the fear that Ripple might be moving away from XRP, clarifying that the digital asset remains an essential part of the infrastructure. Its core function in operating the ledger underpins its value proposition, even as new assets like RLUSD enter the ecosystem. Schwartz and other experts have continually explained XRP’s role in the ecosystem since the announcement of RLUSD in 2024. Both assets will be used where each works best to provide the best experience within the ecosystem.

Over 70% of Binance traders are holding long positions, showing strong confidence in XRP’s future. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights that if XRP stays above $2, it could gain momentum and soar 30% to $2.60. But with so many traders piling into long positions, could a sudden price swing shake things up? 70% Traders Going Bullish on XRP’s Future According to the data shared by Martinez, 4-hour XRP’s long/short ratio has reached 2.37, meaning that traders betting on price increases significantly outnumber those expecting declines. 70.33% of Binance traders with open $XRP futures positions are betting on a price increase! pic.twitter.com/pkoEmI3Ho4 — Ali (@ali_charts) April 6, 2025 Typically, a higher long/short ratio suggests that investors expect the price to rise. However, it can also indicate an overcrowded trade, which sometimes leads to sudden price swings if sentiment shifts unexpectedly. Further, Martinez revealed that 70.33% of accounts were holding long positions, while only 29.67% were shorting the asset. This marks a strong tilt towards optimism among XRP traders. Should Traders Be Cautious? While the bullish sentiment is strong, traders should remain cautious. A high long/short ratio often increases the risk of liquidations, especially if the price moves against the majority. According to Coinglass , XRP saw $3.1 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. Long traders, who expected the price to rise, lost $1.73 million, while short traders, who bet on a price drop, lost $1.36 million. If XRP’s price dips suddenly, leveraged long positions could be forced to close, leading to further declines. XRP Aims for a 30% Surge Further, Martinez suggests that the XRP price is showing strong signs of a potential rally. As per the Martinez 4-hour XRP price chart analysis , XRP is trying to break out of its current consolidation phase. If the price stays above $2, it may attract more buyers, increasing momentum and pushing XRP toward its next major resistance at $2.60—a potential 30% jump from current levels. Right now, XRP is trading around $2.09, down 2% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $121.8 billion.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-06 08:20:27

In a post accompanied by a four-hour chart, Martinez pointed to the $2 level as a decisive support zone. According to him, if XRP can maintain this level, it could lead to a 30% price increase toward $2.6. The chart presents a defined trading channel, with the lower boundary near $2 and the upper resistance line around $2.6. When the chart was published, the digital asset was trading at $2.1297, slightly below the support at $2.13.

His chart illustrates previous reactions near this area, showing price consolidations and rebounds following tests below the $2 zone. The asset tested this level a few days before the news broke that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had dropped its appeal against Ripple. While the asset experienced a brief rebound from this development, it succumbed to bearish pressure from the broader market and retested the $1.9 level again on April 3. In both cases, the asset quickly recovered. If the support remains intact, it could regain its bullish momentum, with $2.60 being the next technical target. Other analysts share the view that XRP is currently in a critical phase that could determine its trajectory, and Martinez’s projection is based on recurring price behavior within the range. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Previous movements between the boundaries have created a recognizable structure that supports his potential 30% upside scenario. The analysis assumes no breakdown below $2, reinforcing the need for continued defense by buyers at this level. Will XRP Experience a Piece Surge? After posting this bullish outlook, Martinez was questioned by a member of the community for what he perceived as a contradiction. The previous day, the analyst shared a bearish view involving a head-and-shoulders pattern . In response, Martinez explained that effective trading involves analyzing multiple possibilities, not fixed predictions. He pointed out that “nothing is 100%” in trading and clarified that the interpretation depends on how the price behaves relative to the support. If XRP breaks below $2, a decline could follow. If it holds, a rebound becomes likely. He noted that while this may sound like a “50/50” scenario to some, understanding the context and price structure differentiates proper analysis from guesswork.

According to his post on X, Ackman, a big supporter of the crypto industry, is now predicting that Trump will postpone the tariffs to make more deals. Bill Ackman is an American hedge fund billionaire who is the founder and chief executive officer of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Ackman has been quite vocal about tariffs in the past, once telling world leaders hoping to strike a deal with Trump to act fast. He noted that the US President loves to make deals and the earlier they make it, the better for all parties. United States President Donald Trump is expected to announce the implementation of his controversial tariffs on April 7, with the US president announcing that all imported goods will be subjected to a universal 10% tariff starting from April 5. The country is also expected to impose harsher tariffs on trading partners with which the US has the largest trading deficits, with those expected to kick in on April 9. However, the billionaire feels like he could pause the said implementations of the tariffs. Bill Ackman predicts postponement of Trump’s tariffs In his post on X, Ackman mentioned the likely outcome that may lead to the postponement, noting that Trump may not have enough time for deals. “One would have to imagine that President Donald Trump’s phone has been ringing off the hook. The practical reality is that there is insufficient time for him to make deals before the tariffs are scheduled to take effect,” Bill Ackman said. “I would, therefore, not be surprised to wake up Monday with an announcement from the President that he was postponing the implementation of the tariffs to give him time to make deals,” Ackman added. He mentioned that the United States’ industrial base has been decimated over many decades, noting that it is important to have a president who finally cares. “President Trump has gotten the world’s and our trading partners’ attention and elevated the importance of resolving an unfair tariff regime that has harmed American workers and decimated our industrial base over many decades. This is a critically important issue that needs to be resolved, and we finally have a president committed to getting this done,” he said. Industry personalities wade into tariff discussions Bill Ackman also highlighted that the current issue cannot be resolved in days, noting that a delay will give the president time to prepare for changes. “The problem, however, can’t be resolved in days, so why wouldn’t a pause make sense to give the president time to properly resolve this critical issue and to allow companies large and small the time to prepare for changes in their supply chains?” he added. Finally, he added that the risks of not taking enough days to access things could prove costly, mentioning that the increase in uncertainty could drive the United States into a potentially severe recession. Noting the significance of Monday, he said, “One thing is for sure. Monday will be one of the more interesting days in our country’s economic history.” After the Trump announcement on April 2, the US stock market shed more value during the April 4 trading session than what the entire crypto market is worth. The fact that crypto performed better than the stock market after the announcement was a talking point for both industry supporters and critics. Popular crypto industry figures like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss recently showed their support for the tariffs. “For 50 years our country has sold out Main Street in favor of Wall Street. Past Presidents have relentlessly pursued globalization deindustrialization policies that favored Capital and decimated the American middle class. Time for change. Tariffs are going to reset bad trade relationships, build back the middle class, and Make America Great Again. If it requires short-term pain in the form of a market selloff for long-term nation-saving gain, then I’m ok with it,” Cameron Winklevoss said in a post on X.

During an interview, Charles Hoskinson presented his plans for integrating Cardano into Bitcoin's decentralized finance (DeFi) environment. This strategy includes bridging Hydra, Cardano’s scaling solution, with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to enhance transaction efficiency. It also enhances its technical foundation with collaboration like with Maestro and uses the Aiken programming language for simplified cross-chain processing. These changes reveal Cardano’s plan for DeFi making it a notable investment as market participants monitor its progress amid macroeconomic shifts. Ripple (XRP) Gains Ground with Regulatory Clarity Ripple (XRP) maintains its trading price at $2.11 while facing reduced daily values of 0.4% and weekly depreciation of 12.8%. Its market indicators signal potential recovery. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin designed for efficient cross-border payments, may benefit from new stablecoin bill regulations currently undergoing review within the U.S. Congress. The proposed legislation has generated optimism in the investment community because analysts expect XRP to reach a price of $2.50 if it is enacted into law. This view is supported by the technical analysis signals where XRP has just recently emerged from a falling wedge pattern supporting a bullish turn. Resistance now stands at $2.21 and the support at $2.02 positioning Ripple as a cryptocurrency with strong fundamentals and growth potential. Ozak AI’s Presale Highlights Investment Appeal Ozak AI’s $OZ token presale, now in its third phase, offers the token at $0.003, a 200% increase from its initial phase. The platform has distributed over 160.43 million tokens, accumulating investor funds exceeding $900,000 based on a token price of $0.001 to $0.003. The project design creates growth opportunities for early investors. The application presents predictive analytics and data vaults for real-time decisions in the financial industry. Even though experts say the $OZ token will climb even higher to $1 by 2025 due to its planned exchange listing price of $0.05, give 50,000% ROI for the early investors. The project design creates transparent expansion possibilities for its first investors. Early-time financial decision-making receives targeted tools from the platform, which consist of AI-driven predictive analytics and secure data vaults. Unlike most projects, Ozak AI is primarily focused on the use of a decentralized approach, especially Arbitrum Orbit for efficient smart contract execution. As Cardano and Ripple continue to develop their ecosystems, Ozak AI becomes a prominent additional investment that remains interested in innovation in the crypto space.

While the price has bounced above the $83K due to a panic rally, fears are still around whether BTC will find stable ground again. And the cryptocurrency market is not the only asset class that has suffered; stocks also cratered as the S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day loss since 2020. Coinbase went down by 7% and MicroStrategy suffered a 10% loss in response to the tariffs. Bitcoin is Yet to Hit a Bottom It was believed a few days ago that Bitcoin had hit the bottom, especially since March 10th, when the world's largest crypto started to create a rising channel. However, that optimism waned after the arrival of a long red day on March 25th. The next three days saw Bitcoin accumulating around the $85K - $86K level, and by 28th March, a massive red candle formed, breaking the rising channel pattern. At the time of writing, the $81.1K mark acts as a crucial support for Bitcoin. Considering that Bitcoin has almost broken down to this level recently, it is getting clear that BTC is yet to hit a bottom. Due to the continued volatile market conditions, the hunt for the best crypto to buy now has become even more critical. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Top 4 Picks With Bitcoin's price moving in an immensely volatile manner—every breakout is quickly followed by steep corrections—it is clear that investing in tokens already live on exchanges may not offer the same upside in current conditions. Therefore, the best cryptos are to be found in crypto presale lists. Their multi-staged structure could offer major gains even before the tokens enter the market, and their listing pumps could also be massive, BTC Bull The volatile market conditions Bitcoin is in do paint a grim picture about its future. However, keep in mind that despite the downturn caused by the recent financial ecosystem, institutional interest remains high. With players from MicroStrategy diving deep into Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs becoming increasingly popular, there is hope for the golden $100K mark to return again. However, it is also important to remember that because the conversation about institutional interest has become so common, sometimes, these conversations don't have much of an impact on BTC price. Therefore, the next best thing is to follow the community sentiment and focus on meme coins that could mobilize the Bitcoin market. BTC Bull is one such project. Designed as an ode to Bitcoin by a community of those bullish about the world's largest crypto, BTC Bull is a social movement. The goal of this project is to create an ecosystem that can directly earn from Bitcoin's growth. This approach is not based on technicalities, but speculation. Every time Bitcoin surges by $25K, BTC Bull will engineer airdrops to provide token holders with free Bitcoins. Token burns will also run parallel to these drops to limit the token supply and push up the BTC Bull price by tapping into a supply-demand dynamic. While BTC Bull is not originally designed with a long-term goal, given that Bitcoin could take some time to reach the $250K level, the token could continue to generate buzz within the cryptocurrency community for years. While there are some apprehensions regarding whether a meme coin could exist for such a long period of time, a strong community can help BTC Bull gain immense popularity among meme coin investors. And with an iconic bull imagery at the center, it could become one of the top meme cryptos in the days to come. YouTubers such as ClayBro are optimistic about BTC Bull, stating that a Bitcoin rebound could lead to this meme coin soaring. SUBBD Bitcoin's current price action has once again drawn eyes towards the speculative nature of most crypto assets. And it has reminded people of the need for a strong utility that could mobilize an asset without purely or exclusively relying on broader market dynamics. SUBBD comes with an answer to provide a decentralized ecosystem for creators. SUBBD is a content creation and sharing platform that deals with the shortcomings of the current centralized ecosystems, such as OnlyFans. For instance, excessive fees, arbitrary bans, warnings, and fragmented AI creation tools don't always make it accessible. With $SUBBD, however, these issues are resolved. AI within the ecosystem streamlines content production, user engagement is enhanced, and payments, thanks to crypto, become frictionless. SUBBD is also defined as an AI hub that offers perks like AI creator tools and an AI personal assistant. It also features gamification and engagement ecosystems, letting users earn from staking rewards as well as experience points. Through the $SUBBD token, users can get access to exclusive content from their creators, and for creators, there is a unique ""Create-to-Earn"" economy. @SUBBDofficial 🍓big things are happening! I’m so proud to be a part of it and change the landscape of content creation 🔥 It’s all about to 🌋 pic.twitter.com/Ti0xsqqR9O — Gabrielle Taylor (@GabbyTaylor_) April 3, 2025 The project has already roped in multiple ambassadors, such as Diana, Brandi Burr, Vaness, Gabrielle Taylor, and more. Over 2,000 top content earning creators will also be coming, with over 250 million combined followers. These stats show that $SUBBD already has the community factor down that could be leveraged to boost the token's value, making it one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025. Mind of Pepe As the community hopes for the current volatility to be followed by a major bull run, eyes are on old strong narratives that once made waves across the cryptocurrency space. One of them is the AI Agent niche, which could resurge thanks to MIND of Pepe . MIND of Pepe is a meme coin with underlying AI fundamentals, focusing on providing users with tools that could help them navigate the market better. The underlying technologies implemented here include real-time intelligence and hive mind analysis, which are instrumental in analyzing the fragmented cryptocurrency market and offering users market insights and early moving opportunities. According to the techmap given on the official website, another utility that MIND of Pepe is offering cuts across token creation and deployment. Furthermore, as an AI agent, it is said to be capable of engaging in thought-provoking conversations around meme coins on social media platforms, including X. Taking these factors into consideration, it is possible that MIND of Pepe could be the best crypto to buy now. Even publications like ICOBench have given a positive prediction in regard to its price action. Solaxy Solaxy is a meme coin project focusing on both meme coin and the Solana narrative. It is designed to provide an L2 solution for the Solana blockchain to make it more efficient. Focusing on a rollup architecture, it aims to evolve Solana and address its issues with scalability. While Solana's co-founder himself has talked about Solana not needing an L2 solution , the community has different ideas. While Solana's high-performance infrastructure has improved a lot, as evidenced by the fact that the only time Solana network was down last year was in early February, an L2 solution will be beneficial for its scalability. And scalability is crucial since the emergence of multiple meme coins could have been the sole reason behind Solana toppling Ethereum as the most sought-after meme coin blockchain in 2024. With Solaxy, the idea is to make the network scalable enough so that more meme coins could emerge, and Solana could achieve more growth. It also offers cross-chain communication and other functionalities that, in the long run, could benefit Solana as well as the broader ecosystem. The token's utility is the perfect counter to Bitcoin's lack of it, making it another altcoin that could rely on technological innovations to grow. Crypto ICOs Provide Haven From the Current Market's Volatility Current market volatility that pushed Bitcoin around the $81K level has created an ecosystem of fear around Bitcoin and other assets that are currently being traded. While this state is not permanent, and there is always hope that the bull run could arrive, investors should consider looking for relatively safer options. Therefore, the best crypto to buy now could be found in crypto ICOs. They offer a safe haven, providing gains outside the market's volatility. While there is still an element of uncertainty surrounding them, they offer a better shot at gains thanks to their use cases and listing pump potential.

Still, the bulls might want to keep an eye on the bond market where dynamics that characterized the COVID crash of March 2020 may be emerging. Nasdaq, Wall Street's tech-heavy index known to be positively correlated to bitcoin, has dropped 11% since President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced reciprocal tariffs on 180 nations, escalating trade tensions and drawing retaliatory levies from China. Other U.S. indices and global markets have also taken a beating alongside sharp losses in the risk currencies like the Australian dollar and a pullback in gold. BTC has largely remained stable, continuing to trade above $80,000, and its resilience is being viewed as a sign of its evolution into a macro hedge. ""The S&P 500 is down roughly 5% this week as investors brace for trade-driven earnings headwinds. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has shown impressive resilience. After briefly dipping below $82,000, it rebounded quickly, reinforcing its status as a macro hedge in times of macroeconomic stress. Its relative strength could continue to attract institutional inflows if broad market volatility persists,"" David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, told CoinDesk in an email. The perception of stability could quickly transform into a self-fulfilling prophecy, solidifying BTC's position as a haven asset for years to come, as MacroScope noted on X. Treasury basis trade risks However, sharp downside volatility in the short term cannot be ruled out, especially as the ""Treasury market basis trade"" faces risks due to heightened turbulence in bond prices. The basis trade involves highly leveraged hedge funds, reportedly operating at leverage ratios of 50-to-1, exploiting minor price discrepancies between Treasury futures and securities. This trade blew up in mid-March 2020 as coronavirus threatened to derail the global economy, leading to a "" dash for cash "" that saw investors sell almost every asset for dollar liquidity. On March 12, 2020, BTC fell by nearly 40%. ""When market volatility spikes - as it is now - it unearths highly leveraged carry trades vulnerable to big market moves. The blowup in the US Treasury market in March 2020, which disrupted basis carry trades, is a recent example. Risk of leveraged carry trade blowups is high...,"" Robin Brooks, managing director and chief economist at the International Institute of Finance, said. The risk is real because, the size of the basis trade as of March end was $1 trillion, double the tally in March 2020. The positioning is such that a one basis point move in Treasury yields (which move opposite to prices) would lead to a $600 million shift in the value of their bets, according to ZeroHedge. So, increased volatility in the Treasury yields could cause a COVID-like blowup, leading to a widespread selling of all assets, including bitcoin, to obtain cash. On Friday, the MOVE index, which represents the options-based implied or expected 30-day volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, jumped 12% to 125.70, the highest since Nov. 4, according to data source TradingView. The gravity of the situation is underscored by a recent Brookings Institution paper , which advises the Federal Reserve to consider targeted interventions in the U.S. Treasury market, specifically supporting hedge funds engaged in basis trading during times of severe market stress. Let's see how things unfold in the week ahead.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Volatility,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-06 08:46:28

The project can be compared to OnlyFans, with the difference being the presence of streamlined tools for content management and fan interaction, and a better ecosystem that gives creators better deals when it comes to monetization. Currently on presale, SUBBD has managed to raise over $40K to date. Considering the current volatile ecosystem, can $SUBBD be the token to make big gains for early investors? What is SUBBD? The global content creation industry is worth $85 billion. However, due to the centralized businesses controlling it, the profits to be earned from this ecosystem are very hegemonized. Creators aren't respected, and are forced to give away 70% of their earnings due to revenue sharing. Policy changes and bans can potentially make them lose control of their earnings, and payment itself has limited flexibility. SUBBD is a decentralized answer to these problems. A web3 ecosystem, it offers an organized structure to investors, wrapped in advanced technologies that could make all end users feel more empowered and productive. The official whitepaper designs it as a convergence between Web3 and AI, which lends to: Creators get more empowered thanks to streamlined content production management and monetization through AI assistance, which lets them focus on the creative tasks more than just focusing on dealing with management issues. Enhanced user engagement as fans can easily access token-gated content, and get AI-driven experience while engaging in real-time interactions with their favorite creators. Frictionless payments become a reality, with the native token – $SUBBD – simplifying subscriptions, exclusive perks, staking and more. SUBBD Token - Utility-Centric Crypto with Benefits for Users and Creators Central to the SUBBD ecosystem is the $SUBBD token, a utility-centric token designed to reward active participation, unlocking premium perks and offering a smooth value exchange. It has different sets of benefits for users and creators. Fans Will Gain a Combination of Exclusive Perks and Content Users can gain access to exclusive content using the $SUBBD token. Many of them will be AI enhanced, not accessible to the general public. As holders, users will also get VIP staking benefits, ranging from APY perks and behind the scenes rewards. $SUBBD token will also be instrumental in offering discounts on the platform, which not only will have content creators hosting live streams, images and more, but will also include platform games and unique interactive features. On top of that, users will also gain access to beta features that will further be enhanced by SUBBD. Another unique feature is the fact that there is no middleman, allowing users to enjoy content while being discreet. Asked the devs if I could accept crypto. They said, “You already do.”No banks. No begging. No names.Just tap, pay, unlock - like nothing ever happened. 🤫SUBBD is built for quiet transactions and loud content. pic.twitter.com/sSjMINjnnT — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) March 31, 2025 Creators Will Gain Tools to Simplify Content Creation and Payments With the $SUBBD token, creators will be able to take part in the platform's unique ""Create to Earn"" ecosystems. Multiple monetization routes will open, ranging from NFT sales to tipping to subscriptions to pay-per-view content. They will also gain access to AI resources that could help make editing tasks simpler, refine compositions, and enhance chat flows. When it comes to payments, SUBBD will offer blockchain-based monetization, allowing creators to retain more revenue from their creations. In addition to these user and creator-exclusive perks, there will also be perks related to voting. Since SUBBD is presented as a decentralized ecosystem, users will be able to gain access to a DAO ecosystem that will allow them to decide which creators are highlighted more, and how the ecosystem develops further.

The leading digital asset lost at least 12% of its value between January and March despite heavy accumulation from corporate entities. The market analytics platform CryptoQuant explained that long-term holders’ on-chain activity is why BTC plummeted significantly despite major corporate buying. Corporate Entities Accumulate Heavily Public companies that have embraced Bitcoin acquired a total of 91,781 BTC in Q1 2025. The business intelligence firm Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) made the highest purchases, totaling 81,785 BTC worth about $8 billion. The entity now holds 528,185 BTC worth $45.64 billion at press time. CryptoQuant said the 8,888 BTC acquisition by the stablecoin issuer Tether was surprising. The purchase brought the company’s BTC stash to 92,646 BTC, valued at approximately $7.96 billion at bitcoin’s current price. Besides Strategy and Tether, other companies that bought BTC include the venture capital firm Metaplanet, healthcare technology provider Semler Scientific, and The Blockchain Group, which develops blockchain technologies for business sectors. Between January and March, Metaplanet topped its bitcoin stash with 2,285 BTC, Semler Scientific acquired 1,108 BTC, while The Blockchain Group purchased 605 BTC. In addition to the acquisitions, a few more companies have revealed plans to acquire BTC in the new quarter. One of them is the leading Bitcoin mining entity Marathon Digital, which unveiled a $2 billion stock sale geared toward buying BTC. Also, the electronics retail company GameStop has proposed a $1.5 billion convertible notes offering to buy BTC after adopting a Bitcoin reserve strategy. Long-term Holders Sold Amid all these acquisitions and BTC purchase announcements, BTC closed Q1 2025 with a negative return of 12%. CryptoQuant attributed the decline to selling activity by long-term holders. The supply of this cohort of investors dropped by 178,000 BTC, adding selling pressure to the cryptocurrency and offsetting the bullish momentum from corporate buys. Moreover, the selling pressure was intensified by outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – investors withdrew at least $4.8 billion from these funds in the first quarter. As the second quarter begins, CryptoQuant sees an impending battle between fresh purchases stemming from corporate demand and selling pressure from existing holders cashing out. It remains to be seen if BTC will end Q2 on a positive note.

The best-selling personal finance author tells his 2.7 million followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the US is staring at the possibility of entering a period of severe economic depression. “In my book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, I warned that the biggest stock market crash in history was going to wipe out the financial security of millions of investors… That stock market crash arrived today. We are definitely in a RECESSION and more than likely…a DEPRESSION.” Kiyosaki says he sees three “non-Wall Street” assets coming out on top amid the stock market collapse. “What can a person do? As I have been suggesting for years, I suggest looking at non-WALL STREET assets. For many years, I have suggested saving real gold, real silver, and today BITCOIN.” Kiyosaki says that the Fed and the Treasury will likely debase the US dollar in an effort to prop up the economy. He notes that dollar debasement will lead to inflation and higher prices for scarce assets like gold, silver and Bitcoin ( BTC ). “WHY: Because after this paper market crash wipes out millions of fake paper assets. Odds are the Fed and Treasury will turn the printing presses on FULL SPEED, printing trillions in fake money, which becomes even more FAKE. And real money – Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin – go up in value. Remember, gold, silver, and Bitcoin ARE NOT going up in price. What is happening is the dollar is going down in value, causing everything of value, such as food, housing and energy to become more expensive, a.k.a. INFLATION… Take care. There are going to be rough storms ahead.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $83,416.

More than $6.2 million has poured into MUTM’s presale across four phases, with 7,900 holders responding positively to its decentralized lending model and organized returns. Currently priced at $0.025, the token is due for a 20% increase to $0.03 in phase five, with early adopters earning immediate returns and a projected exchange debut around $0.06. This migration highlights a larger trend: capital is fleeing speculative tokens on to platforms that are providing real financial solutions. Mutuum Symphony of Growth: Presale Momentum The fourth presale phase of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding this trend, which is quickly heading for a sell out. The lending ecosystem of the project enabling users to borrow, lend and earn as interest mtTokens has hit the right cord. Those early participants who lock in their tokens at $0.025 can look forward to a 140% return at launch, with MUTM listing at $0.06. Though this, analysts charting the platform’s revenue-led buy pressure model — wherein some of the fees are used to buy back tokens — expect that targets could extend to $3.50 and beyond leading up to launch. When applied, such projections are based on the sustainable tokenomics incorporated within the protocol and hint at a potential ROI of 13,900% for phase four investors. MUTM ties its value to mechanics designed to reward sustained holding, not speculative trading, which is what meme coins have become. This makes the overall economy safer and mitigates risks associated with defaults, as its overcollateralized lending model forces borrowers to deposit assets worth more than their loan amounts. At the same time, mtTokens meaning deposited assets such as ETH or DAI accrue interest passively over time (passive income) and can be transferred to any DeFi application. Such dual-purpose usage creates sustained demand for MUTM, as users will either engage in lending pools or customize peer-to-peer loans for unusual assets such as SHIB. The buy-and-distribute mechanism of the protocol also adds another layer of supply pressure as platform revenue is used to buy MUTM to reward stakers. Completion of the Smart Contract Audit In a move furthering investor confidence, Mutuum Finance has set in motion a smart contract audit with CertiK, a milestone which aims to complete in the coming weeks. The move, which comes prior to official announcement of results via social channels, indicates commitment to security which is a paramount issue as the project attains award status. In addition to a $100,000 giveaway for presale participants, these initiatives are serving to increase the FOMO (fear of missing out) for latecomers. As well as a rapidly declining number of phase four slots, the window for purchasing tokens at these prices is closing fast. In a world where platforms like Shiba Inu (SHIB) are forced to come to terms with their own speculative nature, MUTM’s blend of DeFi innovation and real-world utility is revolutionizing the way value is created. For investors looking for assets anchored in utility—and not a passing whim—the presale’s fourth phase is a prudent opportunity. As the project approaches phase five with an increasing price point and exchange listings around the corner each day without action risks losing out on a key opportunity. Take action before Phase Four shuts down Time is critical. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has proven its ability to amass capital and users on a large scale. With structured returns, audited security framework, and revenue-driven tokenomics, the project is primed for explosive growth. Investors who skip this stage will endure higher prices in later rounds — or miss out entirely as the early adopters experience astronomical gains.

Since hitting a local price peak of $29.28 in December, the altcoin has slipped into a downtrend losing over 56% since then. Amid this negative performance, top crypto analyst Ali Martinez postulates LINK could soon experience some short-term price gain. Related Reading: Massive Chainlink Demand Wall At $6.26 As 90K Investors Buy 376M LINK LINK Recovery Depends On Critical Trendline Support In a recent post on X, Martinez shares a positive technical outlook on LINK hinting the altcoin is likely to experience an upswing. This price forecast is based on a crucial ascending trendline that has acted as price support since mid-2023, ensuring a consistent formation of higher lows and higher highs. Based on the trading chart by Martinez, Chainlink is currently heading for a retest with the identified trendline near the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $12.00. If LINK bulls can induce a sufficient surge in demand at this level, the following price bounce could ignite a bullish reversal. Looking at historical price patterns, such a price rally could drive Chainlink’s price to around $19, which represents the next resistance zone. In the presence of robust buying pressure, the altcoin could even rise as high as $30 suggesting a potential 147% price increase on current market prices. On the other hand, a failure to stay above $12.00 would cause an initial price decline to around $10.00, with the potential to trade as low as $5.00.

Chainlink Integrated Into PayPal’s Ecosystem In other news, prominent American payment platform PayPal Holdings has announced the inclusion of Chainlink in its crypto offerings. In a statement released on April 4, PayPal stated that users will now be able to buy, hold, send, and receive Chainlink and Solana (SOL) on both their PayPal and Venmo wallets. This development marks a significant step in the mainstream integration of LINK which is crucial to driving token demand in the future. In addition to both tokens, PayPal also offers users access to Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). At press time, LINK continues to trade at $12.91 reflecting a 0.62% decline in the past 24 hours. On larger time frames, the token maintains a bearish form with losses of 5.03% and 21.81% in the past seven and thirty days respectively. According to data from Coincodex, investor sentiments in the LINK market remain highly bearish with a Fear & Greed Index of 26 signaling near-extreme fear. However, the analysts at this firm foresee a price rebound similar to Martinez’s with a forecast of $15.32 in five days and $17.46 in a month.

On Kalshi, a regulated prediction platform, the probability of a U.S. recession in 2025 now stands at 61%, marking a near-doubling in odds since just March 20. Recession Bets Rise Sharply After Tariff Announcement These figures align closely with rival platform Polymarket , where users have currently priced in a 60% chance that the U.S. will experience two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth—the standard recession definition used by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The sudden shift in sentiment follows Trump’s April 2 executive order imposing broad tariffs on all foreign imports, escalating tensions with key trading partners and sparking panic in capital markets. The fallout has been swift: equities tumbled, volatility surged, and safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin began catching a bid. Here’s What Pompliano Says While the policy move drew immediate criticism from economists and investors alike, some market commentators believe it could be part of a larger political strategy. Notably, Anthony Pompliano, investor and co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, suggested that Trump might be intentionally triggering market instability to push the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates. Pompliano pointed to the decline in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, which dropped from 4.66% in January to 4.00% by April 5, as proof that investor expectations for rate cuts are growing. If Trump’s goal is to weaken the economy just enough to force monetary easing ahead of the election cycle, it may already be working. In an April 4 post on Truth Social, Trump didn’t shy away from pressing the Fed: “This would be a perfect time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates.” Such direct calls to the central bank—especially amid heightened economic uncertainty—are likely to increase pressure on policymakers navigating the delicate balance between inflation control and economic growth.

Ethereum Classic continues to struggle with declining network activity, including daily active addresses, transactions, and transacted value. ETC's fixed supply and low transaction fees pose long-term mining incentive problems, making its future prospects discouraging. Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust trades at a deep discount, but shareholders have no mechanism for redeeming ETC held by the fund. In many ways, 2024 was a year of optimism for cryptocurrencies. By the second half of the year, it became clear that regime change in the United States was looking more likely and digital assets figured to be beneficiaries of a fresh approach to regulations in Washington, DC. But if 2024 was about 'hopes and feels,' I suspect 2025 will be closer to a 'put up or shut up' year. Which is to say, projects, platforms, and tokenized financial products that offer the world legitimate innovation likely need to start taking a share of capital and attention from the ones that don't. Smart contract blockchains can theoretically help bring about that innovation and one such chain that I've covered in the past is Ethereum Classic ( ETC-USD ) . From a philosophical standpoint, readers will get no argument from me that the 'code is law' ethos of ETC is consistent with the ideals held by cypherpunks back in the 1990s. The problem that I've had with ETC for some time is that it is largely a ghost-town of a blockchain network, and I've expressed this through my coverage of the Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust ( ETCG ) and a handful of times. In this article, we'll look at updated network metrics for Ethereum Classic as well as why I still don't think ETCG is worth a long-term investment even at a significant discount to Net Asset Value. Ethereum Classic Network Activity Continues to Fall When looking at networks like Ethereum Classic, I primarily focus on these key metrics; users (daily active addresses), transactions, transacted value, and fees paid to the network's validators. Together, these give us a bird's-eye view of how well a network is growing in usage and whether stakers/miners have a strong incentive to participate. Ethereum Classic's story here has typically been poor and that remains the case today. 30 Day Average DAAs ( Coin Metrics ) Ethereum Classic's daily active users have fallen by 12% year to date and 35% over the last year. Perhaps more concerning, the starting point for this chain in our twelve-month measurement was just 17.5k DAAs. This is not indicative of a large user base and at just 11.3k DAAs on average at the end of March, ETC usage is at the lowest level it has been in four full years. 30 Day Average Tx ( Coin Metrics ) It's generally the same story for transactions where at 25k per day, usage is down 32% over the last year and is again near levels not seen since 2021. 30 Day Average Transferred Value ( Coin Metrics ) Dollar-denominated transferred value of $11.2 million per day at the end of March was down 80% from the same time in 2024. You can see in the chart above that this metric has times of big spikes higher and then typically reverses back down to the $10 million range and lower. I could show you the chart for fees but the daily take for miners from fees is generally three figures or less for the entire network. This is not a blockchain that is driven by fees for transactions; 99.9% of miner revenue comes from supply issuance rather than user payments. Like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), this will have a shelf-life because unlike Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), ETC has a fixed supply of 210.7 million coins - of which 71.9% are currently in the circulating supply. While there is certainly some token issuance runway remaining for the miners that still secure Ethereum Classic, the clock is ticking to find a product-market fit with users. Ethereum Classic Coin/Chain Rank Value Market Capitalization 37 $2.4 billion Total Value Locked 219 $298,388 Stablecoin Supply 118 $71,397 Sources: DeFi Llama, CoinMarketCap - as of 4/5/25 At a $2.4 billion coin market capitalization and less than $300k in total value locked, ETC trades at an 8,083 MC/TVL ratio. ETH trades at a 4.3 MC/TVL ratio. For a smart contract blockchain, I think it's safe to call ETC incredibly overvalued. Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust Perhaps to no real surprise, given the lack of usage of the underlying network, the price performance of ETC has been driven largely by hype cycles in the broader digital asset market. Interestingly, the ETCG price has held up better than ETC over the last 3 years - though it is still down over 55% in 36 months: Data by YCharts The key variable here is that the fund continues to trade with an enormous 47% discount to net asset value. This discount has certainly been worse through the years. During the 'Crypto Winter' of 2022, the NAV discount rate briefly bottomed out at 77% on December 29th, 2022: Data by YCharts Traders lucky enough to buy that NAV rate low during the second to last market session of 2022 did indeed see returns as high as 300-400% between 2023 and 2024. But it's important to remember there really wasn't anything in the fundamental network data that justified such returns. Countertrend rallies can be strong when sentiment gets as bad as it was at the end of 2022. Sentiment in the market is indeed pessimistic once again with a Crypto Fear & Greed index that closed at 28 on Friday, April 4th: ETCG Daily Chart (TrendSpider) Furthermore, RSI-14 is also in oversold territory technically. However, there are additional points to consider before jumping into a prospective contrarian trade in ETCG. Grayscale's share of the total ETC coin supply is higher than what the company typically holds through similar funds. We can see this clearly when we compare ETCG to the Grayscale Litecoin Trust ( OTCQX:LTCN ) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust ( OTCQX:BCHG ): Fund Data ETCG LTCN BCHG Grayscale Coin Holdings 11,191,338 2,030,972 390,871 Total Coin Supply 151,403,828 75,558,468 19,851,934 Grayscale Share of Supply 7.39% 2.69% 1.97% AUM $181m $171.3m $116.9m Sources: Grayscale, CoinMarketCap Grayscale is holding 11.2 million ETC tokens. That amounts to 7.4% of the total coin supply for ETC. Grayscale's share of Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) are considerably smaller even though the funds themselves are similarly sized by assets under management. Essentially, Grayscale is arguably a larger than normal influence over the direction of ETC since it has essentially locked 7.4% of the token supply. As a closed end fund, ETCG shareholders have no redemption mechanism when the NAV rate gets as low as it is now. A 47% discount might be too low. But remember, a 47% NAV rate discount can always go lower. Closing Summary Like many of the competing L1 blockchains in the market, Ethereum Classic has been experiencing declines in usage over the last several years. We can see this through raw numbers like daily addresses, transactions, as well as transferred value on the network. Unless ETC benefits from a significant turnaround in interest from the market for the blockchain network, Ethereum Classic has a long-term mining incentive problem because token supply is fixed and revenue paid to miners will eventually run out without fees paid by users. In my view, the long-term prospects for ETC are not encouraging. I suspect this is why even when other single-asset crypto funds managed by Grayscale traded at large premiums during 2024, ETCG continued to trade at a deep discount. Grayscale holds a large portion of the total ETCG supply. One could argue the fund itself is actually one of the reasons why the price of ETC hasn't fallen even further than it already has. I'll reiterate that I believe ETCG is a long-term sell even at a 47% discount to NAV. You could probably entertain a contrarian swing trade in the fund with a shorter term bias. But the reality is that ETC is a currency that lives on a chain with almost no usage.",ETC-USD|ETCG,EN,0,0,BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|ETC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-06 09:42:45

Ethereum’s recent challenges, including a significant 45% drop in Q1 2025, have left many seeking a more promising alternative. Coldware (COLD) , with its innovative solutions and growth potential, has become the go-to choice for many Ethereum whales looking for higher returns and a more stable blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum’s Struggles and the Market Context Ethereum has long been one of the leading cryptocurrencies, thanks to its smart contract capabilities and massive ecosystem. However, the past few months have been tough for the network, with ETH failing to hold its $1,800 support zone. As of now, Ethereum's price continues to struggle, dropping to around $1,809, reflecting a broader market downturn. Investors have expressed concern about the network’s stagnation despite Ethereum's dominance in the market. At the same time, many Ethereum whales have begun to diversify their portfolios, and a large portion of this capital is flowing into Coldware (COLD) , a next-generation blockchain platform that offers significant advantages over Ethereum. This movement has been driven by Coldware (COLD) potential for providing low-cost, fast transactions and high scalability – features that Ethereum currently struggles to deliver. While Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade, set to launch on May 7, 2025, aims to address several technical issues, many investors see Coldware as a much-needed alternative that could shake up the market. What Is the Pectra Upgrade? Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, which combines the Prague and Electra enhancements, promises to address some of Ethereum's key issues, such as performance bottlenecks and staking process improvements. Despite this effort, there is growing skepticism about whether these updates will be enough to maintain Ethereum’s dominance in the crypto space. For instance, the introduction of smart accounts and the increase in validator staking limits are critical for attracting larger investors. However, the reality remains that Ethereum faces intense competition from emerging blockchain platforms like Coldware (COLD) , which are already addressing scalability and transaction efficiency from the ground up. Coldware (COLD) has been gaining increasing interest for its focus on providing seamless mobile-friendly applications and offering a better decentralized financial ecosystem. While Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade will surely help the network, it is still playing catch-up with Coldware (COLD) 's innovations, particularly in sectors like Internet of Things (IoT) and cross-border payments. Coldware (COLD): A New Era in Blockchain Technology Where Ethereum has long struggled with high transaction fees and scalability issues, Coldware (COLD) is presenting a refreshing solution to these problems. With its focus on mobile adoption and ease of use, Coldware aims to integrate cryptocurrency into the daily lives of users. This forward-thinking approach has attracted the attention of Ethereum whales, who are increasingly flocking to Coldware (COLD) to take advantage of its growing ecosystem. Coldware (COLD) offers a more secure, cost-efficient, and scalable alternative to Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum’s reliance on Ethereum 2.0 upgrades to address these problems, Coldware was built with these challenges in mind from the beginning. Its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism ensures that Coldware can scale seamlessly and securely, making it the go-to blockchain for developers and businesses seeking efficiency. Can Ethereum’s Price Recover After Pectra? While there is growing optimism around the upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade, many investors are beginning to question whether this will be enough to maintain Ethereum’s position as a market leader. Ethereum’s struggle to remain relevant amidst fierce competition from the likes of Coldware (COLD) may not just be a passing phase. The lack of scalability and high transaction fees have continued to plague Ethereum, making it less appealing for large-scale projects and institutional investors. Coldware (COLD) , by contrast, offers a blockchain platform that is fast, secure, and ideal for microtransactions, all of which are crucial for the next generation of blockchain-based applications. Investors, particularly whales, are increasingly betting on Coldware (COLD) 's ability to outperform Ethereum by providing innovative solutions that Ethereum’s existing infrastructure is struggling to deliver. As Ethereum continues to face challenges, Coldware (COLD) is quietly positioning itself as a superior alternative. The Road Ahead for Coldware (COLD) While Ethereum's price may stabilize and see some growth post-Pectra, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, especially as Coldware (COLD) continues to grow in influence. With its superior mobile solutions, enhanced transaction speeds, and strong security measures, Coldware (COLD) stands to capture significant market share in the blockchain and crypto industries. As Ethereum faces more competition and struggles to break free from its limitations, Coldware (COLD) is already on track to become the next major cryptocurrency platform for investors and businesses looking for more scalable and cost-effective solutions. The future of blockchain technology may very well be Coldware (COLD) as the cryptocurrency industry seeks better alternatives to Ethereum.

Despite its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has seen a massive drop in value, falling 45% in Q1. As the broader market struggles, Ethereum holders are looking for alternative opportunities, and many are turning their attention to Coldware (COLD) , a new blockchain platform making waves in the presale space. With Ethereum's failure to hold key support zones and a prolonged bearish trend, Coldware's presale success is rapidly accelerating, raising more than $2 million in the process. Coldware’s Rapid Growth Amid Ethereum’s Decline As Ethereum faces these challenges, newer blockchain platforms like Coldware (COLD) are gaining traction. Coldware (COLD) has captured the attention of many Ethereum holders who are seeking opportunities in the presale space. With Ethereum’s prolonged decline, Coldware’s presale has surged, raising more than $2 million to date. The innovative blockchain platform, with its focus on scalability, low fees, and hybrid solutions for both traditional finance and decentralized finance, has struck a chord with investors. Coldware (COLD) is quickly positioning itself as a solid alternative to Ethereum, offering potential solutions to the scalability issues that Ethereum continues to struggle with. Unlike Ethereum, Coldware’s hybrid approach ensures that both decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance systems can coexist seamlessly, providing a unique value proposition to a wide range of investors. Ethereum's Recent Price Action: A Deeper Dive Ethereum's (ETH) price has been under intense pressure throughout 2025, with the ETH price dropping from over $3,300 at the beginning of the year to just above $1,800 by April 5. The cryptocurrency has endured a series of downward movements, highlighting the fragility of its position in a bear market. This price drop has coincided with a 45% decline in the first quarter, fueled in part by reduced transaction fees, a slowing burn rate, and an increasing shift to Layer-2 (L2) networks. The downturn has raised questions about the sustainability of Ethereum’s price and the overall viability of its existing market structure. Ethereum's transaction fees have plummeted, with a significant decrease in on-chain activity, further undermining investor confidence. This is compounded by Ethereum's inflation concerns, as a slower burn rate could lead to an oversupply of ETH, which could undermine its value. Ethereum’s Shift to Layer-2 and Reduced Burn Rate One of the key factors contributing to Ethereum's (ETH) current struggles is the rise of Layer-2 solutions. These networks, built atop Ethereum, offer faster and cheaper transactions, diverting a significant portion of Ethereum’s transaction volume away from its mainnet. As a result, Ethereum’s fees have dropped to their lowest level since 2020, marking a shift in how users interact with the network. The decline in Ethereum's on-chain activity has exacerbated concerns about the token’s future inflation. DeFi platforms like Uniswap, MetaMask, and Tether, which were once major contributors to Ethereum’s burn mechanism, have seen their burn rates fall by up to 99% in recent months. This indicates that Ethereum’s ability to reduce its circulating supply is weakening, potentially leading to increased inflation, further undermining its value in the eyes of investors. Ethereum's Upcoming Pectra Upgrade: Can It Turn the Tide? Despite these challenges, Ethereum developers are pinning their hopes on the upcoming Pectra upgrade, set to go live on May 7, 2025. The upgrade is designed to address some of Ethereum’s most pressing issues, such as transaction speed, staking efficiency, and wallet usability. Key changes include the introduction of smart accounts and a significant increase in the staking limit for validators. These enhancements aim to improve user experience and make Ethereum more attractive to large holders, potentially increasing institutional involvement. The Pectra upgrade could play a pivotal role in reversing Ethereum’s declining momentum. If successful, it might restore confidence in Ethereum's long-term potential, attracting both retail and institutional investors back into the fold. However, the question remains: Will the improvements be enough to counteract the broader market downturn and Ethereum's own internal struggles? Why Coldware is Gaining Attention Coldware’s success in its presale is a testament to the growing demand for innovative blockchain platforms. As Ethereum’s price struggles to maintain momentum, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself to capture market share with its cutting-edge technology. Ethereum’s problems, including network congestion, high fees, and slow transaction speeds, have pushed investors to explore alternatives. Coldware’s unique features, including its focus on scalability and hybrid blockchain solutions, make it an attractive option for both retail and institutional investors. Moreover, Ethereum whales, who have watched the Ethereum network’s decline over the past few months, are increasingly turning to Coldware as a potential investment opportunity. Coldware’s ability to address some of the major challenges Ethereum faces has led many to view it as a viable alternative for the future of decentralized finance. Conclusion: Ethereum vs. Coldware—The Future of Blockchain As Ethereum faces a period of uncertainty, with its price continuing to fall and transaction activity declining, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a promising contender in the blockchain space. Ethereum's Pectra upgrade may offer some hope for recovery, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to reverse the downward trend. Meanwhile, Coldware's presale success and growing interest from Ethereum investors suggest that it could be the blockchain platform of the future. For investors seeking alternatives to Ethereum, Coldware presents a compelling case. Its innovative solutions, lower fees, and hybrid model offer significant potential for long-term growth. As Ethereum continues to struggle, Coldware (COLD) 's rise could signal a new chapter for blockchain technology, offering investors a chance to be part of the next big thing in crypto.

The report emphasized that the US economy has entered a serious slowdown. JPMorgan has lowered its 2025 real GDP growth forecast for the US from +1.3% to -0.3%. This sharp revision points to the extent of the expected contraction in the economy. The report also forecasts that the unemployment rate will rise to 5.3%. The main reason for this increase is the weakening of economic activity. Due to the newly implemented tariffs, the core personal consumption expenditures (Core PCE) inflation forecast, which measures price increases on core goods and services, was also revised upward. JPMorgan projects core PCE inflation at 4.4% for the end of the year. This increase of 1.4 percentage points from the previous forecast indicates that inflation is running above expectations. Related News: A New Motion Filed in the Ripple-SEC Case as ""Urgent"": Allegedly “Decisive Evidence” The report states that the Fed could start cutting interest rates starting in June. JPMorgan predicts that interest rates will be cut at every meeting until January 2026, and that the upper limit of the federal funds rate could fall to 3.0% at the end of this process. However, it is stated that the real risk is not taking early steps, but a possible delay. The new tariffs are expected to prompt retaliatory measures from major trading partners, particularly China. This poses a risk of reduced US exports. In addition, high inflation is expected to erode real (inflation-adjusted) incomes and cause households to cut back on their spending. In an environment of increasing uncertainty, consumers may be reluctant to continue spending using their savings. According to JPMorgan, economic weakness will be particularly evident in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Growth may weaken further in these periods as temporary dynamics such as strong imports and inventory accumulation in the first quarter fade away. JPMorgan Chief Economist Michael Feroli sees the current picture as a classic case of “stagflation”: high inflation, low growth and rising unemployment. However, Feroli says that the weakening of the labor market could ease the Fed's concerns about combating inflation, and that monetary policy could become more flexible, especially if wage growth slows. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s what happens,https://cointelegraph.com/news/automated-crypto-trades-with-grok-3?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Key takeaways Grok 3 adjusts its predictions based on evolving market trends by analyzing real-time data patterns. Combining technical analysis with sentiment data improves accuracy; Grok 3 effectively identifies potential trade opportunities. Backtesting strategies before live trading is crucial; testing Grok 3’s prompts using historical data helps refine conditions and improve performance. While Grok 3 can automate trades, human oversight remains critical in adapting to unexpected market conditions. Crypto trading is complex. Prices can swing wildly, and even experienced traders struggle to keep up. That’s why automation tools are gaining attention, with many now exploring Grok 3, an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model from xAI (founded by Elon Musk). Grok 3 wasn’t built specifically for trading, but its ability to analyze data, spot patterns and interpret trends has encouraged traders to test it for automated strategies. The idea is simple: Let Grok 3 make data-driven decisions, removing the emotional guesswork that often leads to poor trades. But does it actually work? Some traders report impressive results, while others find it unpredictable, especially in volatile markets. This article digs into what happens when you automate crypto trades with Grok 3. From successful strategies to unexpected risks, you’ll get a clear picture of what to expect, plus actionable tips to improve your results. What is Grok 3 and how does it relate to crypto trading? Grok 3 is an AI model designed by xAI, an artificial intelligence company founded by Elon Musk. While its primary focus is natural language processing, some traders are now testing Grok 3 as a potential tool for improving crypto trading strategies. Unlike traditional trading bots operating on rigid rules, Grok 3’s flexible design allows it to analyze diverse data sources and uncover patterns that might be overlooked. Why some traders are turning to Grok 3 Grok 3’s appeal lies in its ability to handle complex data, a crucial advantage in crypto markets, where price moves are often triggered by unexpected events or sentiment shifts . Here’s where traders say Grok 3 has potential: Identifying market sentiment trends: Crypto markets are heavily influenced by emotions like FOMO (fear of missing out) and FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). Grok 3 can analyze social media, news headlines and community discussions to assess changing sentiment, a key factor in crypto volatility. Recognizing hidden patterns: Grok 3’s machine learning capabilities allow it to detect subtle correlations between indicators that traditional bots may overlook. For instance, Grok 3 may link an increase in social sentiment with rising whale activity to predict bullish momentum. Flexible analysis based on prompts: Rather than following static rules like “Buy when RSI falls below 30,” Grok 3 enables traders to design more complex strategies using natural language instructions. What happens when Grok 3 is used to automate crypto trades? Grok 3 isn’t your typical crypto trading bot. It doesn’t place trades directly or integrate with exchanges on its own. But it can help traders build smarter, faster and more flexible automation systems. From writing trade logic to analyzing market sentiment , Grok 3 is already being used in the real world to streamline how crypto strategies are created and tested. Instead of manually scripting every piece of logic, traders are now using Grok 3 to generate working code for bots. For example, a user asked Grok 3 to write token buy/sell logic with parameters like slippage, take-profit and gas priority fees. It generated a script that can be plugged into DeFi tools or expanded with 0x and Uniswap APIs. Some traders use Grok 3 to build end-to-end bots tailored to niche tokens or specific strategies. In another example, Grok 3 was used to create an automated system that scans price action and triggers trades under strict conditions. It doesn’t just stop at buy/sell logic. Grok also writes portfolio rebalancing scripts and can simulate how positions would perform under different volatility conditions. Here is an example of a prompt fed into Grok 3, along with the output received. Grok 3’s response: High-frequency trading bot framework for Solana (SOL) Below is a structured outline for a high-frequency trading bot framework designed for Solana (SOL), focusing on one-minute price fluctuations, risk management and trade execution. This outline provides a modular structure with placeholders for key components, avoiding specific implementation details as requested. 1. Core configuration Purpose : Define global settings and constants for the bot. Components : Solana network endpoint (e.g., mainnet RPC URL) Wallet configuration (private key or keypair for trading) Trading pair (e.g., SOL/USDC) Timeframe (one-minute candlestick data) Trade size ($100 per position) Max trades (10 concurrent or sequential positions) Profit target ($50 total) Max loss per trade ($20) 2. Data acquisition module Purpose : Fetch and process real-time SOL price data. Components : WebSocket connection to Solana blockchain or exchange API (e.g., Serum, Raydium, or centralized exchange like Binance) 1-minute OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data stream Data buffer for storing recent price history Error handling for connection drops or latency 3. Volatility analysis module Purpose : Assess SOL’s price volatility to inform trade decisions. Components : Placeholder: Calculate short-term volatility (e.g., standard deviation or ATR over one-minute candles) Placeholder: Define volatility thresholds (e.g., high/low volatility states) Output: Volatility score or signal to adjust trade frequency/size 4. Trade signal generator Purpose : Generate buy/sell signals based on price fluctuations. Components : Placeholder: Simple momentum strategy (e.g., price crossing a short-term moving average) Placeholder: Filter signals using volatility analysis Signal validation (e.g., avoid over-trading within one-minute window) Output: Buy/sell signal with timestamp 5. Risk management module Purpose : Enforce risk controls and position limits. Components : Position size calculator (fixed at $100 per trade) Max loss check ($20 per trade stop-loss) Total profit/loss tracker (halt at $50 profit or after 10 trades) Concurrent trade limiter (cap at 10 active positions) Emergency stop (pause bot on extreme volatility or connectivity loss) 6. Trade execution module Purpose : Execute trades on the Solana blockchain or exchange. Components : Placeholder: Build Solana transaction (e.g., swap SOL for USDC via a DEX like Raydium) Order type (market order for speed in one-minute timeframe) Slippage tolerance (e.g., 0.5% max slippage) Transaction signing and submission Confirmation listener (await transaction finality) Error handling (e.g., retry on failed execution) 7. Performance monitoring module Purpose : Track and log bot performance in real time. Components : Trade log (entry price, exit price, profit/loss, timestamp) Running total profit/loss calculator Performance metrics (e.g., win rate, average trade duration) Alert system (notify on profit target, max loss, or errors) 8. Main control loop Purpose : Orchestrate bot operations in a continuous cycle. Components : Initialize bot (load config, connect to data feed) Loop: Fetch one-minute price data Analyze volatility Generate trade signal Apply risk management checks Execute trade if conditions met Update performance metrics Exit conditions (profit target hit, max trades reached, or manual stop) 9. Shutdown and cleanup Purpose : Safely terminate the bot and finalize operations. Components : Close open WebSocket connections Finalize pending transactions Save trade log and performance summary Release resources (e.g., memory, wallet connections) Notes This framework assumes integration with Solana’s ecosystem (e.g., using a DEX or liquidity pool). Adjust the execution module if targeting a centralized exchange. Volatility analysis and signal generation are left as placeholders for customization (e.g., technical indicators or machine learning models). Risk management is strict to align with the $50 profit goal and $20 max loss per trade, ensuring the bot operates within defined boundaries. Caution! The above is a tailored outline shaped by the user’s prompt, targeting one-minute price fluctuations, risk management and trade execution. Its output varies with prompt detail, as specificity sharpens results. Moreover, placeholders like volatility analysis await user customization, reflecting Grok 3’s adaptive learning. It’s a conceptual guide, not code, and success hinges on implementation and market conditions. For deeper refinement, such as Solana-specific tweaks, users can provide more context. Grok 3 adjusts using their input and its latest insights. Let’s learn the general steps required to set up Grok 3 for automated crypto trading. How to set up Grok 3 for automated crypto trading Setting up Grok 3 for AI-powered crypto trading automation isn’t as straightforward as installing a typical trading bot. Since Grok 3 wasn’t built for direct trading, it requires thoughtful setup, integration and customization. Below is a practical guide to setting up Grok 3 effectively for automated crypto trading with AI (artificial intelligence). Step 1: Choosing a compatible trading platform Since Grok 3 doesn’t connect directly to crypto exchanges, it requires integration with third-party platforms that support API automation. Platforms like: 3Commas : Ideal for executing trades via automated strategies. TradingView : Used for generating trade signals using Pine Script. CryptoHopper : Offers custom strategy-building tools with API integration. Ensure that the chosen platform offers robust API support for managing trade execution, setting risk controls and tracking performance. Step 2: Integrating Grok 3 with the trading platform Grok 3 doesn’t connect directly to crypto exchanges; integration requires creative workarounds: API integration via automation tools: Platforms like Zapier or Make.com can connect Grok 3’s analysis to trading platforms. Custom Python scripts: For tech-savvy traders, Grok 3's insights can be processed through Python scripts that execute trades based on Grok 3’s recommendations. No-code automation tools: Services like IFTTT can trigger basic trading actions based on Grok 3’s sentiment analysis. Step 3: Defining trading strategies with Grok 3 Grok 3’s success hinges on well-defined strategies. Unlike traditional bots that rely solely on technical signals, Grok 3 crypto trading bot can combine multiple factors, including: Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc. Sentiment analysis: Social media trends, influencer opinions and news headlines Onchain data: Whale activity , exchange inflows/outflows and large wallet movement. Step 4: Backtesting strategies before live trading Before deploying Grok 3’s strategy in live markets, backtesting is essential to evaluate its performance. Backtesting can reveal: Accuracy of trade signals: Identify how often Grok 3’s suggested trades align with profitable outcomes. False signal detection: Ensure Grok 3 isn’t generating excessive buy/sell recommendations in volatile or stagnant markets Refinement opportunities: Fine-tune conditions such as RSI thresholds, sentiment scores or trade exit conditions Examples of tools for backtesting include TradingView and CryptoQuant. Step 5: Implementing risk management controls Even with solid insights, crypto markets are unpredictable. Adding risk controls minimizes potential losses: Stop-loss orders: Automatically exits trades if prices move beyond a set threshold . Position limits: Restricts trade size to reduce exposure in uncertain markets. Trailing stops: Locks in profits during upward trends while minimizing downside risk. Example of risk control prompt: “Write a code to handle buying and selling a token with the given parameters, including priority fees, slippage, and a take-profit mechanism.” Please note that the output shown above is not complete and is provided for illustration purposes only. Step 6: Ongoing monitoring and strategy refinement Grok 3’s strength lies in its adaptability, but it requires ongoing monitoring to ensure optimal results. Regularly review: Performance data: Assess win rates, profit margins and signal accuracy. Market conditions: Adjust strategy if major shifts (e.g., regulatory changes or macroeconomic factors) impact sentiment or momentum. Pro tip: Revisiting Grok 3’s prompts regularly can refine strategy outcomes and improve long-term performance. Limitations of Grok 3 Despite its strengths, Grok 3 has limitations that traders must consider. Data loss: Crypto trading thrives on accurate and real-time data. However, crypto trading automation with Grok 3 has been reported to lose chunks of data, miscount words and provide incorrect time references, which can be detrimental in a fast-moving market and result in inaccurate signal detection, delayed responses to market events and flawed strategy execution. No direct exchange integration: Unlike purpose-built trading bots, Grok 3 doesn’t connect directly to crypto exchanges. Traders must rely on third-party platforms to execute trades. Forgetfulness: One of the biggest frustrations highlighted by some users is Grok 3’s “retrograde amnesia,” when it forgets everything from previous sessions. For crypto traders, this is a nightmare. Imagine building a trading strategy and needing Grok 3 to remember past trends and conversations, only for it to start fresh each session. Bias: Grok 3 may deliver biased responses, potentially relying on incomplete or skewed sources. For traders who depend on unbiased sentiment analysis to gauge market mood, this shift could lead to misleading insights and poor decision-making. Slower execution speed: Since Grok 3 processes information based on detailed prompts, its trade signals may lag behind fast-moving price changes. Prompt dependence: Grok 3’s accuracy depends heavily on well-structured prompts. Vague or incomplete instructions often produce unreliable results. While Grok-3 and other AI systems offer powerful tools for automating crypto trades, caution is essential.

With just hours to go before the next phase of tariffs is set to hit some of America’s largest trade partners, Ackman believes Trump might opt for a calculated pause. Trump to Delay Implementation? In a post on X dated April 5, the Pershing Square Capital Management founder noted, “One would have to imagine that President Trump’s phone has been ringing off the hook. The practical reality is that there is insufficient time for him to make deals before the tariffs are scheduled to take effect.” Trump’s executive order, signed on April 2, introduced a 10% baseline tariff on all imports, effective April 5. But harsher tariffs—targeting countries like China and Germany—are slated to begin April 9, unless Trump changes course. Ackman argues that the delay could serve a dual purpose: it would not only buy time for trade negotiations, but also help avoid an economic shock that could send companies and consumers reeling. Crypto Holds Strong as Stocks Stumble Interestingly, while traditional markets have been jittery since the announcement, crypto assets have shown surprising resilience. The U.S. stock market lost more in value during trading on April 4 than the entire crypto market’s worth. That divergence hasn’t gone unnoticed. Ackman, who voiced strong support for the crypto industry after the collapse of FTX in 2022 , now finds himself on the same page as other crypto power players. Arthur Hayes and Cameron Winklevoss—co-founders of BitMEX and Gemini, respectively—have also recently backed Trump’s trade policies , seeing them as part of a global economic shift that may favor decentralized assets. According to Ackman, Trump pausing tariffs would be a rational move economically. “The risk of not doing so is that the massive increase in uncertainty drives the economy into a recession , potentially a severe one,” he warned. With markets bracing and political pressure mounting, Ackman expects April 7 to be a pivotal moment. “One of the more interesting days in U.S. economic history,” he called it. Whether Trump pivots or powers ahead, the impact on both global trade and crypto markets could be profound.

After riding one of the most explosive meme coin rallies in history, they’re now setting their sights on the next big thing—Lightchain AI. With an impressive $18.9 million already raised in its presale and a token price of just $0.007, Lightchain AI is quickly capturing the attention of SHIB whales and savvy early investors. So, what’s driving all this buzz? It’s the cutting-edge tech behind the project—and the huge potential for massive returns. The question is – will you seize the moment? From Memes to Machines – Why SHIB Holders Are Moving Into AI The meme coin hype was fun, but even the most loyal Shiba Inu holders are now chasing more than just community and vibes. They’re looking for innovation. Real-world utility. Scalable infrastructure. Enter Lightchain AI —a project that doesn’t just ride trends but defines them. This isn’t just another Ethereum-based altcoin. Lightchain AI merges artificial intelligence with blockchain through a revolutionary architecture built for performance, decentralization, and long-term growth. SHIB investors know potential when they see it—and this is tech they don’t want to miss. What Makes Lightchain AI So Special? Lightchain AI is changing the game by combining AI with blockchain technology to solve big challenges like scalability, governance, and privacy. With a fresh approach, it’s leading the way in creating real-world applications across industries, making blockchain more practical and widely useful. By using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Lightchain AI removes bottlenecks in block processing, allowing for smooth, fast, and efficient transactions and AI computations. It’s smarter, faster, and way more efficient than traditional blockchain models. This isn’t just cutting-edge tech—it’s the future of infrastructure , and it’s no wonder investors are keeping a close eye on its groundbreaking potential! Why Get In Now? Timing Is Everything The Lightchain AI presale is on fire, with $18.9 million already raised and the crypto crowd buzzing. Early birds (including those savvy SHIB veterans) are snapping up $LCAI at just $0.007—talk about a steal! What makes $LCAI so spicy? Its deflationary tokenomics. Every transaction fee and AI task payment burns a slice of the supply, making the remaining tokens rarer than a mint-condition Charizard. Less supply, more potential value—sounds like a win-win. Don’t wait until it’s $0.07 or $7.

Right now, in Phase 4, tokens are available for just $0.025 – but when Phase 5 opens, the price will jump 20% to $0.03. It is an urgency-driven model that has already seen predictions of a 140% return on its $0.06 exchange listing and post-launch estimates even reaching as high as $3.50. In contrast to Ripple (XRP), which is still tied to traditional banking partners, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seeks high-growth status through decentralized lending, algorithmic buy pressure, and real-world utility. Presale Momentum, with Immediate ROI Pathways Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stage 4 of its presale is moving swiftly as investors acquire tokens to benefit from ascending price values. Precise entry at $0.025 enables buyers to generate a 140% profit from listing then wait for a 20% profit boost to $0.03 which indicates accelerated action in the upcoming Phase 5. The tokenomics shows a definite upward trajectory since $0.06 launch price guarantees instant profits but specialists envision $3.50 as the long-term target because adoption rates are projected to rise rapidly. A current $1,000 investment will reach $2,400 at launch then experience the opportunity to generate $140,000 if Bitcoin-based targets are achieved post-launch. The Ripple (XRP) network faces resistance from regulatory forces as well as unexciting price movements because it stays below its $3 threshold. Strong potential for gains exists exclusively on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) since the platform operates without institutional approval requirements. Demand Drivers are Built into the Business Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a self-sustainable ecosystem. Its buy-and-distribute model allocates platform revenue towards repurchasing tokens and redistributing them to mtToken stakers. This ensures perpetual buy pressure to counter coinciding volatility in the market. mtTokens – yield-bearing assets such as mtETH or mtDAI – appreciate over time, making it possible to earn passive income without selling off the portfolio. Loans are overcollateralized, adding further stability to the protocol. Borrowers must lock assets equal to 140% of the loan values, so default risks are mitigated, while liquidity pools are balanced. Meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) see their utility increase – attracting a narrow audience still excluded by traditional platforms – through emerging peer-to-peer lending alternatives. Upgrading security — and providing incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the process of completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, which will go a long way in building investor confidence. Results pending, but the initiative reflects a commitment to transparency — in contrast to Ripple’s ongoing SEC litigation. Engagement heightens with a $100k giveaway for presale participants, rewarding 10 investors with $10k each. This mechanism not only enhances platform visibility but also encourages long-term commitment, creating synergy between user success and platform growth. Last Call Before Phase 5 Just Blast Off the Price What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an undeniable DeFi 2023 candidate is the merging of DeFi innovation and mathematical certainty by providing definite quantifiable gains unlike miscalculation speculators like Ripple (XRP). The $0.025 entry for Phase 4 ends soon — and thereafter, everything is a stair step up that cannot be reversed. As Certik verification is weeks away and exchange listings are around the corner, it is clear the window of opportunity to maximize your return is closing fast. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting investors looking for testable assets, not hype-driven schemes. This unique combination of growth mechanisms and presale exclusivity is as accessible as it is potentially profitable. Get your tokens now or lay back and see the next wave pass by.

Meanwhile, early-stage projects still offer the biggest potential for ROI, especially for those who get in before the crowd. But here’s the catch: not every ICO is built to last. Some are pure hype with no real vision behind them. This analysis examines three crypto projects currently raising significant capital. Notably, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , Mind Of Pepe (MIND), and WallitIQ (WLTQ) are the ICOs to invest in this April 2025. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Meme Coin That Lets You Create, Earn, And Grow FloppyPepe (FPPE) is extending the use case of meme coins, making it easier for traders and creators to engage with the crypto space . As AI continues to transform the industry, FloppyPepe (FPPE) asks why wait for the future when you can create it now? With FloppyAI, users can access an all-in-one tool for real-time crypto updates, meme magic, and instant insights. Through FloppyX and Meme-O-Matic , users can input commands and craft their ideas as images or videos within seconds. This feature is exclusive to its community, where the token lets users farm memes and earn rewards for their creativity. The ICO has experienced a massive flow, as experts predict a significant surge in price when the token reaches a major exchange. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to expand its reach with listings on Uniswap and CEXs while partnering with Key Opinion Leaders (KoLs). FloppyPepe (FPPE) has a long-term vision with a structured tokenomics that increases in value over time. This is achieved with an automatic burning mechanism. Additionally, the token has a limited supply, ensuring scarcity and higher demand, unlike other tokens with an excess supply. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) allow investors to get in early on promising crypto projects. Much like PEPE’s surge, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to outperform it, with advancements that set it ahead of PEPE in the crypto space. To build investor confidence, Solidprof has conducted an audit of FloppyPepe (FPPE) , Mind of Pepe (MIND), and WallitIQ (WLTQ), confirming that they are secure investment platforms. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The AI-Powered Wallet Of The Future WallitIQ (WLTQ) addresses three of the biggest issues for today’s crypto users: security, usability, and financial literacy. With biometric and facial authentication features, WallitIQ (WLTQ) takes user protection and smart trading to the next level. WallitIQ (WLTQ) incorporates Machine Learning algorithms that help users to enjoy strategic portfolio recommendations, set up automated transactions, and customize their wallet experience based on their habits and preferences. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is already in the third stage, with a token price of $0.0420. Token holders receive staking rewards of up to 180% APY while covering gas fees directly from the wallet with this token. Get Ahead Of The Market With Mind Of Pepe’s AI Insights Most early opportunities are snapped up by insiders or those with access to exclusive tools, leaving everyday investors behind. Mind of Pepe (MIND) combines meme culture with AI to create a self-evolving AI agent that interacts with influencers and provides insights into early-stage opportunities. This approach seeks to leverage AI to transform meme coin investing, making it one of the most promising ICOs. Analyst Alessandro suggests investing in the ICO for Mind of Pepe (MIND). The utility token Mind of Pepe (MIND) is designed for early trading perks and staking rewards, with an impressive 288% APY. Over $7.82 million has already been raised, and Mind of Pepe (MIND) ‘s full compatibility with wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet makes it easy for anyone to join. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Advantage When evaluating ICOs, factors like total funds raised, sellout speed, post-launch selling pressure, social media presence, pricing strategy, and the chances of reaching the hard cap are essential in identifying the best opportunities. FloppyPepe (FPPE), Mind of Pepe (MIND), and WallitIQ (WLTQ) stand out as the best ICOs this month. The opportunity is here, but it won’t wait for anyone; early entry is key. While others have moved on to higher stages, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has just begun, offering the lowest entry price of $0.0000002 . So, seize the moment before it passes.

Down nearly 60% from its all-time high, Solana reflects the weakness seen across the crypto sector, where fear and volatility have returned to dominate investor sentiment. As macroeconomic instability and risk-off behavior persist, bulls have been unable to regain control, and confidence remains shaky. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Make-Or-Break Support Level – Will DOGE Hold? Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared an important technical analysis, identifying $120 as a critical make-or-break zone for Solana. According to Martinez, this level has historically marked major shifts in SOL’s price trajectory, often acting as the tipping point between recovery and further decline. With Solana now hovering dangerously close to this threshold, traders are watching closely to see whether it can hold or break. If $120 fails to act as support, it could trigger a deeper correction. On the flip side, holding this level could offer bulls a base to mount a potential comeback — especially if market conditions stabilize. For now, Solana remains in a vulnerable position, and how it behaves around this key level may define its direction in the weeks ahead. Solana Holds Critical Demand As Global Trade War Tensions Grow Solana is trading at a critical demand zone as selling pressure intensifies across the crypto market, driven by escalating global tensions and trade war fears. On Liberation Day, US President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, sparking strong responses from major economies like China. The fallout has shaken investor confidence across all markets, including crypto, where risk assets are feeling the weight of heightened uncertainty and reduced appetite. Solana (SOL) has been especially vulnerable, with price action slipping toward key support levels. Analysts warn that if current demand fails to hold, the downtrend could accelerate. The next few days will be crucial, as continued weakness into next week could confirm a bearish breakdown. Many traders are already preparing for more downside if the market doesn’t stabilize soon. Martinez recently highlighted the importance of the current support zone. According to his analysis, the $120 level is a decisive make-or-break point for Solana. This zone has historically marked major trend reversals and shifts in momentum. A failure to hold above it could lead to a deeper correction, while a bounce from this level could spark a recovery. With SOL already 60% down from its all-time highs, bulls are on the defensive. If they can defend $120, there’s still hope for a reversal — but losing it may signal that the broader bearish trend remains intact. In the days ahead, all eyes will be on Solana’s ability to hold the line as macro pressure continues to shape the crypto market’s direction. Related Reading: Massive Chainlink Demand Wall At $6.26 As 90K Investors Buy 376M LINK Key Weekly Support Faces Breakdown Risk Solana is currently trading at $120, on track to record its lowest weekly close since February 2024. After weeks of selling pressure and repeated rejections below the $150 level, bulls are running out of time to defend key support. The inability to reclaim $150 — a major resistance zone — has kept SOL trapped in a bearish structure, with momentum firmly in favor of the bears. For any hopes of a recovery rally to take shape, Solana must reclaim $150 in the coming days. That level remains the gateway to higher demand zones and a shift in short-term trend. However, if price action continues to weaken and $120 fails to hold, the next logical target is much lower — around the weekly 200-day MA and EMA, both converging near $95. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Buy the Dip – Over 130K ETH Added In A Single Day This would represent a critical breakdown and likely trigger additional downside pressure, particularly if broader market conditions remain fragile. With macroeconomic uncertainty and trade war tensions weighing heavily on sentiment, Solana’s position looks increasingly vulnerable.

The figure is based on the standard definition of a recession—two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth—as tracked by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Recession odds on Kalshi have nearly doubled since March 20 and now align with similar predictions on rival prediction platform Polymarket, where traders currently put the likelihood at 60%. Rising Pessimism Signals Market Fears Over Trump’s New Trade Policies The spike in pessimism reflects mounting concern over the potential economic fallout from the new trade measures. Trump’s executive order introduced a blanket 10% tariff on all imports and added “reciprocal” tariffs targeting trade partners that impose duties on U.S. goods. The announcement triggered immediate turbulence in financial markets, leading to a massive sell-off that erased over $5 trillion in shareholder value within days. Market analysts warn that the tariffs could spark a prolonged trade war, increasing economic uncertainty and weighing heavily on both traditional equities and risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The downturn has revived fears of a bear market and broader macroeconomic slowdown. UNITED STATES: Chances of US recession this year have risen further to 62% according to prediction market @Kalshi pic.twitter.com/xaXyZnKJif — The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) April 5, 2025 Despite the growing concerns, President Trump has maintained that the tariffs will ultimately benefit the U.S. economy by correcting trade imbalances. “The markets are going to boom,” he asserted on April 3, downplaying the sharp market correction as temporary. Some observers, including asset manager Anthony Pompliano, have speculated that the sell-off may be strategic. Pompliano suggested that Trump may be using market pressure as a tool to push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Supporting this theory, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have dropped from 4.66% in January to 4.00% as of April 5. In a post on Truth Social, Trump called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to take action, writing, “This would be a perfect time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates.” Last month, Bitcoin commentator Anthony Pompliano said that the Trump administration may be deliberately engineering market turmoil to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into lowering interest rates. He hypothesised that President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are attempting to crash asset prices, forcing the Fed’s hand to reduce rates. U.S. Stocks Lose $11 Trillion Since February As reported, U.S. stock markets have experienced a staggering $11 trillion wipeout since February 19, with losses accelerating on April 4 following heightened concerns over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff measures. The single-day market loss amounted to $3.25 trillion—exceeding the total valuation of the global cryptocurrency market, which stood at $2.68 trillion at the time. Among major tech players, dubbed the “Magnificent 7,” Tesla led the plunge, falling 10.42%. Nvidia and Apple also saw steep losses, dropping 7.36% and 7.29% respectively. The widespread sell-off sent the Nasdaq 100 tumbling 6% on the day, pushing the index officially into bear market territory.

Aptos is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain with a mature ecosystem comprising a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Aptos network continues to build decentralized applications and tools for developers. But how about APT’s performance? How high will it go? Is APT a good investment? Let’s explore these questions in our Cryptopolitan price predictions from 2025 to 2031.

The price chart shows that Aptos could be heading for a retest after a daily breakout. Aptos 1-day chart price analysis APT/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView At current levels, Aptos is trading downwards. The William Alligator trendlines signal rising volatility, and the relative strength index is in neutral territory. The MACD histograms indicate rising negative market momentum. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis Aptos 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart, like the daily chart, shows rising volatility and positive price momentum on the MACD histograms. The price trend on the chart is bearish. Watch the $4.74 level on the chart at the channel’s lower trendline if the drop continues. The cryptocurrency could find support near a range of narrow consolidation. Investors should monitor the $5.41 level upon a price reversal. A rally into this area would likely face resistance from an earlier low at the flattening 100-day SMA.

Our chart analysis shows a bearish market sentiment, while the Fear and Greed Index shows fear among investors. The technical indicators show a bearish market sentiment with support now at $4.74. Why is Aptos down? Aptos was bullish in the last quarter of 2024. The wider crypto market corrected into 2025. Will Aptos reach $10? Yes, Aptos rose above $10 this year. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will Aptos reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Aptos will reach the $100 mark in 2031. Will Aptos reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains unlikely that Aptos will get to $1000 before 2031. What is the long-term price prediction for Aptos? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, Aptos will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. How high can Aptos coin go? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Aptos will reach a high of $24.84 in 2031. Is Aptos worth investing in? APTOS’s design prioritizes scalability, reliability, and upgradeability. It is notable for using the MOVE programming language, developed by Facebook and now META. While the current trend is bearish, predictions paint a different narrative. Recent news Aptos Labs has revealed its new blockchain execution engine, Shardines, that has unlocked 1 million transactions per second for non-conflicting transactions and more than 500,000 TPS for conflicting transactions. The sharded execution engine enables the Layer 1 blockchain to achieve horizontal scalability.

Some members previously worked on the Diem blockchain proposed by Facebook. The Aptos mainnet launched in October 2022 with an initial supply of 1 billion tokens. After the launch hype, Apt fell to its lowest in December 2022, at $3.09. A month later, the tables turned, as it peaked at a time high of $19.90 on January 30, 2023. It pumped, partly driven by the NFT market. Collections such as Aptos Monkeys and Aptomingod have attracted more users.

Current investors in the presale benefit handsomely, given the structured nature of the token’s presale price, beginning at $0.025, which rises incrementally by 20% to $0.03 in phase 5. Analysts note that it will initially cost around $0.06 — representing a 140% gain for investors now. Post launch, analysts predict rapid climbs for MUTM, anticipating price points upward of $3.50 in months ahead—driven by its innovative lending ecosystem and incessant buying pressure—a strategy designed to ensure it overtakes established giants of the space like Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK) within months. Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance ’s 11-stage presale is in Phase 4, and progress is rapid as investors snap up tokens ahead of further price increases. The project’s tokenomics are designed with just that trajectory in mind: every phase increases the cost both absolutely and relatively to signal growing urgency as entry points become ever more expensive. This would net those buying now at $0.025 140% gains on exchanges, a number based on the protocol’s constant launch valuation. Targets after the launch, though, stretch much higher. Independent predictions indicate that MUTM has potential to soar up to $3.50 toward the end of 2025— a bargain 13900% from its current stage. Such returns dwarf ordinary market action — reminding of the volatility-charged spikes of Dogecoin’s 2021 rise but rooted in real DeFi utility. Outshining Established Names Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK) are popular choices for smart contracts and oracle networks, but they face scalability and adoption challenges. While Cardano takes its time to develop, Mutuum Finance has shown rapid presale growth, boasting thousands of holders in just a couple of weeks. Chainlink, on the other hand, although essential for making data decentralized remains unable to reflect buy-side demand like MUTM’s revenue-driven capital allocation scheme. The 2021 moonshot of Dogecoin, the world’s favorite meme coin, lacked the kind of structural incentive Mutuum Finance builds in, a cut of platform fees that gets funneled into buying up MUTM tokens, naturally inflating their price while also mitigating the starved sell-off. This mechanics focused approach to MUTM establishes its identity as a systematized growth asset rather than a meme-fueled, meandering bet. Security Prioritization and Extension The team behind Mutuum Finance is completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts — a move designed to boost investor confidence. Results will be released through official channels once they have been compiled, consistent with an emphasis on transparency within the project. At the same time, work is ongoing on mtTokens—interest-earning assets representing user deposits—and an overcollateralized stablecoin intended to expand liquidity. The new features are designed to take Mutuum beyond pure lending, creating a network of interconnected revenue streams that further incentivize the accumulation of MUTM. With the crypto market shifting doggedly towards projects building yield generation & deflationary dynamics into their models, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned as a likely candidate for exponential revaluation. Its unique presale structure balances alongside post-launch targets surpassing $3, allowing an uncommon combination of immediate upside and sustained potential. Phase 4 slots are running down, and daily, the time you have to buy tokens at pre-surge price decreases. For investors searching for assets predestined to outstrip the original legacy tokens MUTM offers a sound investment opportunity — reminiscent of the original Doge hype but redesigned for prolonged relevance. Seizing the Moment Timing remains critical. With the Certik audit yet to be completed and exchange listings being next in line, you can expect new waves of demand. At the launch stage of phase 4, current participants not only secure 140% returns but also prime themselves for triple-digits multipliers as Mutuum Finance’s ecosystem develops. MUTM’s unique positioning in decentralized lending and buy-pressure dynamics allows for a clear roadmap to upwards movement in a saturated market counterparty environment for both Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK). The question isn’t whether MUTM will Mirror Dogecoin’s pump — it’s how high it will fly as major league trading starts. Act now—phase 4 won’t last. Invest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) AT $0.025 before, the price go up.

In his assessment based on on-chain data, Ju stated that current market dynamics now point to a bear market. In his explanation, Ju first drew attention to the concept of “Realized Cap”. This metric considers Bitcoin entering a wallet as a purchase and its exit as a sale. This data, which allows the calculation of the average cost per wallet, offers the opportunity to measure the real capital entering the market when multiplied by the amount of BTC in wallets. Therefore, Realized Cap represents the total capital entering Bitcoin through on-chain activities. Market cap, on the other hand, is often misunderstood because it is based solely on the last trading price on exchanges. Ju emphasized that even a small purchase can significantly push prices up during periods of low selling pressure, but under high selling pressure, even large purchases are insufficient to move the price. As an example, he cited the period when Bitcoin was trading close to $100,000, when the price remained stable despite high volume transactions. Related News: Renowned Analyst Says ""Everyone Is Missing The Big Picture, The Last Rally Will Be Much Bigger"" For Bitcoin, Shares BTC Record And Altcoin Season Prediction According to Ju’s analysis, in order to understand whether the market is in a healthy upward trend, it is necessary to look at the relationship between Realized Cap and Market Cap. If Realized Cap is increasing while Market Cap is stable or decreasing, this indicates that prices are not rising despite new capital inflows, meaning a bear market is dominant. In the opposite case, if prices are rising with small capital inflows, this is considered a sign of a bull market. Ju, who stated that the currently observed data clearly points to the first situation, said that large capital inflows could not push prices up and that this situation is a classic bear market indicator. The CEO said that the selling pressure may decrease at some point, but historically, such market reversals last at least six months, so expecting a short-term rally is unrealistic. *This is not investment advice.

Currently, ETH trades at approximately $1,796, down 18% in the past 30 days and significantly off its all-time high of above $4,800 reached in November 2021. This outlook as analysts is predicting further pain for Ethereum. But could Ethereum’s struggles signal a buying opportunity for investors eyeing emerging projects like Bitcoin Pepe ? Here’s a Bitcoin Pepe price prediction as an analyst shares the potential outlook for ETH. ETH woes deepen as price falls to near $1,700 Ethereum’s negative returns in 2025 deepen rot that has seen it dip nearly 50% in the past year. While this reflects broader turbulence in the crypto market, ETH’s underperformance versus Bitcoin has been glaring. This means the top altcoin below $1,800 leaves it under notable downside pressure. Macroeconomic factors, including inflation concerns and shifting investor sentiment, could push ETH toward support below $1,500. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently noted ETH’s failure to break key resistance levels, suggesting a potential dump to $1,100. Ethereum whales have also dropped by 10% in the past month. Ali @ali_charts · Follow #Ethereum $ETH has broken out of a multi-year triangle pattern, setting its sights on $1,150 as the next major target! 4:01 am · 6 Apr 2025 186 Reply Copy link Read 41 replies However, for crypto enthusiasts eyeing new opportunities, the downside could be for stacking more coins. In particular, altcoins and meme coins often thrive when major assets consolidate, a backdrop that sees projects like Bitcoin Pepe to capture attention. What is Bitcoin Pepe? Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is a new meme coin gaining traction in presale. Details on the official page show that this phase of development has exploded, with over $6 million raised so far. Interestingly, Bitcoin Pepe markets itself as a blend of Bitcoin’s security and Solana’s speed. Its aim is to create a meme-focused layer-2 solution on the Bitcoin blockchain. The PEP-20 token standard supports more than meme coins – the team eyes decentralised applications (dApps) on the OG blockchain network. Bitcoin Pepe price prediction Despite ETH and similar struggles for most of the cryptocurrency market, there’s a lot of buzz regarding what the next bull cycle would mean. Analysts point to Bitcoin’s resilience as a major indicator. Currently in stage 8 of 30, Bitcoin Pepe is priced at $0.0295. The price will rise throughout the presale, offering a chance to make a significant upside before the final stage later in the quarter. Given price predictions of 2x for ETH and BTC, analysts suggest a potential 20x surge post-launch for viral projects like BPEP. If Bitcoin Pepe mirrors explosive gains for Pepe (PEPE) at its launch, or Solana when it rose from under $10, then predictions of $1 in 2025 for BPEP and $5 in the next cycle could be modest. However, like other meme projects, Bitcoin Pepe will rely on the attention currency and overall crypto market conditions. What happens next in the market will be crucial.

In a new interview with Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast, Gromen calls attention to the America First Investment Policy, a memo released by the Trump Administration in February that aims to make the US foreign investment policies more cautious and conscious of national security. Gromen, the founder of the macroeconomic research firm Forest for the Trees (FFTT), says that the memo essentially directs China to “take your money and go home, we don’t want it here anymore.” With all of the foreign capital invested in US markets, Gromen says the Nasdaq index will likely suffer capital outflows while Bitcoin – as a neutral global asset essentially exempt from tariffs or political agendas – will shine, breaking the correlation between the two assets. “That, I think will ultimately be a catalyst to the separation of Bitcoin and Nasdaq, and that, I think, is starting to drive Nasdaq down – it has a long way to go because multiples are high – and in the short run, traders control the flows… Bitcoin is levered Nasdaq, I get it; it’s a high-beta Nasdaq, in the short run. If you back up to a five-year or ten-year chart, you can see very clearly these periods where Bitcoin has massively outperformed Nasdaq, but they still tend to go directionally similarly, when Bitcoin’s up Nasdaq’s up and vice versa… The America First Investment Policy memo, I think, will start to break that correlation because I think right now in the short run, that correlation is holding, [but] at some point I think capital flow is going to see Bitcoin for what it is which is a neutral reserve asset linked to energy, uncontrollable by any govenment and I think it’ll start siphoning some flows off from Nasdaq as America continues to say, ‘Listen, you want to invest in some factories here? Great, otherwise, get out.’ And that’s a lot of capital that’s got to get out, and we’re seeing gold benefit already. I think what we’re seeing in gold is a precursor to what we’ll see in Bitcoin.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $83,233.

This new token might print more zeros,https://crypto.news/how-much-profit-did-trump-print-this-new-token-might-print-more-zeros/,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. After TRUMP token’s massive price surge, investors are eyeing Catzilla as the next memecoin with the potential to soar. Table of Contents Catzilla: A memecoin with high growth potential TRUMP token’s massive gains Conclusion With the bullish winds sweeping through the crypto market, there’s been a lot of chatter about the massive gains seen with certain tokens. TRUMP coin was spotlighted for its remarkable profits, capturing the attention of traders and investors alike. Its performance has sparked interest in whether another new token on the horizon might follow in similar footsteps, potentially adding extra digits to portfolios. Could this emerging token be the one to watch next? Catzilla: A memecoin with high growth potential Catzilla is one of those projects that seems too wild to ignore — a mix of Japanese kaiju culture, internet memes, and crypto. At first glance, it might just seem like another meme token, but there’s more going on under the hood. With a structured presale and a growing community, Catzilla has some actual momentum behind it. Instead of a typical one-shot token sale, Catzilla’s presale is broken into 14 stages, giving investors multiple chances to buy in before launch. As each stage progresses, the price ticks up, meaning early buyers get in at a lower cost. Current presale stats: Current price: $0.0009 Next stage price: $0.0010 Final presale price: $0.0016 Funds raised so far: $2.2m and climbing Right now, the presale is at Stage 7, and the CoinMarketCap community seems optimistic about where it’s headed. Since the price keeps increasing with each stage, some investors are getting in now to lock in a lower price before the token hits exchanges. What makes Catzilla different? Plenty of memecoins rely purely on hype, but this one has a few things going for it besides viral appeal. 1. There’s a unique concept A big part of the project revolves around a kaiju-style concept. Its mascot is a giant cat that destroys cities and earns rewards. 2. It’s tapping into multiple communities Catzilla is clearly designed to appeal to more than crypto traders. The mix of anime, gaming, and meme culture makes it something that could attract: Crypto investors looking for early-stage projects. Meme lovers who enjoy viral, internet-driven trends. Anime and gaming fans who like the kaiju-inspired theme. The mix of audiences could help sustain interest in the long term. 3. There’s a strong focus on community involvement A big part of the project is community engagement, whether it’s through governance voting, staking rewards, or the play-to-earn mechanics in the game. The more people participate, the more active the ecosystem becomes — which could also help with long-term sustainability. Is it worth getting in? The presale is moving along quickly, and since the price keeps increasing in stages, there’s a time factor involved. Like any memecoin, it’s a speculative play — there’s potential for major upside, but also risks, especially in a volatile market. That said, the combination of an actual game, community engagement, and a structured presale makes Catzilla more interesting than most memecoins that pop up and disappear. Whether Catzilla turns into a big winner depends on how well the roadmap will be executed, but it’s one to keep an eye on.

TRUMP token’s massive gains Upon its debut on 17 January 2025, the TRUMP token surged from below $1 to an all-time high (ATH) of $75.35 on 19 January. This price action translated into an equally dramatic market‑cap expansion. Within hours of going live, TRUMP’s market capitalization surged to $8 billion, with daily trading volumes approaching $1 billion. The launch also led to gains in other digital assets, with Solana hitting an ATH of $294.33. Even after the initial frenzy subsided, the token has settled at a market cap of around $1.8 billion, with its current price at $9.02, underscoring the massive value printed for early participants. Conclusion With the TRUMP token showing that memecoins can still deliver profit, all eyes are now turning to the next potential breakout — and Catzilla is making a strong case. Its layered presale, active community, and unique blend of meme, anime, and gaming culture set it apart in a crowded field. While no memecoin is risk-free, the structured approach and early momentum give Catzilla a real shot at turning more heads — and possibly printing more zeros for early believers.

As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu lose momentum, a new AI-powered memecoin — Codename:Pepe — is turning heads with growth potential. Table of Contents Codename:Pepe: Where AI meets memecoin virality Dogecoin tests support amid recent declines Shiba Inu’s price forecast Conclusion As hype around memecoins evolves, the once-celebrated Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are seeing a shift in the spotlight. A new contender is rising, promising to blend humor with opportunity: Codename:Pepe. This project aims to shake up the crypto scene by harnessing artificial intelligence for lucrative gains. Built on the ambition of its successful predecessors, Codename:Pepe is catching eyes with its unique mix of AI-powered strategies and community-driven growth. While DOGE and SHIB fade into the background, this new memecoin is rallying a dedicated group of believers hopeful for massive results. The project’s unique approach is setting a new standard in the crypto world. Codename:Pepe: Where AI meets memecoin virality Codename:Pepe is a fresh crypto project that fuses two of the biggest trends in Web3 — artificial intelligence and memecoins — into one intelligent, viral ecosystem. As interest in AI-powered crypto surges, countless projects have jumped on the bandwagon. But many rely on hype alone, offering little to no real utility. Codename:Pepe is different — it’s not just using AI as a buzzword, it’s building AI into the core of its functionality. While most AI tokens overpromise and underdeliver, Codename:Pepe is calling out the fakes and delivering real value. The platform blends smart AI systems with blockchain mechanics to help traders navigate the chaotic memecoin market with precision. Built to be intelligent and adaptive, Codename:Pepe’s AI framework is designed to: Spot rising memecoins early: By analyzing social media trends and on-chain data, the system identifies tokens gaining momentum before they go viral. Read market sentiment: Codename:Pepe monitors hype levels, community chatter, and whale activity to gauge which tokens are heating up. Generate AI-based trading insights: From forecasts to risk profiles, it delivers signals that help users make faster, smarter trading decisions. Optimize auto-trading strategies: The platform adjusts automated trading tactics in real-time, keeping strategies sharp in volatile markets. The dev team is committed to scaling Codename:Pepe’s AI capabilities alongside its blockchain infrastructure — ensuring the project stays ahead of the curve. To fuel community growth and reward early adopters, Codename:Pepe has launched a multi-stage presale. Stage 1 started at $0.003333333 per AGNT token. The price increases gradually across 28 stages. This structure creates urgency and rewards early supporters with the best possible entry points. With a powerful AI engine, viral meme appeal, and a clear roadmap, Codename:Pepe is quickly emerging as a standout in the next wave of intelligent crypto projects. You might also like: Missed PEPE? Here is Codename:Pepe, a memecoin poised for a 10,000% breakout Dogecoin tests support amid recent declines Dogecoin has dropped significantly over the past week and month, declining by 3.87% and 18.60% respectively. It is currently trading between $0.1582 and $0.1941. Despite short-term losses, Dogecoin has gained 52.02% over the past six months, indicating potential for long-term growth. The RSI stands at 39.89, suggesting the coin may be nearing oversold territory. The nearest support level is $0.1377. If the price holds above this, it could rebound. The nearest resistance is at $0.2209. Breaking this level might indicate a bullish trend. If Dogecoin bounces from support, it could rise about 44% to the resistance level. However, if it falls below support, further declines are possible. Shiba Inu’s price forecast Shiba Inu has recently experienced a notable decline in its price. Over the past week, the coin’s value dropped by 4.51%, and it’s down by 10.46% over the past month. In the last six months, SHIB has seen a significant decrease of 30.41%. These consecutive declines indicate a bearish trend that might concern investors. Currently, SHIB’s price hovers between $0.00001186 and $0.00001465. The nearest support level is at $0.00001007. If the price continues to fall and breaks this support, it could signal further declines. On the other hand, the nearest resistance level is at $0.00001685. Overcoming this resistance could indicate a potential reversal in the downtrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 43.77. An RSI below 50 suggests that the asset is losing momentum. However, with the RSI approaching the oversold territory, there might be potential for a price rebound if buying pressure increases. Given the consistent downward movement over the past six months, there’s cautious sentiment around SHIB’s immediate potential for growth. To regain bullish momentum, the price would need to rise above the resistance level, which would require an increase of over 15%. Conversely, a drop to the support level would represent a further decline of approximately 10%. Conclusion In a landscape where DOGE and SHIB have already had their moment, their potential for significant short-term gains appears limited. Codename:Pepe emerges as a compelling alternative, leveraging artificial intelligence to maximize profits. The coin provides real utility by offering AI-powered trading signals and automated trading capabilities, enabling investors to seize lucrative opportunities ahead of the crowd. With its community-driven approach and unique features, Codename:Pepe positions itself as a standout contender for those looking to capitalize on the next big wave in the crypto arena.

According to a weekly report by the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the crypto market witnessed a sell-off before and during the press conference held for the announcement. Since then, bearish conditions have persisted. Crypto Investors’ Reaction to Trump’s Tariffs As the press conference approached, investors scrambled to transfer their BTC to crypto exchanges. The rush was so high that a single Bitcoin block recorded as much as 2,500 BTC. The largest American crypto exchange, Coinbase, also witnessed a significant spike in BTC deposits, especially from large holders. The uptick in exchange deposits was not peculiar to BTC; investors also rushed to transfer their ETH and XRP to trading platforms. ETH deposits to exchanges rose to an hourly maximum of roughly 80,000 ETH, while XRP transfers spiked to 130 million tokens—a far cry from the 10 million per hour transactions seen the previous day. CryptoQuant said these large exchange inflows indicated that investors were positioning themselves to sell their assets due to the rising economic uncertainty. During the press conference, BTC, ETH, and XRP plummeted by 6.2%, 7%, and 5%, respectively, erasing the price gains they had garnered that day. This is a clear indication that investors did sell their holdings. BTC Demand Plummeted Moreover, demand for BTC and ETH in the perpetual futures market declined as traders closed their positions to take profits during the conference. The total open interest for BTC fell from 334,000 BTC to 304,000 BTC, while that of ETH plunged by 100,000 ETH. CryptoQuant revealed that falling open interest during a price drop indicates that traders are exiting long positions due to liquidations or anticipating further decline. After the conference, demand for BTC from U.S. investors was reduced. This was seen in the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium falling from 0.04% before the tariffs confirmation announcement to 0.03% after Trump’s speech. “For the price of Bitcoin to rally significantly, it needs relatively higher demand from US investors,” CryptoQuant stated. Meanwhile, the Bull Score Index still suggests that BTC is in a bear market. For weeks, the metric has been at 20, its lowest level since January 2023, flashing signals seen in previous bear phases.

While this might sound like a rare fluke, it’s part of a quiet trend: solo miners are scoring more often than they used to. A One-in-a-Million Win According to data from the Solo CKPool platform, solo miner entities processed 7 blocks in 2022, 12 in 2023, and 16 in 2024. The increase is modest, but telling. While these miners aren’t exactly overthrowing industrial giants, they’re proving that with enough patience—and a little luck—David can still land a blow on Goliath. “This is still like playing the lottery,” said Scott Norris, CEO of independent mining firm Optiminer. “But people are playing it.” Despite the long-shot odds, the growing presence of hobbyist miners may be playing a role in the recent uptick in solo block wins. Speaking to Decrypt, pseudonymous Bitcoin advocate Econoalchemist highlighted the trend of increasingly frequent solo victories. “Now and then—and more often than before—it turns out that the machine solving a block is something like a Bitaxe, quietly humming away in someone’s living room,” he remarked. Decentralization by Design—or Just Dreams? That said, not all solo miner are lone bedroom hobbyists . Some have access to more hash power than it appears, and the line between “solo” and “private collective” isn’t always clear. Still, the spirit of solo mining remains: control, privacy, and independence. The rise of plug-and-play mining rigs like Bitaxe and FutureBit Apollo has brought mining into more homes. In one notable case earlier this year, a FutureBit Apollo mined a block with the help of donated hash power from fellow enthusiasts. This effort was led by a group aiming to “dismantle the proprietary mining empire.” While hobby miner won’t topple industrial mining operations anytime soon, their presence keeps alive the ethos of decentralization that Bitcoin was founded on.

However, the unpredictability of meme coins makes investing in them a high-risk gamble. While SHIB has seen impressive pumps in the beyond, its long-term sustainability remains questionable. In contrast, Ozak AI (OZ) emerges as a more promising funding, presenting real-world application thru AI-powered blockchain technology. With specialists predicting a surge to $1, Ozak AI provides a greater reliable and basically strong possibility for traders searching for widespread profits in the next bull cycle. Shiba Inu’s Uncertain Future Despite its huge community and meme coin appeal, Shiba Inu’s price movements stay more speculative, pushed largely by market sentiment as opposed to technological advancements or adoption. While SHIB saw notable rallies in 2021 and brief spikes afterward, its momentum has slowed appreciably. Even with ecosystem expansions such as Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution, the coin’s use case remains limited compared to rising utility-driven initiatives. The trouble with meme coins like SHIB is their dependence on viral tendencies, celebrity endorsements, and whale activity—all of which are unpredictable and unsustainable in the long run. Investors who are hoping for any other huge SHIB rally are basically setting a guess without a fundamental backing. Ozak AI: A Fundamental-Driven Crypto with 100x Potential Unlike Meme coins, Ozak AI is built on solid fundamentals. The project benefits from artificial intelligence to increase blockchain applications, which brings innovation in DeFi, predictive analytics and automatic trading solutions. While AI continues to use, the industries continue to expand, Ozak AI has been well placed to take benefit of this trend, making it a real utility-driven property instead of a hype-based gambling. Ozak Ai's current presale priced at $0.003, which offers an attractive entrance point for investors in search of massive growth potential. With increasing adoption, experts suggest that OZ can be $1 or beyond, marking the 300x jump from the current assessment. Unlike Shib, who is struggling with long-term stability, AI-operated applications of Ozak AI and the use of the real world provide a strong basis for development. Why Ozak AI’s $1 Target Looks More Certain A crucial factor in Ozak AI’s rapid boom is its small market cap and high investor interest. Early-stage cryptocurrencies with groundbreaking technology regularly see explosive gains once adoption picks up. The AI zone is currently experiencing big institutional and retail interest, and initiatives like Ozak AI are poised to capitalize on this wave. Unlike Shiba Inu, which relies on speculative pumps, Ozak AI’s price trajectory is based on demand for AI-pushed blockchain solutions, making its $1 goal far more achievable. While Shiba Inu might see occasional pumps, its long-term potential stays uncertain because of its lack of real utility. Ozak AI, on the other hand, offers groundbreaking AI-based blockchain technology that aligns with the growing demand for artificial intelligence in the digital economy. With analysts predicting a 300x surge to $1, Ozak AI gives a greater solid and promising funding than taking a risky bet on SHIB’s next pump. Investors seeking out long-term wealth advent in place of a brief-term hypothesis might also discover Ozak AI to be the smarter preference.

Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) token plunged to a low of $11.10, down by 67% from its record high of $35.20. This crash has brought its market cap from near $10 billion in December to $3.8 billion. The HYPE token has crashed partly because of its substantial dilution risks. According to CoinnMarketCap , it has a total supply of near 1 billion tokens, with 333 million being in circulation. Hyperliquid’s token unlocks will start in November this year, when the network will start releasing 216,580 HYPE tokens worth $2.52 million daily. The final unlock will happen in November 2028. Token unlocks, especially without a burning feature, lead to higher inflation and dilution of existing token holders.

In it, the developers delisted the token abruptly leading to substantial losses among investors. The crisis has led to lower activity in the network. DeFi Llama data shows that the perpetual futures volume dropped to $175 billion in March, the second consecutive month of decline. This volume peaked at almost $200 billion in January as Solana meme coins surged. Hyperliquid’s seven-day volumes dropped by over 27% to $38 billion, while the daily volume fell by 70% to $2.4 billion. The same trend has happened on Hyperliquid’s layer-1 network, the volume of which dropped by 28.5% to $702 million. HYPE price technical analysis Hyperliquid price chart | Source: crypto.news The 4H chart shows that the Hyperliquid price has crashed from $35.12 to $11.6. It recently dropped below the crucial support level at $12.11, its lowest point on March 13. Moving below that level invalidated the formation of a double-bottom pattern. The token has also formed a bearish flag pattern, which is characterized by a vertical line and a rectangle consolidation. This is a highly popular bearish continuation pattern in technical analysis. HYPE price has moved below the 50-period moving average. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target its all-time low of $10.45. A move above the resistance at $13.37 will invalidate the bearish outlook.

But in 2025, as the market matures and investors search for higher potential returns, many are realizing that the next 10x opportunity may not come from these already-established giants. Instead, one of the most talked-about up-and-coming tokens is MUTM, the native asset of Mutuum Finance—a project that’s quietly building momentum with strong fundamentals, a growing user base, and a token price still in its early stages. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that offers crypto users a simple way to put their assets to work or access liquidity without needing to sell. What makes the platform stand out is its flexible structure. Whether users are looking to earn passive income or borrow without offloading their positions, the system is designed to handle both with transparency and full on-chain control. The protocol works by allowing users to deposit supported cryptocurrencies and, in return, receive interest-bearing tokens that reflect their share of the platform’s liquidity. These tokens grow in value as borrowers pay interest, making them ideal for long-term holders who want their capital to work without the need for active management. On the borrowing side, users can lock up collateral to access funds—maintaining exposure to their original assets while using the borrowed capital however they choose. But it’s not just the product that’s gaining attention—it’s also the timing. MUTM is currently in its presale phase, priced at just $0.025, with over $6 million raised and more than 7,750 holders already on board. The token is set to launch at $0.06, giving early participants more than 2x gains right out of the gate. However, analysts and early supporters believe this is only the beginning. A key reason for this optimism lies in the upcoming CertiK audit. CertiK is one of the most trusted names in blockchain security, and the audit will give new investors added confidence in Mutuum’s smart contract safety and protocol integrity. Once complete, it’s expected to open the doors to more serious capital entering the ecosystem—particularly from users who wait for that extra level of verification before getting involved. So why are people calling MUTM a potential 10x? There are several reasons. First, the current price and market cap are still extremely low relative to the project’s capabilities and roadmap. The platform is solving a real problem in DeFi—how to lend and borrow assets safely and transparently—without overcomplicating the user experience. As more capital flows into on-chain lending systems, Mutuum is well-positioned to benefit from the shift. Second, the token’s buy-and-distribute model supports its value over time. A portion of protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM from the open market, and those tokens are then distributed to active participants. This creates consistent demand while rewarding users who contribute to the protocol, resulting in a feedback loop that encourages long-term holding. Third, the infrastructure is already in motion. Unlike many early-stage projects that are still in the concept phase, Mutuum has launched its core systems and is progressing steadily toward wider adoption. With the CertiK audit underway and major exchange listings expected post-launch, the conditions are aligning for a strong market debut. In the short term, many expect MUTM to climb significantly in the first few weeks after launch, with some forecasts placing it around $0.25 to $0.30 based on current momentum and early adoption. Over the medium to long term, reaching a 10x from the presale price—bringing the token to around $0.25—is seen as a reasonable and achievable target, especially if protocol usage and community growth continue at their current pace. Ethereum and Cardano will always have a place in the market, but the biggest gains often come from finding value before everyone else does. Mutuum Finance might just be one of those rare opportunities—and those who recognize it now may be glad they did when the next breakout arrives.

As of now, Pi is down over 11% and trading at $0.63. One reason for Pi Coin’s struggle could be its absence from major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which limits its visibility and trading volume. As reported by Bao Moi , Nguyễn Hà Minh Thông, founder of Cabo Capital in Ho Chi Minh City, has shared reasons on why Binance has yet to list Pi Token. The expert said that while the Pi community might believe the project doesn’t need Binance, without recognition from major exchanges, Pi will continue to face skepticism and struggle to achieve real market value. Limited Open Market Activity: Pi Network’s mainnet has been live since late 2024, but it remains in an “enclosed” state, meaning transactions are limited to its internal ecosystem. Binance prefers projects with fully open, public blockchains to ensure transparency and market stability. Unclear Tokenomics: The total supply of Pi is reportedly 100 billion tokens, but only about 6.8 billion are in circulation. The Pi Core Team has also reduced the supply by removing 10 million tokens without clear explanations, raising concerns about potential price manipulation. Binance requires clear data on token distribution to avoid risks. Regulatory Concerns: Binance is under regulatory pressure globally, especially in the U.S., where legal issues around money laundering and financial compliance are serious. Pi Network has not been officially recognized by any regulatory body. In Vietnam, cryptocurrencies aren’t legally recognized, and in China, Pi was flagged as a “multi-level marketing project.” Listing Pi could expose Binance to legal risks. Lack of Liquidity and Market Activity: For a token to be listed on Binance, it needs strong liquidity and trading volume on major exchanges. Pi currently trades mainly through OTC channels like Telegram and small exchanges (e.g., OKX, HTX) with unstable prices. Binance prefers tokens that have experienced real price discovery in open markets. Centralization Issues: Pi Network has faced criticism for its high level of centralization, with the Pi Core Team controlling all mainnet nodes. This contradicts the decentralization principle that major exchanges like Binance prioritize, as seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-06 12:10:04

The industry is gearing up for a number of tech launches that could change the balance of power: Ethereum will introduce the Pectra upgrade to improve scalability, MEXC will launch a hybrid exchange for simplified crypto asset trading, and Hemi Network will launch a mainnet to merge Bitcoin and Ethereum. It remains to be seen whether these developments will lead to another market surge, but they certainly lay the groundwork for future growth. Innovations in DeFi, AI integration, and infrastructure expansion highlight the industry’s desire to adapt and evolve, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty. MEXC Launches Hybrid Exchange — DeFi and CEX Under One Roof While most exchanges choose between a centralized or decentralized side, MEXC is taking the path of fusion. In March 2025, the platform launched a next-generation hybrid exchange that combines the liquidity of centralized markets with access to decentralized protocols, all in one interface. The DEX+ Wallet offers access to on-chain assets across various blockchains and seamless multi-chain trading, backed by institution-grade security. It combines the diverse asset options of decentralized platforms with the robust security and user-friendly experience of centralized exchanges, providing users with a streamlined and highly secure trading experience. With UX becoming a key battleground, MEXC's bet on a unified hybrid platform looks like a timely (and potentially game-changing) move. Ethereum Pectra’s upgrade Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade , slated for mid-March 2025, is a major step toward improving the network’s scalability, efficiency, and usability. By merging the previously separate Prague and Electra upgrades, Pectra introduces critical enhancements such as flexible gas payments, optimized staking options, and technical advancements like Verkle Trees and PeerDAS. A key highlight is account abstraction, which allows users to pay transaction fees with ERC-20 tokens like USDC instead of being limited to ETH. This shift simplifies transactions and enhances user accessibility. Additionally, Verkle Trees and PeerDAS improve data management and reduce storage demands, ensuring a more efficient Ethereum ecosystem. The upgrade will roll out in two phases, with the initial implementation in March 2025 focusing on increasing layer-2 storage capacity, lowering fees, and expanding validator staking limits. The second phase, expected in late 2025 or early 2026, will integrate advanced optimizations to further enhance network performance. Pectra builds upon the foundation laid by the Dencun upgrade in 2024, which introduced proto-dank sharding to reduce layer-2 transaction costs. By addressing key bottlenecks, Pectra positions Ethereum for broader adoption and long-term sustainability, reinforcing its role as the leading smart contract platform. TRON Removes Fees — Completely Many blockchains are reducing fees. TRON has decided to go further and completely eliminate gas for transactions in its ecosystem. The new feature, introduced in early March, allows users to send transactions without any fees — by redistributing revenue within the network. For users, this is a breath of fresh air, especially in DeFi and NFT applications, where micropayments were unprofitable due to fiat. For developers, it is an incentive to rethink the UX in favor of the mass user. The network is already recording an increase in activity, especially in the markets of Southeast Asia, where the cost of transactions is a critical factor. Tether launches an AI platform When one of the largest stablecoin issuers suddenly goes beyond the financial infrastructure, it is already an event. In March 2025, Tether introduced its own AI platform focused on blockchain applications with artificial intelligence. Unlike typical hype-driven AI efforts, Tether is focusing on infrastructure: the launch includes a framework for developing AI models in a Web3 environment and a computing architecture powered by self-governing nodes. This could change the approach to decentralized storage, data analysis, and predictive model building on the blockchain. If the platform is adopted by developers, Tether will be able to occupy a unique niche between AI and Web3 — and strengthen its influence beyond USDT. Hemi Network Brings Bridge Between Ethereum and Bitcoin What if you combined the resilience and security of Bitcoin with the flexibility of Ethereum? This question is now answered by Hemi Network , a new mainnet aimed at uniting two of the largest ecosystems in a single decentralized structure. The network uses a hybrid architecture and an original smart contract interoperability model, which allows it to run EVM applications with Bitcoin security at the base level. This is not just a ""bridge"" — it is an attempt to reboot the very concept of interoperability in crypto. While analysts argue about the feasibility of ambitions, the market votes with interest: validator activity and TVL are growing rapidly.

XRP is trading at $2.12 presently and has seen a 265% rally in the last year owing to the top altcoin gaining regulatory clarity and beating its SEC case. Experts estimate that Ripple prices can soar to above $3.5 by the end of April if it breaks significant resistance levels. However, uncertainties over institutional dependence continue to cloud its long-term course. Meanwhile, Remittix is picking up steam as a cryptocurrency game-changer, with analysts calling it the ""next XRP."" While Ripple appears to falter, showing an 18% decline in the last month alone, Remittix's innovative strategy is positioning it as a frontrunner in the PayFicompetition. Let’s find out more. XRP Statistics and Predictions; Ripple Price Shows A Mixed Outlook Amid Market Volatility Ripple has won the support of financial institutions because of its cost-effective and high-performing international payment solutions. The present Ripple price of $2.12 has generated fresh market attention because China's counter-tariffs redirected investment capital from U.S. equity markets into international markets. Analysts argue that the tariff initiative launched by President Trump on April 2 , 2025 will continue to impact XRP, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The predictions about future Ripple prices depend on three key elements such as regulatory developments, market reactions and advancements within Ripple's XRP network. While its partnerships with major banks contribute to its legitimacy, the rising supply combined with decelerating demand might cause XRP to lose value. The result of these tariffs on Ripple prices remains to be seen because it depends on the specific details and market changes that will occur in 2025. According to analysts, if XRP is unable to hold support at $1.90 during bearish trends, selling pressure could worsen, putting further pressure on Ripple’s price. As Ripple grapples with these concerns, emerging projects like Remittix are plugging gaps of inefficiencies in cross-border payments with innovative solutions that adapt to evolving market demands. Remittix Is 2025’s Big PayFi Disruptor The cryptographic currency marketplace receives significant transformation from Remittix (RTX) which brings a disruptive international payment solution. Through its blockchain framework Remittix enables fast and economical and transparent international payments. The method represents an operational answer to current monetary business obstacles. Investor confidence in the Remittix presale proves strong based on its success in generating $14.3 million from selling over 526 million tokens. The remarkable growth of RTX stands as one of the best new initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2025 overshadowing market competitors. The distinctive tokenomics built by Remittixcommits major token allocations to community rewards and liquidity pools for ensuring long-term stability and driving user-developed expansion. The PayFi native protocol supports swift transactions at low prices to attract both small businesses and population segments who have limited access to banking services from mainstream institutions. Remittix represents a different asset class compared to Ripple (XRP) because it combines an inclusive platform model to democratize digital finance through simplified mechanisms which enable people to move between blockchain and fiat currency systems. Call-to-Action: Secure Your Place in Remittix Today Ripple price predictions show market potential but Remittix provides a different investment space which gives users both utility functions and the potential toward rapid price increases. Investors who join Remittix's presale today get a stake in a project that is showing strong signs of disruptive growth.

Can We Expect a Swift Rebound for Ethereum and Solana?,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/is-the-bull-market-done-can-we-expect-a-swift-rebound-for-ethereum-and-solana,"The crypto market faces uncertainty as recent trends raise questions about its future. Ethereum and Solana , two major players, draw attention in this period of potential change. As analysts debate the possibility of a quick recovery, the market holds its breath. This article delves into which digital currencies might be poised for a resurgence. Ethereum Faces Bearish Pressure in a Volatile Market Over the past month, Ethereum has dropped nearly 18%, with a six-month decline of about 25%. Price activity has shown weakness, as evidenced by a short-term weekly change of around -1%, adding to the ongoing downward trend. Negative momentum and declining energy in the market indicate persistent selling pressure. Recent price movements reflect subdued trading volume, lacking any signs of a strong recovery. Currently, Ethereum trades between approximately $1,538 and $2,325. Support is nearby at around $1,255, while resistance builds near $2,829, with a higher barrier at $3,616. Bears maintain control as momentum indicators and the RSI near 38 suggest limited buying interest. Traders might explore short-term strategies within these levels while waiting for a clear breakout that could signal a trend reversal. Solana Faces Bearish Trends Yet Hints at Altcoin Season Over the last month, Solana prices fell by about 16%, while a six-month decline approached 17%, marking a challenging period. This drop, with weekly lows exceeding 3%, has highlighted a trend of weakness. The recent figures reflect sluggish behavior, as the downward momentum has significantly impacted overall performance. Current prices fluctuate between $98 and $166, with clear support around $71 and resistance near $207. Bears dominate the market as key indicators show negative signals. Traders might find opportunities within these levels, focusing on purchases near support while being cautious not to make aggressive moves until clear signs of an uptrend emerge. Conclusion The market's recent downturn has raised questions about future movements. ETH and SOL have shown resilience despite recent drops. Analysts are watching key indicators to gauge a potential bounce back. Historical trends suggest possible recovery phases, but timing remains uncertain. Investors should consider both short-term and long-term perspectives. Various factors will influence how quickly ETH and SOL may regain momentum. The markets often evolve, presenting opportunities for those who stay informed. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

But activity on the blockchain remains at 1.2 million daily transactions. Transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain have reached their lowest levels in years, with the seven-day moving average (7DMA) indicating transaction fees of less than $500,000 per day - contrasted with a peak of $30 million in March 2024. At the same time, the number of daily transactions remains stable at about 1.2 million per day, which characterizes not a decrease in demand but a change in network economics, the media noted. The decline in fees has been influenced by a number of upgrades, including the introduction of EIP-4844, which added BLOB (big data) transactions, a cheaper way to store data for L2 solutions. Among other things, Base blockchain has become a popular choice among users due to its significant cheapening while maintaining Ethereum's security. According to Glassnode, total transaction fees were 317.1 ETH as of April 6, 2025. The previous low value was recorded on February 22, 2020 - 306.2 ETH. For users, lower commissions mean increased availability, which opens up opportunities for small DeFi transactions and daily transfers. For validators, however, it reduces motivation - the blockchain increasingly relies on Ethereum issuance instead of fee income, the publication noted. Record lows in the Ethereum ecosystem are also seen in the amount of assets burned due to transaction fees, a decrease in the number of new addresses on the blockchain and decreases in the available supply of Ethereum on centralized exchanges. However, on May 7, 2025, the blockchain will undergo a Pectra update, which aims to improve the user experience and efficiency of Ethereum.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-06 12:27:35

Stellar ( XLM ) was trading at the crucial support at $0.25 on Sunday, much lower than last year’s high of $0.6380. On-chain data shows that the Stellar ecosystem is doing relatively well. Nansen data shows that transactions have risen by 24% in the last seven days to 21.5 million. They have risen by almost 30% in the last 30 days to 70.5 million, making Stellar one of the most active chains in crypto. The number of active addresses in the Stellar ecosystem has also jumped in the past few days. They rose by 15% in the last seven days to 162,947. These numbers have also translated to a 105% increase in weekly transaction fees.

Stablecoin market cap on Stellar | Source: DeFi Llama Stellar price analysis XLM price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the XLM price has dropped sharply from its highest point in November last year. It has moved below the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. Worse, the token will form a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages approach their confluence. Such a crossover would potentially lead to a further downside. On the positive side, there are signs that the token is slowly forming a falling wedge pattern. This pattern consists of two descending and converging trend lines, and in most cases, it leads to a bullish breakout. A good example of this pattern in action happened with the Pi Network price , which rebounded on Saturday. There are signs that the XLM price is slowly forming a double-bottom pattern at $0.2282, whose neckline is at $0.30. A double bottom is another highly bullish chart pattern. Therefore, the Stellar price will likely bounce back if it remains above the double-bottom point at $0.2282 and avoids a death cross. More gains will be confirmed if it rises above the upper side of the wedge pattern.

The confident prediction comes even as XRP currently trades at $2.07 and the broader cryptocurrency market struggles through a prolonged downtrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Slips Below Triangle—Is A $1,600 Crash Next? XRP Shows Unusual Strength Amid Crypto Slump While XRP has dropped more than 5% over the past few weeks, this decline is significantly less severe than what other major cryptocurrencies have experienced. According to the report, top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have fallen by over 40% in the last three months. Similar sharp drops have hit other popular coins such as Solana and Dogecoin. XForceGlobal, who describes himself as a Certified Elliott Wave Analyst, pointed out that XRP has maintained its position above recent lows while competing cryptocurrencies have plummeted between 45% and 65% from their peaks. This relative stability forms the foundation of his optimistic outlook. I agree 100%, this is just showing that the possibility being there is just telling us how XRP is in its own league even for just wave counts! — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) April 2, 2025 Elliott Wave Analysis Points To Massive Gains The analyst’s forecast is based greatly on Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis technique which tries to predict market action by finding repeating wave patterns. On the basis of his recognition of a 5-wave pattern, XForceGlobal has consistently predicted that XRP will hit $20 to $40 this year or next. Trillion-Dollar Valuation Projections Questioned By Critics Many market observers remain skeptical of such ambitious price targets. For XRP to reach $10, it would need to surge over 370% from its current price. A move to $20 would require an even more dramatic 850% increase. At such prices, XRP’s market capitalization would be around $1 trillion at the $10 level and $2 trillion at $20. Such valuations would be a first for an alternative currency and are the reasons why many analysts believe such forecasts are unrealistic, at least in the short term. Source: CoinGlass CoinGlass: Trading Interest Grows Despite Market Uncertainty In spite of the continued argument regarding the future of XRP, statistics by CoinGlass indicate increasing interest in the cryptocurrency. Open interest on XRP trades has risen to $3.60 billion over the past few days, reports indicate. This increase indicates that traders are opening positions in the asset irrespective of the direction of the market. I will be laughing at everyone who said $XRP can never hit $10-20. — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) April 2, 2025 When asked for the timeline of his price forecast, XForceGlobal was not as definite, indicating that it may take a while before XRP gets to the forecasted $10-20 mark. Related Reading: XRP Breakout Alert! Could This Surge Send The Altcoin To $3? Nevertheless, the analyst was confident enough with his technical analysis to assert he would “be laughing at everyone” who are skeptical about XRP’s ability to hit these price levels. With XRP’s year-to-date gains dwindling to mere 0.80%, wiping out all gains since the beginning of 2025, the question is if XForceGlobal’s lofty predictions will materialize or become part of the long list of failed cryptocurrency price projections.

A cryptocurrency whale made at least $6.26 million profit on the Jelly my Jelly (JELLY) memecoin by exploiting the liquidation parameters on Hyperliquid, Cointelegraph reported on March 27. The exploit was the second major incident on the platform in March, noted CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong. “$JELLYJELLY was the more notable attack where we saw Binance and OKX listing perps, drawing accusations of coordinating an attack against Hyperliquid,” Ong said in an April 3 X post , adding: “It’s clear that CEXes are feeling threatened by DEXes, and are not going to see their market share erode without putting on a fight.” DEX growth reshapes derivatives market Hyperliquid is the eighth-largest perpetual futures exchange by volume across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. This puts it “ahead of some notable OGs such as HTX, Kraken and BitMEX,” Ong noted, citing an April 4 research report .

According to Bitget Research analyst Ryan Lee, the incident may harm user confidence in emerging decentralized platforms, especially if actions taken post-exploit appear overly centralized. “Hyperliquid’s intervention — criticized as centralized despite its decentralized ethos — may make investors wary of similar platforms,” Lee said. Whale exploits Hyperliquid’s trading logic The unknown Hyperliquid whale managed to exploit Hyperliquid’s liquidation parameters by deploying millions of dollars worth of trading positions. The whale opened two long positions of $2.15 million and $1.9 million, and a $4.1 million short position that effectively offset the longs, according to a postmortem by blockchain analytics firm Arkham.

Instead, it was absorbed into the Hyperliquidity Provider Vault (HLP), which is designed to liquidate large positions.

The Hyperliquid exploit occurred two weeks after a Wolf of Wall Street-inspired memecoin — launched by the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) and Libra (LIBRA) token co-creator Hayden Davis — crashed over 99% after launching with an 80% insider supply.

While OKX has improved its AML policies, Malta’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIAU) could not dismiss its compliance violation from 2023. MiCA Licensed Exchange Fined for Past Compliance Issues OKX has come under regulatory fire in Europe after Maltese authorities slapped the exchange with a fine over AML failures that took place in 2023. Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) issued a $1.2 million fine to the exchange’s European arm, Okcoin Europe, after identifying multiple AML failures in 2023. OKX is among the first exchanges to be licensed under the EU’s newly enacted Markets in Crypto-Asset (MiCA) regulation. The exchange received its license through its Maltese-based arm in January 2025. In an April 3 announcement, the FIAU stated that while OKX significantly improved its AML policies in recent months, it “could not ignore” the past failures. Despite acknowledging OKX’s improvements, the FIAU explained that some of the transgressions were “serious and systematic.” Details of OKX’s AML Violations According to the FIAU, OKX drafted a business risk assessment (BRA) to identify vulnerabilities and threats in 2023 and found several issues. The regulator explained it identified numerous deficiencies in the BRA and CRA’s methodology, which rendered the exchange unable to access the money laundering risks it was vulnerable to sufficiently and to take the necessary measures to manage these risks. In its notification, the FIAU detailed: “Specifically, the Committee expressed greater concerns pertaining to the Company’s past failure to undertake an adequate assessment of the ML/FT risks emanating from its business and its customers, its inability to establish an adequate customer profile, in inadequately monitoring and scrutinising the activity of the majority of the files reviewed, and in failing to report to the FIAU suspicion of ML/FT in one of its customers. All such past administrative breaches could have potentially led to the unintentional facilitation of ML/FT.” Despite OKX’s vow to exclusively serve European customers, the FIAU noted money laundering risks associated with Okcoin Europe’s exposure to other jurisdictions, stating: “Despite the company’s strategy adopted to only service European-based customers, it was essential to also consider the potential [money laundering/financing terrorism exposure emanating from other jurisdictions, including from where the sources of the customers’ funding originated.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

One way to track this is through the ratio of the iShares 3–7 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEI) to the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG). This IEI/HYG ratio, highlighted by analyst Caleb Franzen , serves as a proxy for credit spreads and is now showing its sharpest spike since the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in March 2023 — a moment that marked a local bottom in bitcoin just below $20,000. Historically, bitcoin and other risk assets tend to fall during sharp credit spread expansions. The key question now is whether this surge has peaked or if more downside lies ahead. If spreads continue to rise, it could reflect mounting stress in financial markets — and spell further trouble for risk-on positioning. A credit spread represents the yield difference between safe government bonds and riskier corporate bonds. When spreads widen, it signals growing risk aversion and tightening financial conditions. However, Friday's market action seems to indicate that bitcoin is starting to decouple from the traditional markets, outperforming equities. One analyst event called it the new ""U.S. isolation hedge,"" indicating that BTC might be starting to act more like a safe haven or digital gold for TradFi investors.

Behind the plan. Behind the policy. He didn’t say it directly, but it’s clear now: the new wave of tariffs hitting every corner of the planet didn’t come from Trump alone. Elon helped design them. From the math behind the percentages to the backdoor strategy shaping the administration’s trade war, Elon is no bystander. And while he’s avoided saying it out loud, the fingerprints are his. As we all know, Elon is now Donald Trump’s closest friend in the White House, temporarily running the department Trump made up and called the “Department of Government Efficiency” or D.O.G.E. He’s been working inside the administration since January after he funded Trump’s campaign with hundreds of millions of dollars. Musk clashes with Navarro as Europe prepares counterattack on Trump Elon’s voice hasn’t been loud, but it’s been constant. Over the weekend, he appeared by video link at a gathering of Italy’s right-wing League party. In that appearance, Elon said he wanted the U.S. and Europe to build a “zero-tariff” free-trade zone, adding, “Both Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America.” Elon directed the comment to Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini. He also called for more worker mobility between the U.S. and Europe, though he didn’t say whether that advice was related to tariffs or immigration. That’s not the only advice he’s been giving. Elon has been in and out of the Oval frequently, giving Trump economic input, despite not being directly involved in official trade policy. Trump even said this week that Elon may leave the White House “in a few months,” but until then, he’s in the loop. While Elon has backed the broader direction of Trump’s trade policies, he’s also taken swipes at others shaping the approach. On Saturday, he took a shot at Peter Navarro, a former White House economic adviser from Trump’s first term. Elon wrote on X that Navarro’s Harvard degree was “a bad thing” and criticized him for “never building anything.” Navarro has long supported extreme tariffs and helped write past trade actions. Elon clearly wants everyone to know this round wasn’t Navarro’s work. Mark Cuban called Elon out directly. “Hey Elon, you may be the greatest manufacturing builder of all time. Did you need protective tariffs in order to manufacture in the USA?” he wrote. He pointed instead to private capital, Elon’s own investment, and government incentives as the real fuel behind his manufacturing success. Mark added, “By the way, what I respect most about you is that you go all in with your own money for your startups. Most people don’t have the balls to do it.” After someone asked him about the strategy behind the tariffs, Mark answered, “If the hierarchy of goals by Elon is to reduce the deficit first, and everything else is tied for last, the path of least resistance is for DOGE to make dramatic cuts and to implement tariffs like this.” Mark said the idea is to tank the economy enough to force the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. But that plan is risky. “The problem with the strategy is that tariffs at this level are incredibly inflationary. So the Fed can’t just cut rates, it would make inflation worse. And slow the economy down even further.” President Donald Trump with Elon Musk in the Oval Office. (Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok) Mark also raised another problem. “Let’s say China and the rest of the world comes back and says we will do zero tariffs on American goods, with no other manipulation, if the USA does the exact same thing. So no tariffs or shenanigans either way. I’ll ask you. Should he say yes?” While Mark doubts it’ll work, Elon is still pitching that zero-tariff dream. But that dream is in total conflict with the reality he’s helped create: a trade war with almost every major economy. And Tesla, his own company, isn’t immune. Tesla builds cars in California and Texas, so it’s less exposed than others to the new auto tariffs. Still, Elon said the company’s operations in China could take a hit. Elon is still publicly acting like he’s not leading trade policy. But the evidence says otherwise. Trump’s tariff percentages were literally calculated using the trade deficit numbers. That kind of math isn’t Peter Navarro’s style. Wonder who would incite and enable this ludicrousness. Elon is expected to step away from his White House advisory role once his 130-day stint ends—but the damage is done. His ideas are already locked into Trump’s policy.",OP-ED|D.O.G.E|EUR|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|DOGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-06 13:08:21

Cardano ( ADA ) was trading at $0.646 on Sunday, bringing its market cap to over $22.7 billion. The recent decline is mostly in line with the performance of other cryptocurrencies. Its top comparable tokens, like Solana ( SOL ), Binance Coin ( BNB ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ), have all moved into a bear market. You might also like: ‘Shock’ Fed warning risks crashing Bitcoin, altcoin prices Cardano navigates death cross There is a risk that the ADA price will continue downward in the next few weeks as a death cross pattern nears. A death cross forms when the 200-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages cross each other while pointing downwards. In Cardano’s case, the spread between the two moving averages has narrowed in the past few months. The 200-day MA stands at $0.729, while the 50-day one is at $0.736. The spread stood at over 20% a few weeks ago. A death cross often leads to a substantial decline over time. For example, the last time that Cardano price formed this pattern was in May last year, and the coin dropped by over 40%. The opposite of a death cross is known as the golden cross. Cardano formed this cross in November last year, leading to a nearly 200% price surge. Worse, Cardano has also formed a descending channel comprising a series of higher lows and lower highs. It also formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, a popular bearish continuation sign. Therefore, if the death cross pattern forms fully, the coin will likely continue falling in the next few days. If this happens, the next potential target will be $0.515, its lowest level in February this year. Cardano price chart | Source: crypto.news ADA faces major fundamental challenges Cardano price faces some major fundamental challenges too. The most visible one is that its ecosystem dwarfs that of other blockchains. The total value locked in the network has dropped to $314 million. In contrast, other recently launched chains with much smaller market caps, like Berachain, Sonic, Sui, and Sei have much higher assets in their DeFi networks. Berachain has over $2.97 billion in assets, while Sui has $1.2 billion. The same is true with Cardano’s stablecoin assets, a notable figure since all transactions in the blockchain industry are conducted in these tokens. Cardano has just $30 million in stablecoins compared to Berachain’s $1.3 billion and Sonic’s $576 million. Further, some of the most anticipated Cardano catalysts have not happened. For example, its integration with BitcoinOS , which was announced in October last year, has not been launched. Also, it is unclear whether the much-anticipated meeting between Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and a VIP happened and its outcomes. While a potential ADA ETF is a positive catalyst, the ongoing ETH ETF outflows indicate that investors are largely interested in spot Bitcoin funds alone.

A recent study by Atmos positioned the United States as a worldwide frontrunner among nations for digital asset support and integration. The nation’s commitment to blockchain technology sets a precedent for tokenization/digital payment integration of the global financial sector with a progressive regulatory approach, according to a study by BoxBet. You might also like: US leadership in crypto: The focus is on stablecoins | Opinion Indeed, many large US banks such as J.P. Morgan, Citibank and other large banks such as UBS, Société Générale, the Swiss Banking Association, Banque de France, UK Regulated Liability Network, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Barclays, Lloyds, DZ Bank, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Unicredit, SBI Holdings, Hitachi, SHIZUOKA BANK, TIS, NSD, Fujitsu, KDDI, MUFG Bank, Higo Bank, Kagoshima Bank, GMO Financial Holdings have launched digital asset services departments fueling the tokenization trend of the financial sector. Adopting new digital technologies enables financial institutions to considerably reduce operating costs, enhance transparency, and offer innovative services. Vivek Raman, CEO of Etherealize, states: “ Tokenized deposits will be the largest unlock for liquidity movement within banks. While stablecoins were the first instance of mass product-market fit for the blockchain ecosystem, stablecoins are not capital efficient. Tokenizing deposits (which could be IOUs or earn interest) allows for more capital-efficient movement. We are already seeing that with SAB 121 being repealed, the desire for banks to hold tokenized assets is increasing. We think the default choice—the safest, most secure blockchain ecosystem to hold tokenized assets—is within the Ethereum economy .” You might also like: The US focus is on tokenization friendly accounting rules | Opinion What are tokenized deposits? Tokenized deposits are a token representation of the traditional commercial deposits that have been converted into digital tokens on a blockchain network, where each token is backed by a retail or institutional deposit. It involves the conversion of traditional financial assets such as a certificate of deposit, or a savings account into a digital token that offers investors potential benefits like faster 24/7 round the clock transactions with smart contracts used to automate interest rates, increased liquidity, fractional ownership, transparency—eliminating any possibility of fraud or manipulation. Instead of holding physical cash or keeping money in a bank account, investors can hold digital tokens representing their certificate of deposit or savings account amount on a secure and decentralized ledger by empowering them to participate in the digital asset ecosystem, ultimately leading to cost savings. For example, a tokenized certificate of deposit is a digital representation of a traditional CD, which is a fixed-term cash investment with a guaranteed interest rate of return, adapted into a token that the investor can freely trade on various digital asset exchanges or platforms similar to other digital assets that are regulated under the same framework as traditional bank deposits, focusing on ensuring the underlying bank’s stability and compliance with existing regulations. This gives investors more flexibility and liquidity than a certificate of deposit, which often has an early redemption penalty. Universal Digital Payments Network’s tokenized deposit platform Last year, after running over a dozen proofs of concept, or PoC, with multiple global banks, technology companies, and intergovernmental organizations, UDPN launched two digital asset management systems for commercial use, designed to reshape the landscape of digital payments and assets in the financial sector: Tokenized deposit/stablecoin management system : Designed for both commercial banks and regulated stablecoin issuers, it streamlines the entire lifecycle of tokenized deposits and stablecoin services—from issuance to operation, including advanced interoperability features. Digital asset tokenization system : Provides a robust platform for financial institutions, such as banks and investment firms, to tokenize real-world assets and manage them within a regulated environment. Operating a digital asset system involves complex lifecycle management. These new digital asset systems—tokenized deposit/stablecoin management system and digital asset tokenization system—easily integrate into core banking systems and can be installed in a bank or a stablecoin operator’s on-premises or cloud environment to ensure compliance and security in a regulated environment. UDPN’s solutions efficiently link to legacy systems via APIs, ensuring seamless interoperability with traditional banking infrastructures and other digital asset systems within regulated frameworks, granting institutions full data sovereignty and the flexibility to choose their underlying infrastructure and deploy digital assets and tokens on any public or private blockchain. Both solutions allow the optional ability to interoperate with other regulated digital currency systems through UDPN’s infrastructure. This feature promotes seamless collaboration and integration within the digital asset ecosystem. As regulatory scrutiny intensifies around stablecoins and digital assets globally, UDPN’s platforms offer a robust and compliant framework tailored for operation within regulated financial environments. Source: UDPN Tim Bailey, VP of Global Business and Operations, Red Date Technology, explained: “ Financial institutions and banks are embracing innovation to stay ahead by utilizing UDPN’s cutting-edge tokenized deposit/stablecoin management system and digital asset tokenization system to forge the future of tokenized banking. This chart [above] is a general comparison between different types of digital currencies, such as tokenized deposits vs. stablecoins vs. retail and wholesale CDCs, not necessarily the capabilities of UDNP’s tokenized deposit/stablecoin management system .” Read more: The focus is on strengthening US leadership in crypto tech | Opinion",Opinion|bank|Blockchain|payments|Technology|United States,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-06 13:30:00
42992103,https://invezz.com/?p=2656077,1743946200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surpasses $6.1 million raised as momentum accelerates in early April,https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/06/mutuum-finance-mutm-surpasses-6-1-million-raised-as-momentum-accelerates-in-early-april/,"As April kicks off, the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction. With more than $6.1 million raised, investor attention is rapidly shifting toward this rising DeFi project. What started as a quietly emerging protocol is now becoming a top consideration among experienced market participants, many of whom are positioning early in anticipation of wider adoption. The momentum is clear—and so is the sense of urgency among those watching the final phases of the presale unfold. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is not another short-lived hype token. It’s a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that allows users to put their crypto to work in a smart, non-custodial way. The protocol’s mechanics offer both passive income for depositors and borrowing access for users who want to unlock liquidity without selling their assets. At its core, Mutuum is designed around simplicity, control, and transparency—three factors that experienced investors consistently seek in DeFi. The platform’s presale, currently priced at $0.025, has attracted over 7,750 participants, reflecting growing trust and confidence from early adopters. As the project heads toward its next price increase and eventual public launch at $0.06, the opportunity window for a favorable entry point is narrowing. The presale structure is tiered, meaning those who join earlier benefit from built-in value before the token ever hits a major exchange. What’s particularly notable about this momentum is the type of investors getting involved. This isn’t just casual interest from new entrants; experienced crypto holders and DeFi-native wallets are beginning to rotate capital into Mutuum’s ecosystem. The reasons are layered, but a few stand out. First, Mutuum isn’t selling a dream—it’s delivering functionality. The platform is already operational, offering features that include smart contract-based lending, overcollateralized borrowing, and interest-generating deposit systems. Participants receive tokens that reflect their holdings and track their accrued yield, giving them flexibility and visibility over their funds at all times. Second, the tokenomics are designed for long-term sustainability. A portion of the protocol’s revenue is allocated toward buying MUTM tokens from the open market. These purchased tokens are then redistributed to active contributors and stakers, creating a cycle of value that grows stronger with platform usage. This model has been tested in previous DeFi cycles, and Mutuum’s version has been refined to favor long-term participants over speculative short-term movement. Third, trust is being reinforced by action. Mutuum Finance is currently undergoing a smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the most reputable security firms in the blockchain space. This audit is seen as a key milestone that could further boost credibility and attract institutional attention. For investors who prioritize safety alongside returns, this is a positive signal that the project takes security seriously and is preparing for large-scale deployment. As the total raised crosses the $6.1 million mark, the remaining presale allocation is shrinking quickly. Analysts monitoring early-stage projects have pointed to MUTM’s low entry price, growing user base, and consistent development updates as signs that the token could perform well not just at launch, but across the broader 2025 cycle. With a launch price of $0.06, early investors are already positioned for more than 2x returns—before even factoring in post-launch growth or exchange listings. In a market where most presales struggle to gain traction, Mutuum is accelerating. The quiet start is giving way to visible traction, and the community is expanding with it. For those still watching from the sidelines, the current presale phase may be the last chance to buy at these levels before momentum carries the project into its next chapter. The DeFi space rewards those who recognize value early. With strong fundamentals, a clear roadmap, and a fast-moving presale, Mutuum Finance is showing all the signs of a project that’s not just trending—but building something with staying power.

Despite $SOL’s falling price, its TVL numbers in April were the highest they have been since June 2022, showing investors’ belief in the Solana ecosystem. Keep reading to find out the real significance behind Solana’s rising TVL, why it’s a good time to be bullish on it, and how you can maximize your earnings by investing in the best meme coins . Understanding Solana’s Falling Price Solana has fallen by more than 60% since mid-January, after making a high of $290. It’s now trading at around $120 and has tested its support of $113 twice. The last 7 days have also seen a sharp 15% decline, which can be attributed to Solana’s unlocking event on April 4th. Around 1.79M staked tokens, which were staked at $23, became available for trading on 4th April. This led to significant selling pressure, which pushed Solana down to its resistance levels. After a 60% decline in the first quarter, investors were keen to book some returns on the staked tokens. Solana Steady in Choppy Waters At a time when cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins, have taken a hit, Solana has been doing pretty well. Although the price is down, deposits on the network are on the rise. Solana dApps deposits reached 53.8M SOL – a 14% month-on-month increase. In terms of DEX volumes, too, Solana has been quite strong against the likes of Tron, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, and Base. It now holds a market share of 24%, thanks to its integrated Web3 user experience and emphasis on base layer scalability. $SOL is, in fact, only marginally behind Ethereum, which has a market share of 26%. The recent crypto dip has been a great opportunity for investors to jump in at some really low prices, and Solana has been no exception. More funds flowing into Solana is a reconfirmation of investors’ trust in the network – and potentially even the future of meme coins and altcoins. With the fundamentals growing strong, it’s only a matter of time before we see the prices pushing up as well. If you’re looking to join the crypto bandwagon, this could be a perfect time. Here are three top cryptos that are in a pole position to benefit from Solana’s upcoming rise. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Meme Coin Right Now Thanks to First-Ever L2 for Solana If you wish to ride Solana’s growth, there’s hardly a crypto project better than Solaxy ($SOLX) . That’s because it won’t just feed on Solana’s meme coin-friendly infrastructure, but it plans on making the blockchain network better than ever. Solana currently struggles with several issues that have hindered its growth and stopped it from reaching its true potential. The insane popularity of $TRUMP, $MELANIA, and meme coin launchpad Pump.fun overloaded Solana. As a result, the network became congested, and transactions started failing. Solaxy is building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. It will combine Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s speed to create a hyper-efficient meme coin infrastructure on Solana. According to Solaxy’s whitepaper , this multi-chain token will process a bunch of Solana’s transactions on a sidechain, thereby reducing weight on the network’s mainnet. What’s more, early buyers of $SOLX can also stake their tokens and earn 139% in staking rewards. Solaxy is currently in presale, where it has amassed a mind-boggling $29.2M so far. You can join one of the best crypto presales this year for just $0.001686 per token. Here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $SOLX . 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy for Bitcoin Maximalists While Solaxy could single-handedly be the reason we see a huge spike in meme coin activity, the fact remains that Bitcoin plays a massive role in deciding the larger crypto market’s direction. And with $BTC projected to cough up new highs sooner rather than later, the time is ripe to invest in a Bitcoin-themed meme coin like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . $BTCBULL’s specialty is that it’s the ONLY crypto offering free (and real) $BTC to its token holders as rewards. It’s worth noting that other meme coins typically offer a handful of ecosystem benefits or more of their own tokens as loyalty rewards. However, BTC Bull Token has raised the bar by pledging to give away Bitcoins to $BTCBULL holders who store their tokens in Best Wallet . These giveaways will take place every time Bitcoin surges past a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K, for the very first time. We also like that the developers have reserved 40% of the total token supply for marketing purposes. Combined with regular token burn events, there seems to be a strong plan in place to ensure $BTCBULL is always among the top trending cryptos . Currently in the early stages of its presale, BTC Bull Token has raised over $4.4M. You can join the tribe by paying just $0.00245 per $BTCBULL. Here’s how to buy it . 3. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – Community-Backed Meme Coin Posting Massive Returns Like Dogecoin, Fartcoin, too, owes its existence and popularity to the tech billionaire Elon Musk. That’s because it was created upon a suggestion by Truth Terminal, an AI chatbot. The bot explained that having a meme coin based upon Musk’s amusement with fart jokes could be a good idea. And indeed it was! $FARTCOIN is, in fact, one of the most profitable meme coins of this year, having gained over 66% in the last month – and an otherworldly 919,000% since its launch in October last year. The project rewards users with free $FARTCOIN tokens for submitting hilarious fart jokes. What’s more, every time you make a transaction, you’ll be greeted with an amusing fart sound. $FARTCOIN is currently trading at $0.4599 – up 9.5% in the last seven days. More importantly, the token looks like it’s now moving away from the lows it made in its February crash, when it dumped around 90%. It’s, therefore, one of the best cheap cryptos to buy right now . Bottom Line To conclude, Solana is looking like a million dollars thanks in part to Solaxy ‘s revolutionary roadmap for the network.

Nearly 400,000 FTX users risk losing $2.5 billion in repayments Nearly 400,000 creditors of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX risk missing out on $2.5 billion in repayments after failing to begin the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process. Roughly 392,000 FTX creditors have failed to complete or at least take the first steps of the mandatory Know Your Customer verification, according to an April 2 court filing in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. FTX users originally had until March 3 to begin the verification process to collect their claims. “If a holder of a claim listed on Schedule 1 attached thereto did not commence the KYC submission process with respect to such claim on or prior to March 3, 2025, at 4:00 pm (ET) (the “KYC Commencing Deadline”), 2 such claim shall be disallowed and expunged in its entirety,” the filing states.

Those who fail to meet the new deadline may have their claims permanently disqualified. Billionaire investor would “not be surprised” if Trump postpones tariffs Crypto-friendly billionaire investor Bill Ackman is considering the possibility that US President Donald Trump may pause the implementation of his controversial proposed tariffs on April 7. ""One would have to imagine that President Donald Trump's phone has been ringing off the hook. The practical reality is that there is insufficient time for him to make deals before the tariffs are scheduled to take effect,"" Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, said in an April 5 X post. ""I would, therefore, not be surprised to wake up Monday with an announcement from the President that he was postponing the implementation of the tariffs to give him time to make deals,"" Ackman added. On April 2, Trump signed an executive order establishing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from all countries, which took effect on April 5. Harsher reciprocal tariffs on trading partners with which the US has the largest trade deficits are scheduled to kick in on April 9.

To this end, the asset’s recent price action, where XRP tested the $2 support, is forming a bullish structure, signaling a possible “buy-the-dip” opportunity, according to an April 5 analysis by ImmortalAXS on TradingView. The analyst noted that XRP recently experienced a liquidity sweep, dipping below previous lows into a known support zone around $2. This move, often referred to as a “Swipe Liq / Adding more,” is a common tactic to trap sellers and collect liquidity before a sharp reversal. True to form, XRP quickly rebounded, suggesting a strong bullish reaction. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analyst noted that a developing triple bottom pattern at the $2 support level further strengthens the case. Each dip into this zone has been met with aggressive buying, indicating heavy accumulation by market participants. This repeated defense of the $2 area reinforces its importance as a key support level and sets the foundation for a potential upward move. Now, the next major hurdle for XRP lies at $2.48, a strong resistance zone that has been rejected twice. Therefore, a clean break and hold above this level would mark a shift in market structure, flipping resistance into support, and could signal the start of a bullish continuation, especially if backed by volume and momentum. If XRP convincingly breaks through $2.48, the next targets to watch are $3 and $3.40. These levels are psychological milestones and technically significant zones, aligning with previous price reactions. However, a clear invalidation point remains; a close below $1.79 would break the current structure and suggest sellers are back in control. This level is a critical stop-loss zone for traders looking to manage risk. Investors bullish on XRP price Currently, XRP is trading in line with the broader cryptocurrency market , which remains subdued amid equities reeling from the recent traffic-induced sell-off. Amid these conditions, on-chain data again indicates that most XRP investors are betting on the asset’s price rallying. Specifically, data shared by prominent on-chain crypto analyst Ali Martinez shows that Binance futures trading data reveals that 70.33% of traders with open XRP positions are long, pointing to a strong bullish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency.

MUTM’s Journey to the Top of DeFi,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/from-undervalued-to-unstoppable-mutms-journey-to-the-top-of-defi/,"The post From Undervalued to Unstoppable? MUTM’s Journey to the Top of DeFi appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the constantly evolving world of decentralized finance, it’s often the lesser-known projects that quietly build strong foundations before rising to prominence. One project that’s starting to shift from overlooked to in-demand is Mutuum Finance. Still early in its journey, Mutuum is building the kind of infrastructure that appeals to both everyday users and experienced DeFi participants—and many are now watching closely as it gains momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol focused on lending and borrowing. While that space already includes a number of established platforms, Mutuum takes a more balanced and accessible approach. The protocol allows users to earn interest on their crypto or access liquidity without selling their assets—all through smart contracts that eliminate the need for third-party intermediaries. Here’s how it works in practice: a user deposits an asset like ETH or stablecoins into the platform. In return, they begin earning interest based on demand within the pool. The system is dynamic—when borrowing activity increases, yields for lenders rise as well. This makes it attractive for long-term holders looking to earn passively while keeping full control of their deposits. Borrowers, on the other hand, can lock up their crypto as collateral to access funds without selling at potentially unfavorable prices. For example, someone holding MATIC may believe the price will rise in the coming months. Rather than liquidating it to free up cash, they can use that MATIC as collateral to borrow a stablecoin, giving them flexibility while maintaining exposure to future gains. This structure supports smart capital use without giving up asset ownership. Beyond its functional design, one of Mutuum’s strengths lies in its tokenomics. The native token, MUTM, serves multiple purposes within the ecosystem. Users who hold and participate in the platform are rewarded as the protocol uses a portion of its revenue to buy MUTM from the open market. These tokens are then distributed to active contributors, creating a system where ongoing engagement is met with ongoing value. This model helps build demand for the token while reducing circulating supply over time. It’s a sustainable model that incentivizes long-term behavior, something many early-stage DeFi tokens often lack. Looking ahead, the Mutuum team is preparing to launch a beta version of the platform, which will give users an opportunity to test and interact with the core lending and borrowing tools in a live environment. This milestone is expected to draw more attention and bring new users into the ecosystem, especially as it showcases the platform’s capabilities in real time. Another major driver of future growth is the expected listing of MUTM on top-tier centralized exchanges following the conclusion of its presale. Listings on major platforms typically bring a surge in liquidity and visibility, which can significantly impact token price. For early buyers who entered during the presale at just $0.025, public listings combined with platform activation could mark the beginning of a strong upward move. What makes Mutuum stand out isn’t just the promise of returns, but the structure it’s building around them. Transparent smart contracts, a dual lending model, real passive yield generation, and plans for a collateral-backed stablecoin all contribute to a layered and functional protocol. It’s not about hype—it’s about building a system that works and grows naturally over time. As the DeFi space matures, projects like Mutuum Finance that focus on user experience, sustainable rewards, and smart token design are likely to gain more traction. From an undervalued asset in its early stages to what could soon be a widely used protocol, MUTM’s journey is just getting started. And if the beta launch and exchange listings go as expected, the move from overlooked to unstoppable may happen sooner than many think.

Guide To Best Crypto Altcoins This April,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-cryptocurrency-to-invest-into-guide-to-best-crypto-altcoins-this-april/,"The crypto market is heating up again in 2025, drawing investors to the altcoin scene, where innovation and potential are buzzing. One project that’s really making waves is Yeti Ouro (YETIO) . It combines GameFi mechanics with the kind of meme coin appeal that gets people excited. But what sets it apart from other contenders? That’s where the most dynamic segment of the market comes in: the altcoin space. This year, we’re seeing projects that go beyond simple utility. They’re leaning into narrative-driven adoption, technological upgrades and strong community backing. Cryptocurrencies With Potential This Year Bitcoin is still the center of the crypto universe and in 2025 it’s as strong as ever. But recent volatility has left BTC struggling to break out of its range. After trading above $88,000 for most of Q1, Bitcoin price was dragged below $82,000 after Trump announced global tariffs. The resulting market uncertainty has spooked investors and we’re seeing a risk-off sentiment across crypto and traditional equities. Some say a dip to $73,800 isn’t out of the question unless macro conditions improve. But long term bulls are unfazed with predictions as high as $200,000 by year end given BTC’s limited supply and institutional adoption. Meanwhile Ripple’s XRP is making headlines after finally completing its regulatory battle with the SEC. XRP price is around $2.02 , down for the week but within its support range. Ripple’s push into stablecoin territory with the launch of RLUSD is being watched closely and if US lawmakers approve the bill backing Ripple’s stablecoin infrastructure many think XRP price could go beyond $5. On chain metrics are mixed and some bearish patterns are pointing to downside if sentiment doesn’t shift. Traders are watching closely knowing XRP’s next breakout will depend on clear legislative progress. Cardano is often praised for its academic and research first approach but is in a tough spot. ADA price is around $0.63 after falling from recent highs of $0.73. The platform is rolling out updates and building dApp infrastructure but price action hasn’t followed. There’s cautious optimism among analysts with forecasts of a rebound to $1.16 if network activity and partnerships increase. But some investors are wondering if ADA is undervalued or just stuck in consolidation without strong enough catalysts to move higher. Why You Should Pay Attention To Yeti Ouro Yeti Ouro has been gaining momentum over the last few weeks. With over $3.2 million raised in presale and over 212 million tokens sold so far, it’s no longer flying under the radar. Presale started at $0.012 and is now at $0.024 giving early backers of the project a 100% ROI as the token goes through different funding stages. Each round has been oversubscribed which is a clear sign that early investors see big upside. Only 17 days remain of the current stage and steeper price increases have been confirmed for the remaining Stages 4 and 5. Part of Yeti Ouro’s appeal is the solid foundation it’s built on. Tokenomics are designed for long term value: total supply of 1 billion tokens and allocation strategy for sustainable ecosystem growth, marketing and game development. And it’s been audited by SOLIDProof , a well known blockchain security firm. That level of transparency gives the community confidence that the smart contract is safe, functional and bug free. But what really sets Yeti Ouro apart is Yeti Go, a play-to-earn racing game built with Unreal Engine 5. It’s fast, competitive and visually stunning—way beyond the standard Play-to-Earn (P2E). Players can earn YETIO tokens by winning races and completing in-game achievements, creating a built-in economy where token demand is tied to user engagement. It’s not just speculation driving value; it’s usage. Yeti Go was born from a powerhouse collaboration with a world-renowned game asset studio—responsible for shaping iconic titles like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space. But it’s more than just a visual masterpiece. The game’s audio has been fine-tuned by expert engineers who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid, creating a soundscape that pulls you in from the first moment. Below is the main character of the game and project which can be seen stepping into a vivid, immersive world unlike anything we’ve seen. The integration of this gaming ecosystem with token based rewards creates a natural feedback loop of demand. As more users join to play and earn, the token’s utility increases and so does its value. That’s why some analysts are forecasting big price targets—up to $5 by the end of 2025. Given the current presale price, that’s 104x return. A $500 investment today could be worth $104,166 in a year if the momentum continues. It’s not just the numbers that are impressive. Yeti Ouro is riding a perfect storm of trends: GameFi, meme coins and a market looking for the next big story. It’s not just hype—it’s a well thought out project with a working product and a strong community behind it. Conclusion There are many altcoins to explore in 2025 from infrastructure plays like Solana and Chainlink to scaling solutions and DeFi powerhouses. Each has its pros but few have the high risk high reward profile of Yeti Ouro. Backed by strong tokenomics, a playable game, an audited contract and more it’s one of the best investment opportunities right now. For those who missed the early days of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu or Axie Infinity, Yeti Ouro might be the redemption arc. It’s not just a token—it’s a full ecosystem in the making and it’s one that retail investors are starting to notice. Whether you’re in it for the memes, the gameplay or the 294x returns, this is one altcoin you should check out this April. To invest in YETIO is easy. Investors need a good DeFi wallet on any network of their choice, including Meta mask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase, etc. Place an order on the official Yeti Ouro website for the preferred amount of YETIO tokens and complete it with a one-click transaction.

According to industry data , Solana-based DeFi platforms such as Pump.fun, Jito, and Raydium collectively brought in around $42 million in March, down 55% from February and a steep 75% from their record highs in January. On BNB Chain, leading protocol PancakeSwap generated just $21 million in revenue, marking a 54% drop compared to the previous month. Ethereum DeFi Revenues Plunge 65% Since January Amid Market Slowdown Ethereum-based protocols including Ethena, Lido, Aave, Curve, Compound, and Sushi also recorded losses, generating $24.5 million in total March revenue—down over 52% from February and 65% since January. MakerDAO, now rebranded as Sky, was the only major protocol to buck the trend. It reported $10 million in revenue for March, representing an 11% increase from the previous month and making it the sole gainer among the group of 11 major DeFi platforms analyzed. The decline in protocol revenues has mirrored the year-to-date performance of DeFi tokens. The monthly revenue of DeFi protocols has been on a declining trend for the last 4 months. This might be attributed to the sluggish wider market. But there are some exceptions: Yield Bearing stable coins have been getting more traction and volume. BTCfi based protocols… pic.twitter.com/sEPeP7a7DA — Hercules | DeFi (@Hercules_Defi) April 5, 2025 GMCI’s DeFi Index (GMDEFI), which tracks a basket of DeFi-related tokens across multiple chains, is down 40% so far in 2025. The index includes assets from projects such as Uniswap, Aave, Jupiter, Ethena, Maker, and PancakeSwap. Analysts suggest that the slump in DeFi revenues is largely due to reduced user engagement, fewer transactions, and broader market headwinds affecting crypto activity. DeFi TVL Drops Over 30% Since December Peak As reported, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has plummeted more than 30% since reaching a local high in December, underscoring growing market uncertainty and waning investor confidence. DeFi’s TVL currently sits at $94.49 billion, a sharp decline from its $137 billion peak on December 17. The value briefly dropped as low as $88 billion in March. The downturn mirrors the broader pullback in the cryptocurrency market, which had initially rallied following the November 5 election of pro-crypto U.S. President Donald Trump. At the time, investor optimism pushed DeFi TVL beyond the $100 billion mark. However, the enthusiasm has since faded amid growing macroeconomic concerns and regulatory challenges. The bullish momentum that followed Trump’s victory was overshadowed by a series of economic headwinds, including sweeping new reciprocal tariffs and persistent inflation concerns. The Federal Reserve’s extended pause on interest rate cuts has further dampened market optimism. Bitcoin has since fallen from an all-time high above $108,000 in January to around $83,000, while Ether slid from $4,000 in December to roughly $1,800. At the same time, regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. continues to cast a shadow over DeFi’s future. Dan Greer, co-founder of DeFi App, recently told Cryptonews.com that DeFi represents more than just a financial alternative—it is a potential evolution of the global financial system. However, he warned that unresolved regulatory issues may drive talent and innovation offshore. “Mass adoption of DeFi hinges on solving its biggest barriers: complexity, cost, and accessibility,” Greer said.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has failed to hold key support levels, and analysts are increasingly warning of a potential drop below multi-year lows near $1,750. With no clear consensus on where the next reliable support might lie, sentiment remains shaky and uncertain. Related Reading: Massive Chainlink Demand Wall At $6.26 As 90K Investors Buy 376M LINK The broader crypto landscape has faced heavy volatility, but Ethereum’s underperformance stands out. According to IntoTheBlock, ETH significantly lagged behind Bitcoin in the past quarter. This disparity has raised concerns about Ethereum’s short-term strength and resilience, especially as it continues to struggle below the $1,900 level. As macroeconomic instability, regulatory uncertainty, and risk-off sentiment continue to pressure financial markets, Ethereum’s path forward looks increasingly fragile. Without a strong rebound or renewed demand, the current trend suggests a prolonged period of weakness. Until bulls regain control and key resistance levels are reclaimed, the outlook for ETH remains cautious, with investors watching closely for any signs of a potential bottom — or further breakdown. Ethereum Holds Ground As Tariff Shock, Underperformance Fuel Market Anxiety Ethereum is trading at critical levels following weeks of mounting selling pressure and fading bullish momentum. The broader crypto market has been hit hard by escalating macroeconomic uncertainty, largely driven by US President Donald Trump’s recent policy shifts and sweeping tariffs. These moves have rattled investor confidence, sending shockwaves through both traditional and digital markets. Among major assets, Ethereum has been one of the most affected. Bulls lost control in late February when ETH broke below the $2,500 level, triggering a steady downtrend that has continued to weigh on price action. Attempts to regain support have consistently failed, and ETH now trades near multi-month lows with no clear bottom in sight. According to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum underperformed significantly this past quarter — losing nearly 50% of its value- while Bitcoin dropped just 15% in the same period. This widening performance gap has become a point of concern for investors who once expected ETH to lead a 2025 rally fueled by Ethereum-based developments and broader adoption. Now, all eyes are on the coming weeks. If bulls can reclaim key levels and reignite momentum, Ethereum may still have a shot at recovery. But if a bearish sentiment continues to dominate, a deeper correction — potentially below the $1,750 mark — could be next. The pressure is on, and Ethereum’s next move could set the tone for the rest of the altcoin market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Make-Or-Break Support Level – Will DOGE Hold? Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Ethereum is currently trading below the $1,800 mark, showing continued weakness as bulls struggle to regain momentum. The price remains firmly below the 4-hour 200 MA and EMA, both of which are clustered around the $2,000 level — a critical technical zone that previously acted as strong support. Now turned resistance, this area must be reclaimed for any hope of a sustained recovery. To shift the trend, bulls need to push ETH above $2,000 and ideally reclaim the $2,200 level, which would mark a break from the recent downtrend and signal the start of a potential recovery phase. Without that move, however, price action continues to favor sellers. The $1,800 level is now the last line of defense. Failing to hold and reclaim it quickly could open the door to a much steeper decline. If bears continue to pressure price below this zone, Ethereum may revisit levels not seen since early 2023 — with $1,750 and even $1,550 as potential downside targets.

Among the names gaining traction ahead of the next altcoin season is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a DeFi project with a clear roadmap, fast-growing community, and a token model designed for long-term growth. With its current presale price sitting at just $0.025, MUTM is being widely viewed as a high-potential candidate for major returns once market sentiment turns fully bullish. Early-Stage Price, Long-Term Vision Mutuum Finance is currently in its presale phase and has already raised over $6.1 million from more than 7,800 holders, showing strong early demand. The next phase will bring a price increase, while the final launch is expected to happen at $0.06—already more than double the current entry level. But investors are looking far beyond launch-day gains. With the right catalysts in place, analysts believe MUTM could surge as high as $8 by the end of 2025, representing a return of over 31,000% for those buying now at presale levels. Such projections aren’t without precedent. Previous altcoin seasons have seen low-cap tokens deliver massive returns as user adoption and exchange listings ramp up quickly. With the right timing and utility, these tokens can move fast—and Mutuum appears to be aligning the right ingredients for a similar trajectory. Unlike purely speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized platform designed to enable lending and borrowing of crypto assets in a non-custodial, permissionless way. The protocol supports both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. This dual approach allows users to interact with shared liquidity pools or directly negotiate lending terms with other users depending on the type of asset and risk preference. Mutuum also plans to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and issued on the Ethereum network. This stablecoin will offer users access to liquidity without needing to sell their crypto—an attractive tool for those looking to unlock value while holding long-term assets. All interest generated from these stablecoin loans is funneled back into the protocol’s treasury, reinforcing its financial structure over time. The MUTM token plays a central role in driving the platform’s economy. A standout feature is the buy-and-distribute mechanism, where a portion of protocol fees is used to purchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to mtToken stakers—users who actively contribute to the liquidity and function of the platform. This creates a feedback loop that supports price appreciation while rewarding long-term commitment. Combined with the token’s low initial market cap, this mechanism could make even modest protocol activity a strong driver of price growth. As more users interact with the platform, more MUTM gets bought and circulated among stakers, effectively linking token demand to actual usage. Another key factor behind investor excitement is the timing. The Mutuum team is preparing to launch a beta version of the platform shortly after the token becomes tradable, offering immediate utility for early holders. This stands in contrast to many presale projects that delay their product launches by months or longer. Additionally, MUTM is already drawing interest from top-tier centralized exchanges. Given the protocol’s fast-growing user base and strong presale momentum, a major listing is widely expected—an event that often serves as a trigger for upward price movement. In a market full of noise, investors are becoming more selective—and utility is starting to matter again. With a presale price under $0.03, real protocol development, a transparent token model, and clear plans for platform rollout, Mutuum Finance is checking all the right boxes for those seeking long-term growth in the next altcoin season. For investors who missed early runs in tokens like SOL or ADA, MUTM may offer another shot at outsized returns—this time, with fundamentals to match the hype.

The token continues its downward spiral as bearish momentum weighs heavily. Based on a detailed analysis of patterns, support/resistance levels, and key indicators, the outlook remains bearish unless reversal signals appear. Support and Resistance Levels Major Support: $0.0203 Key Resistance: $0.0242 and $0.0288 The price is sitting just above the $0.0203 support zone. If this level fails to hold, VET could dip toward the psychological $0.0180 mark. On the upside, the $0.0242 and $0.0288 levels act as resistance zones that need to be reclaimed for bullish momentum to return. Chart Patterns Descending Triangle: VET has formed a descending triangle pattern—a classic bearish continuation structure. This suggests a likely breakdown if support around $0.020 is breached. Falling Wedge: There is also a visible falling wedge forming, typically a bullish reversal pattern. However, the breakout confirmation hasn’t occurred yet. Bear Flag: Following a steep drop, VET has formed a bear flag. This continuation pattern indicates that the current sideways consolidation might resolve downward. Technical Indicators Bollinger Bands (20, 2): VET is hugging the lower band, reflecting oversold conditions and strong bearish pressure. The bands are also wide, signaling high volatility. MACD (12, 26): The MACD remains below the signal line and in the negative zone. Momentum remains bearish, with no crossover in sight. EMA (20): Price continues to trade below the 20-day EMA, reinforcing the downward trend. Until the price breaks and closes above this moving average, bulls will remain sidelined . RSI (14): The RSI is in the oversold region, hovering around 30. While this suggests the potential for a bounce, historical behavior during strong downtrends shows RSI can stay oversold for extended periods. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Outlook and Next Price Target Given the dominance of bearish patterns and the alignment of indicators, the near-term outlook for VET remains negative. If the $0.0203 support is lost, the next downside target lies near $0.0180. However, should the falling wedge break to the upside with increased volume, a relief rally toward $0.0242–$0.0250 could unfold. Volume remains relatively low, signaling a lack of conviction from buyers. A meaningful reversal will likely need a surge in demand accompanied by bullish confirmation from MACD and RSI. VeChain is at a critical juncture. Traders should monitor the $0.0203 support and watch for any signs of divergence in RSI or bullish MACD crossover. Until then, caution is warranted as the bears maintain control. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The image, which includes President Donald Trump embracing the American flag, places XRP firmly at the top of the chart. Squire captioned his post with, “XRP isn’t just winning, it’s dominating,” referring to XRP’s significant lead over its U.S.-based competitors. According to the graphic, XRP’s market cap stands at $126.29 billion, more than two times the market cap of Solana (SOL) at $62.21 billion and far ahead of USDC, which sits at $58.03 billion. The data reinforces XRP’s current dominance in the American digital asset space. $XRP isn’t just winning, it’s dominating. pic.twitter.com/RzfXw4Hdm5 — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) April 5, 2025 Can XRP Gain More Ground in the U.S.? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has abandoned its appeal in the long-running legal battle against Ripple, removing a significant regulatory hurdle that previously affected market sentiment around XRP. With that case closed, XRP has experienced a notable boost in credibility and investor confidence. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Its regulatory clarity in the U.S. now positions it as a frontrunner among American blockchain projects. The conclusion of the SEC case has also leveled the playing field. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, this development has unlocked the U.S. market . XRP could experience more growth and show more dominance over its competitors. This legal clarity also plays a major role in XRP’s current market position, as it offers institutional investors a clearer path for engagement. Ripple can now sell XRP to institutional investors , and widespread institutional adoption could be a game changer for the digital asset. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Policy The image in Squire’s post prominently features Donald Trump, the most pro-crypto president in U.S. history. Trump has shown openness to digital assets, recently hosting a crypto summit in the White House when the previous administration would not openly engage with crypto companies. Market analysts also believe a Trump administration would focus on supporting U.S.-based digital assets, placing XRP in the perfect position to benefit from such a shift in federal policy. What’s Next for XRP? Many community members expressed excitement for the digital asset. As one commenter noted , XRP is not leading the pack by chance, it has earned its spot at the top. As the only U.S.-based token in the top five globally by market cap, XRP has secured a unique advantage in what could soon be a friendlier policy environment under Trump’s leadership. Its regulatory clarity, increasing interest from institutions, and a favorable federal government create a strong foundation for future expansion.

The abrupt shutdown erased months of community engagement and developer momentum. Phaver, which aimed to bridge the Lens and Farcaster ecosystems, once had 35,000 daily active users and over 800,000 downloads. At its peak, the app accounted for 50% of all Lens traffic and 20% of Farcaster traffic. DeFi analyst Ignas shared his views on the platform’s collapse, citing a combination of strategic missteps and financial mismanagement: “Yesterday I learned that Phaver was shutting down all social media,” Ignas wrote, adding, “I had high hopes for Phaver, which combines the Lens and Farcaster ecosystems.” Related News: “The Bull in Bitcoin is Over,” Says Expert CEO, Explains Why and How Long It Will Take to Restart The platform’s token launch was marred by technical issues, including hours-long portal outages that prevented users from claiming tokens. The delays led to widespread FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), undermining user trust from the outset. According to Phaver team members, the project spent over $1 million to secure listings on five centralized exchanges (CEXs), including Bybit, KuCoin, and Gate.io. Despite this, trading volumes and liquidity failed to meet expectations. The critical decision by the Phaver team not to sell tokens due to the already high FUD during the tokenization event resulted in a lack of operational funds. “It was a mistake,” said one former employee, adding that the decision left the team without sufficient resources to continue operations. SOCIAL price has dropped 99% since its launch. Phaver had raised $8 million at a valuation of around $80 million from major backers like Polygon Ventures and Nomad Capital. However, the financial loss ratio and poor treasury management proved fatal. As a Finnish company, Phaver was also legally required to pay its employees for the mandatory 1-2 month notice period following the closure announcement. SOCIAL technically continues to trade on exchanges, but its value has fallen, shocking investors and users. *This is not investment advice.

As the Nasdaq and other stock markets fall, many investors are now looking to Bitcoin as a possible safe-haven asset. However, risks in the U.S. bond market, similar to those seen during the 2020 COVID-19 crash, could threaten this stability. Bitcoin Holds Firm While Stock Markets Decline Since President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on 180 countries, the Nasdaq has dropped 11%, raising fears of a trade war. Except for Bitcoin, global markets, U.S. stocks, and even gold have fallen. Although the asset briefly fell below $82,000, it quickly rebounded and is now above the $80,000 price. Experts like David Hernandez from 21Shares said that Bitcoin may act as a “macro hedge” to protect against big economic risks. Analysts believe that as more people trust Bitcoin during uncertain times, its value could stay strong. Some even said this trust could make Bitcoin a lasting safe-haven asset. Traditional Bond Market Risks Remain Despite Bitcoin’s recent strength, there are signs of trouble in the U.S. Treasury market. A risky strategy called the “basis trade” has grown in size. This trade involves hedge funds using large amounts of borrowed money to exploit small differences between Treasury futures and bonds. This strategy failed in March 2020, when financial markets were shaken by the pandemic. Investors rushed to sell assets, including Bitcoin, to get cash. On March 12, 2020, Bitcoin dropped nearly 40% in a single day. Robin Brooks, chief economist at the International Institute of Finance, said that high market volatility can lead to trade problems that use too much leverage. Brooks believes that if the bond market becomes unstable, it may trigger a large sell-off again. The size of the basis trade has doubled since March 2020 and is now about $1 trillion. Many worry that even a small change in bond yields could cause big losses. If the bond market becomes more volatile, hedge funds may sell Bitcoin and other assets quickly, just like during the COVID-19 crash. Volatility Index Signals Rising Risk The MOVE index, which measures expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, rose 12% on Friday to 125.70. Notably, this is the highest level since November 2024. This sharp increase suggests that uncertainty is growing, and market stress may rise in the coming days. A recent report from the Brookings Institution suggests the Federal Reserve may need to support hedge funds during times of stress to prevent serious disruptions in the Treasury market.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Bitcoin wavers below its all-time high, Yeti Ouro is stealing the spotlight with its blend of utility, meme energy, and Play-to-Earn gaming. Table of Contents Bitcoin price analysis Yeti Ouro: Gaming and crypto utility Bitcoin (BTC) has always been the trendsetter for the crypto market, with over 50% dominance. Over time, however, more altcoins have been introduced, and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) has been growing rapidly, fueled by its utility nature and combination of meme culture and Play-to-Earn (P2E). Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin started the year strong at $93,400 but ended Q1 at $82,510, marking an 11.7% decline. Despite a brief recovery, Bitcoin’s price remains down 0.93% in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $82,927. This is still far from its all-time high (ATH) of $109,220, which was just a few months ago. With a market cap of $1.65 trillion and a circulating supply of 19.84 million BTC, Bitcoin remains the dominant crypto asset. Analysts are confident that this is just a normal setback and the $80,000 support level will be crucial for bulls. At the moment, Bitcoin has a resistance zone at around $85,000. If market sentiment improves, Bitcoin could reclaim $90,000 and maybe even its ATH before the end of 2025.

The project has already raised $3.2 million by selling more than 212 million tokens. The YETIO coin price is currently $0.024, up 100% from the stage 1 price of $0.012. As the countdown continues, investors can take advantage of a 20% bonus on all purchases and 25% on purchases made of over $500, with the flexible buy option allowing use of either crypto or card. Why YETIO? Unlike typical memecoins, Yeti Ouro has integrated into the gaming ecosystem. Designed to fuel Yeti Go, an upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game, YETIO serves as both an in-game currency and an investment asset. Yeti Go is built on Unreal Engine 5 and expected to deliver high-octane PvP battles, where players can compete, strategize, and earn real rewards. Yeti Go is being developed in partnership with a top-tier game asset studio, celebrated for its work on blockbuster hits like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space. The game pairs visually stunning environments with a rich audio experience, crafted by sound engineers who’ve worked alongside Grammy-nominated artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. YETIO tokens will be used for in-game purchases, including skins, power-ups, and vehicle upgrades, ensuring value beyond speculation. Additionally, YETIO token holders can stake their assets to unlock exclusive rewards, premium content, and marketplace trading opportunities. The integration of a player-driven economy allows users to trade in-game assets for YETIO tokens, reinforcing its real-world utility. With Stage 4 around the corner, the Yeti Ouro price is expected to go up just like in the previous stages. That, combined with the bonus, could be an opportunity to get a higher return on investment. To invest in YETIO is easy. Investors need a good DeFi wallet on any network of their choice, including Meta mask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase, etc. Place an order on the official Yeti Ouro website for the preferred amount of YETIO tokens and complete it with a one-click transaction.

In a new CNBC interview, Ives says Trump’s sweeping and reciprocal tariffs are bad news for tech companies, particularly for firms relying on China for parts and labor. Last week, Trump issued an executive order imposing a 10% tariff on all imported goods entering the US, with the stated goal of safeguarding domestic manufacturing. Trump’s executive order also details country-specific tariffs, leading to a cumulative 54% tariff on Chinese imports. According to Ives, US tech firms like Apple are now under pressure to rethink their business model amid the potential increase in production costs. “It’s essentially an economic armageddon if these tariffs stay in place. The reality of talking in front of the microphone in a 202 area code is a lot different than the reality of moving the supply chain. And I think it speaks to our point that when you look at China-exposed names, from Nvidia to Apple to any of the [semiconductor] names, this is as nervous as I’ve seen investors going back to Covid March 2020.” Ives says he sees tech firms responding by hiking prices, leading to “demand destruction.” “If they hold in their current form, then essentially you have 15% to 20% demand destruction across the board in terms of costs that are actually going to have to come through.” The wealth management executive says that at the end of the day, American consumers will bear the brunt of Trump’s tariffs. “Whoever is going to pay it? It’s the consumer, and that’s the reality. You can talk about tariffs all you want, consumers are going to pay it on the iPhones, they’re going to pay it on electronics, they’re going to pay it across the board.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Q4 turned out to be an ideal window for swing traders to realize profits on Ether: ’25 Q1 End $1,824 (-45%) ’24 Q4 End $3,332 (+28%) ’24 Q3 End $2,603 (-24%) ’24 Q2 End $3,433 (-2%) ’24 Q1 End $3,508 (+59%) That’s according to historical Ethereum price data compiled by Yahoo Finance. Tough Times for Long-Term Ether Holders Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum smart money platform, has traded in a market doldrums since rolling far downhill from its $4,860 all-time high price in Nov. 2021. Over that time period, its largest competitor, Bitcoin (BTC) , has risen by greater percentages despite a heftier market cap and locked in its gains at higher long-term support levels. Ethereum didn’t rally as far as Bitcoin in 2024, nor did it hold as much of its market cap as crypto markets sharply corrected this February. Quinn Thompson, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Lekker Capital, a Hague, Netherlands-based small hedge fund that launched last year, said at the end of March: Make no mistake, $ETH as an investment is completely dead… There is no investment case here. As a network with utility? Yes. As an investment? Absolutely not.” Ethereum has some significant headwinds and difficulties creating price resistance, but other financial analysts expect it to recover and continue its long-term high growth trend. Standard Chartered Ether Price Forecast: $10K Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s crypto research head, predicted in October that Ether prices would rise to $10,000 in President Donald Trump’s second term. The UK multinational bank had $367 billion in assets under management in 2024. Kendrick hit a bullseye with his prediction last February that Ether’s price would climb to $4,000 by year end. Meanwhile, in March, a report in Forbes Digital Assets noted that an increase in ETH long positions taken by futures market traders in Q1 signals a rally starting soon. The report said: “Though the price of Ethereum could fall further, the futures data indicates that institutional traders believe it could soon trade as high as $2400 – a 22% increase over today’s price.” Since 2023, this market has been a reliable leading indicator for rallies and routs in Ether’s price. Together, these two analyses forecast near-term and long-term gains for Ether purchased in Q2 of 2025. But here are five hurdles Ethereum will have to overcome along the way: 1. L2 Ethereum Gas Wars Ethereum underwent a systemwide reboot from processor mining to currency staking to pay transaction validators in Sept. 2022. The currency community called this historic operation “The Merge.” Changing from proof-of-work (mining) to proof-of-stake validation promised more network bandwidth, faster settlement, and lower fees to use Ethereum. The redesign failed to impress users or markets sufficiently. As a result, Ethereum deployed a new incentive structure with the Dencun upgrade on Mar. 13, 2024. This configuration introduced a new, far cheaper method for second-layer (L2) blockchains to lock their updates into the Ethereum base chain (L1). A year later, that leaves the Ethereum network in its “ELthereum” era. A whole slew of new Layer-2 chains now handle much of the network’s business for lower fees and then periodically lock in a small hash of all their latest blocks with the base chain. The base chain’s revenues from fees consequently dropped from $30 million annually one year ago to just $500,000 in Q1 of 2025. That has left some irritated Ethereum stakers high and dry. Most Ethereum L2s use their own native currencies. The largest by market cap in Q2 2025 are (in descending order by size): Mantle (MNT), POL (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Movement (MOVE), and Starknet (STRK). Their average market capitalization was $1.49 billion to end Q1. 2. More Trump Coattail for Solana President Donald Trump has become a singular influence on the crypto sector, with an agenda of unprecedented and unequivocal support for cryptocurrency from the US government. The president and the Trump family’s crypto business warmly support both Ethereum and Solana but have shown some favoritism toward the latter in their business ventures. The new Trump stablecoin launched in March, USD1, is an Ethereum and Binance token. Meanwhile, in February, the president’s son, Eric Trump, pumped Ether in a post on X. But Solana hosts the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin, which ranked #4 by total market capitalization among all meme coins at the beginning of April. Its market cap topped $2 billion. Imagine if the president and his family supported Blu-ray or HD DVD during that format war. Meanwhile, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has been beefing with Trump, while the founder of competitor coin Cardano (ADA), Charles Hoskinson, is making inroads with the new White House administration. Last July, Buterin told followers he is against “choosing your political allegiances based on who is ‘pro-crypto.'” The note was widely read as a snub to President Trump’s campaign. However, this could work in Ethereum’s favor among the Internet’s decentralization purists. 3. Solana Memes Clobbering Ethereum It’s not just the Trumps that favor Solana’s lightweight, low-fee network to deploy meme coins. One analyst recently said the Solana meme frenzy is a headwind for Ethereum. Hong Kong-based institutional crypto manager ($1 billion+ AUM) HashKey Capital’s Jeffrey Hu said in March: “Ethereum is also not doing well in terms of community culture. In contrast, Solana clearly places more emphasis on meme coin community culture, which has attracted more application development and on-chain transactions.” Ethereum has had some massive successes, such as Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), but the overall capitalization and daily trading volume for Solana memes markedly eclipses Ethereum. 4. Wall St. ETFs Favor BTC over ETH Meanwhile, Wall Street’s ETF investors clearly favored BTC in Q1 2025, but before that as well. As Bitcoin ETFs flows flipped green on Mar. 17 for nine consecutive trading days, Ether ETFs remained bearish with net outflows on each day over that period. On the 1-month window, Wall Street investors sold $760 million worth of Ether ETFs. During that same time, big Internet traders with whale-sized addresses holding 10,000 ETH or more declined from 999 to 919. Wall Street’s selling pressure put resistance on Ethereum price gains in March. 5. Bitcoin Maxis Flex Social Clout During this Bitcoin bull run, there have not been any Ethereum boosters with the profile and charisma of the Bitcoin maxis like Michael Saylor and Robert Kiyosaki. Saylor’s BTC treasury company Strategy announced another monster Bitcoin purchase on Mar. 31 of 22,048 BTC for around $1.9 billion. There is no comparable figure from corporate America with that kind of conviction and endless appetite for Ether yet. Meanwhile, bestselling investing author Robert Kiyosaki regularly pumps BTC to his X audience of 2.7 million followers. The most similar thing the Ethereum camp has at the moment is maybe Mark Cuban. He calls himself an Ethereum maximalist. But he’s a big Bitcoin bull too, and he hasn’t been as bombastic in supporting ETH as the Bitcoin maxis have been for BTC.

The SEC specifies that Covered Stablecoins are backed by low-risk, liquid assets with reserves matching or exceeding the redemption value of all circulating tokens. The guidance excludes algorithmic, yield-bearing, and non-USD-pegged stablecoins. The two primary stablecoins fitting this definition are Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ).

While JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. were busy preparing as lead underwriters, the Wall Street Journal reported that Circle was reassessing its IPO timeline due to economic uncertainties.​ Tariff uncertainty The decision to delay the IPO reflects broader market conditions. Markets reacted swiftly to Trump’s tariff announcements, with U.S. small caps leading a broad equity sell-off and crypto weakening . The U.S. dollar declined against major currencies, while the yield curve bull-flattened, signaling increased recession fears. Nansen analysts believe that markets had priced in a stagflation scenario, anticipating slow growth alongside rising inflationary pressures. Crypto funding rates plunge Traders are exercising extreme caution in the crypto markets, as Trump’s tariffs spark widespread bearish sentiment. The rapidly escalating trade war between the U.S. and most of its major trading partners is striking fear into traders. On Friday, April 4, funding rates on most centralized and decentralized exchanges dropped below the 0.005% threshold , a signal of extreme bearish sentiment. At the same time, liquidation rates are down 42% over the past 24 hours. While this may seem like good news, it likely indicates that traders are hedging and staying on the sidelines. This aligns with a sharp decline in trading volumes, which dropped by 22.71% in 24 hours to $247.6 billion. Altogether, these figures point to plummeting market activity.

However, this range is expected to hold, potentially leading to a bullish reversal. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin has been moving sideways above the $80K key support zone, which includes the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels and the ascending channel’s lower boundary. This area is a critical psychological and technical support, likely filled with buying interest. However, if sellers gain control and push the price below, a wave of long liquidations could trigger substantial declines. The next major trend will depend on Bitcoin’s price action around the $80K zone. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin faced selling pressure at the upper boundary of its descending channel, resulting in a sharp rejection. The price is now testing short-term support at $83K, aligning with a previous swing low. While some buying interest may emerge, overall market momentum remains weak, with sellers still in control. If buyers fail to defend this level, a drop toward the channel’s mid-boundary at $79K will become likely. Conversely, a breakout above the descending channel’s upper trendline could trigger a rally toward $93K. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan This chart illustrates the Miners’ Position Index (MPI), a key metric that measures the ratio of total miner outflow to its one-year moving average. Elevated MPI values indicate heightened selling pressure from miners, which can signal potential price declines. Currently, the MPI remains below zero, suggesting no significant miner-driven selling pressure. Although the total number of Bitcoins held by miners continues to decline gradually, the USD value of their holdings has been trending steadily upward. This trend implies that miners remain confident in their operations. While their BTC reserves are shrinking, their USD-denominated value is increasing, reducing the incentive for mass liquidations even amid market downturns. This behavior suggests that the ongoing correction is more likely a deep consolidation phase rather than the start of a bear market.

This leaves behind a devastating selling pressure seen on the technical indicators, as ETH is sitting on support levels last seen in late 2023. Its next stop, according to analysts, is now seen effectively around $1,600. Against this backdrop, traders are shifting gears, pumping capital into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a presale-stage token that’s showing a 60x growth outlook. With $6.1 million already raised, and Phase 4 moving at $0.025 per token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a safe haven for investors. Ethereum enters a death spiral of bearness The daily chart for Ethereum shows a horrible picture, with its price wrecked under the 20-day moving average since January 2025. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) metric highlights this continued selling as it has languished at new lows, with whales presently transmitting around BTCs to exchanges. Previous strong support around $1,824 has broken to allow bears to aim for the $1,550 area — a price not seen since in a long while. ETH shorts led up to $1,850 on lower timeframes to create a current rejection here — the level now flipped resistance — while liquidation clusters near downside appear near $1,640. “There’s also no bullish reversal, so Ethereum’s likely path of least resistance is settlement down,” and traders have “desperately” been looking for alternatives, said Avtar Sandhu, a crypto trader based in Australia. The presale momentum of Mutuum Finance As difficulties mount for Ethereum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding the tide of changing sentiment, attracting more than 7,800 investors in its active presale. Phase 4 is available at $0.025, acting as a last chance before a 20% increase to $0.03 in Phase 5. Tokens are expected to be listed at $0.06, meaning early participants could net a 140% return on launch. Outside of this baseline, projections demonstrate explosive post-launch potential, with modest estimates aiming for $1.50—60x from here. This asymmetrical risk-reward ratio is drawing in capital like a vortex, compounded by the buy-pressure mechanics of Mutuum’s (MUTM) structured buy pressure. In addition, the protocol’s lending model funneled a portion of platform fees into strategic MUTM buybacks, methodically returning tokens to long-term stakers. This cyclical deflation mitigates sell-side pressure while rewarding retention — a dynamic that’s markedly absent from speculative rivals. When paired with mtTokens—interest-bearing deposit certificates that transact between DeFi—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ties together utility and scarcity, a dual engine for value accretion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced they are currently undergoing a smart contract audit with Certik, with results published at any moment. This pre-emptive protective measure goes hand in hand with a $100,000 presale giveaway, cultivating investor confidence in MUTM. Ethereum’s woes have without warning spotlighted the elliptic, secure world of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where presale friction and imbued tokenomics come together to provide an exit from the tumble of volatility. The 20% increase can be sprung at any time, and Phase 4’s $0.025 price will soon become a distant memory. As traders flee sinking ships for steadier vessels, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is there to capitalize on the exodus — turning Ethereum’s defeat into its hard-fought liquidity gains. Time to capture the asymmetric opportunity When markets fall, generation defying opportunity is created. One such inflection point comes in the form of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), combining presale value with post-launch ambition. As Ethereum grapples with gravity, MUTM soars, buoyed by the grit of utility, demand loops, and investment campaigns. The pending completion of the Certik audit will only serve to add further credibility. For anyone in search of an exit from crypto’s tempest, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) doesn’t just provide shelter, but a launchpad. Act before Phase 4 concludes.

This suggests low market activity, leading to a short-term consolidation phase. XRP Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart XRP has been trading within a tight range, constrained by the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, signaling market indecision. Following a sharp decline, the price has now reached the crucial $2 support level, a key area that has held firm since December 2024. Given the current low trading activity and the balance between buyers and sellers, XRP is expected to maintain consolidation above this level until a surge in demand or supply dictates the next major move. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, XRP’s consolidation near the $2 support zone is more pronounced, indicating a state of equilibrium in the market. A slight bullish divergence between the price and the RSI suggests the potential for buying pressure to emerge in the coming days. Additionally, the recent price action aligns with the Wyckoff accumulation pattern, increasing the likelihood of a short-term bullish rebound. If this scenario plays out, Ripple could target the $2.5 level as its next major resistance.

Speaking at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing’s annual conference, Powell highlighted that the scale of these tariffs exceeded expectations and could significantly complicate the Federal Reserve’s path forward. Tariffs Expected to Hit Inflation and Growth In his prepared remarks, Powell didn’t mince words about the consequences of the new trade measures. “While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,” he stated. The Trump administration’s new policy includes a blanket 10% tariff on all foreign imports. Countries with large trade surpluses with the U.S. will face even steeper levies, which economists warn could raise the effective tariff rate above 25%. This shift is expected to weigh on economic expansion and put upward pressure on prices across a range of goods. Fed Holds Steady Amid Economic Uncertainty Despite the potentially disruptive effects of the new tariffs, Powell made clear that the central bank is not planning any hasty policy moves. Instead, the Fed intends to remain patient and await further data. “We are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,” Powell said. “It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy.” The central bank’s cautious stance is influenced by several uncertainties, including the specific details of the tariffs, how long they will remain in effect, and the likelihood of retaliatory measures from trade partners. Powell emphasized that these variables will be closely watched before any decisions are made. Current Economic Outlook: Stable but Challenged Powell acknowledged that the U.S. economy is currently in “a good place,” with healthy growth, a solid labor market, and inflation running above the Fed’s 2% target. However, he warned that this stability could be threatened if the tariff hikes filter into prices over the coming months. “Higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,” he said. Recent economic data suggests inflation is already proving stubborn. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index—widely regarded as the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge—climbed 2.8% year-over-year in February. This further complicates the inflation fight, especially if tariffs worsen price pressures. Inflation Expectations Remain Anchored—for Now Despite these risks, Powell tried to strike a balanced tone. He pointed out that while progress toward the 2% inflation goal has slowed, inflation expectations remain “well anchored.” He emphasized that the central bank would work to ensure that tariff-driven price increases do not turn into long-term inflation problems. The Fed’s ability to manage these emerging threats will depend on its flexibility and patience. Powell’s speech underlined that the central bank is not rushing into policy changes but remains watchful and ready to adapt as conditions evolve.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-06 14:44:09

After weeks of persistent lower highs and fading momentum, bulls are under pressure to hold the line. If this level breaks, a sharp leg down could follow. This analysis breaks down the technical indicators, chart patterns, and short-term forecasts to understand XLM’s next potential move. Key Support & Resistance Levels Support Zone: $0.2400 – $0.2450 This is a historically significant area. A breakdown below could trigger a fall toward $0.2200 or even $0.2000. Resistance Levels: $0.2700 and $0.3000 Bulls must reclaim these levels to shift short-term sentiment. Trend Overview The prevailing trend is bearish , characterized by consistent lower highs and lower lows on the 4-hour chart. XLM remains below key moving averages, and momentum continues to lean in favor of sellers. Indicator Insights MACD (12, 26): The MACD histogram is negative and the signal line is dominant. No bullish divergence or crossover is visible — signaling ongoing downward pressure. EMA (20 & 50): XLM trades below both the 20 and 50 EMAs. These moving averages have acted as dynamic resistance throughout the downtrend, confirming weak buying strength. Bollinger Bands: Price is hugging the lower band, indicating oversold conditions. However, volatility is compressing, suggesting an impending breakout — likely downward unless buying pressure returns. Volume Profile: Volume remains low, underscoring weak conviction. A breakout or breakdown with a strong volume will be crucial to validate the next move. Key Chart Patterns Descending Triangle: A classic bearish pattern forming on the 4H chart with a flat base near $0.2450. A breakdown would confirm continuation lower. Bear Flag: The recent consolidation looks like a bear flag — suggesting the downtrend is likely to resume soon. Rounded Top: A slow reversal pattern indicating that upward momentum has fully stalled out. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Outlook & Prediction The next few 4H candles are critical. A decisive break below $0.2450 could trigger a slide to $0.2200, followed by $0.2000 if bearish momentum strengthens. However, if bulls defend support and break above $0.2700, a short-term relief rally to $0.3000 could be in play. For now, the bearish bias remains intact unless volume spikes in favor of the bulls with a strong close above the 20-EMA. Stellar (XLM) is teetering on a critical edge. The technical landscape suggests sellers are still in control, but oversold signals offer bulls a narrow window for a potential bounce. Traders should closely watch the $0.2450 level, as the next move will likely dictate XLM’s short-term trajectory.

This article explores the upcoming price movements and offers insights on which of these two coins might be poised for future growth. Stay tuned to discover potential market trends and price forecasts for ADA and XRP. Cardano ADA Analysis: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels Cardano dipped nearly 29% within the last month with a modest weekly decline of about 4%. Over six months, the coin surged by around 84%, showing a strong rebound from previous lows. The figures reveal short-term challenges contrasting with long-term recovery, highlighting an uneven journey in price action. The current trading range of ADA lies between $0.47 and $1.02, with immediate resistance at $1.37 and support near $0.27, and a secondary resistance at $1.92. Bearish signals appear as momentum indicators are weak and the RSI sits at 41. Traders might watch for potential rebounds at support or test resistance levels to catch a reversal, keeping positions aligned with these key benchmarks. XRP Market Trends: Six Month Surge Amid Short-Term Decline XRP recorded a slight weekly decline and an almost 18% drop over the past month, paired with a remarkable 303.73% rise in the last six months. The price behavior shows sharp short-term corrections contrasted by robust long-term gains, reflecting the volatility inherent in its market cycle and the broader altcoin season. Current price trades between $1.66 and $2.77, with key levels marked by support at $1.23 and resistance at $3.45. Negative momentum and oscillators suggest a slight bearish sentiment, though the trend remains range-bound. Trading ideas include buying near the support level and watching for a breakout above resistance to signal a shift in market sentiment. Conclusion ADA shows some potential for a rebound despite its recent instability. On the other hand, XRP faces challenges with weak demand and increasing supply, which may lead to a downward trend. Both coins have distinct dynamics, and their future movements will depend on how these factors evolve in the short term. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While unsustainable development costs and an innovation crisis seem to be the main culprits behind the collapse, Web3 gaming emerged as a potential solution promising to return power to developers — and it raised billions of dollars in investment to do so. Yet, despite a continued rise in crypto adoption, Web3 gaming has failed to capture mainstream players’ attention or solve any of gaming’s fundamental problems. Why? Early blockchains were designed for financial applications. Game developers were forced to either build on blockchains that weren’t designed for their use or create their own chains that isolated themselves from the blockchain ecosystem. Either choice led to poor player experience and an overemphasis on tokenomics. Many developers choose the latter, picking control over connectivity. Inadvertently, this resulted in walled gardens that were not dissimilar to the ones that contributed to traditional gaming’s collapse. A solution that created more problems A recent article in The New York Times revealed that over the last 30 or 40 years, video game industry executives have bet on better graphics to bring in players and profits rather than leaning on creativity. Traditional gaming development is costly, regularly exceeding $100 million per title. Indie developers often struggle to compete against large publishers who ultimately control funding and distribution. Blockchain seemed to be a promising solution for indie studios, providing them with new avenues to raise funds and giving them control over distribution. Early Web3 gaming platforms, however, ended up recreating the same enclosed systems that blockchain was trying to fix. With high player acquisition costs and limited Web3 gamers, Web3 gaming platforms deepened their moats to prevent users from moving away. As it continued developing, Web3 gaming introduced its own problems. An impossible choice for game developers The technological infrastructures of layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum and Solana were created for finance and not aligned with gaming’s requirements. Beyond transaction speed, layer-2 solutions were not designed to handle gaming’s unique needs either. Game developers — attracted to Web3’s funding model, promises of ownership and user engagement, are forced to either build on existing blockchains and compromise gameplay or launch their own chain — which diverts attention and resources away from what they want to do: make better games. Recent: Web3 gaming investors no longer throwing money at ‘Axie killers’ While crypto native players may feel this is a worthwhile tradeoff, mainstream gamers want engaging experiences. A January DappRadar report showed that Web3 gaming had reached 7.3 million unique active wallets , but in speaking with the community anecdotally, approximately 10,000 of those represent the actual gaming cohort who aren’t in games just to farm rewards. This number may be higher but is not more than 50,000 to 100,000 at the most. A misalignment with gaming culture The thing that converts mainstream users onchain isn’t non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or decentralized finance, its meaningful ownership of in-asset games. Mainstream gamers have spent decades on arcade games, Nintendo or mobile games. If combined with true ownership of in-game assets, that familiarity is powerful enough to create a compelling experience for developers and gamers. While Web3 games claim to be revolutionizing gaming, most projects aren’t listening to actual gamers. In actuality, they end up competing for the same crypto-native users. Rather than focusing on fun and engaging gameplay, most Web3 games are led by crypto technology and tokenomics. Within this bubble , success in Web3 gaming meant taking crypto users from each other rather than bringing new players onchain. With rare exceptions, the industry lost sight of what’s important: making fun games that people want to play. This misalignment also extends to game developers who want to enter Web3 to create better player experiences and sustainable revenue models. Game studios understand the potentials of Web3 but are hesitant to navigate crypto’s complex systems, which require technical skills to build protocols with sufficient liquidity and user bases while delivering seamless gameplay simultaneously. Make games fun again As major studios continue to struggle, Web3 has a second chance to deliver on its promise. But this time, we must rethink how games interact. We must focus on creating access for creators and players instead of building new walled gardens. This requires Web3 gaming-specific infrastructure that provides both developer control and cross-ecosystem collaboration. The path forward is clear. We need to restore economic freedom to creators and put control back in players’ hands. That means revenue models that reward collaboration instead of isolation. Most importantly, it means returning to gaming’s roots — making games fun again. The future of gaming isn’t about better graphics or token incentives. It’s about creating an industry where creativity and collaboration can thrive. When developers can focus on making engaging experiences instead of building moats, everyone wins.

Here Are 3 Crypto Coins Could Flip $30 into $3000 Before It Hits $0.74 ATH,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-still-is-trading-79-below-its-ath-here-are-3-crypto-coins-could-flip-30-into-3000-before-it-hits-0-74-ath/,"Dogecoin sits 79% below its record high of $0.74, and has struggled for a pullback as investors rotate into assets with clearer paths to growth. As the volatile meme coin snatches up the headlines, three cryptocurrencies are stealing the show, with a high potential to turn small investments into huge returns — Solana (SOL), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Ripple (XRP). Solana’s scalable blockchain remains appealing to developers, XRP anticipates a resolution in its SEC case, and presale earnings for Mutuum Finance have passed $6.2 million. A standout name among them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , whose fourth presale phase is moving at speed, and where a 20% price rise is not far away in the following stage. The User Growth Optimism Driven By Solana’s Scalability Now trading at $126.46, Solana has fallen more than 50% off its all-time high of $294.33, but analysts see a comeback towards $400 in 2025. Its ecosystem, which includes more than 1,000 decentralized applications, benefits from speeds faster than Ethereum and tiny fees. Network upgrades targets previous congestion issues, meanwhile institutional interest is gaining traction in NFT’s and decentralized finance. But Solana’s dependence on larger market trends and regulatory changes keeps high-risk, high-reward guesswork in play. If adoption slows, prices could stagnate around $250, leaving its trajectory somewhat unpredictable compared to new presale opportunities. Speculation Rides on XRP’s Legal Clarity Ripple (XRP) is still pinned at $2.17 as analysts argue about its short-term prospects. Based on historical patterns similar to its 2017 rally, crypto expert Egrag Crypto recently predicted a rise to $27 within 60 days. Technical indicators point to a key resistance level at $2.70 and a breakout could trigger more substantial gains. XRP, however, is still bound to Ripple’s active suit with the SEC and sentiment in the market. A solution, however, has shown a need for growth, the reliance on external factors is juxtaposed with presale projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where the structured tokenomics offer predictable returns. Momentum of Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in its fourth presale stage and is available at $0.025, and over 7,900 holders have already grabbed tokens since presale began. MUTM price rises 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5. At its $0.06 listing on the exchange, early participants can reap 140% returns, with its post-launch targets of $3.50—13,900% growth from the current phase—symbolising its historic potential for disruption. Utility and profit incentives converge in the platform’s decentralized lending model — with overcollateralized loans and interest-bearing mtTokens. By generating revenue from loan fees, a buy-and-distribute mechanism is put in motion, generating systematical demand for tokens, while simultaneously rewarding long-term stakers for their loyalty. Purchasing MUTM at $0.025 grants investors a tidy 140% profit at launch, as analysts predict a blistering rise to $3.50 as adoption takes off. While potential value accrued from Mutuum Finance’s tokenomics and user base easily eclipses most market yields. The presale’s $6.2 million haul illustrates a confidence in its model, which chooses liquidity stability and sustainable growth over speculative hype. Security Assurance The developers behind Mutuum Finance are in the final stages of a smart contract audit with CertiK, a milestone that should bolster investor confidence. Results will be posted through official channels, alongside the team’s transparency ethos. Coupled with a $100,000 giveaway for presale participants, these initiatives help generate substantial visibility while reducing risks traditionally associated with relative newcomers to the space. Timing the Market Shift As Dogecoin faces volatility, Solana, XRP and Mutuum Finance offer different approaches to harnessing crypto’s next growth wave. While SOL and XRP depend on outside forces, MUTM’s presale arrangement provides concrete profits, with every phase specifically increasing the availability of discounted tokens. In fact, more than 20% of Phase 4 allocations have been claimed, indicating increasing scarcity as the project heads towards exchange listings. For those looking to invest in assets protected from the vagaries of meme coin trading, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines DeFi creativity with presale excitement. The opportunity to purchase at $0.025 doesn’t last long, so strike while the iron is hot, or lose your chance to climb!

Or has its moment passed the baton to something newer, leaner, and more prepared for what 2025 demands? That’s the million-dollar question buzzing across Telegram chats and Discord servers right now. While Solana is clawing its way through resistance levels, a fresh face is flying past early benchmarks like a rocket — we’re talking about MAGACOIN FINANCE . With over $5.3 million raised and 10,000+ holders, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just creeping onto radars — it’s setting off alarms. Touted as one of the Best Altcoins to Buy and Hold for Short Term , this project is powering through its newly launched presale, giving early investors front-row seats to what could be one of the top-performing coins of the year. And yes, it’s bringing that “this could be the one” energy to the table. Solana’s Current Market Position: Breakout or Breakdown? Solana (SOL) has recently been navigating a complex market landscape, with its price movements capturing the attention of traders and analysts alike. According to a recent analysis, SOL has been testing critical support levels, and while the overarching trend suggests bullish potential, a minor breakout attempt, unfortunately, turned into what appears to be a fakeout. Volume analysis indicates that bearish volume is showing signs of weakening, which could be a positive signal. However, bullish volume has not shown any significant increase, suggesting that the market is currently in a state of consolidation, with neither bulls nor bears having a clear advantage. Given these dynamics, traders need patience. Monitoring for a decisive breakout above resistance with strong bullish volume or a firm hold of support levels could provide clearer trading signals. As always, managing risk and staying informed are crucial in navigating Solana’s current market position. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin That’s Turning Heads There’s “trending,” and then there’s MAGACOIN FINANCE. This isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan meme token trying to ride the social media wave. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a serious project with serious goals, built on audited blockchain infrastructure and laser-focused on solving some of the messier issues plaguing crypto today — things like expensive cross-border payments, sketchy transparency, and inaccessible financial tools. Let’s put it into perspective: MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised $5.3 million, and it’s still in the early stages of its presale. That’s not small-time crypto hype — that’s traction. With over 10,000 investors already on board, it’s growing not just in capital, but in community. And with a listing price locked in at $0.007, anyone getting in at current presale pricing (around $0.0002704) is looking at a projected ROI of 2,500%. Let that sink in. A $1,000 investment at today’s price could turn into $25,800 before MAGACOIN even hits the open market. And what if it pumps to $0.02 or $0.03 like analysts are whispering? We’re talking $74K to $111K from one well-timed move. That’s exactly why it’s trending as one of the Best Altcoins to Buy and Hold for Short Term. Real-Life Use Cases That Actually Matter Do you know what’s getting old? Crypto projects that sound good on paper but completely flop in the real world. MAGACOIN FINANCE is actively avoiding that trap by building something people can actually use. Imagine you’re a freelance designer in LA. You just finished a project for a client in London. Instead of waiting 3-5 business days and losing 3% to PayPal fees, you get paid instantly via MAGACOIN — and you actually keep your full earnings. Or say you’re a small business in Austin selling handmade goods online. With MAGACOIN, you can offer crypto checkout, avoid banking fees, and tap into a whole new market of DeFi-savvy buyers. Whether it’s peer-to-peer payments, merchant integration, or decentralized savings, MAGACOIN isn’t just theory — it’s a tool. And that utility? It’s exactly what makes it one of the Best Altcoins to Buy and Hold for Short Term . MAGACOIN FINANCE: New Presale, Real Momentum, and 2,500% ROI Potential Let’s not sugarcoat it — MAGACOIN FINANCE is making serious waves, and the numbers don’t lie. With $5.3 million already raised and a rapidly growing community of 10,000+ holders, this isn’t some slow burn — this is a full-blown ignition. The current presale offers tokens at just $0.0002704, while the confirmed public listing price is set at $0.007. If you’re doing the math, that’s a 2,500% ROI locked in for those who get in early. Drop in a hypothetical $1,000 investment now, and you’re looking at $25,800 when it lists. But it gets better — if MAGACOIN FINANCE climbs to $0.025–$0.03 (as some analysts whisper), your $1K turns into $90K–$110K. Not bad for a so-called “new kid on the block.” So what’s driving this momentum? It’s a cocktail of smart tokenomics, real-world utility, and a presale model that favors early movers. Unlike many presales that feel like a money grab, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built with a vision — for people, businesses, freelancers, and crypto newcomers alike. Solving Real Problems: Not Just Another Meme Coin Here’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE truly separates from the crypto clutter — it actually solves problems. While coins like DOGE and PEPE made headlines for their memes, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines for its mission: empowering users with scalable, secure, real-world financial solutions. Take cross-border payments, for instance — a nightmare for small businesses and digital workers. Slow, expensive, and riddled with third-party headaches. MAGACOIN FINANCE cuts through all that. Imagine a freelance designer in New York getting paid instantly by a client in Dubai, with zero gas-gouging middlemen. That’s the kind of frictionless, fee-slaying future MAGACOIN is building. And it’s not just good for freelancers. Retailers, startups, and solo entrepreneurs are already eyeing it as a cost-effective, transparent way to transact, even as traditional crypto networks keep struggling with scalability and fees. That’s why it’s gaining traction as one of the Best Altcoins to Buy and Hold for Short Term — it’s not just talk, it’s execution. A Presale Model That Rewards the Early — Without the Gimmicks The MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is structured for smart entry and serious upside. While most projects reward whales or slap early investors with vesting cliffs, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s model keeps things simple and fair. As demand rises, the price ticks up automatically. There’s no “stage 7” or token-count fatigue messaging — it’s being presented as a fresh, exciting presale with real momentum. That means the earlier you get in, the cheaper your tokens and the more you stand to gain. It’s like front-row seats at a concert… but the band hasn’t even started playing yet. With growing daily interest and a presale that feels more like a gold rush than a slow crawl, there’s a very real sense that MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just another presale. It’s the top crypto presale to watch this month — and maybe even this year. Use Cases That Actually Matter Let’s talk use cases — because utility is what separates flash-in-the-pan hype from lasting value. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned to help a wide range of people and businesses. For example: A small business owner in Austin can use MAGACOIN FINANCE for payroll, slashing processing fees and settlement delays. An eCommerce startup in Berlin can accept MAGACOIN FINANCE as a payment method, reducing cart abandonment due to clunky crypto checkouts. A college student investing just $250 could 10x their investment by the time the token hits exchanges, turning their weekend side hustle into a savings cushion. These aren’t dreams — these are the kinds of scenarios MAGACOIN FINANCE is built to support. And that real-world relevance is exactly what makes it one of the Best Altcoins to Buy and Hold for Short Term , especially for anyone not trying to wait five years for their bags to move. Compared to Solana: Who’s Really Winning? Now let’s shift gears — what’s going on with Solana? According to Binance’s latest Square update, Solana recently surged past the $190 level but failed to maintain momentum, dipping back to $172. Analysts believe Solana could rally again if it holds support at $165–$170, but there’s also skepticism over whether it’s just another bull trap — especially with macro pressure keeping altcoin bulls on edge. Solana has also seen some mixed signals in terms of volume, with certain metrics showing strength while others suggest the rally might be fading. And let’s not forget the historic outages and occasional network reliability issues that have plagued SOL in the past. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, doesn’t have that baggage. It’s not weighed down by legacy drama or unstable infrastructure. It’s starting fresh, building lean, and scaling fast — everything a short-term investor wants in a breakout crypto. That’s why many are already switching gears and stacking MAGACOIN FINANCE as the smarter play for short-term returns with long-term potential. Final Thoughts: The Best Altcoins to Buy and Hold for Short Term? The Answer’s Clear If you’re still sitting on the fence, here’s the bottom line: Solana might still be in the game, but it’s playing defense right now. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is powering forward like an offensive powerhouse, blitzing past $5.3 million raised and earning its spot as one of the Best Altcoins to Buy and Hold for the Short Term . It’s got utility, momentum, a fair presale, and a real mission. Plus, that 2,500% ROI upside is hard to ignore. So if you’re asking what coin to move on this month, you’re not just looking for hype — you’re looking for smart entry, strong utility, and massive upside. Don’t miss your window.

This prediction shows the potential for substantial growth in the asset’s market value. BarriC’s prediction is not isolated. It is part of a growing sentiment among crypto analysts that XRP is poised for a breakout. Despite past uncertainty surrounding the coin’s price, BarriC’s prediction suggests a promising trajectory for the digital asset. The asset has gained significant attention recently, especially as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its appeal against Ripple . While BarriC did not provide specific details, his previous predictions show how the digital asset could hit this target range. Comparisons to Bitcoin’s Historical Performance The analyst recently drew parallels between the skepticism surrounding high price targets for XRP and past doubts about Bitcoin’s ability to reach significant valuations. Reflecting on his own experience, he noted that in 2016, few anticipated Bitcoin’s ascent to $100,000, suggesting a similar trajectory could be possible for XRP. BarriC’s insights highlight the potential for XRP to replicate Bitcoin’s past performance. He emphasized that just as Bitcoin’s value surged from $330 to $100,000, XRP could experience comparable growth . This perspective challenges the current skepticism about XRP reaching higher valuations and suggests that XRP’s value could rise beyond current expectations like Bitcoin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Catalysts for Growth Several factors could contribute to the anticipated rise in XRP’s value. Analysts have identified key drivers that may push the digital asset’s price past $10, including the potential approval of an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Data from PolyMarket suggests an 83% chance of ETF approval in 2025, which could significantly boost institutional investment and demand. Other analysts share a bullish outlook on XRP’s future. Brandon Hong, for instance, has identified a highly bullish setup , indicating a potential massive breakout. He highlighted the token’s extraordinary chart structure and underlying strength, describing it as the most bullish altcoin chart in the crypto market and suggesting that the asset is on the verge of a significant breakout. Can XRP Climb to $10? XRP is currently trading at $2.14, and a rise to $20 represents an 834.58% increase. In late 2024, BarriC predicted that XRP would dominate 2025 , and the asset kicked off the year with a massive surge to a multi-year high of $.3.39. Market participants will be watching closely to see if all the bullish factors surrounding the digital asset can push it to $20 in the coming months.

The ongoing consolidation around $80,000 to $85,000 is part of a classic technical setup that can cause strong directional moves in the market. Notably, this triangle pattern was shared in an analysis on social media platform X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, where he advised traders to keep a close eye on Bitcoin’s next breakout move. Related Reading: Solana Slammed By Whale Dump—Can It Recover Or Is More Pain Ahead? The current pattern hints at a possible 15% swing in either direction, and with Bitcoin now hovering around $83,000, the stakes are high. Triangle Pattern Forms As Bitcoin Compresses Between Lower Highs, Higher Lows Martinez’s highlight of a triangle formation examines Bitcoin’s price action since March 7, when it briefly crashed from $91,000 until it broke below $80,000. The ensuing recovery above $80,000 eventually led to the Bitcoin price creating a lower high at $87,000 before correcting again. Since then, Bitcoin’s price action has been highlighted by the formation of lower highs, higher lows, and an increasingly tightening range, all of which are classic parts of a triangle pattern formation. Bitcoin is currently trading right in the heart of this tightening range. The 4-hour timeframe chart shows the upper trendline of the triangle, which caps the price at nearly $86,000, while the lower trendline provides support at around $82,000. These levels have effectively boxed in Bitcoin’s price over the past few weeks, and any clean breakout beyond these boundaries could define the cryptocurrency’s direction in the near term. Image From X: @ali_charts Analyst Predicts 15% Move, Warns Traders To Watch Closely Martinez’s analysis points to a significant price shift once Bitcoin breaks out of the triangle. “#Bitcoin $BTC is consolidating within a triangle pattern, setting the stage for a potential 15% move. Watch closely for a breakout!” he wrote on X. The warning carries weight, especially for short-term traders and those managing leveraged positions. If Bitcoin breaks above the $86,000 resistance line, it could spark a rally toward $90,000 or higher and usher in a renewed wave of bullish momentum. On the other side, a break below the $82,000 support could lead to a quick drop toward the $70,000 level, a scenario that would deal a harsh blow to bullish market sentiment and delay the hopes for predictions of new all-time highs.

Most investors are positioning for a bullish outcome and a return above $100,000, but analysis of buy zones shows that Bitcoin must break past $85,470 and $92,950 convincingly before this can happen.

But a new wave of Bitcoin investors is turning toward MAGACOINFINANCE, drawn by its early-stage entry, strong momentum, and a clean structure that favors transparency and accessibility. While solid projects like ADA, ETH, AVAX, and BCH continue developing at their own pace, MAGACOINFINANCE has stepped into the spotlight with urgency. CLICK HERE TO JOIN THE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT MAGACOINFINANCE – Built for Bold Targets MAGACOINFINANCE has crossed over $5.3 million raised, entering the final phase of its offering with serious momentum. From its early days, the project set out to offer something different: a token with a fair launch, a fully public allocation, and a firm 100 billion token supply. There are no insider deals, no exclusive rounds, and no hidden allocations—just a straightforward opportunity for anyone to participate equally. That clarity has earned the project strong support, especially from investors who missed out on early runs in previous cycles. What’s driving the excitement now is the growing awareness that the window is closing.

Acting Chair Mark T. Uyeda has asked agency staff to review several older staff statements concerning crypto investments. He aims to look into how securities laws apply to digital assets. This decision is part of Executive Order 14192 , Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation. It also follows recommendations from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The goal is to determine whether these statements should be updated or removed to reflect the SEC’s current priorities better. Revisiting the Howey Test and Digital Assets Uyeda wants the SEC to rethink its approach to digital assets. Some statements under review were written years ago before digital assets became a major part of the financial world. One key document from 2019 explained how to tell if a digital asset is a security using the Howey Test. This test checks if an investment depends on others to make a profit. That rule has caused a lot of debate over the years, especially as new types of tokens and memecoins have entered the scene. Recently, the SEC even said memecoins might not be covered by securities laws. Bitcoin Futures and Mutual Fund Warnings Under Review Uyeda also pointed to a 2021 staff statement that warned investors about mutual funds holding Bitcoin futures. The SEC said these funds were risky because Bitcoin’s price could swing wildly. Also, the markets might be too small or unstable. However, things have changed. Spot Ethereum and Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are popular and hold billions in assets. Uyeda now wants the agency to revisit whether these old concerns still apply. After major crypto bankruptcies in 2022, the SEC told companies to warn investors about any links to crypto markets. That included risks like losing access to funds, bad press, and tighter rules. Uyeda said it is time to review these statements again to see if they are still helpful or too outdated. In addition, the regulatory agency will review a 2021 Risk Alert about the special risks of trading digital assets. A 2020 statement from the Division of Investment Management on a Wyoming rule that lets trust companies hold digital assets. It will also look at the two statements related to COVID-19 issued during the pandemic. SEC Faces a Wave of Staff Resignations This internal review comes at a time when the SEC is facing many staff departures. According to a recent Reuters report , more than 600 workers, over 12% of the total staff, have accepted voluntary buyout offers and agreed to leave the agency. Meanwhile, the SEC has not made an official statement regarding these exits. Nevertheless, the timing adds pressure to Uyeda’s efforts to review and possibly reshape the agency’s approach to digital assets.

Trump Slaps 10% Tariffs on All Countries As CryptoPotato reported on April 2nd, Donald Trump’s tariffs were imposed on literally all countries at a rate of 10%, with some of them facing even higher rates. China faces 34%, Vietnam – 46%, Japan – 24%, while the European Union was hit with 20% tariffs. Describing these as “reciprocal,” Trump has stated that the new taxes are needed to wipe out an existing deficit between the US and the rest of the world. What is more, imports will also be facing both the universal tariff of 10%, including the specific reciprocal import levies targeting each individual nation. International response was just as quick, with China announcing import taxes of 34% themselves, while also curbing exports of critical minerals and blacklisting American companies, while altogether saying that the actions of the US President are a form of “bullying,” as well as a violation of international trade rules. Tension between the US and other countries is also escalating, although many of them have chosen not to retaliate in hopes of negotiating better deals. Maroš Šefčovič, the trade commissioner for the European Union confirmed a “frank” exchange with US representatives, saying : “The EU is committed to meaningful negotiations, but also prepared to defend our interests. We stay in touch.” Global Markets Plunge, Tech Giants Take a Beating The stock market’s reaction came immediately, as major indices took a beating on April 2nd, which worsened as the week went by. Ultimately, on Thursday and Friday alone, the stock markets saw over $5 trillion in market cap erased, closing the worst week since the COVID crash. The S&P 500, for instance, lost over 6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdq 100 “ended in a bear market,” as reported by the Business Insider. S&P 500 Heatmap.

Bitcoin Hangs on, Defies Expectations For most parts during the past few months, turmoil across traditional stock markets also reflected in Bitcoin’s price, which was moving more or less hand in hand. This seems to have changed, at least for the past seven days. Amid the massive drawdown, Bitcoin has remained steady, charting a mild decrease of 0.3% for the past seven days, according to data from CoinGecko. Source: CoinGecko As CryptoPotato reported earlier, many industry experts noted the detachment of the BTC price from traditional assets, with some of them even stating that it might be on the verge of noting gains in the coming weeks. “BTC positive divergence from gold and risk in past 24 hours is striking.

With new projects emerging daily, some stand out by offering innovation, strong communities, and massive earning potential. Among the hottest trends, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC ) is capturing investor attention, while Pudgy Penguins continues to gain traction in the NFT space, and Floki Inu remains a powerhouse in meme coin rankings. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Magic: Weekly Token Burns Scarcity fuels value, and Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is capitalizing on this by implementing a unique token burn mechanism. Unsold tokens are permanently eliminated weekly throughout the presale, ensuring a continually shrinking supply. Even after the presale, leftover tokens will be burned, fostering a deflationary ecosystem that enhances investor value and long-term sustainability. To ensure transparency, all burn transactions are recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), allowing investors to verify each burn in real time. This aggressive deflation strategy positions Arctic Pablo Coin as one of the most compelling cheap cryptos that will explode . The Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Prices Are Rising Fast! Stage 17 of Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale, Glacial Glade, is anything but cold. Priced at $0.000087, the token has already pulled in over $2 million—and the projected ROI of 9,084.48% is making waves. APC isn’t just hype—it’s solidifying its spot among the top new meme coins for exponential returns. The project has already attracted significant interest, and those who secure their holdings now stand to benefit before the next phase triggers another price increase. As one of the hottest meme coin presales , this is a golden opportunity to join before it’s too late. Pudgy Penguins: The NFT Collection With Expanding Utility Pudgy Penguins has evolved beyond a viral NFT collection into a full-fledged brand with widespread recognition. The project has secured strategic partnerships, expanded into the toy industry, and continues to deliver strong community engagement. With its focus on building a real-world ecosystem, Pudgy Penguins is proving that NFT-based projects can achieve long-term success. Its dedicated fanbase and increasing utility make it a project worth keeping an eye on, especially as the broader NFT market continues to evolve. Floki Inu: The Meme Coin With Real-World Adoption Floki Inu has transitioned from being just another meme coin to a serious contender in the crypto space. With strategic partnerships, aggressive marketing campaigns, and a growing ecosystem, Floki Inu is carving out its place in decentralized finance (DeFi) and beyond. From NFT gaming to DeFi staking opportunities, Floki Inu continues to expand its use cases. As more investors and institutions take notice, this meme coin could have a significant impact on the market. Final Thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge With Arctic Pablo Coin’s aggressive token burn strategy, Pudgy Penguins’ expanding brand, and Floki Inu’s real-world adoption, all three projects present exciting opportunities. However, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out due to its rapidly depleting supply and presale frenzy, making it one of the best meme coin presales to watch. As demand surges and token burns reduce supply, Arctic Pablo Coin is positioning itself for explosive growth. Investors looking for cheap cryptos that will explode should act fast before the presale reaches the next phase.

But in recent months, its short-term trend is leaning bearish. Let’s look closer at our Dogecoin ( DOGE ) price prediction for April and whether it will rally. Table of Contents What is DOGE? ‘Dogefather’ does little to bolster outlook Dogecoin price prediction Should you invest in Dogecoin? What is DOGE? What started as a meme in 2013, featuring the adorable Shiba Inu dog, has since become a huge part of the crypto world. Dogecoin built a strong community over time and even piqued the interest of people like Elon Musk. Built on a Litecoin fork, it uses the Scrypt algorithm for mining and is known for its fast transactions. Additionally, the total number of coins that can be mined is unlimited. Dogecoin’s price took a hit on March 31. By April 6, DOGE was trading at $0.16, down 3.1% for the day. Source: CoinGecko What’s going to shape the Dogecoin price prediction for April 2025? Is Dogecoin a good investment? ‘Dogefather’ does little to bolster outlook Earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that the US government had no plans for DOGE. Musk had previously sparked hopes by naming his department the Department of Government Efficiency, or D.O.G.E. This led to speculation that Dogecoin could be part of the department’s plans. Despite his strong support for Dogecoin, which has led to legal issues over his price-moving statements, Musk clarified that DOGE has no role in the federal government’s strategy. Musk, who dubbed himself the “Dogefather,” is seemingly distancing himself from Dogecoin, raising questions about the memecoin’s future. That said, Dogecoin is still the top meme coin. If demand remains strong across exchanges, it could continue to stay relevant. Furthermore, the positive news surrounding a Dogecoin ETF filing could further support its growth. Dogecoin price prediction The drop in Dogecoin’s price occurred as investors stressed over President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The initiative tanked the market and caused economists and investment banks to raise recession odds. These concerns rippled through the crypto markets. So far, the Federal Reserve has not indicated that it will cut interest rates or introduce measures like quantitative easing to stabilize the economy. Given these factors, what does the Dogecoin price prediction for April look like according to analytical sites? CoinCodex’s Dogecoin coin price prediction suggests a rally this month, with the potential to climb 230% and hit $0.57 by April 27. The Dogecoin price prediction for April 3 leans bearish, as 27 indicators signal a decline, while just 3 suggest a possible rebound. According to DigitalCoinPrice’s Dogecoin price forecast, DOGE might increase by almost 118% by the end of April and reach a price of $0.36. Meanwhile, Wallet Investor’s DOGE projections are more conservative, suggesting that the meme coin could reach a maximum price of $0.17 by mid-April. Should you invest in Dogecoin? It depends on your risk tolerance and investment goals. DOGE remains the top meme coin with a strong community, and potential catalysts like a Dogecoin ETF could support its growth. However, recent price trends have been bearish, and uncertainty around macroeconomic factors — such as US tariffs and recession fears — could impact its performance. Price expectations for April 2025 vary widely, with some analytical sites expecting a significant surge while others see limited upside. Like any investment, crypto carries risks — be sure to research and assess them carefully before investing.

Solana at $126.46 is a prediction where it will move to $300 soon enough despite 50 percent fall down from its $294.33 peak. Cardano’s nevertheless recent 40% monthly plunge to $0.62 has failed to deter Alex Becker from predicting an 800% rise to $5, based on institutional adoption and upgrades to the ecosystem. However, amid these speculations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) moves towards its fourth presale phase quietly at $0.025. Over $6.3 million has already raised and 7,900 holders. Now, investors and analysts ask if this DeFi token can follow the same growth trajectories as its more well-known peers. Solana’s Path to Recovery “Solana’s current valuation is shaped by the market’s careful weighing of its scalability against the network’s lingering challenges.” Once touted as an “Ethereum Killer” because of its high-speed transactions, SOL now sits 57% lower than its all-time high. Analysts have not been put off and predict a rise to $400 in 2025 as developer activity and DeFi integrations ramp up. By 2030, they range as high as $1,351, relying on institutional inflows and technological refinements. Despite the solid potential for Solana, the challenge of congestion and regulatory pushback presents some room for an alternate solution, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to steal the limelight. Cardano’s Bid for Relevance At $0.62, Cardano’s price belies a growing optimism driven by partnerships and U.S. institutional interest. Becker’s $5 target relies on ADA crossing its $3.09 level — a 40% gap from its all time high — right before pursuing higher highs. The network’s disciplined upgrade cadence and academic credentials make it a candidate for the long game, but the 800% growth it thinks it’ll need highlights the speculative nature of such predictions. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) promises real, near-term gains with its presale structure without the multi-year timescale of other large-cap assets. The Strategic Momentum of Mutuum Finance Built on this new DeFi chain, Mutuum Finance rapidly moves through phase four of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.025 before a 20% increase to $0.03 in phase five. Such early participants would see 140% returns at launch where MUTM will list at $0.06—that number is hardcoded into its tokenomics. Post-launch targets indicate a rise to $3.50, which would provide current buyers with a 13,900% ROI, though larger presale profits dwarf this. This prediction is based on the buy-and-distribute business model of the MUTM because its the revenue from the platform contribute to this cycle for buybacks and sustained demand Audit and Ecosystem Assurance As a milestone aimed at increasing investor confidence, Mutuum Finance places a premium on transparency and is currently concluding a smart contract audit with CertiK. Results will be broadcast across official channels once complete, further emphasizing the project’s commitment to security. MUTM’s usage-driven model parts approximately ways with speculative counterparts, in its extremely over-collateralized lending protocols and mtTokens, interest-bearing deposit certificates. With Solana and Cardano going through very uncertain recoveries, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a considered entry into DeFi’s lending sector with provable upside. As phase four is selling fast and price increases are soon to come, the opportunity to buy the tokens for $0.025 a piece is reduced with each day that goes by. With the turbulence of the market and the prospect of exponential gains, investors seeking staggering returns cannot overlook the structured growth of MUTM and the potential 13,900% gain. You Do It Before Phase Five Comes In Mutuum Finance’s presale pricing opportunity continues to dwindle for investors. It’s phase four, with $0.025 tokens representing a last opportunity to get ahead of a 20% price hike and an imminent exchange listing. Head over to Mutuum Finance official site to join before another wave.

According to the complaint , OKX, operated by Aux Cayes Fintech Co. Ltd., has been offering digital asset exchange services to Thai users unlawfully. The SEC said the platform collected transaction fees and promoted its services without regulatory approval, actions that fall under criminal penalties. Thailand’s Economic Crime Division to Investigate OKX Case The case will be investigated by the Economic Crime Suppression Division. Alongside the exchange, nine individuals have also been accused of promoting OKX’s unlicensed platform on social media, as noted by financial consultancy Kapronasia. Thai authorities have also flagged OKX for failing to implement adequate know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures. The lapse could have potentially exposed Thai investors to financial risks and undermined regulatory oversight. If convicted, OKX and the individuals involved could face two to five years in prison, fines between 200,000 and 500,000 baht (approximately $5,890–$14,630), and a daily fine of 10,000 baht ($293) until compliance is met, according to Thanh Nien .

OKX reportedly served Thai users since 2021 via its website and… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 29, 2025 The enforcement move is part of a broader effort by Thailand’s SEC to tighten control over digital asset platforms. In previous years, the regulator has taken similar actions against other major exchanges, including Binance and Bybit. OKX has also faced scrutiny globally, having reached a $504 million settlement with U.S. authorities for unlicensed operations. Recently, OKX enlisted former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as a legal advisor amid its $505 million federal settlement with U.S. authorities. Cuomo, a licensed New York attorney, reportedly began advising OKX following his resignation from the governorship in August 2021. Prior to that, the exchange also appointed Linda Lacewell as its new Chief Legal Officer, the company announced. Lacewell, who previously served as the Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), will oversee the company’s global regulatory and compliance strategy. OKX Suspends DeFi Services Amid Media Scrutiny and EU Regulatory Pressure Last month, OKX temporarily suspended its decentralized finance (DeFi) services , citing intensified media scrutiny and a coordinated attack allegedly involving the North Korean Lazarus Group. The company stated that while it typically remains focused on innovation, it could not ignore the timing of these accusations, especially as it steps up efforts to combat financial crime. The move came after increasing competitive pressure and regulatory attention, particularly from the European Union. OKX’s decision comes as EU regulators investigate the platform over claims of laundering $100 million from the February 2025 Bybit hack. The probe threatens the exchange’s MiCA license, which is essential for operating in Europe under the new crypto regulatory framework.

33767162,[object Object],1743955246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,US Macro Setup To Favor New Bitcoin ATH In The Long Run: Analyst,https://bitcoinist.com/us-macro-to-favour-new-bitcoin-ath-in-the-long-run/,"In the last two months, Bitcoin price has plunged by over 23% in a prolonged market correction. Significant portions of this decline have been attributed to a series of new US tariffs announced in February, March, and most recently April. Despite the short-term bearish effects of this macroeconomic development on the crypto market, popular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher theorizes that BTC could substantially benefit from the long-term effects of these policy decisions. Short-Term Chaos, Long-Term Clarity: Bitcoin Tipped For New ATH In a recent X post , Deutscher states that Bitcoin is on course for a new all-time high despite current market uncertainty. The analyst explains that while recent trade and economic policy changes by the administration of US President Donald Trump may be exerting a negative market effect, the ensuing sequence of events from these decisions can prove bullish. Firstly, Deutscher states that recent economic decisions by the US government show intentions to induce short-term pain that could weaken the dollar and interest rates which should be beneficial for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. However, the new import tariffs are likely going to discourage the purchase of US Treasury Bills forcing a reliance on domestic buyers which triggers liquidity tightening. As Bitcoin is sensitive to liquidity, the contraction of global liquidity will cause further price falls as investors move their funds to safer assets. Eventually, the crypto market is expected to bottom out pricing in recession fears. By the time an official recession is announced, the market could be stable and anticipate an economic response by the Federal Reserve. At this junction, the US Apex Bank is likely to announce a rate cut clearing the way for quantitative easing (QE). However, while this QE may not occur until 2026, Bitcoin will experience a dollar liquidity boost from other economic tools including repurchase agreements, Bank Term Funding Program, and Treasury bill purchases. Following this development, Bitcoin is expected to embark on an upward trajectory. The “top quality” altcoins will potentially follow the market leader while other tokens with little to no utility shrink. Once Bitcoin nears or hits a peak price, the altseason will kick in. Deutscher explains it is currently difficult to predict the crypto market and US policies in the short term i.e. 1-12 weeks. However, his forecast is likely to roll out in the coming months placing Bitcoin in a strong position for a new all-time high between Q3 2025 and Q1 2026. BTC Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $83,313 following a 0.90% gain in the past week. However, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 68.68% and is valued at $14.25 billion.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin new all-time high|btcusd|BTCUSDT|liquidity tightening|US government tariffs,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-06 16:00:46

Notably, at a time when all the major indices recorded massive capital outflows, Bitcoin showed resilience, a move mirrored across the broader cryptocurrency market . As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $82,427, down just 0.49% over the past seven days. In the past 24 hours, the flagship digital currency has slipped a modest 0.5%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold In contrast, weekly index performance paints a bleak picture: the S&P 500 is down 8.21%, the Dow Jones has dropped 7.4%, and the Nasdaq fell 8.4%. The cryptocurrency titan showed surprising stability throughout the week, briefly surging to nearly $88,000 on April 2 before cooling off. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin has remained largely range-bound and resilient, showing signs of decoupling from broader market turmoil. Wall Street analysts have warned that Trump’s tariffs could reignite inflationary pressures, further impacting the stock market. Why Bitcoin defied tariffs sell-offs Several factors may explain Bitcoin’s short-term resilience. Trump’s tariffs, aimed at reducing the trade deficit, have raised concerns about retaliatory measures from major trading partners, potentially weakening the dollar’s dominance and boosting demand for Bitcoin as a digital gold alternative. Notably, gold surged to record highs above $3,000 , indicating an ongoing flight to non-fiat stores of value. Still, Bitcoin’s resilience isn’t guaranteed based on how the asset performed during the week. The maiden digital currency dropped from a high of $88,000 to $81,200 earlier in the week, reflecting some risk-off sentiment. But its swift rebound signals a shift in investor behavior. Experts note that while tariffs may drive inflation, the crypto market has remained relatively stable, likely due to Bitcoin’s weaker correlation with tariff-sensitive sectors like manufacturing and tech. The unveiling of concrete policy details on “Liberation Day” may have also reduced uncertainty. Some institutional investors, such as Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ), saw the pullback as a buying opportunity. What next for Bitcoin While uncertainty lingers in the equities market, Bitcoin seems to be banking on continued price appreciation. That possibility is evidenced by on-chain data shared by cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez on April 6, who noted that over 91,900 BTC have been withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges in the past month.

Analysis Company Publishes Technical Analysis,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-chainlink-link-getting-bullish-or-will-the-bear-dominate-analysis-company-publishes-technical-analysis/,"Cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision has released its new technical assessment for the Chainlink (LINK) price. The report argues that LINK is still in a downtrend and is retesting a critical support area. It is stated that the reaction to this level may play a key role in determining the direction of the price. The red trend line used in the technical analysis of the analytics company continues to work as a dynamic resistance and there is no signal of a structure change so far. LINK price is at the intersection of the horizontal support in the range of $ 12.60–12.90 and the green ascending trend line. Related News: “The Signal Has Come, There's Huge Volatility Ahead,” Analytics Firm Says, Predicting What Could Happen to Bitcoin and Altcoins However, according to the analyst firm, the $12.60-$12.90 range is a strong support area that has been tested many times before. Breaking this level could lead to a continuation of the downtrend. However, if the support holds, a short-term recovery and a higher low are possible. If the support is broken, the next strong support area stands out as the $10.80-$11.00 band. On the resistance side, according to MakroVision, the $16.60–$17.20 range is considered the critical resistance area for a possible trend reversal. If this area is exceeded, a medium-term bullish momentum could be triggered. Technical analysis chart shared by the analytics company. *This is not investment advice.

42996030,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-bitcoin-outperforms-nasdaq-during-market-crash,1743955655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/42996030.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now As Bitcoin Outperforms NASDAQ During Market Crash,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-bitcoin-outperforms-nasdaq-during-market-crash,"U.S. markets took a $5.4 trillion hit in two days after President Trump’s reciprocal tariff announcement, sending the S&P 500 to its lowest level in nearly a year and pushing the Nasdaq 100 into bear market territory. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, while not untouched, fell far less sharply— BTC dropped 6%, while the Nasdaq plunged 11% . With analysts now framing Bitcoin as a potential hedge amid TradFi chaos, investor attention is shifting fast. As equities stumble, crypto’s relative stability could open the door for a new wave of inflows—especially into early-stage tokens with real use cases and momentum. Does BTC’s Resilience Indicate Bull Run Continuation? Bitcoin’s recent price action has kept traders on edge. Despite a bullish start to the year, BTC has been bleeding for weeks, prompting fresh speculation that the cycle top may have already passed. However, while price action has been shaky, sentiment from institutions tells a different story. Wallet inflows remain consistent, ETFs continue to see net inflows, and major players are still quietly accumulating. This disconnect—between price weakness and institutional behavior—creates a strange but critical dynamic. And now, with U.S. equities erasing over $5 trillion in just two days, Bitcoin’s relative resilience is drawing new attention. A 6% dip compared to the Nasdaq’s 11% collapse, especially in a macro panic, isn’t just coincidence. It’s evidence of crypto’s shifting role. Whether by design or evolution, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge—something that was once reserved for gold and bonds. The broader implication is this: if BTC holds steady—or even bounces—as equities continue to struggle, capital rotation into digital assets may accelerate. And when that happens, altcoins with strong narratives, real use cases, or ecosystem traction tend to move next. From projects tackling creator monetization to L2 scalability or wallet infrastructure, those tokens may emerge as the first runners once confidence returns and capital seeks growth again. Best Crypto to Buy Now SUBBD While hundreds of new crypto projects launch every month, very few manage to align with real-world demand like SUBBD does. The creator economy isn’t just trending—it’s thriving. Influencers, streamers, educators, and independent artists are building careers by connecting directly with fans. And SUBBD steps in with a simple yet powerful goal: make those connections better, smarter, and more rewarding through crypto and AI. Think of it this way—imagine your favorite content creator had a space where you could interact without algorithmic noise, get exclusive content, and even hold a small stake in their growth. That’s the kind of interaction SUBBD is making possible. It’s not about replacing existing platforms—it’s about giving creators more control and fans more value. All powered by blockchain infrastructure and enhanced through an AI layer that customizes fan engagement and helps creators grow their brand. Spotted: a shiny new token making its debut - and no, it’s not just another coin with a cute name. $SUBBD presale is now officially live. ✨And between us? Early buyers don’t just get perks… they get power.You know where to find it.🔗 https://t.co/8yAMjVQD5E pic.twitter.com/g33ipi9kp2 — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) April 3, 2025 The $SUBBD token serves multiple functions—from access to premium content, tipping, and fan-based rewards to creator-level analytics and tokenized voting. And while the concept is broad, its execution is surprisingly lean. This isn’t a full-scale blockchain—it’s a streamlined, AI-driven solution targeting a growing audience. With its presale still open and moving fast (priced at just $0.055), SUBBD could easily close out soon. As more creators and their communities migrate to smarter tools, this token could ride the wave in a big way. BTC Bull When a project ties itself directly to the most talked-about asset in crypto—Bitcoin—it better bring more than just branding. BTC Bull does exactly that. This isn’t a meme coin dressed in Bitcoin lingo. It’s a gamified concept where users engage with BTC’s price action through milestone-based rewards, token burns, and staking mechanics. Now, consider this: Bitcoin has held up better than traditional equities during the latest downturn, and institutional sentiment is still leaning bullish. That makes BTC Bull’s model even more interesting. It’s essentially a reflection of Bitcoin’s momentum—except with leveraged community interaction built into it. If BTC touches new highs again, BTC Bull is engineered to respond with token burns and presale stage progressions that drive up scarcity. The staking mechanism rewards holders who believe in both Bitcoin’s long-term price and BTC Bull’s structural design. Plus, its roadmap includes multiple ways to engage: social contests, prediction-based mini-games, and DAO features later down the line. Analysts and creators—most notably the 99Bitcoins channel —have already highlighted BTC Bull as a strong early-stage pick. With the presale still active and the sentiment surrounding Bitcoin staying relatively bullish, BTC Bull might offer one of the most reactive value-growth models in the current cycle. MIND of Pepe AI tokens might have cooled slightly on the charts, but the underlying demand for AI-based utility in crypto is far from gone. The funding plateau in large-scale AI firms and their stock prices is more about venture cycles than the tech itself. That’s why MIND of Pepe —a tokenized AI agent wrapped in meme culture—is gaining serious traction. Rather than building a generic AI chatbot or marketplace, MIND of Pepe has gone with something more clever: a digital AI personality that interacts with social media trends, engages users in real-time, and builds sentiment reports for investors. It doesn’t just ""exist""—it lives in the online conversation, reading engagement and helping its community make sense of it all. Think of it like having an AI-driven content analyst that follows meme coin trends, identifies hype patterns, and provides sentiment insights—while being fully wrapped in a meme identity that keeps it entertaining and relatable. With creators like ClayBro and others already supporting it, MIND of Pepe is turning heads. The project isn’t just a commentary on meme culture—it’s actively plugged into it. As interest in trend-based investment grows, especially among crypto-native traders, a token like MIND of Pepe that lives where the trends are born could be perfectly placed. The project is still relatively early, and with its user base expanding and the AI use case becoming more targeted, it’s one that deserves a close watch. Solaxy When two of the most used blockchains—Ethereum and Solana—operate in silos, the friction is felt across DeFi, NFTs, and even simple token transfers. Solaxy builds on that problem, but not with just another bridge—it’s a full-fledged Layer 2 with meme branding that aims to seamlessly facilitate movement and smart contract execution across both chains. The reason Solaxy’s chances of a major short-term pump feel strong is because it’s hitting a trifecta: meme attention, L2-level utility, and cross-chain relevance. That’s rare. And considering the fact that influencers have been actively covering the project and the community numbers are spiking across Telegram and X—it’s clear that the project is building more than hype. Trust is growing, and so is capital. The presale has already brought in over $29 million, and insider chatter suggests that a number of larger buyers and crypto funds are preparing to enter before it closes. Solaxy is already being framed as one of this quarter’s top launches, and its roadmap includes exchange listings shortly after the presale ends. Curiosity isn't always a good thing...But $SOLX gets it right.Speed ✅Security ✅Innovation ✅ https://t.co/mdaTX9aVVx pic.twitter.com/DGmKQL3vud — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) April 6, 2025 As the market recovers and transactional demand across chains picks up again, Solaxy could be in prime position to benefit—not just because it solves a problem, but because it does so in a way that keeps retail and institutional eyes equally interested. Conclusion Bitcoin staying steady while equities slip has opened up space for smart investors to start looking elsewhere—and these four projects each offer something timely. SUBBD fits right into the growing demand for creator-focused platforms that actually pay, not just promise. BTC Bull is built to reflect Bitcoin’s momentum and rewards those aligned with its trajectory. MIND of Pepe offers an active, usable AI tool that follows trends where they start—online—and gives crypto traders something they can actually apply. And Solaxy tackles a real friction point by linking Ethereum and Solana in a way that’s already drawing attention from bigger names. As crypto starts moving ahead of traditional markets again, these are the kinds of projects that make sense to watch now.

In an announcement on X, formerly Twitter, Coinbase derivatives disclosed that it had filed to self-certify XRP-based futures. If approved, the request, directed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), would provide a safer regulatory environment in the long term. Additionally, approval is expected to introduce a capital-efficient way to bring about exposure. It bears mentioning that XRP’s liquidity levels position it as an appealing crypto asset for the exchange and its clients. Due to its high liquidity, the exchange’s derivative arm considers XRP one of the most promising assets. As the announcement reads; “We’re excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify $XRP futures – bringing a regulated, capital-efficient way to gain exposure to one of the most liquid digital assets.” Liquidity is especially attractive to cryptocurrency market players. It allows for the swift sale and purchase of crypto assets without a massive change in price value. A highly liquid market is also paramount in attracting investors, as key players are less likely to execute trades. Although the CFTC’s approval will be a key determinant in influencing the company’s moves, Coinbase is optimistic about the future. As noted in the announcement, the contract is expected to go live on April 21, 2025. Coinbase has been committed to expanding its futures offerings in the past year, and the XRP futures filing is one of many. The firm previously filed for a Natural Gas (NSG) and Cardano (ADA) futures contract and is currently awaiting approval from the CFTC. The new development also comes not long after Coinbase launched two futures.

On the 4-hour chart, bearish sentiment dominates, with multiple technical signals aligning to suggest a potential continuation lower unless buyers intervene soon. Price Overview At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.6242, reflecting a 2.75% decline. The price has been in a persistent downtrend, struggling to reclaim key levels after a sharp rejection from the $1.20 zone. Key Support and Resistance Support: $0.60 – $0.62 This zone is pivotal. A breakdown could open the door to a deeper move toward $0.55. Resistance: $0.70 – $0.75 Bulls need to reclaim this area to shift short-term sentiment and target the next resistance at $0.80. Trend Analysis The trend remains decisively bearish, with consistent lower highs and failed breakout attempts. Volume has also been declining, reflecting weakening bullish conviction and sustained control by sellers. Indicator Insights MACD (12, 26, close): The MACD remains below the signal line and in negative territory, indicating continued downside momentum. No bullish crossover is present, signaling a lack of immediate reversal strength. RSI (Relative Strength Index): Estimated between 30–40, the RSI shows bearish momentum but hasn’t yet entered oversold territory. This leaves room for further downside before a technical bounce is likely. Bollinger Bands: Though not shown, Bollinger Bands likely show price hugging the lower band, suggesting persistent pressure with a possible volatility expansion if support fails. Technical Patterns Descending Triangle: A bearish pattern with flat support around $0.62 and descending resistance. A breakdown would likely trigger a sharp drop toward $0.55. Bear Flag: A weak consolidation after the steep fall from $1.20 resembles a bear flag, often a precursor to further decline. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Double Top Formation: The $0.90–$0.95 rejection formed a clear double top in March — a reversal pattern that played out into the current downtrend. Rounded Top: The overall price arc from February to April shows a rounded top, signaling exhaustion of bullish momentum and long-term weakness. Next Move: What to Expect ADA is teetering at a critical point. A break below $0.62 could accelerate the sell-off to $0.55, while a push above $0.70 may ignite a short-lived relief rally toward $0.75–$0.80. However, momentum and structure currently favor the bears. Cardano (ADA) is caught in a bearish grip , with multiple indicators and patterns pointing to potential downside continuation. Unless buyers step in at key support with strong volume, further losses remain likely. Traders should monitor for a confirmed breakout or breakdown to guide their next move.

Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) regulates exchanges. The FIAU concluded that there were many financial violations with OKX, forming a systematic pattern that could not be ignored. The FIAU claimed that OKX’s risk assessment process did not account for the possible money laundering risks associated with their products. FIAU argued that there was insufficient assessment when new clients were being acquired, finding that only half were screened. The FIAU further raised concerns about external reporting and the lack of record-keeping. These were issues that occupied FIAU the most, focusing on anything that may allow or facilitate money laundering. Before the FIAU assessment in March, Bybit accused OKX of having technology that enabled hackers to launder stolen money easily. In February, Bybit suffered a $1.5 billion breach by hackers who used various exchanges to hide their actions. Ben Zhou, Bybit CEO, accused OKX of enabling the hackers, through web3 proxies, to move 40,233 ETH, worth around $100 million, to more anonymous wallets. He also claimed that European Union regulators were investigating the incident. OKX hit back at the claims, saying that Zhou was spreading misinformation and that there was no such investigation. In February, U.S. regulators fined OKX for not implementing proper procedures for registering money transfers, fining the parent company $500 million. The incident could be confirmation that OKX is facing scrutiny from a range of regulatory committees, or it could just mean that OKX got caught up in the crosshairs of the previous administration’s ‘war on crypto. ’ In March, Thailand brought a criminal complaint against OKX for operating an exchange without registering their actions with the appropriate authorities. OKX, meanwhile, has been trying to grow its business in Europe. In January, it became one of the first crypto exchanges to obtain a license from the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA). OKX obtained its license while operating in Malta, the exchange’s main department for European operations. Since then, it has obtained its MiCA II license, further expanding its business model. The license is essential for the business to expand throughout Europe. The MiCA license allows European customers to deposit or withdraw Euros without a fee. The service is integrated with local businesses, such as those using credit cards, banking services, and local transfers. As a result of such integrations, OKX has become more versatile for European customers, with extended options to view a local currency alongside other European currencies. There is also a team of multilingual help desk workers. OKX, earlier this year, was penalized €304,000 by Malta’s Financial Services Authority for its lack of compliance. The fine required that OKX seek outside help auditing their business structures, specifically focusing on improving their legal standing. OKX responded to these requirements by employing Linda Lacewell as its chief legal officer. Lacewell worked in the New York Department of Financial Services and advised OKX during their legal battles. OKX, by employing Lacewell, shows a positive regard for legal structures and is making an effort to increase the accountability of the exchange. When working for the New York Department of Financial Services, Lacewell modernised the state’s cryptocurrency framework. She also has an interest in cybersecurity and financial crime. Lacewell plans to combine regulation and innovation without compromising the business standards. She aims to improve OKX’s regulatory standards so that the exchange is better suited to the global market, taking a lead in legal frameworks and taking on board the advice given by Maltese financial regulators.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-06 16:42:01

This project aims to bring fairness and transparency to how tokens are launched. McGregor Partnered with Real World Gaming DAO McGregor did not launch the new token by himself. He teamed up with the Real World Gaming decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This partnership means the REAL token could be used in gaming economies, allowing holders to earn rewards and vote on future decisions. This makes REAL more than just a memecoin; it is part of a growing ecosystem. Instead of using the usual free-for-all launch, McGregor’s team chose a sealed-bid auction. This was done to prevent bots and hackers from taking over the launch, a common issue with regular token releases. McGregor explained that this approach is meant to set a new standard in the industry, focusing on trust and fairness in a space often filled with scams . The auction was held on April 5 and 6, aiming to create a fairer and more controlled environment for token buyers. The Rise of Memecoin and Market Trends McGregor’s memecoin comes when the memecoin market is gaining attention. Thanks partly to the launch of other celebrity-driven tokens like the TRUMP memecoin . Although memecoins are seen as speculative, some traders are still looking for opportunities to make quick profits. Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen, said traders embrace memecoins for fun. They intend to make quick profits while waiting for more stable market conditions. However, the broader crypto market is facing challenges. President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs have caused a lot of uncertainty, with global stock markets losing trillions of dollars. Many investors are moving away from risky assets and looking for safer options like Bitcoin (BTC). This shows that people see Bitcoin more as a store of value, like gold. Bitcoin Shows Strength During Economic Uncertainty Even with the current global challenges, Bitcoin is holding its ground . Its ability to stay strong during market drops suggests that more investors are beginning to see it as a safe asset. As fears of a recession grow, Bitcoin’s stability is attracting more attention as a reliable asset.

While Nakamoto’s true identity remains shrouded in mystery , the birth date associated with the pseudonym — April 5, 1975 — marks a symbolic milestone for the crypto community amid a year of increasing institutional and geopolitical adoption of the premier cryptocurrency. Satoshi, Master of Historic Contextual References? Crypto community members don’t really know who Satoshi Nakamoto is, and will likely never know, but the mysterious founder does apparently have a birthday. Satoshi entered a birth date when they registered the pseudonym with the P2P Foundation. According to that registration, Satoshi’s birthday is April 5, 1975. Historically, April 5th is laden with many notable events that many find too perfect to be coincidental. For instance, on April 5th, 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102, banning the private ownership of gold. The order criminalized the possession of many forms of gold by individuals or corporations. The year Nakamoto indicated as his birth date, 1975, is also significant. It’s the year that Americans were once again allowed to possess gold for the first time since the Executive Order 6102 was enacted. It suggests that the Bitcoin inventor could have purposely chosen a birth date that symbolized monetary freedom. Bitcoin’s Journey From Worthless To Priceless Bitcoin wallets associated with Satoshi Nakamoto still hold roughly 1.1 million BTC , worth billions of dollars. These coins have remained untouched for years since he stepped away, despite the flagship crypto soaring from $0 to a historic high of nearly $109,000 in January 2025. Interestingly, Satoshi’s supposed 50th birthday celebration coincides with a notable sell-off in Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin has slumped approximately 6% since President Donald Trump unveiled reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday evening that led to a $5 trillion U.S. equities bloodbath. Despite this setback, Bitcoin has transcended its enigmatic origins to ascend to notoriety with a staggering market capitalization of $1.6 trillion as of publication time. It’s worth mentioning that Nakamoto’s 50th birthday comes roughly a month after President Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, marking the first huge step toward integrating Bitcoin into the US financial system. The price of BTC is currently holding at around $82,541. That’s about 0.3% lower over the past 24 hours. Regardless of the current bleeding in the crypto market, Bitcoin’s enduring prominence highlights its resilience and growing relevance in the finance industry.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Satoshi Nakamoto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-06 16:48:31

According to a new report by Reuters, JPMorgan is raising the odds of a global recession from 40% to 60% due to new US trade policies, which include tariffs on China and the European Union (EU), sparking a worldwide trade war. As stated by the firm in a note seen by Reuters, “Disruptive U.S. policies have been recognized as the biggest risk to the global outlook all year. The effect… is likely to be magnified through (tariff) retaliation, a slide in U.S. business sentiment and supply-chain disruptions.” However, JPMorgan did note that it expects the blow from the tariffs to be dampened by the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the future. Other large institutions are sounding the alarm on a potential recession as well, including Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), though their odds of a downturn are lower. As stated by an HSBC analyst, according to Reuters, “Our equity market implied recession probability indicator suggests equities are already pricing in (about) 40% chance of a recession by the end of the year.” Last week, Goldman Sachs raised its chances of a recession hitting the US economy in the next 12 months to 35%, a 15% jump from its previous prediction. The firm said that it expects inflation – excluding food and energy prices – to hit 3.5% this year, 1.5% higher than the Fed’s 2% goal. Also last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10% tariff on all imported goods entering the US, while issuing a proclamation detailing “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of specific countries effective April 9th, with rates totaling up to 54% on China.

The performance ranked 12th out of the past 15 first quarters, according to NYDIG Research's data. The drawdown invites a familiar question in crypto circles: is the cycle over? The last time bitcoin started the year this poorly was in 2015, during a prolonged slump following the 2013 peak and after the collapse of Mt. Gox , according to NYDIG. Back then, prices recovered modestly over the rest of the year before surging in 2016. In the first quarter of 2020, amid a market sell-off tied to fears surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, BTC saw a 9.4% drawdown but then recovered to end the year up over 300%. In other years with negative Q1 returns—like 2014, 2018 and 2022—bitcoin ended the year down sharply, coinciding with the tail ends of previous bull cycles, the research note said. This time around, the backdrop is murky. Cryptocurrency prices surged after Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November after running a pro-crypto campaign. While under the Trump administration, the sector has been gaining greater regulatory clarity, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) backed off a number of lawsuits against crypto firms, it isn’t all bullish. Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs against nearly every country in the world last week, leading to a massive $5.4 trillion U.S. equities market wipeout in just two days. This led to the S&P 500 index's lowest level in 11 months and the Nasdaq 100's entry into bear market territory. While bitcoin has outperformed so far , what will happen after Monday’s opening bell is unclear. Historically, a weak Q1 doesn’t always spell doom for BTC, NYDIG’s data shows. The asset has bounced back in half of the years when it started in the red. The recent macroeconomic backdrop has seen analysts raise recession odds , which could test BTC’s role as a “U.S. isolation hedge.”Read more: Chart of The Week: Will April Bring Good Luck or Fool's Hope for Bitcoin?",Markets|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-06 17:00:00

BlockDAG’s strategy is clear: combine practical utility, worldwide reach, and accessibility. From mobile mining apps attracting hundreds of thousands to a significant partnership with football club Inter Milan, BlockDAG is active on various fronts. This is supported by an expanding developer community and a roadmap filled with important goals. As the cryptocurrency market prepares for the next round of leaders, BlockDAG is positioning itself at the forefront. BlockDAG’s Ascent: Layer 1 Highlight in 2025 As the competition among next-gen Layer 1s heats up, BlockDAG stands out. Focused on user-friendliness, simplicity, and a smooth experience, BlockDAG is quickly attracting users to its X1 Miner software and TG Tap Miner, now boasting millions of users. Its one-tap mining feature is making crypto more accessible worldwide, thereby transforming its broad acceptance. Yet, BlockDAG’s allure extends beyond growing its user base. Its modern architecture, which combines Proof of Work security with Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scalability, is garnering developer interest. While other Layer 1 networks strive to balance speed and decentralization, BlockDAG achieves both, setting a solid foundation for processing high-volume transactions and deploying real-world applications. Moreover, with over $212 million raised and BDAG priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, BlockDAG’s presale has already yielded a 2,380% return for early participants. And the momentum continues unabated. As 2025 approaches, BlockDAG is proving to be more than just another Layer 1 contender. The looming question is not if BlockDAG will succeed, but rather how quickly and extensively it will advance. Across Devices and Fields: BlockDAG’s Broadening Reach BlockDAG’s expanding user community is just the beginning. The momentum continues with a thriving ecosystem fueled by international partnerships and developer-led growth. A standout partnership with Inter Milan, a top name in European soccer, exemplifies a unique fusion of high-level sports and Web3 technology. This alliance puts BlockDAG in front of millions globally, showcasing its drive to integrate into the mainstream. On the development side, BlockDAG is also making significant strides. With over 200 decentralized apps functioning in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 platforms, collaborations like those with HackerEarth are sparking innovation within the network. Additionally, a technical partnership with SpaceDev is accelerating preparations for a robust Mainnet debut. BlockDAG employs a dual approach: rapid scaling through major partnerships and robust architecture, alongside promoting widespread adoption with user-friendly tools like the X1 Miner. This is a network aimed at long-lasting influence and real-world presence, not just temporary excitement. 2025 in Focus: Mainnet Launch, Key Listings, and the $1 Milestone As BlockDAG broadens its influence across sports, technology, and decentralized applications, it is preparing for its most crucial phase. The Beta Testnet, scheduled for launch in March 2025, will test the network’s scalability and performance in real-time, marking a significant shift from a promising project to an operational Layer 1. Beyond technical achievements, BlockDAG is also preparing for listings on ten major centralized exchanges to enhance global liquidity and accessibility. The much-anticipated $1 price point, which would represent a 3,930 percent increase from the initial presale, is currently under scrutiny by market analysts. Following extensive groundwork, BlockDAG is transitioning into a phase marked by practical delivery, widespread visibility, and significant market influence. With solid backing from international partnerships and a scalable tech infrastructure, 2025 could see BlockDAG not just participating but leading in the space. Concluding Insights BlockDAG’s path into 2025 is supported by tangible metrics, strategic planning, and solid implementation. It stands out from the typical Layer 1 narrative with a significant user base, growing developer engagement, and global reach through key partnerships. As the network moves from building anticipation to executing on a grand scale with the upcoming Beta Testnet and significant exchange listings, the focus shifts from mere validation to expansion, live deployment, and enhancing access. The next steps for BlockDAG involve expanding on its established foundation. Observers may soon realize that the opportunity to get involved with BlockDAG at an early stage is narrowing more quickly than anticipated.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is flashing bullish technical signals that point to a potential breakout, while Polkadot (DOT) is trading within a long-term accumulation zone—often a precursor to significant gains. Both are generating buzz, but neither matches the sustained momentum seen with BlockDAG (BDAG) . BlockDAG isn’t just competing in the Layer 1 race—it’s reshaping expectations. By combining DAG structure with Proof-of-Work (PoW), it delivers high-speed, scalable, and secure performance. After reaching $212 million in presale funds and onboarding over 800,000 users, BDAG is not waiting for a rally—it’s already in motion. For forward-thinking buyers, this could mark a defining opportunity in 2025. Shiba Inu Approaches a Breakout—But Can It Hold? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is nearing a technical breakout based on recent chart patterns and trading activity. Following a strong performance earlier in 2024, the token has entered a consolidation phase, with a Bollinger Band squeeze forming—a setup that often leads to high-volatility price movements. Support has held firm at $0.00001165, while a 21.74% rise in 24-hour trading volume suggests increasing interest. If price momentum continues, SHIB could rise toward $0.00001370 in the near term. With backing from its strong community and a large circulating supply of 589 trillion tokens, the project minimizes dilution risks. Investors are now watching for confirmation. Should SHIB break through its resistance zones, the next leg up could materialize quickly. For those eyeing market entry, the window could be narrow if buying pressure escalates. Polkadot Targets $50 as Accumulation Signals a Potential Upswing Polkadot (DOT) is drawing attention from analysts as it trades between $3.50 and $4.50—a price range that has historically signaled strong accumulation. This zone has often preceded large upward moves, with long-term holders quietly increasing positions. If DOT surpasses the $10–$11.50 resistance range, analysts believe it could potentially revisit its $50 all-time high. That projection represents a possible 1,000% upside, based on historical market cycles and current technical patterns. Momentum is slowly building, and if sentiment strengthens further, DOT could transition into a major uptrend. For investors focused on long-term structure, Polkadot’s price zone and network fundamentals suggest potential—but patience will be key. BlockDAG Redefines Blockchain Performance With $212M Raised & DAG-PoW Tech BlockDAG is gaining serious traction, thanks to its hybrid architecture that combines Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with Proof-of-Work. Unlike conventional blockchains that require blocks to be added sequentially, BlockDAG processes several blocks at once—removing congestion and enabling greater throughput. Its mining model is designed to be accessible, supporting both ASICs and mobile miners. This dual structure widens participation while preserving network integrity—something many Layer 1 networks still struggle to achieve. Compatibility with both EVM and WASM also ensures developers can launch smart contracts and interact with other blockchain ecosystems more easily. Buyer enthusiasm is evident. BlockDAG’s presale has surpassed $212 million, with BDAG currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. Those who entered during Batch 1 at $0.001 have already seen a 2,380% gain. With price predictions suggesting a climb to $1, BDAG’s upside remains compelling. Adoption isn’t limited to buyers—user numbers back it up. Over 800,000 users have joined the X1 Miner App , and 400,000+ have signed up for the Tap Miner. Additionally, 10+ centralized exchange (CEX) listings have been confirmed post-mainnet launch, setting the stage for broader reach. Summing Up! While SHIB and DOT offer technically promising setups, they remain reliant on future price recoveries. SHIB continues to rely on community-driven speculation, and DOT is still working to reclaim previous highs. By contrast, BlockDAG is actively delivering on milestones and reshaping blockchain infrastructure. With a 2,380% ROI already in the books, BDAG’s growth isn’t theoretical—it’s happening. As mainnet launch nears and CEX listings roll out, BDAG offers both a compelling story and verifiable fundamentals. For those evaluating 2025’s top crypto plays, the choice becomes clearer: rather than waiting on speculative moves, consider the project already showing results. BlockDAG isn’t just part of the conversation—it’s helping define what comes next.

This event quickly became a hot topic in Hyper Liquid news, especially because the whale still controls more than 10% of JELLY’s total supply. The unusual trading pattern—built on fast long and short positions—has triggered wider discussions about how liquidity is managed on the exchange. Meanwhile, PEPE price is building momentum after a key technical breakout. With signs of support forming, analysts believe PEPE could test the $0.000010 level again soon. While short-term trading interest grows around meme coins, long-term attention is shifting elsewhere. That brings us to BlockDAG . With $212 million raised, over 19.1 billion coins sold, and a 100,000+ strong community, it’s doing far more than generating hype. From miner distribution to growing app adoption, BlockDAG is showing why it”s a serious contender for the best crypto to buy 2025. Whale’s $6.2M Trade Draws Spotlight on HyperLiquid News A recent trading move has put Hyper Liquid news back in focus. A crypto whale reportedly made over $6.2 million using strategic long and short trades on JELLY—without triggering liquidations. This has raised eyebrows across the trading community. Even more interesting, the whale still holds around 10% of the token’s supply, worth nearly $2 million. Most of these tokens were purchased after March 22, fueling speculation that price manipulation could continue. This incident highlights the need for thoughtful investing strategies. The Hyperliquidity Provider Vault—designed to handle large trades—fell short in this case. It’s a reminder to focus on fundamentals, especially in markets driven by memes and short-term speculation. PEPE Price Eyes Key Resistance After Bullish Pattern Breakout PEPE price is showing signs of recovery as it challenges major resistance levels. The token recently broke out of a falling wedge—often seen as a bullish reversal—drawing interest from traders looking for upside. PEPE touched $0.000009242 within the last 24 hours, although it couldn’t stay above the 50-day EMA due to selling pressure. Still, four green candles in a row show consistent buying activity. The MACD is slowly rising, which points to building momentum. If sentiment continues to improve, PEPE price could test $0.000010 again and potentially reach $0.000013344. Support is holding at $0.0000060, which may offer a good entry point. As the recovery trend builds, PEPE remains one to watch. BlockDAG’s $212M Presale & Strong Community Fuel Long-Term Confidence In an industry where many projects overpromise, BlockDAG is steadily delivering. Its $212 million presale isn’t just impressive—it shows how much confidence the project has earned. While others struggle to prove their worth, BlockDAG continues to build steadily. The team is preparing to ship nearly 10,000 X-series miners ahead of mainnet launch. Meanwhile, over 800,000 users are already on the X1 Miner App , and another 400,000 are active on Tap Miner. These figures point to real-world interest, not just hype. Now in Batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248—a 2,380% increase from its Batch 1 price. With over 19.1 billion coins sold, demand is clearly strong. The project’s 100,000+ community members play an active role, supporting testnet operations and pushing BlockDAG forward. It’s not just a presale—it’s a live and growing network. That’s why many now see it as the best crypto to buy 2025 . Summing Up! The latest Hyper Liquid news has sparked important conversations. A whale’s $6.2 million gain from trading JELLY has put the spotlight on exchange dynamics and liquidity handling. It’s a reminder that due diligence is essential. At the same time, PEPE price is gaining traction again. Analysts are watching for a move past $0.000010, with short-term interest likely to increase if current patterns hold. Looking ahead, BlockDAG stands out. It has already sold 19.1 billion coins, achieved a 2,380% price increase, and continues to deliver key milestones. With active user growth and miner rollouts underway, it’s backed by real results—not just buzz. For anyone focused on long-term potential, BlockDAG is becoming a clear standout. As the market evolves, it could very well prove to be the best crypto to buy 2025.

Though refunds are planned, trust in the platform remains shaky. Meanwhile, Bittensor (TAO) is seeing fresh interest, having broken out of a six-month price wedge, with analysts now watching for a push toward $750. But among all the buzz, BlockDAG (BDAG) is pulling the biggest crowd. Its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work system is tackling the core issues that have long held Ethereum back—like high gas fees and slow speeds. With a 2,380% return during presale and tools that make token launches easy, BlockDAG isn’t just another new crypto—it’s building something practical. As more users and developers look for low-cost, scalable options, BDAG is quickly becoming the one to watch. $12M Hyperliquid Exploit Drags Down HYPE—Is There Still Hope? A recent exploit has caused major trouble for Hyperliquid. Using the illiquid JELLY token, a trader deposited $7.1 million, used leverage to pump its price, and drained over $12 million from the Hyperliquidity Provider vault. HYPE, the platform’s native token, dropped 14% and is now priced around $14.23. In response, Hyperliquid says it will fully compensate affected users, except flagged wallets, via the Hyper Foundation. While the hack exposed weak risk controls, the quick recovery plan and promised validator upgrades could help HYPE stabilize. For some investors, this dip could be a buying opportunity—if Hyperliquid can repair its reputation quickly and tighten its security going forward. Bittensor (TAO) Breaks Out of Long Slump—Is $750 on the Table? TAO is grabbing attention after breaking free from a falling wedge it’s been stuck in for six months. For technical traders, this pattern often signals a shift from bearish to bullish, and current price action backs that up. TAO is hovering near $275, and if it clears the $300 mark, a run toward $750 is back on the table. Momentum indicators like RSI and MACD are showing strength. Trading volume is picking up, and open interest jumped more than 10% in the last day. It’s the kind of setup that gets traders excited—and may lead to more upside if momentum keeps building. Why Developers Are Moving From Ethereum to BlockDAG BlockDAG is quickly attracting developers who are frustrated with Ethereum’s limitations. High gas fees and slow confirmation times are well-known issues on Ethereum, especially during heavy network use. BlockDAG’s architecture solves this with a Directed Acyclic Graph system paired with Proof-of-Work, allowing thousands of transactions per second. The cost advantage is clear—BlockDAG keeps fees low and stable. That’s a major plus for projects with frequent transactions or growing user bases. But it’s not just about price and speed—BlockDAG also makes things easier for developers. Its no-code Token Wizard and smooth setup tools allow even beginners to create assets and launch apps. Security matters, too. BlockDAG uses parallel validation and strong encryption, offering more resilience against attacks than Ethereum’s more linear model. With $212 million already raised, over 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold, and a 2,380% gain since the presale’s first batch, momentum is hard to ignore. Developers are joining in—and not looking back. Which Project Deserves Your Attention in April? HYPE might recover if it restores user trust, and TAO’s technical setup looks promising, but BlockDAG is doing more than chasing trends. It’s solving real infrastructure issues that Ethereum and other networks still face. With over $212 million raised, dev-friendly tools, and lightning-fast processing, BDAG is proving it’s more than just a presale token. TAO could be attractive for chart-watchers, and HYPE might stage a comeback—but BlockDAG is drawing builders, buyers, and serious crypto capital. It’s not just a coin—it’s the core of a growing ecosystem focused on speed, scale, and utility. If you’re tired of overhyped tokens and clogged networks, BDAG offers something different: real usage, real progress, and a shot at long-term dominance. Among April’s top crypto contenders, BlockDAG isn’t just holding its ground—it’s changing the conversation.

Their joint appearance marked a symbolic moment of cross-chain cooperation with the new season, which includes 16 early projects in fields like artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized finance (DeFi), depIN, deSci, and gaming to expand these Web3 projects. Season 9 of MVB is focused on nurturing early-stage builders with direct mentorship, technical support, and funding opportunities through Binance Labs. MVB Season 9 launches in Hong Kong with 16 projects entering intensive Web3 accelerator program The offline opening event for MVB had been set to be held in Hong Kong between April 5 and April 6. MVB Season 9 is not just a builder competition—it’s a full-fledged accelerator program. The selected projects, 16 in total, had the opportunity to gain investment support from YZi Labs and were due to join a 4-week incubation. According to a press release, BNB chain, YZi Labs, and CMC Labs collaborated to execute the 4-week accelerator program. The program was set to kick off with a two-day offline event in Hong Kong on Apr. 5, which was held alongside the BNB Super Meetup and the Hong Kong Web3 Festival. Vitalik’s and CZ’s presence significantly boosted participants and highlighted the industry-wide push to scale practical and sustainable blockchain solutions. Across the duration of the program, the founders and core team members of each project were to receive a curriculum covering key concepts for early-stage Web3 projects. This included talent development, team building, fundraising tactics, and tokenomics design. Finally, on Demo Day, the 16 project teams were to present and make a pitch to investors. Afterward, YZi Labs will make its investment decision based on the program’s project performance and the Demo Day pitches. Hong Kong Web3 festival in 2025 set to propel global Web3 growth with leading industry minds Apart from BNB Chain’s MVB Season 9, the Hong Kong Web3 festival has also contributed to boosting the growth of Web3. Earlier on April 4, reports announced the Hong Kong Web3 Festival would return in 2025 from April 6 to 9 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC), located at 5BCDE. This marks the world’s leading crypto event that brings together the brightest minds in the Web3 and crypto space. It is worth noting that this event goes beyond a straightforward conference since it brings together leaders and innovators to discuss the future of Web3 and present the newest advancements and solutions in the field. Past editions have featured prominent speakers such as Cathie Wood, founder, CEO, and CIO of ARK Invest; Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum; Paul CHAN Mo-po, GBM, GBS, MH, JP, Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The list of speakers who were to attend this year’s ongoing festival includes government representatives and business executives, such as Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, Paul CHAN Mo-po, financial secretary, and others. The festival brings together investors, developers, policymakers, and enthusiasts from around the world through a mix of exhibitions, networking sessions, and panel discussions. Attendees explore the latest developments in crypto policy, DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain infrastructure, while interactive zones add a layer of engagement with immersive metaverse games and digital art installations.

The token was launched through a sealed bid to avoid bots taking over the bid. The meme coin was released with the help of Real World Gaming DAO. “This is not some celebrity-endorsed bullshit token”, wrote McGregor, “it is a REAL game changer that will change the crypto ecosystem as well as make REAL change in the world. The sealed-bid auction is the new way of launching a token to prevent rug pulls and snipers. This is about transparency – we show the world how it is done with integrity”. During an interview, McGregor mentioned that he aimed to create a memecoin with transparency and integrity. “I changed the FIGHT game”, wrote McGregor on X, “I changed the WHISKEY game. I changed the STOUT game. Now it’s time to change the CRYPTO game. This is just the beginning”. The REAL whitepaper outlined a staking plan to reward users who participate regularly and stake large sums of money, gaining extra status points and possibly earning a revenue bonus. REAL aims to align the industry with consumers’ experiences, hinting at a possible collaboration. Memecoins have become more popular lately, especially with the TRUMP token . Elon Musk has continued to promote Dogecoin while creating the DOGE department at the White House. Analysts believe that a crucial element to the success of a memecoin is whether it has a cult following. For this reason, McGregor’s token may have a chance, due to how many dedicated fans he has in the MMA community. However, a rising star in UFC could presumably create a memecoin and outshine McGregor’s REAL token. Crypto investors are continuing to buy memecoins alongside their traditional investments. The SEC declassified memecoins as securities and instead likened them to trading cards. In 2016, McGregor became the first fighter in UFC history to hold two championship titles at the same time, winning the Lightweight Championship, beating Eddie Alvarez, and boosting his status as a prized fighter. McGregor continued to build a large fan base despite ongoing injuries due to his vibrant charisma and business ventures, including his own brand of Whiskey called Proper Number Twelve. REAL, including staking rewards, may indicate that the project wishes to increase participant engagement, boost the time consumers engage with the project, and promote the fan base of McGregor and MMA. REAL has not yet published token metrics such as locked value and liquidity. Collectors may also wish to wait for any further information about regulatory standards regarding the token because such can indicate whether the memecoin will be less volatile over time. In 2017, McGregor faced boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Junior in a highly promoted boxing match. Although McGregor lost, the match drew many pay-per-view revenues. McGregor can still draw a large crowd despite having mixed results with his bouts and continued injuries.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-06 17:03:40

Trading volumes are declining and marketplaces shutting down. The once-hyped world of non-fungible tokens, which analysts once boldly projected could balloon to over $264 billion by 2032, now seems to be limping along. Weekly trading volumes have been falling like dominoes for weeks, scaring off capital and dragging the market back to levels not seen since its explosive 2020 debut. Art NFTs yearly trading volume and sales count | Source: DappRadar Blockchain analytics firm DappRadar shows that trading volumes in 2021 were riding high, hitting nearly $3 billion. Fast-forward to the first quarter of 2025. That figure has nosedived 93% to just $23.8 million as “active traders have vanished,” blockchain analyst Sara Gherghelas noted. “This rapid growth coincided with global shifts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerating the adoption of digital platforms and pushing artists to explore innovative methods of engaging with their audiences. However, three years later, the hype around Art NFTs has significantly decreased.” Sara Gherghelas The data backs her up. In 2024, trading volume dropped nearly 20% from the year prior, while total sales declined 18%. As Gherghelas put it in her 2025 research, it was “one of the worst-performing years since 2020.” Still speculative assets In an interview with crypto.news, OutsetPR’s legal officer Alice Frei implied that regulation is still a mess as “governments are still undecided on how to classify NFTs.” In the U.S., they’re often treated like securities, meaning platforms must walk a legal tightrope. In the U.K., they’re seen more like collectibles under intellectual property law. “These are examples of leading countries with clear cryptocurrency regulations; in many other countries, the situation is even more uncertain. This lack of regulatory clarity creates an environment that is ripe for fraud and erodes investor confidence. Until there is more consistency, NFT adoption will remain stagnant.” Alice Frei Frei also highlighted a deeper issue: beyond the worlds of cryptocurrency and gaming, NFTs are still “trying to prove that they offer real value.” “In theory, they could revolutionize several industries — think concert tickets that prevent scalping, digital IDs for online verification, or property deeds stored on the blockchain. But in practice, most NFTs are still largely speculative assets.” Alice Frei Speaking of gaming, where NFTs have the most potential for mainstream use, their adoption is also struggling, Frei pointed out, recalling that Ubisoft’s Project Quartz , an attempt to integrate NFTs into AAA games, was met with “resistance from players, forcing the company to shut it down.” Frei notes that gamers are “hesitant about digital assets that feel more like currency than a genuine addition to their experience.” You might also like: What is an NFT? A complete guide to non-fungible tokens Revolving door If the data wasn’t already bleak, March brought more bad news: a string of marketplace shutdowns added fuel to the fire. Among them, South Korean tech giant LG shut down its LG Art Lab, which was launched just three years ago at the height of the NFT mania. The company didn’t share detailed reasons, only saying that “it is the right time to shift our focus and explore new opportunities.” Just a week later, X2Y2 — a former OpenSea rival that once boasted $5.6 billion in lifetime volume — also ceased its operations, citing a “90% shrinkage of NFT trading volume from its peak in 2021” and struggles to remain competitive in the space. Then came Bybit . The crypto exchange, still reeling from a $1.46 billion theft linked to North Korea-affiliated hackers, quietly closed its platform. Emily Bao, head of web3 at Bybit, said the decision would allow the company to “enhance the overall user experience while concentrating on the next generation of blockchain-powered solutions.” Amid the wave of closures, Frei says the NFT market now “feels like a revolving door.” “Take Bored Ape Yacht Club, for example – once the pinnacle of NFT status, its prices have dramatically dropped. At the peak, a single Bored Ape sold for $400,000, but now some are barely fetching $50,000. The problem lies in the fact that many NFT projects rely on hype rather than actual utility. If people cannot see long-term value, they are unlikely to return.” Alice Frei Last hope Coinbase , too, seems to be pulling back. While it hasn’t officially shut down its NFT platform, all signs suggest it’s shifting focus. During an earnings call in early 2023, President and COO Emilie Choi indicated that the company sees “medium and long-term opportunities” in NFTs. But its real focus seems to be behind Base, its layer-2 blockchain network. Coinbase declined to comment on its position as NFT activity continues to decline, despite multiple requests from crypto.news. The OutsetPR legal officer thinks that with the market’s current trajectory, smaller platforms are unlikely to weather the storm. “Smaller platforms will continue to shut down, leaving only a few dominant players like OpenSea and Blur,” she said. She explained that the shift is being driven by two major forces. First, tighter regulations are on the horizon, which will likely bring an end to the “Wild West days of NFTs.” Second, the gaming sector may offer NFTs a lifeline—but it’s still a narrow one. As Frei puts it, gaming may be NFTs’ “last hope,” though developers will still need to avoid “pay-to-win mechanics that could turn players away.” “The hype is over. If NFTs are to survive, they will need to prove that they offer more than just expensive pictures on the blockchain,” Frei concluded.

""I think with the current administration, my sense is, we are highly likely to see a significant pullback by the CFPB in the context of the activity by other regulators,"" Ostroff told Cointelegraph in an interview. State regulators also have the authority under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) to assume some of the regulatory roles of the CFPB , the attorney said but also added that some regulatory functions will continue to fall within the purview of the CFPB as a matter of established law. Ostroff cited the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) as regulators to keep an eye on as potential leaders of crypto regulations at the state level. However, the attorney clarified that while the CFPB may see a diminished role during the Trump administration, the agency would not be outright dismantled during the current regime due to ""statutorily mandated obligations and requirements"" that require acts of Congress to change.

In a recent interview with early Bitcoin investor Kyle Chasse, Hayes explained why Bitcoin’s value is now primarily determined by global fiat liquidity rather than technology or adoption cycles. “Bitcoin has transitioned from this sort of technological digital bearer asset into the best smoke alarm for fiat liquidity that we have globally,” Hayes stated , adding, “ previously that role was held by gold.” According to Hayes, while Bitcoin’s technological underpinnings remain solid and primarily unchanged, its price action is increasingly tied to central bank policies, particularly those of the Federal Reserve. He emphasized that he focuses entirely on liquidity when analyzing Bitcoin’s price trajectory. The pundit further pointed to a “seminal change” in Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s recent statements as evidence of a shifting monetary landscape. Despite inflation remaining above the Fed’s target, Powell has indicated a decrease in the pace of quantitative tightening, allowing fewer Treasury securities to roll off their balance sheet. “Powell said that in the future, we might allow our mortgage-backed security runoff, which is about $35 billion a month, to be negated by buying $35 billion a month of treasuries,” Hayes explained. “That’s very positive for dollar liquidity.” Perhaps most significantly, Hayes highlighted Powell’s comment that the “inflationary aspects of tariffs are transitory,” suggesting the Fed views any price increases from Trump’s trade policies as temporary disruptions rather than persistent inflation. “Tariffs don’t matter anymore to Powell, and they shouldn’t matter anymore as crypto investors,” Hayes argued. “If Trump does 50% or 2%, it doesn’t matter because we know that Powell’s going to continue to provide the monetary conditions that we need.” This policy shift has made Hayes “extremely bullish” on crypto’s trajectory. When pressed about price targets, Hayes mentioned his previously stated $1 million Bitcoin prediction, noting it could also be “$ 660,000 or $500,000 or $250,000 or some round number that the human mind finds significant.” Earlier this week, he identified a crucial support level for Bitcoin amid market uncertainty caused by new U.S. tariffs . On April 2, President Trump announced a minimum 10% tariff on all countries effective April 5, with additional “reciprocal tariffs” starting April 9. In a Thursday tweet , Hayes emphasized the importance of Bitcoin maintaining support above $76,500 until U.S. Tax Day on April 15. “The market doesn’t like Liberation Day,” Hayes wrote, suggesting that after April 15, the crypto market could be freed from the uncertainty and volatility triggered by these trade policies.

With AI crossing into DeFi, tokenization on the rise, and digital wallets becoming household tools, crypto is clearly breaking past its niche status. From Latin America to Asia, folks aren’t just parking cash in old-school stocks anymore. They’re looking for smarter alternatives—assets that don’t sleep, don’t close, and aren’t chained to Wall Street’s mood swings. This shift is creating fresh waves of attention around digital assets that not only store value but actively do more. While Bitcoin still gets the headlines, it’s time to pay attention to the newer power players redefining how people save, transact, and earn. Qubetics , Bittensor TAO, and Bitcoin are three standouts—but for different reasons. With each carving out its role as a high-utility asset with long-term potential, they’re answering the global appetite for smarter digital ownership. But among them, Qubetics is blazing a different trail, backed by staggering presale performance and some seriously practical tech. Qubetics: The Web3 Aggregator That’s Grabbing Attention Fast Qubetics has come out swinging. It’s sitting deep into its 28th crypto presale stage, with over 506 million $TICS tokens sold and a presale tally north of $15.8 million. The current price per token is $0.1430, and more than 24,300 backers already hold $TICS. Now that’s traction—and fast. For those keeping score, even a modest rise to $1 could mean a 599% ROI. A climb to $15? That’s a 10,388% ROI. That’s the kind of math that’s got people talking. With $500, you’re getting close to 3,496 tokens at the current price. If $TICS hits $10, you’re sitting on $34,965. At $15, that number climbs to $52,447. For someone in Colombia or Argentina looking to change their financial future with a mid-sized crypto play, this isn’t just potential—it’s a real shot at leveling up. Qubetics isn’t riding on hype. It’s actually solving something real. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it’s weaving together fragmented Web3 services into a single powerful interface. No more bouncing between five different apps just to swap, stake, or pay. Qubetics puts it all in one place—clean, fast, and smooth. But what’s pulling in the crowds even more is the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. This isn’t your average crypto wallet. It’s the tool that lets everyday users—entrepreneurs, freelancers, remote workers, even small e-commerce brands—send and receive crypto across multiple chains without giving up control of their keys. Picture this: A designer in Medellín gets paid in Polygon, but needs to swap into Arbitrum to buy ad space. Done in seconds. A software agency in São Paulo handles ten clients, all paying in different tokens—no middleman, no third-party wallet risk. That’s next-level practicality. Even tourists using crypto for borderless payments? Qubetics makes it as easy as scanning a QR code. The crypto ICO presale for Qubetics has built legit hype around these features, and the project’s numbers reflect the growing confidence from its early adopters. Multiple analysts have floated $TICS price predictions that range from $5 to $15 over the next year, especially if adoption continues to snowball. The demand is growing not just because of speculation—but because the utility makes sense in real life. For those watching closely, this isn’t just a presale—it’s a movement in motion. Bittensor TAO: AI Meets Decentralized Rewards Bittensor TAO is making waves for being one of the only projects that successfully merges machine learning with crypto. It’s not built for memes or quick flips—it’s built for long-term infrastructure. TAO rewards contributors for training and hosting open-source AI models on a decentralized network. Instead of big tech hoarding it all, TAO pays its community to help improve machine intelligence. For buyers looking for something deeply technical, Bittensor has positioned itself as the backbone of decentralized AI computation. That’s drawn attention from serious builders and crypto-native tech folks who’ve been looking for value beyond staking or holding. Its native token, TAO, has held strong over the past few years, even while others struggled to stay afloat. Bitcoin: The OG Store of Value Still Holding Strong Say what you want—Bitcoin still runs the show. It’s the first, the most adopted, and the most recognized. It doesn’t have smart contracts, it doesn’t care about flashy DeFi apps—but it still gets treated like digital gold by its global community. From Miami to Buenos Aires, people trust BTC to store value outside government control. In 2025, Bitcoin remains the most widely held crypto on the planet. It’s been battle-tested through market crashes, regulation waves, and tech innovation cycles. And every time folks get nervous about fiat currencies or centralized banks, they come back to Bitcoin. What’s wild is how much institutional attention Bitcoin continues to grab.

Davinci Jeremie Predicts Solana will Surge 20X this Cycle,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-o-g-davinci-jeremie-predicts-solana-will-surge-20x-this-cycle/,"In a surprising turnaround from his recent bearish outlook, popular Bitcoin veteran Davinci Jeremie has issued a bold prediction for Solana (SOL), suggesting the crypto asset could experience a staggering twenty-fold price surge during the current market cycle. Interestingly, this bold prediction comes just days after he urged investors to dump all their altcoins for Bitcoin. In a Saturday analysis , the pundit first warned short-term traders that any expectation of a short-term rebound was misguided. “ Solana? Same thing. We are dead in the water,” he said, hinting at a break below the $120 multi-year support level. He pointed to $80 as the next downside target in the near term, although emphasizing his broader conviction in the token’s long-term potential. “ If you want to get into the short, you can probably get into it right now,” Jeremie stated. However, despite his bearish short-term view, he suggested that current price levels might represent a golden buying opportunity. “There’s going to be a move so fast it’ll make your head spin,” he added, hinting at smart money quietly rotating into high-potential assets like SOL . “I think Solana is going to surprise us and do something incredible. Not just a 10X, but a 20X this cycle.” As for what could drive such a surge, Jeremie pointed to the explosive meme coin mania ignited by Donald Trump on the Solana network. “ Trump opened the floodgates,” he said. “ He launched a meme coin. He didn’t tell anyone to buy it, he didn’t promise it would moon—he just launched it, and people jumped in.” Jeremie says this phenomenon signals a wider trend in the coming months. “Meme coins are blowing up on Solana. If Trump can make that kind of money from a meme coin, what’s stopping other celebrities or big companies from doing the same?” he asked. Jeremie, whose contrarian takes have often proven prescient in the past, did not provide an exact timeline for the projected 20X move but emphasized the need to “do what you have to” and position for what he sees as an inevitable crypto shift. Notably, the pundit’s 20X prediction would potentially place Solana’s price at approximately $2,400 from current levels, significantly surpassing its previous peak of $294.33 earlier this year. Jeremie, who gained fame for his 2013 video urging viewers to invest $1 per day in Bitcoin when it was trading below $100, has built a reputation for making contrarian calls that occasionally prove prescient. That said, Solana has experienced significant volatility recently and is trading near the crucial $120 support level identified by multiple ana lysts, including Ali Martinez and Elliott Wave analyst, “More Crypto Online as a ‘make-or-break zone.” According to them, holding above this price range could be key for the next move. SOL traded at $114 at press time, reflecting a 3.50% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-06 17:20:03

According to Messari’s latest report, the figure reflects a strong climb from its earlier TVL range of $300-500 million seen between late March and mid-September 2024. Compared to the previous year, Aptos’ TVL rose by 109% in USD terms and a whopping 562% in APT terms. This increase occurred despite a 47% drop in the APT token price over the year. USDT, USDC Drive Aptos Stablecoin Market Cap The stablecoin market cap on the Layer 1 network reached a milestone on March 24 when it surpassed $1 billion for the first time, which marked an over 10x increase compared to the same time last year and triple the value from December. This rapid growth has been fueled by major inflows into Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC after the launch of their native contracts on October 28 and January 31, respectively. While USDT saw its market cap soar over 8x to $680 million, USDC increased by 131% after climbing from $128 million to $295 million. Aptos Labs has launched two major technologies – Zaptos and Shardines – to improve performance. These solutions aim to lower latency and increase throughput as Aptos works toward becoming a global transaction hub capable of processing 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Zaptos is designed to improve Aptos’ pipelined architecture, where multiple block stages run in parallel for better efficiency. By optimizing this system, it sharply cuts end-to-end latency, thereby boosting overall performance and helping Aptos achieve faster, more scalable blockchain operations. Shardines, on the other hand, brings a horizontally scaled execution engine by splitting transactions into smaller parts and distributing them across multiple nodes for parallel processing. This sysytem enables the network to manage more transactions at once, and significantly increase transaction speed and overall network efficiency. Aptos is currently positioned as the 11th largest total value locked among blockchains, according to data compiled by DefiLlama. Institutional Demand For APT Bitwise filed to introduce a spot Aptos ETF in the United States last month. Although the network operates on a proof-of-stake model, the filing notably excluded any staking component. Additionally, Coinbase Custody is designated as the ETF’s proposed custodian in the application. The asset manager had launched an Aptos Staking ETP on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange last November, following which a Spanish bank then allocated 2% of its holdings to it.

Notable digital currencies are showing promise for significant growth. The article explores which coins to keep an eye on. Discover how DOGE , TRX , AVAX , and SUI are positioning themselves for a potential rise. Dogecoin Market Outlook: Recent Trends and Critical Levels Over the past month, the coin dropped by 17.17%, reflecting temporary volatility. However, it has shown a substantial gain of 53.26% over the last six months, indicating a recovery momentum that hints at underlying potential. The 1-week change of -1.48% points to a brief cooling-off phase, even as long-term trends lean towards a bullish resurgence. Current pricing is between $0.13 and $0.23, with resistance at $0.28 and a secondary cap at $0.38. Support is located near $0.08. Mixed signals from various indicators point to a balance between bulls and bears, with no clear trend emerging. Trading strategies could involve buying opportunities near support and cautious selling at resistance levels. Upward Momentum with Caution: TRON Market Dynamics in Focus Past month figures show a slight dip of 1.55%, while over the past six months TRON surged by over 50%. The coin exhibited moderate volatility with steady performance changes, reflecting shifts that have sent mixed signals to traders during these timeframes. Current price action has TRON trading between $0.22 and $0.26, with immediate resistance around $0.27 and support near $0.19, followed by the second levels at $0.31 and $0.15 respectively. The market shows neither clear bullish dominance nor a strong bearish mood, as oscillators and momentum indicators offer balanced readings. Trading within these bands may suit short-term strategies for those eyeing a break above resistance or fallback below support. Avalanche Faces Downward Pressure Amid Ongoing Market Uncertainty Avalanche experienced a 17.11% decline over the past month and a 34.57% drop over the last six months, trading between $14.37 and $24.15 during this period. The coin’s performance reflects a steady slide, indicating waning momentum and growing selling pressure. Historical price movement shows a market gradually retreating due to shifting investor sentiment and reduced buying interest. Current trading shows prices held within the $14.37 to $24.15 range, with key support at approximately $9.96 and resistance near $29.52. Bears currently dominate, as negative momentum readings and an RSI around 38.63 suggest ongoing caution. Traders might consider testing support levels for potential rebounds or explore short-term opportunities within the declining trend. Sui Price Analysis: Short-Term Dips Amid Six-Month Growth Sui experienced a sharp one-month drop of about 20% and a weekly decline near 6%. Over the past six months, the coin recovered by 8%, reflecting volatile swings with periods of resilience. Short-term moves point to a quick loss in momentum followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a mixed performance in the altcoin segment. The current trading range sits between $1.74 and $3.03, with a strong support level at $1.21 and resistance at $3.78. Bears currently dominate with slight negative momentum and oscillator pulls. Traders might consider buying near support while watching for any breakout toward the second resistance at $5.07. Conclusion DOGE , TRX , AVAX , and SUI show strong potential for growth by 2025. Their unique features and active communities set them apart. DOGE benefits from its widespread recognition. TRX focuses on decentralizing content sharing. AVAX offers fast transactions and low costs. SUI is gaining traction for its innovative approach to blockchain technology. These factors position these cryptos as ones to watch closely in the coming years.

Known for quick transactions and scaling, analysts are now doubting its supremacy as regulatory pressures and network congestion endanger growth. Key market observer turns his attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a decentralized lending protocol that has been gathering momentum in its fourth presale phase. So far, with an impressive secured sum of $6.2 million and 7,900 holders onboard, MUTM’s price rally is already exceeding the target and could potentially dethrone Solana by late 2025. The Uncertainty Of Solana’s Climb As Competition Rises And the broader Solana ecosystem keeps pulling developers, aided by lower fees than Ethereum and more DeFi integrations. (If its adoption accelerates, Solana could be worth $400 in 2025, forecasts imply, even as risks like regulatory crackdowns or technical bottlenecks could keep it to gains of no more than $250.) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has recently exploded in popularity with novel models for demand sustainability, indicates the cautious optimism that surrounds the long-term outlook of the space. Where Solana’s resilience is tethered to wider market direction, MUTM’s self-feeding tokenomics analysts say could drive faster appreciation. MUTM Presale Stronger Every Day Phase 4 of Mutuum Finance’s presale is moving fast, with tokens available at $0.025 before a 20% jump to $0.03 following in the next stage. At $0.06, once MUTM is listed, this figure built within its token distribution plan offers early participants a 140% return. Long term estimates predict an ascent to $3.50 in months, yielding an eye-watering 13,900% ROI for current holders. The ubiquity stems from Mutuum’s lending framework, seen as the generation of finance-earning mtTokens and a repurchase strategy to create perpetual demand. During the presale itself, MUTM has already crossed 7,900 holders, which showcases confidence in its Roadmap. Mutuum Finance, however, differentiates itself with mtTokens that appreciate in value when users earn interest on their deposited assets like ETH or stablecoins. In this way, these tokens keep their liquidity by DeFi battlefields, providing long term accumulation. 20% of the platform fees, at the same time, go to buy back the MUTM on the exchanges and redistributing the tokens to stakers while decreasing the sell-offs as well. The two-in-one help continue buy pressure and diffusion of incentive compared to Solana’s dependence on external adoption. While presale proceeds are helping them pick up the pace in development, Mutuum’s developers are finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, a milestone that would enhance the confidence of investors ahead of its exchange listing. How to Time the Market Before the Presale Gets Underway Phase 4 is coming to a close fast and the opportunity to secure MUTM at $0.025 is shrinking. Later phases will gradually increase prices, emulating the sense of urgency prevalent in Solana’s early days, but do so with structured tokenomics which should ensure better price stability. Those first in stampede not only get a 140% launch reward, but have also get themselves an incoming exponential amplifier when MUTM hits its $3.50 target after launch. As Solana struggles with macroeconomic uncertainty, Mutuum’s closed-loop economy provides insulation from major swings in the wider market, appealing to investors craving predicable returns. Audit to finalise ahead of Exchange listing This confirms one of the last steps for mainstream adoption, and the process will be released through its official channels allowing official publication of Mutuum Finance’s audit completion with Certik. This transparency is in line with its ethos of decentralized stability, which is in stark contrast to speculative assets. While Solana works on its recovery, the presale performance and utility-first approach of MUTM offers portfolios with more strategic growth over hype a viable alternative. Analysts following both projects state Solana’s destiny is dependent on outside factors whereas Mutuum Finance governs its demand cycle via cyclical incentives. Phase 4 is underway and the next price hike is just around the corner, the time to act is now. Head to the Mutuum Finance official site now to grab tokens before the presale progresses — get positioned to profit as this DeFi contender takes aim at established competitors.

This financial infusion aims to enhance the platform’s capabilities in bridging the gap between cryptocurrency payments and traditional fiat systems, particularly in regions where QR code-based transactions are prevalent. ​ Addressing the Crypto-Fiat Divide The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies has introduced a new paradigm in digital payments. However, a significant challenge persists: while many users are eager to transact using cryptocurrencies, a majority of vendors still prefer fiat currencies. This disparity is especially pronounced in areas where QR code payments dominate the financial landscape. ​ P2P.me offers a novel solution to this conundrum. Unlike traditional on-and-off ramps that often involve complex processes and intermediaries, P2P.me leverages a decentralized network of intermediaries. In this system, a user initiates a payment in USDC (a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar), and a designated intermediary accepts the USDC, subsequently transferring the equivalent fiat amount to the intended recipient. Remarkably, this entire transaction is completed in approximately 90 seconds, providing a swift and efficient means of converting crypto payments into fiat currency. Innovative Approach to User Verification In an era where data privacy concerns are paramount, P2P.me distinguishes itself by implementing zero-knowledge proofs for user verification. This advanced cryptographic method allows the platform to authenticate users without storing sensitive personal information. The system assesses the authenticity of a user’s social media presence and may also verify government-issued identification, all without retaining this data. This approach not only streamlines the verification process but also enhances user privacy and security. ​ According to reports, the Base-built platform plans to launch a token within the next 12 months, aiming to transfer control to the community. We’ve raised $2M from Multicoin Capital ( @multicoincap ) & Coinbase Ventures( @cbventures ) to decentralize crypto-to-fiat swaps. Using ZK, https://t.co/xmf0CjcqXv enables anyone to pay with USDC at any QR! Thanks, @CoinDesk , for covering our fundraise! … — P2P.me (@P2Pdotme) April 4, 2025 P2P.me’s emergence comes at a pivotal time in the evolution of digital payments. The platform’s ability to seamlessly integrate stablecoin transactions into existing fiat-based payment infrastructures addresses a critical bottleneck in the adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. By facilitating rapid and secure crypto-to-fiat conversions, P2P.me not only enhances the utility of digital currencies but also fosters greater acceptance among vendors who have been hesitant to embrace crypto payments. Final Thoughts Thus, with its recent infusion of $2 million in seed funding from industry heavyweights like Multicoin Capital and Coinbase Ventures, P2P.me is poised to make significant strides in the crypto payment landscape. y addressing the longstanding challenge of crypto-to-fiat conversions, particularly in QR code-centric economies, P2P.me stands to play a crucial role in bridging the gap between digital currencies and traditional financial systems.

However, Ozak AI (OZ) is emerging as a standout project with a sturdy use case in AI-driven blockchain generation. By integrating predictive analytics, machine learning, and decentralized finance, Ozak AI offers real-time market insights and automatic trading solutions, setting it apart from speculative tokens. Currently in its 3rd presale stage at just $0.003, analysts expect OZ could attain $1, imparting a large growth possibility. With AI reshaping industries and blockchain technology evolving, Ozak AI’s progressive method positions many of the elite 5% of cryptos with long-term potential, proving CZ’s caution at the same time as highlighting its promising destiny. The Crypto Market’s Harsh Reality Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has long been a vocal figure within the cryptocurrency space, offering insights into market trends and potential risks. Recently, CZ issued a stark caution: 95% of cryptocurrencies will finally fail. His declaration aligns with a widely usual reality within the crypto enterprise—most projects lack real-world software, sturdy development groups, or long-term sustainability. Despite the fast increase of the blockchain sector, history has shown that only a handful of tasks manage to survive and thrive over time. Many cryptocurrencies released with bold roadmaps however fail due to terrible execution, lack of adoption, or unsustainable tokenomics. With regulation tightening and investors becoming extra cautious, most effective tasks with sturdy basics and innovative use instances will have a risk at long-term success. This raises the question: Which cryptos will defy the odds? Youtube embed: OZAK AI Will Get You Successful Returns with $1 in Target on Launch Why Ozak AI (OZ) Stands Out Among the emerging crypto initiatives, Ozak AI (OZ) is swiftly gaining traction as a promising project. Unlike the heaps of speculative tokens flooding the market, Ozak AI is built on a foundation of artificial intelligence and blockchain integration, offering real-world applications that deal with urgent financial and analytical needs. Ozak AI combines AI-pushed predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, and decentralized finance (DeFi) to offer users with real-time monetary insights, automated trading strategies, and advanced data analytics. This approach unites it other than conventional cryptocurrencies, many of which lack a tangible use case beyond hypothesis. By leveraging AI, Ozak AI ambitions to revolutionize the way investors have interaction with the crypto market, making facts-driven decisions extra accessible and efficient.

Moreover, the 3rd stage of the Ozak AI presale is currently occurring, and the task is already making waves within the crypto community. With an outstanding over $900K raised so far, Ozak AI tokens are currently priced at simply $0.003 each, with the next level price set at $0.005. This early-level opportunity is poised for sizable growth, with projections suggesting that the token ought to reach $1 by 2025. The Road to $1: A Realistic Projection Currently, Ozak AI is in its 3rd presale stage, with the OZ token priced at simply $0.003. Given the growing hobby in AI-driven crypto solutions and the speedy adoption of blockchain-based predictive analytics, analysts are expecting that OZ should reach $1 in the near future. This could represent an outstanding 333x return for early investors, making it one of the most money making opportunities in the current crypto market. Unlike many tokens that rely simply on hype, Ozak AI is sponsored by a strong ecosystem and clear software. The growing demand for AI in financial markets, mixed with the assignment’s innovative method, gives it a great area over competitors. If adoption keeps at its current pace and the AI area keeps its momentum, Ozak AI might be among the elite 5% of cryptos that prevail, proving CZ’s caution right while solidifying its place as a chief player within the industry. CZ’s caution about the fate of 95% of cryptocurrencies is a reminder that now not all initiatives are built to remain. However, Ozak AI’s solid fundamentals, progressive AI integration, and strong market positioning make its route to $1 extra promising than ever.

Analysts predict RXS will increase by 21,990%, which has attracted investors to this developing player in the real-world asset sector. SHIB Struggles—22.27% Drop Signals the End of the ‘DOGE Killer’? Shiba Inu remained the “Dogecoin killer” until it entered a dangerous financial situation. SHIB maintained a trading value of $0.00001238 during March 2025 while showing no signs of matching its 2021 performance and faced a 22.27% monthly decline through its downward trend. Supply reduction efforts indicated by its -7.84% burn rate cannot counter the bearish market sentiment as technical indicators display negative signals. The failure of SHIB to surpass its previous peak of $0.00008616 has made retail investors doubt its ability to survive in the long term. RXS: The Future of Asset-Backed Crypto—21,990% Growth Incoming! Rexas Finance (RXS) represents a token revolutionizing the relationship between blockchain and real-world assets. The value of RXS remains stable because it links to physical assets, including gold and real estate properties, instead of relying on speculative meme coin mechanisms. RXS has achieved 91.52% presale success with its $56 million target and plans to list on major exchanges at $ 0.25 on June 19, 2025 . The analysts predict a 21,990% return for RXS by year’s end, surpassing the limited growth of SHIB. RXS: Secure, Audited, and Backed by Real Assets—The Future of Crypto Investing! RXS stands out from speculative tokens because it has audited infrastructure and security verification from Certik, which many others lack. The real-world asset tokenization process in RXS enables investors to access traditionally illiquid markets through fractional ownership of luxury real estate and precious metals. Combining real-world assets with digital tokens in RXS gives investors an investment model that reduces meme coin price volatility while offering stable and accessible wealth-building opportunities. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 RXS Set for Lift-Off—CoinMarketCap & CoinGecko Listings to Fuel Massive Growth! RXS’s June 2025 listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko will serve as the catalyst to initiate its market growth. The final presale stage sold 457.6 million tokens, demonstrating strong market demand. The analysts anticipate an upcoming price increase following the listing because institutional investors want RWAs while retail investors search for stability beyond meme coins. Conclusion SHIB maintains its status as a meme-based token, yet RXS establishes new standards for cryptocurrency investment. RXS represents the exact opposite of speculative tokens because it relies on its RWA backbone, audited framework, and strong presale momentum to become the anti-speculative token choice for investors seeking substance-based investing. Investors who want to achieve a 21,990% return in 2025 should select the future of finance rather than sticking with outdated financial practices.

42999281,https://thecoinrise.com/vitalik-buterin-teases-new-ethereum-roadmap/,1743961540,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/42999281.jpeg,Vitalik Buterin Teases New Ethereum Roadmap Amid Market Struggles,https://thecoinrise.com/vitalik-buterin-teases-new-ethereum-roadmap/,"Ethereum (ETH) recorded a challenging first quarter of 2025, marking its worst performance in seven years. Despite its market downturn, the Ethereum team is not giving up. Vitalik Buterin, the blockchain cofounder, has introduced a new roadmap to tackle some of Ethereum’s biggest challenges. This includes improving security and scalability, which are issues that have plagued the Ethereum ecosystem for years. Vitalik Buterin’s New Plans for Ethereum (ETH) Future The new roadmap, introduced by Buterin in March 2025, aims to tackle Ethereum’s biggest issues, especially scalability. The network has faced slow transaction speeds, particularly when demand increases. A well-known example of this was the Cryptokitties game in December 2017, which caused a traffic jam on the network. Now, in 2025, Ethereum still faces similar scalability problems. Ethereum has already made progress to fix this, like switching from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in 2022. Still, Buterin’s new roadmap outlines even more steps to improve scalability and network performance. A major focus of the roadmap is increasing the use of roll-ups and blobs. Roll-ups process transactions off-chain and send data back to the main network. This is to make Ethereum faster and cheaper to use. On the other hand, Blobs organize data and make roll-ups more effective. By 2026, Ethereum plans to have up to 72 blobs, significantly improving scalability. Buterin also introduced a new hybrid-proof system to make transactions faster and more secure. This system will use multiple proof methods, ensuring that most transactions are finalized quickly, with low fees and higher security. Ethereum Network Faces Backlash, Shows Resilience Ethereum has had its fair share of struggles . Many critics have called for its shutdown, and there is even a website called “Ethereum Obituaries” that tracks all the times Ethereum has been declared “dead.” Despite these setbacks, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, just behind Bitcoin (BTC). Even other networks like Solana are trying to surpass Ethereum by offering faster transactions and better scalability. Nevertheless, Buterin and his team continue to push forward with plans to improve the platform. Despite its recent price struggles and increasing competition, Ethereum remains a leader in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). In March 2025, Ethereum (ETH) outpaced Solana in trading volume, marking a big win for the network. Moreover, 53% of the stablecoin market is built on Ethereum, showing the platform’s ongoing importance in crypto. Skepticism About The Roadmap While many are hopeful about the roadmap, not everyone in the Ethereum community is convinced. Some worry that focusing too much on Layer2 solutions might not solve all of Ethereum’s problems. However, Buterin’s plan shows that Ethereum is determined to adapt and improve, showing that the platform is not ready to give up.

XRP previously exhibited potential to rule global payments, yet it trades between $5 and $0.50 in restricted price ranges as investors execute a down-or-upward trajectory prediction. Remittix (RTX) token stands out among utility tokens because it addresses practical operative needs, which raises speculation about XRP’s market leadership in cross-border transactions. XRP Struggles to Break Out Despite Legal Clarity The 2024 legal victory between Ripple and the SEC in court brought definitive clarity regarding the non-security status of XRP. The court decision about the XRP classification brought back investor confidence, causing the token price to increase dramatically. The price reached its peak settlement value, after which the momentum decreased steadily. Although volatile, XRP maintains a trading pattern near $2.09 to $2.17 while experts monitor essential price points. The price will probably experience renewed bullish strength if it breaks through $2.50; however, declining below $2 may trigger ongoing market downturns. The market has conflicting opinions, while charts indicate decision-making difficulty. The transaction activity levels of XRP have fallen below those witnessed at its peak periods. RippleNet maintains its bank partner base, but the crypto industry now features numerous newer payment-focused protocols. The XRP price rally creates a dilemma for potential investors who must choose between an expected return of $0.50 or the continued fulfillment of $5 price forecasts which analysts have maintained over the past years. Remittix Offers a New Blueprint for Cross-Border Utility XRP maintains a quest to recover previous growth, although Remittix (RTX) has emerged as its major market competition. RTX attracts investor interest due to its presale price of $0.0734 and has collected over $14.3 million through successful fundraising before its release. Remittix develops an ecosystem based on consumer needs that effectively serves individual users as well as freelancers, NGOs and small businesses instead of XRP’s target of institutional pipelines. The main service of this platform consists of converting cryptocurrency into local currency, which gets deposited directly into any supported banking account instantaneously. The product provides a smooth transition between blockchain technology and standard banking systems to eliminate international money transfer barriers that many established cryptocurrencies have failed to address. Analysts view Remittix as an early phase version of Ripple, with the exception that users have instant access since its launch. The market analysts predict that RTX can elevate up to 50x value by 2026, while the crypto sector begins its transition from hype to practical utility. A Changing Landscape for Utility-Driven Tokens The destiny of XRP reaching $5 vs. attaining $0.50 first goes beyond Ripple’s roadmap, since market changes are crucial in this scenario. The market transformation found its expression in this trend. Cryptocurrency investors have begun to abstain from past narrative-based token projects while embracing new ventures that provide validated,quick results. The new utility token category represented by Remittix is creating a complete transformation of blockchain operational strategies compared to those practiced by XRP and its institutional supporters. These tokens provide rapid onboarding and emphasize products first, along with regulatory understanding. Current investor needs require stronger market performance than they needed in the past five years. Analysts do not create this prediction about XRP reaching $0.50 prices simply for speculation. The prolonged correction of either Bitcoin or Ethereum would trigger widespread deterioration throughout the entire altcoin market sector. XRP remains exposed to negative prospects when it lacks new positive developments. Ripple’s path to reach $5 becomes achievable when it gains more central bank partnerships and expands the adoption of its ODL across underdeveloped areas, following U.S. institutions returning to the market. The Path Ahead Is Narrow — But Not Closed XRP continues to occupy an unstable position between the lowest values it formed during previous downturns and its former anticipated peak price of $5. Legally established clarity for Ripple creates some stability for the token, yet it does not shield XRP from the wider market fluctuations. What determines whether XRP reaches its predicted $5 value before seeing price drop back to $0.50 resides in market sentiment along with execution timing. The company Remittix develops new technology which is now growing commercially. XRP’s capability to address real-time needs has converted it into an extremely popular pre-sale event of this year. RTX tokens could leap higher than XRP if the latter fails to execute successful consumer-oriented applications.

Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,710.66 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price dropped over the last 24 hours towards the resistance at $580.1. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; However, the support floor at that level seems stable because the Bulls secured the level this week. In addition, the coin is now trading below the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,710.66 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB was trading near the psychological mark of $600, which it still continues to do so in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-06 18:00:22

Dogecoin Price Stabilizes as Tesla Loses $30 Billion Amid Trump’s Tariff Shock Dogecoin (DOGE) has stabilized above the $0.16 level, showing notable resilience despite broader volatility in the crypto and equity markets. After briefly dipping to $0.12 last Wednesday, following former President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of sweeping tariffs, DOGE rebounded and currently trades 4% higher from that weekly low. Dogecoin price action, April 6 | Source: CoinMarketCap DOGE resilient price performance aligns with a broader trend: top cryptocurrencies increasingly decoupling from the volatility that plagues traditional equities and commodities. Tesla Takes $30 Billion Hit as Elon Musk Faces Political Pressure Tesla (TSLA) stock has emerged as one of the most heavily impacted assets in the wake of Trump’s trade announcement. U.S. equities suffered a dramatic selloff, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging over 3,000 points and the S&P 500 falling by 8% within five trading sessions. As expected, Tesla (TSLA) stock price took a major hit due to Elon Musk’s prominent role in the Trump administration’s newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency. Tesla (TSLA) stock loses $30B after Trump’s tariff, April 6 2025 | Source: NASDAQ With the electric vehicle giant thrust into political and economic crossfire, Tesla shares currently trade at $239, down 4% on the week and 10% over the past 30 days. At a current market cap of $750 billion, over $30 billion in shareholder value has been erased since the tariffs were announced. Is Dogecoin Price Finally Decoupling from Elon Musk’s Influence? Against this backdrop, Dogecoin’s stability above $0.15 has raised questions: is DOGE beginning to decouple from Elon Musk’s influence? 1. Musk’s Influence on DOGE Is Fading Elon Musk, long seen as a de facto mascot for the Dogecoin community, has historically had influence over DOGE price action. In past years, events such as Tesla’s earnings calls, SpaceX launches, and even cryptic tweets from Musk often triggered short-term rallies in DOGE price . But recent events suggest a shift in sentiment. In January 2025, DOGE price briefly tested yearly timeframe peaks above $0.40 after Musk’s government office teased a DOGE logo on its official site. Speculation quickly spread that Dogecoin might be adopted for government-related transactions. However, Musk personally clarified last week that the administration has “no current intention” of adopting DOGE for official use—promptly quashing those rumors. 2. Trump Administration’s Crypto Strategy Excludes Dogecoin Another key factor behind Dogecoin’s decoupling from Elon Musk’s influence is Trump’s private crypto interests In March, the administration announced its “Crypto Strategic Reserve,” which conspicuously excluded Dogecoin. The move was seen by many as a sign that DOGE would not receive institutional or governmental support. Adding to the sentiment, Trump launched his own memecoins—TRUMP and MELANIA—during his inauguration. These tokens, alongside WLFI, a pro-Trump crypto PAC, have since dominated the altcoin narrative, effectively crowding out Dogecoin from the political meme coin arena. This exclusionary stance diminishes the likelihood that Dogecoin will receive direct endorsements or adoption from the current administration, despite Musk’s presence within it. 3. Dogecoin Remains Insulated from Tesla’s Trade War Risk Dogecoin’s price resilience also stems from its insulation from the economic risks now weighing on Tesla. While Tesla faces serious exposure to retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners like China and Canada—threatening its supply chain and Q2 earnings—Dogecoin operates independently of such traditional business cycles. The memecoin’s lack of ties to physical goods, manufacturing, or logistics shields it from geopolitical shocks that affect multinational corporations. As a result, DOGE appears increasingly insulated from Tesla’s financial performance and the broader trade war fallout. DOGE Price Forecast: $0.15 support cluster must Withstand Short-term Risks Dogecoin’s stable price action this week, despite Tesla losing $30 billion in market value, signals a maturing market dynamic. Investors are beginning to view DOGE as an asset less exposed to Elon Musk’s influence and more driven by its own market fundamentals. From a technical standpoint the current Dogecoin price forecast signals lean neutral-to-bearish. After a brief 5.14% recovery over three sessions the two consecutive red candles that followed now put the immediate support at $0.15 at risk. Since closing Friday at $0.16, Dogecoin struggles to hold above the 20-day EMA resistance at $0.17. This rejection at the moving average signals insufficient buying pressure to drive the next leg-up. Dogecoin price Beyond that, Dogecin trading volumes remains flat at 402.82 million DOGE, showing weak conviction from bulls. The True Strength Index (TSI) also slipped to -0.82, a clear sign of continued bearish momentum. With TSI below the zero line, a downside continuation is likely if demand doesn’t resurface soon. If bears push below $0.15, the next downside target lies at $0.142—where DOGE last found support on April 3. On the upside, bulls must reclaim the $0.17 level to target the stronger resistance cluster between at $0.20, near the 50-day EMA.

If the Oracle of Omaha is to be trusted, and his massive success rate and longevity certainly say so, then XRP investors should worry about the asset’s future price performance. Moreover, Ripple’s cross-border token has already started to correct, and its price is close to the coveted $2 support line. According to analysts, this level holds particular significance in determining XRP’s upcoming moves. A bounce-off above could propel a surge to $2.6, but the opposite scenario envisions a massive drop to $1.2/3 if it fails. 67.61% of traders on Binance Futures with open #Cardano $ADA positions are betting on a price increase! pic.twitter.com/IjgmvPF9yU — Ali (@ali_charts) April 6, 2025 The situation with ADA is quite similar, as the token has attracted a substantial wave of big bullish trades on Binance futures. Similar to XRP, Cardano’s price has tumbled by 5-6% in the past day (26% on a monthly scale), and now struggles to remain above $0.6. The current level is also an important support line that could lead to a crash below $0.5 if it’s broken to the downside. Oh, aside from Buffett, Santiment has also outlined countless times in the past that too much emotion in either direction usually leads to price moves in the opposite.
