For the players: because then they actually own their assets, the free market prices them, and they can win in real life when they win in the game. For everyone: easier global access, lower platform fees.” The optimism, however, was quickly challenged by skeptics who say the track record of GameFi speaks for itself. Roblox, not Fortnite John Wang, co-founder of Armor Labs and a former product manager at Immutable , a Web3 gaming platform, replied directly to Pollak’s post, asking, “Why would it be better for the game company for their game to be onchain?” Wang argued that games like Roblox already provide a developer-first platform with APIs for nearly every financial interaction imaginable. “I think going onchain is strictly worse for them because lower fees + worse experience,” he said. He pointed to Roblox’s deep analytics capabilities, including tagging every UI component for retention and clickthrough rates, logging every trade, and regional pricing. Pollak pushed back, noting that Roblox is not Fortnite. He continued his argument by claiming that a decade of experience working in the field has convinced him that on-chain systems can support a “more expressive and powerful set of financial and other APIs than web2 servers.” Still, Wang countered that permissioned restrictions in Web2 platforms can sometimes be better for developers and players, urging Pollak to look more closely at Roblox as a model for what sustainable gaming platforms with product–market fit actually look like. The exchange quickly drew in other voices from Crypto Twitter, many of whom pointed to the repeated failures of GameFi projects to scale or retain users. GameFi is a faltering sector The back-and-forth brought out the current realities surrounding blockchain gaming, which peaked in 2022. Since then, it has largely failed to maintain momentum. Axie Infinity , once the poster child of play-to-earn, collapsed under the weight of an unsustainable token economy and security failures. Its Ponzi-like dynamics left many players in debt when new user growth slowed. Axie Infinity’s market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap A recent analysis found that blockchain games suffer from high churn, with more than 60% of users reportedly leaving within 30 days. Other challenges plaguing blockchain gaming are the low adoption and high costs, with more gamers still hooked on gaming on Web2 platforms. In the meantime, platforms like Immutable are working on bridging both Web2 and Web3 gaming platforms by leveraging partnerships with gaming heavyweights such as Ubisoft. Critics also argue that most projects have prioritized speculative token models over the actual fun of playing games. The result has been short-lived hype cycles rather than sustainable communities. However, while progress has been slow and challenging, the GameFi industry is still growing, with a market cap of $13.2 billion. Play-to-earn games dominate the GameFi sector. Source: CoinGecko Can on-chain gaming still work? For Pollak, the ability to build “more powerful APIs” and introduce transparent, composable economies outweighs the current challenges. He also stated that on-chain systems can still incorporate permissioned restrictions when needed, countering Wang’s point about the benefits of centralized controls. Pollak’s posts may reignite new projects in the GamFi space, and maybe Pollak himself may commit resources to bring games on-chain, find solutions to their unique challenges, and scale. For now, the skeptics seem to have the stronger case as the failures of past GameFi projects loom large. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Bitcoin wallet “19D5J8”, which has been dormant for five years, transferred 3,000 BTC ($353.16 million) from its 23,969 BTC ($2.82 billion) holdings to a new wallet. The whale wallet's last transaction, on December 13, 2020, was trading at around $20,000. At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $117,000. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation-affiliated wallet 0xF39d sold 7,294 ETH ($33.25 million) at an average price of $4,558 over the past three days. The wallet previously attracted attention in June 2022 when it bought 33,678 ETH ($40.2 million) at an average price of $1,193.

Over 15250 investors have already invested in the project presale, while over $14.45 million has been raised. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Stage 6 of Presale at $0.035, or 16.67% higher than the last stage. Stage 7 will experience another 14.29% rise in price to $0.04. While DOGE’s trajectory remains tied to broader market trends and adoption currents, Mutuum Finance is trending for its yield management features and inclusion of asset lending, an area that some researchers believe can surpass mainstream memecoins in the upcoming cycle. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Long-Term Targets Within Reach as Speculation Takes Center Stage Dogecoin (DOGE), priced at $0.253 currently, is at the center of attention with experts laying out possible paths towards the $1 mark. Crypto analyst KrissPax argues that DOGE’s past 4-year cycle patterns can support a bull run to $1 or even to $2 in the later part of this year, based on its cyclical meme-cycle repetition. CoinPedia, for its part, offers the more optimistic estimate of $1.07 in 2025, based on estimated growth in trading volume, with scope for a bearish downmove to $0.62 in bear markets. More traditional CoinCodex models predict DOGE to trade an average of $0.27 in 2025 within a $0.23–$0.34 range, citing medium-upside estimates. Those figures contrast with growing interest in newer DeFi tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are attracting attention for potentially higher long-term upside. Mutuum Finance Announces Launch of Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has finished Phase 5 of its presale and has entered Phase 6, wherein its tokens on sale sell for $0.035. Its price appreciation in the future will increase the price of its tokens by 14.29% to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has so far raised over $14.45 million and over 15250 holders added. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Joins Forces with CertiK to Launch $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is collaborating with CertiK in launching Bug Bounty Program. The program will carry a reward pool of $50,000 USDT. Four categories i.e. low, minor, major and critical would be rewarded under the program. The program is the best execution of Mutuum Finance’s vision of building community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project also received a thorough audit by Certik on blockchain security and user fund protection. It is part of Mutuum Finance’s roadmap to an open institution-grade DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway where 10 users will be awarded $10,000 of MUTM tokens. It has also recently announced that a leaderboard system will reward the top 50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders bonus tokens. Mutuum Finance is a P2C and P2P lending protocol whereby high-return funds are completely owned by the customer. It is an end-to-end DeFi experience that’s highly bespoke to the customer’s needs and more secure, transparent, and flexible compared to a centralized lending product. Dogecoin aims for $1, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers greater potential in 2025. At $0.035 in stage 6, it will grow 14.29% to $0.04 at the next stage. Well more than $14.45M raised from 15,250+ investors enforces its dual lending framework, USD-pegged stablecoin, and 95.0 CertiK rating. With a $100K giveaway and $50K bug bounty, early buyers can earn good profits before the next price hike.

With institutional money flowing in at unprecedented levels, innovative blockchain upgrades rolling out, and investor confidence returning, it’s no surprise that analysts are spotlighting the top altcoins to watch — especially among layer-1 blockchain projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one new player among the giants that are seriously making noise. While the top two, Ethereum and BNB, are still taking most of the attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly positioning itself as one of the best alternative coins to get by today with a massive upside potential for those who come in first. Ethereum: The Institutional Powerhouse Nearing All-Time Highs Ethereum is once again proving why it’s the backbone of Web3 and DeFi. As of August 16, 2025, ETH is trading around $4,406, just 5% shy of its all-time high of $4,866 set in November 2021. With year-to-date gains exceeding 67%, Ethereum is drawing massive institutional attention, driven in large part by an unprecedented wave of ETF inflows. Just this month alone, Ethereum ETFs saw eight straight days of net inflows, totaling roughly $3.7 billion. On August 14 alone, Ethereum ETFs brought in over $639 million — with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust leading the charge with $520 million in a single day. Ethereum ETFs are now consistently outperforming Bitcoin ETFs in capital inflows, a clear signal of where institutional priorities are shifting. With major banks, corporations, and tech firms adding ETH to their treasuries, and over 28% of the supply now staked, Ethereum remains one of the best altcoins to buy for both short-term momentum and long-term value. BNB: Billion-Dollar Backing and Ecosystem Strength Fuel Growth If Ethereum is the institutional choice for DeFi and smart contracts, then BNB is the powerhouse of exchange-based infrastructure and adoption. In August 2025, BNB reached a new all-time high of $864 before slightly consolidating to around $840–$850. BNB’s fundamentals also remain strong. The chain now supports over 552 million wallet addresses and processes 4.5 million daily transactions. Weekly decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes top $2 billion, and the platform’s native wallet is responsible for over 82% of global crypto wallet transactions. With such an expansive ecosystem, BNB has quickly become one of the best altcoins to buy for investors betting on the continued growth of centralized and decentralized trading platforms. Analysts remain extremely bullish on BNB. Near-term targets range from $900 to $950, while long-term forecasts extend beyond $2,000 by early 2026. Speculation around a potential BNB ETF is also growing, especially given the SEC’s recent crypto-friendly tone and BNB’s structural similarity to Ethereum. Solana: High-Speed Innovation and Scalability Leadership No conversation about disruptive layer-1 blockchains in 2025 is complete without Solana. With a focus on ultra-fast transaction speeds, near-zero fees, and ongoing innovation at the protocol level, Solana continues to be one of the top altcoins to watch — especially as institutional attention shifts toward scalable alternatives to Ethereum. In August 2025, Solana implemented a series of major performance upgrades that are already reshaping the network’s throughput capabilities. The most notable is the “Alpenglow” governance proposal, which introduces new consensus mechanisms — Votor and Rotor — aimed at optimizing block propagation and validation speeds. If approved, early testing suggests the network could achieve sub-200 millisecond finality, a huge leap for real-time decentralized applications. Despite the recent market pullback, Solana is holding strong around the $190–$194 range, with significant investor confidence reflected in over $85 million in SOL outflows from exchanges — a bullish signal. The pending approval of a Solana spot ETF in the U.S. remains a key narrative, and analysts believe a green light could send SOL soaring well past its current resistance levels. With continuous innovation, active governance, and a robust developer ecosystem, Solana is clearly one of the best altcoins to buy if you’re betting on scalability and next-gen blockchain infrastructure. As it continues to expand its capabilities and attract serious institutional interest, Solana remains a top-tier layer-1 blockchain project that’s worth holding through the rest of 2025 and beyond. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Sleeper Giant Ready to Explode Often described as a mix of meme culture and serious decentralized finance (DeFi) ambition, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a leading blockchain project built for speed and financial freedom. With major announcements expected in Q4 2025, analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could easily deliver strong gains, especially if broader market momentum continues. MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned its place among the Top 3 Layer-1 blockchain projects expected to shake up the crypto market in 2025. Its strong focus on speed, low transaction fees, and innovative technology is gaining attention. As it continues to grow, experts believe it could become a major player in the space. For investors seeking the best altcoins to buy before the next leg of the bull run, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly hard to ignore. Conclusion In a year full of regulatory shifts, institutional involvement, and massive infrastructure upgrades, the crypto market is once again offering investors a chance to get ahead of the curve. While Ethereum, Solana and BNB dominate in adoption, scale, and capital flow, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the undiscovered gem — a high-upside project with the fundamentals, narrative, and momentum to deliver outsized returns. If you are a 2025 portfolio creator and are looking for the best altcoins to watch, then these layer-1 blockchain projects are the ones you should not miss out on. These projects present you with an opportunity either for a gradual growth backed by institutions or for a rapid breakthrough in the early-stage of development, so you can hardly go wrong with their picks.

After a high-visibility CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing, RUVI’s Phase 2 is 90% complete at $0.015. When it sells out, the token steps 33% to $0.020 in Phase 3, with a final presale price set at $0.070. With $3M raised, 230M tokens sold, and a holder base above 2,900, the lower-entry window is closing, and analysts say the setup could be a millionaire-maker for early backers. Why RUVI’s presale is accelerating CMC functions like crypto’s discovery engine. RUVI’s listing pushed it into trending sections and converted watchlists into buys right as supply tightened in Phase 2. Investors also like the clean price ladder, $0.015 now, $0.020 next (+33%), and $0.070 at presale close, because it rewards speed and removes guesswork. A completed CyberScope audit adds third-party credibility, while a partnership with major exchange WEEX boosts visibility and lays groundwork for smoother trading routes after the sale. A live leaderboard giveaway further nudges larger allocations as phases turn. Key milestones: $3M raised 230M tokens sold 2,900+ holders Phase 2 at 90% completion; $0.020 next (+33%) Final presale price: $0.070 CyberScope audit completed WEEX partnership announced Leaderboard giveaway live Real utility: a creator-first AI super app RUVI’s core advantage is product utility. The super app compresses the entire content lifecycle into one workspace so creators and teams can produce more with fewer tools and less time. Research trends: Identify high-demand topics across platforms to guide your content calendar. Create scripts: Generate channel-ready scripts tuned to brand voice and format (YouTube, Shorts, TikTok). Generate media: Produce images and videos natively to reduce tool sprawl and subscriptions. Streamline workflows: Plan, iterate, schedule, and publish from a single dashboard for consistent output. Who benefits? YouTubers, TikTokers, agencies, brands, and lean marketing teams that need speed, scale, and lower costs. By tying token relevance to daily creative workflows, RUVI aims to anchor demand in usage rather than speculation. Why TRX holders are moving TRX has scale, but outsized multiples are tougher at later stages. RUVI offers clear near-term catalysts, CMC-led visibility, a transparent price path, third-party audit, exchange alignment via WEEX, and real-world utility, giving early participants a cleaner shot at meaningful upside as phases flip. VIP tiers: modeled upside at a $1 valuation For larger allocations, RUVI’s VIP program illustrates how bonuses can amplify modeled outcomes if adoption scales: VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens, boosted by a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI. These are models, not guarantees, but they help explain why buyers are acting before the 33% price step to $0.020. Bottom line RUVI’s momentum is measurable: 90% through Phase 2 at $0.015, with a programmed move to $0.020 next and a $0.070 finish at presale close. Add CMC-driven discovery, a completed CyberScope audit, WEEX exchange alignment, verifiable traction ($3M raised, 230M tokens sold, 2,900+ holders), and a creator-first AI super app, and you get a high-growth story with tangible catalysts. That’s why TRX holders are securing allocations now. If you want AI exposure backed by real utility and a clear price ladder, acting before Phase 2 closes could make all the difference.

Market Psychology Shifts At Key XRP Price Targets Crypto pundit BarryC has outlined a psychological roadmap for what could happen in the broader market if XRP were to climb to significant price milestones such as $100 and $1,000. His perspective is not centered on technicals or market cap constraints but rather on how retail and institutional sentiment might evolve as the asset scales through different stages of valuation. According to BarryC’s report shared on X social media, early price moves such as $4 would likely be dismissed by many observers as insignificant. However, once XRP reaches the $10 to $15 range , a shift in sentiment begins. The analyst notes that as the token advances, some traders may feel uneasy, coping with the rally by convincing themselves that a crash is imminent and they can re-enter at lower prices. He further suggested that the turning point would come when XRP hits $100 . At this projected stage, panic could set in as disbelief grows that XRP, once thought of as a low-priced asset , could climb so high. The analyst stated that the narrative would shift from skepticism to urgency, with new buyers considering entering at levels they previously dismissed. BarryC highlighted that the climax of this psychological cycle would likely be at a $1,000 price level . Here, the analyst envisions massive FOMO dominating the market. He reveals that disbelief would give way to desperation as people scramble to buy even a fraction of what they would perceive as the only cryptocurrency being broadly utilized by banks and financial institutions worldwide. Expert Pushes Back With Market Cap Facts In contrast to BarryC’s psychological analysis, market experts like Crypto Town Podcast argue that such ambitious predictions are mathematically and economically unrealistic . The analyst’s response on X points out that if XRP were to ever hit $100, its market capitalization would surge from $185.08 billion to approximately $6 trillion. For comparison, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by value, currently holds a market cap of $2.3 trillion. At $1,000 per XRP, the projection becomes even more challenging to justify, as it would imply a whopping $60 trillion market cap. Crypto Town Podcast compares this extraordinary growth to that of gold, highlighting that the entire gold market capitalization sits roughly at $22.3 trillion. The analyst argues that it is highly improbable, if not impossible, for XRP to ever exceed gold’s market cap by threefold. The expert tempers expectations by suggesting that a more plausible long-term scenario would be XRP potentially reaching $30 , which would place its valuation near $2 trillion. Still, this outcome is seen as a distant prospect, requiring exceptional market adoption and favorable conditions.",XRP|BarryC|bitcoin|Crypto Town Podcast|fomo|gold|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-16 22:30:08

The community has turned its attention to Shiba Inu major updates like the expanding burn mechanism and Shibarium’s Layer 2 developments. These could prove critical for supply reduction and broader adoption. Alongside SHIB, investors are also eyeing new opportunities, with MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as the best altcoin to buy now. Shiba Inu: Forecasts, Major Updates, and the Battle for Recovery Analysts continue to publish bold targets for the Shiba Inu price forecast 2025. Benzinga projects a high of $0.00010 with an average of $0.00006, while Changelly estimates a maximum of $0.000059994 and an average of $0.000049995. Together, forecasts cluster between $0.00003 and $0.00010 — a strong range suggesting recovery potential. Shiba Inu burn data: Shibburn Over 3.7 million SHIB were burned in 24 hours, contributing to a total of more than 410 trillion tokens permanently removed from supply. The token is still down 85% from its October 2021 Shiba Inu all-time high, but with bullish predictions for 2025 and growing adoption, optimism is building. The ongoing debate around Shiba Inu vs Dogecoin highlights how SHIB differentiates itself with DeFi integration, NFT expansion, and more aggressive supply cuts. For long-term planners, building a future-proof portfolio ahead of the next crypto cycle and setting up accumulation strategies before the upcoming multi-year bull run are increasingly part of the conversation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investors Spot the Best Altcoin to Buy Now While SHIB price discussions dominate, a new player is attracting fresh attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being spoken about as the best crypto to buy now, thanks to its unique positioning in the meme coin space. The MAGACOIN hook is clear: while Shiba Inu fights to reclaim its all-time high, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising quickly with strong community energy and innovative tokenomics. Shiba Inu’s established brand gives it weight, but new investors are searching for upside beyond legacy meme coins. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides that early-stage excitement — earning its place in strategies where diversification is key. Final Word: Can SHIB Hit Its Targets While New Stars Rise? Reaching the Shiba Inu all-time high again would demand both adoption and consistent token burns, but the SHIB price prediction outlook for 2025 shows there’s room for recovery. Strong updates, active community support, and wider ecosystem use could help SHIB regain traction. At the same time, investors aren’t ignoring rising names. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining ground in discussions as the best altcoin to buy now, giving portfolio builders another option to consider. For those preparing for the next cycle, balancing proven names like SHIB with promising new entries like MAGACOIN could prove to be the smarter play.

More than 10,000 verified participants have already joined the presale, underscoring the strong demand for early access to one of the sector’s most talked-about new tokens. Analysts are ranking MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential 2025 moonshot altcoin , highlighting its combination of rapid capital inflows, technical foundations, and expanding ecosystem. Security and Transparency Through Audits Security remains a top priority for the project. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already completed a full audit with HashEx , providing investors with confidence in the platform’s smart contract integrity. A CertiK audit is currently in progress, with findings and reports set to be published publicly upon completion. Independent audits not only strengthen investor trust but also demonstrate the project’s commitment to transparency – a critical factor for long-term sustainability in the competitive crypto market. Funding Momentum and Community Growth The $12.5 million raised reflects both investor confidence and the project’s ability to capture market attention at an early stage. Analysts note that this capital, sourced from thousands of verified presale contributors, provides MAGACOIN FINANCE with a significant runway for development, marketing, and ecosystem expansion. The scale of participation also highlights the community momentum behind the project, often cited as a key driver in altcoin success stories like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Roadmap and Future Potential Looking forward, the MAGACOIN FINANCE development roadmap includes potential Tier 1 exchange listings , expanded features, and strategic partnerships. These milestones, while subject to market and regulatory conditions, represent important steps in broadening adoption and accessibility. Analysts argue that if executed successfully , these initiatives could position MAGACOIN FINANCE for exponential growth in 2025 and beyond. Why Newer Altcoins Can Deliver Bigger Returns One of the defining features of the crypto market is the potential for outsized returns, but those opportunities often shift over time. Established coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP offer relative security and liquidity, yet their massive market caps limit the scale of future growth. For example, doubling in value requires billions in new inflows — a far higher hurdle than smaller tokens face. This is where newer altcoins stand out. With lower initial valuations, they can move dramatically with even modest adoption or community momentum. Early backers of projects such as SEI and SOL witnessed extraordinary gains precisely because these tokens began small and captured investor imagination at the right moment. Analysts argue that today’s emerging projects, like MAGACOIN FINANCE, fit this narrative. With strong presale traction and expanding ecosystems, newer altcoins have the ability to deliver exponential upside while still in their formative stages. Of course, risks remain higher, but for investors willing to position early, the reward-to-risk profile can be far more attractive than in mature assets. Each market cycle proves the same lesson: the biggest returns often come from spotting tomorrow’s giants while they’re still small. Whale wallets have already begun accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE aggressively , pushing presale rounds to sell out faster than expected. With $12.5 million raised and allocations drying up quickly, analysts warn the window for early entry is closing fast . Once whales secure their positions, retail investors may find opportunities limited – making this one of the last chances to get in before broader adoption. Final Thoughts With a $12.5 million presale raise , over 10,000 early investors , MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most anticipated altcoins of the upcoming cycle. The combination of security audits, rewards for early investors, and a clear development roadmap sets it apart from the majority of new token launches. For investors seeking exposure to high-upside opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a 2025 moonshot candidate with the potential to deliver exponential long-term returns.

Predictions around Solana’s future are gaining traction, especially with institutional firms lining up forecasts between $350 and $520. Alongside this, many traders are scouting the best crypto to buy now, weighing Solana’s growth roadmap against other rising stars. Among those, MAGACOIN FINANCE is beginning to capture attention as a fresh project with strong upside potential. Solana Price Prediction 2025: Breaking Down the Forecasts AI-driven models and expert analysis are converging on one theme — Solana has room to grow. Multiple analysts expect the token to cross the $350 mark, with some projecting higher peaks toward $520 by year-end. The Solana price prediction 2025 rests on two key elements: institutional adoption and technical progress. VanEck’s autoregressive forecast model points to a possible market cap near $250 billion, backing its bold $520 year-end target. Meanwhile, the SEC’s final extension on Solana ETF applications — with issuers like Fidelity, Grayscale, and VanEck awaiting decisions — sets a definitive date of October 16, 2025. This timeline aligns directly with the $350 Solana at $350 forecast, creating a catalyst for market movement. For those scanning the top crypto to buy 2025, Solana continues to feature strongly thanks to its expanding ecosystem, speed, and developer activity. Hidden altcoin gems to accumulate before the next peak may exist, but Solana remains among the best altcoins for growth when factoring in institutional flows and ETF developments. Analysts believe this structure could support the Solana at $350 forecast, making it one of the best crypto to buy now for medium- to long-term investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Alternative With Stronger Upside AI predicts Solana could hit $350 by October 2025, yet analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE has even stronger upside as a future growth play. Positioned as a disruptive new entry, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum with investors searching beyond the big names. Unlike Solana, which has established itself as a top crypto to buy 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE appeals as a rising challenger with a narrative designed for long-term growth. Early backers view it as one of the best altcoins for growth, aiming to catch value before the mainstream notices. For traders looking at diversification, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an exciting alternative, especially for those positioning for the upcoming waves of altseason. Solana’s Path to $350 and Beyond The Solana price prediction 2025 narrative is gaining strength, with AI-driven forecasts and institutional projections aligning around the $350 to $520 range. The Solana growth roadmap shows clear steps toward scalability, adoption, and potential ETF-backed inflows. This makes Solana one of the best crypto to buy now and a strong contender for those focused on the medium-term market cycle. Yet, while Solana remains in focus, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a different kind of appeal — an emerging project with a rising profile that could challenge established players. For investors weighing the best altcoins for growth, both Solana and MAGACOIN FINANCE deserve attention, making them key names to watch in the next cycle.

SOL has caught attention after $40 million worth of transfers from whale wallets raised concerns about selling pressure, with $189 standing out as the key breakout level for a bullish reversal. XLM has strengthened its breakout potential after a clean move out of a bullish flag pattern. If current support levels remain intact, price targets extend toward $0.75, adding to the optimism surrounding its upward trajectory. Even with these developments, the most popular cryptocurrency analysis this quarter highlights Cold Wallet ($CWT) as the top contender. Stage 17’s $0.00998 entry compared to a confirmed $0.3517 listing locks in the largest ROI window before public trading. With $6.16M raised, more than 2 million active accounts ready at launch, and a cashback model rewarding every transaction, Cold Wallet enters the market with immediate adoption and proven utility. SOL Eyes $189 Breakout After Mass Whale Transfers Solana (SOL) is facing renewed volatility after whale wallets moved over 226,000 SOL, valued at nearly $40 million, to major exchanges such as Binance and Kraken. These transfers, tracked by Lookonchain, have stirred concerns about selling pressure ahead of the upcoming CPI inflation report. SOL is currently trading around $174.59, reflecting a 5% dip in the past 24 hours and still sitting 40% below its all-time high despite recent market gains. Trading activity has climbed 10% to $28.16 billion, showing that interest remains strong. However, the REX Osprey Solana ETF has recorded minimal inflows throughout August, raising questions about institutional confidence. Analysts see $189 as the breakout threshold. Stellar Targets $0.75 as Bullish Breakout Gains Momentum Stellar (XLM) has surged past a bullish flag pattern on the four-hour chart, opening the door for a run toward $0.75. This pattern emerged after a sharp rally from late June to mid-July, followed by a period of consolidation within a downward channel. The breakout zone between $0.42 and $0.45 has now flipped into strong support, giving buyers a clear defensive line. After retesting and rebounding from this support, XLM is holding its ground with the next targets set at $0.50 to $0.52. A decisive close above $0.52 would establish higher highs and reinforce bullish sentiment, while sustained momentum could carry the price toward mid-$0.60 levels and eventually $0.75. Cold Wallet’s Stage 17 Presale Offers the Largest ROI Window Before Listing Cold Wallet (CWT) is tackling one of Web3’s most persistent challenges, where participation often costs more than it returns. Through its CWT cashback rewards model, every interaction on the network becomes a profitable experience for users. Sending funds, paying gas fees, or swapping assets all generate rewards, creating a constant cycle of engagement and ensuring that activity stays high over time. The integration with Plus Wallet eliminates the typical cold-start issue, bringing over 2 million active accounts into the ecosystem on launch day. This ensures immediate liquidity and adoption from the moment trading begins. With $6.16M already raised in token sales and 733M coins sold, Cold Wallet enters the market with a fully funded foundation and proven interest from participants. Stage 17’s presale price of $0.00998 sits far below the confirmed $0.3517 listing price, offering early buyers an unmatched ROI potential of more than 3,400%. As this stage nears its close, the entry window for securing the largest possible price gap is rapidly narrowing. By joining now, buyers gain access to a ready-made ecosystem that is already functional, liquid, and built for scale from day one. Cold Wallet’s model positions it to bypass the post-launch struggles many projects face, replacing uncertainty with immediate adoption and sustained user engagement. Market Takeaways While Solana (SOL) presents short-term caution from whale activity and Stellar (XLM) offers a calculated breakout setup, neither matches the rare blend of scale, readiness, and ROI that Cold Wallet brings. This is a launch primed for impact, entering the market with over 2 million connected accounts, instant liquidity, and a live cashback system that rewards every transaction. At $0.00998 in Stage 17 against a confirmed $0.3517 listing, the current gap offers one of the most compelling ROI opportunities highlighted in this quarter’s most popular cryptocurrency analysis. With infrastructure complete, incentives active, and adoption secured, Stage 17 is the final deep-value entry before the market revalues Cold Wallet.

He noted that the Trump–Putin meeting delivered a productive outcome, which could fuel a positive reaction in the market if conditions remain steady. Daily Candle Shows Slight Bearish Bias, Yet Indecisive In his update, CRYPTOWZRD noted that Bitcoin’s daily candle closed slightly bearish. The analyst explained that although the close leaned to the downside, he would still consider the overall signal indecisive. Related Reading: Bull Case For Bitcoin At $300,000 Triggers After Reaching Critical Level Turning attention to external factors, CRYPTOWZRD highlighted that the recent meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska was productive. He pointed out that this development could create a favorable atmosphere in the broader crypto market, which may spill over into Bitcoin, unless the situation changes later on. At the same time, CRYPTOWZRD stressed that traders cannot overlook the traditional markets, where the weekly candle closed bearish. He described this as an early warning sign that should not be dismissed, as it may serve as a precursor to deeper corrections if unexpected developments occur. In his view, this makes it necessary to remain alert, even in the face of seemingly positive momentum elsewhere. While a productive geopolitical meeting may boost investor confidence, the bearish weekly signal in traditional markets is a reminder that conditions can quickly shift. As for his approach, CRYPTOWZRD stated that his focus remains on the lower timeframe chart formations. He believes this is where quick scalp opportunities are likely to emerge, allowing traders to capture movement without being overly exposed to sudden swings. By tracking these intraday setups, he intends to navigate the volatility while waiting for clearer signals on Bitcoin’s next larger move. Bitcoin Choppy Price Action Limits Clear Setups Rounding up his analysis, CRYPTOWZRD observed that the intraday chart for Bitcoin remained somewhat choppy and leaned bearish. He explained that price action has been confined within a relatively small range, making it less favorable for immediate trading decisions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Hits 2-Year Low As 30-Day Range Tightens He emphasized that the key level to watch on the upside is $119,500. According to the expert, a move above this threshold would shift Bitcoin into bullish territory, creating a potential long opportunity. Until that breakout occurs, he prefers to remain cautious rather than force trades in uncertain conditions. On the downside, CRYPTOWZRD noted that a break below $117,000 would signal further weakness and open the door for short positions. For now, he concluded that an ideal approach is to wait for the next decisive move before taking action.

The real challenge is identifying projects with both strong fundamentals and growing community traction. Some are already posting impressive fundraising figures, while others are building practical products and fostering active ecosystems ahead of launch. This list examines four projects currently attracting significant attention: BlockDAG, Maxi Doge, Snorter Bot, and SpacePay. While each takes a different approach to entering the market, all share the potential to deliver strong returns if their roadmaps are executed successfully. Whether it’s a major technological advantage, a memorable brand identity, or a targeted payment solution, these projects are shaping up to be part of the most popular crypto presales heading into 2025. 1. BlockDAG: $375M Raised and Accelerating BlockDAG integrates Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus and full EVM compatibility to achieve high transaction throughput, strong security, and the flexibility of smart contracts. This combination allows the project to match DAG systems’ scalability while retaining the security benefits of PoW. The approach has resonated strongly with early participants, resulting in more than $375 million raised during its presale. Over 25 billion BDAG coins have been sold, with Batch 29 pricing each coin at $0.0276. Analysts have suggested that with robust exchange adoption, a $1 price target could be possible post-launch. Community engagement and infrastructure are already well in place before the official debut. The X1 Mobile Miner App has amassed over 2.5 million active users, while more than 200,000 holders are already involved in the network. Development is thriving, with over 4,500 developers working on 300+ decentralized applications. Additionally, the sale of more than 19,000 mining units demonstrates early product traction. To prepare users for the market, BlockDAG offers a live demo trading platform that allows wallet testing and practice transactions in a risk-free environment. With 20 confirmed exchange listings, including MEXC, BitMart, LBank, Coinstore, and XT.com, and plans to enter Coinbase and Gemini, BlockDAG is combining advanced technology, active adoption, and a clear listing roadmap. It’s a frontrunner among the most popular crypto presales of 2025. 2. Maxi Doge: Meme Appeal with Built-In Utility Maxi Doge blends the playful nature of meme culture with tangible feature plans. While many meme coins rely entirely on hype, Maxi Doge’s roadmap includes token rewards, staking capabilities, and light NFT integrations to give holders reasons to stay long term. The approachable and humorous branding ensures accessibility, but beneath the fun is a more structured product vision. Its presale has attracted attention through active community events, social engagement campaigns, and loyalty incentives for holders. The low entry price helps it appeal to a broad audience, from casual crypto fans to buyers seeking upside potential coupled with planned functionality. By combining entertainment with early-stage utility, Maxi Doge is positioned to stand out among meme tokens and could prove resilient in a market where many fade after launch. 3. Snorter Bot: Designed for Speed and Ease of Use Snorter Bot is being built for those who value speed, affordability, and simplicity in their crypto interactions. Its focus is on fast, low-cost transactions within a clean, intuitive interface qualities that can appeal to both experienced traders and newcomers who prefer a smooth onboarding experience. The project’s presale is drawing interest thanks to its early buyer incentives and a roadmap aimed at increasing long-term engagement. Planned features include cross-chain compatibility to broaden network connections and a native rewards program for active users. At its current low presale pricing, Snorter Bot offers an accessible opportunity for early participation. If the team delivers on its promises, the project could emerge as a practical contender in the most popular crypto category for 2025, serving users who want both performance and simplicity. 4. SpacePay: Making Crypto Payments Effortless SpacePay is aiming squarely at the payments sector, with the goal of making cryptocurrency spending seamless across different regions and currencies. The vision is to integrate with existing payment systems so users can pay in crypto without dealing with complex conversions or multiple wallets. This focus on ease of use for both merchants and end-users addresses one of the biggest hurdles to mainstream crypto adoption. During its presale, SpacePay is offering tokens at an appealing entry price to attract early supporters. Its roadmap includes partnerships with online and offline retailers, enabling real-world purchases in crypto, as well as the launch of a mobile wallet app and integration with point-of-sale systems. While payments is a competitive space, SpacePay’s emphasis on smooth cross-border transactions gives it a distinct advantage. For those tracking the most popular crypto presales with clear utility, SpacePay’s practical payment focus makes it a noteworthy candidate. BlockDAG Extends Its Lead Each of these projects brings unique strengths. BlockDAG is far ahead in both fundraising and ecosystem preparation, backed by millions of active users and a targeted exchange rollout. Maxi Doge adds depth to meme coin appeal by planning functional features. Snorter Bot targets speed and ease, appealing to users across experience levels. SpacePay is tackling real-world payments, a critical step for mass adoption. The presale phase is often where the greatest potential lies, provided the project delivers on its roadmap. These four have distinguished themselves by taking active steps toward tangible goals before launch. For those positioning early in 2025, understanding each project’s trajectory and community engagement will be crucial. Among them, BlockDAG’s combination of cutting-edge technology, significant fundraising success, and large, engaged community places it firmly ahead in the race for the most popular crypto presales. As the market moves closer to launch windows, these projects will be the ones to watch closely.

Bitcoin has found its footing above $120,000, and altcoins are starting to stir with fresh momentum. If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the right entry point ahead of the next full-blown bull run, this might be it. While the usual giants like Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to lead, the biggest gains often come from earlier-stage plays that combine strong narratives with growing adoption. Based on market chatter, analyst reports, and early investor sentiment, here are three altcoins, including Magacoin Finance, that are climbing to the top of trader watchlists — and why each could play a defining role in the next breakout cycle. BlockDAG: A High-Risk, High-Reward Layer-1 with Bold Targets First up is BlockDAG (BDAG) — a Layer-1 project that’s turning heads with its aggressive upside projections. The token is still flying under the radar, but a growing number of analysts are pointing to its EVM compatibility and scalable architecture as catalysts for long-term growth. Some forecasts are even targeting a $1 price tag, which would represent a 55x gain from current levels — a bold call, but not unprecedented in past altcoin cycles. BlockDAG has the core features that tend to attract developers: high throughput, Ethereum tooling, and low fees. But it’s also in the phase where most of its gains (and risks) are still ahead. A few X accounts this week referred to it as the “Arbitrum of 2025,” though others cautioned about its volatility. Bottom line: BDAG offers serious potential, but it’s not for the faint of heart. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Political Underdog Altcoin Turning Into a Multi-Cycle Sleeper Then there’s MAGACOIN FINANCE — a coin many initially wrote off as another meme play, but that’s quickly building a real case as a multi-cycle contender. What started as a politically-themed token is now showing real traction with investors looking for early-stage assets backed by strong tokenomics, growing communities, and transparent audits. The project has passed its Hashex audit, and a CertiK audit is underway, bringing a degree of trust most meme coins never achieve. Its capped supply model and long-term incentives for holders — including staking rewards and unique bonus programs — have helped it attract both retail interest and early fund attention. Traders on X have started grouping MAGACOIN with early Dogecoin and Shiba Inu cycles — but with far more structure behind it. One community analyst described it this week as “a meme with a memory — and a roadmap,” suggesting that MAGACOIN could play a serious role in the 2025–2026 alt season. If MAGACOIN Finance continues on its current trajectory, some believe it could surprise the market with 10x to 30x upside, especially once major listings and influencer awareness kick in. It’s still early, but the buzz is real — and it’s growing. Solana: The Quiet Giant Setting Up for a Second Wave Last but not least is Solana (SOL) — already a blue-chip in its own right, but still seen as underpriced by many. Currently trading about 33% below its previous all-time high, SOL has a strong case for another explosive move if the broader market rallies. What’s driving the renewed confidence? A few things: Solana continues to dominate DEX volume, its developer onboarding rates are outpacing Ethereum, and new network upgrades like Firedancer are designed to further boost scalability. Meanwhile, DeFi and NFT activity on Solana is heating up again, and funds that largely ignored SOL during the 2022–2023 downturn are now quietly accumulating. While the upside on Solana might not be as extreme as smaller-cap plays, analysts believe it could 3x to 5x in a strong bull market — a huge move for a Layer-1 of its size. As one trader said in a recent Telegram group: “Solana’s no longer trying to be Ethereum’s killer — it’s just building in its own lane. And that lane is fast, cheap, and getting crowded.” Final Thoughts: The Altcoin Smart Money Is Watching The next altcoin cycle won’t be a repeat of the last one. The market is more informed, more skeptical — and more selective. That’s why coins like BlockDAG, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Solana are getting extra attention. Each one sits at a different stage of maturity, but all three are aligned with core themes investors are betting on: scalability, adoption, and early positioning. For those seeking moonshot potential, BlockDAG and MAGACOIN may deliver those 20x to 50x plays — but with higher risk. Solana offers a more established path, and may anchor portfolios seeking explosive growth without starting from scratch. No matter your approach, now is the time to start narrowing your list. Because when this market moves — it tends to move fast and in only the direction of Magacoin Finance.

His outline is broadly consistent with other highly optimistic perspectives within the XRP community, where many regard the current price of $3.06 as an early point in a longer adoption cycle. Pantoja contends that an initial rise to around $4 would not materially change the broader narrative among skeptics. In his view, critics would frame such a move as incremental rather than meaningful, and many would continue to discount XRP’s prospects. He expects sentiment to shift more noticeably if the asset trades in a $10–$15 band . At that juncture, he anticipates growing unease among sidelined participants who delayed buying; some may state they intend to re‑enter only if the price returns to sub‑$1 territory. $XRP at $4 → mocking: “lol just $4” $XRP at $10–15 → discomfort: “I’ll buy back in under $1” $XRP at $100 → panic: “It was never supposed to get this high” $XRP at $1,000 → full-blown FOMO, and supply crunch and mania. pic.twitter.com/harNxhUEry — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) August 15, 2025 This assessment aligns with earlier remarks from analyst BarriC , who argued that a sustained move into double digits would force long‑standing critics to reassess why XRP is advancing after a period of relative underperformance versus Bitcoin. According to Pantoja, a print near $100 would represent a decisive point for market psychology. He expects a broad recognition that the move is more significant than many anticipated, prompting a wave of late risk‑taking from those who previously dismissed the asset. The step into three‑digit pricing is also where some analysts connect valuation to potential utility in tokenized financial markets. Versan Aljarrah of Black Swan Capitalist has argued that pricing in the hundreds could be consistent with a role for XRP as a settlement bridge across tokenized assets and cross‑border payments. He has maintained that a low‑single‑digit valuation limits liquidity for large flows, implying that materially higher prices could be a functional requirement rather than solely an expression of speculation. $1,000 and Market Behavior Pantoja’s framework suggests that a move toward $1,000 would likely coincide with intense demand, limited available supply, and pronounced attempts by new buyers to obtain exposure. Community advocates often cite XRP’s issuance constraints and burn mechanisms as potential contributors to scarcity under heavy institutional usage. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Some projections extend even further. Crypto entrepreneur Jake Claver has claimed that, under scenarios involving large‑scale institutional settlement, XRP might need to command prices around $10,000 to support throughput at very high notional volumes. Supporters of this view argue that capacity and liquidity considerations at network scale could necessitate higher valuations, while acknowledging that such numbers remain contentious. Counterarguments and Valuation Concerns Skeptics challenge the feasibility of extreme targets. At $1,000 per token , XRP’s implied valuation would be on the order of tens of trillions of dollars, far above the capitalization of global equity markets today. Critics, therefore, regard four‑digit pricing as inconsistent with current market structure, available capital, and the pace of institutional deployment. Currently, XRP trades at $3.11 , well below the levels described in these scenarios. Nevertheless, a sizable portion of the community views present prices as an accumulation window ahead of potential future integration into broader financial infrastructure. Pantoja’s staged roadmap, spanning $4, the $10–$15 area, $100, and ultimately $1,000, offers a clear lens on how sentiment could change if XRP advances through successively higher thresholds. Supporters connect higher prices to prospective utilities in tokenized markets and cross‑border settlement, whereas critics focus on the scale implied by multi‑trillion‑dollar capitalizations.

It has moved from hype-driven sales and overpriced JPEGs to one focused on practical utility, integration, and real-world applications. But even utility is not enough to drive sales and attention. You need a powerful marketing plan. Here are our top 15 NFT marketing strategies to stand out in 2025. Where is the NFT Market Today? NFTs, or non fungible tokens , are simply digital assets based on blockchain technology, popularly Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, among others. Unlike Bitcoin and other cryptos, non-fungible tokens are non-interchangeable and represent ownership of items like art, collectibles, or virtual goods. In their early days, NFTs were synonymous with speculative hype—think Beeple’s Everydays: the First 5000 Days selling for $69.3 million or Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs fetching millions. “The Merge” by Pak is the most expensive NFT, selling for a record $91.8 million in December 2021. Many celebrities got into the trend, including Snoop Dogg, Kelvin Hart, Jimmy Fallon, Serena Williams, Justin Bieber, Shaquille O’Neal, and others. Big brands weren’t left out. Nike, Wendy’s, Louis Vuitton, Starbucks, Gucci, Adidas, Coca-Cola, Amazon, Walmart, etc., all dabbled in the NFT market. By mid-2022, however, the market crashed, with trading volumes plummeting from $24.9 billion in 2021 to a fraction of that, and floor prices for collections like Bored Apes dropping 95%. This meltdown weeded out unsustainable NFT projects, shifting focus to utility and sustainability. In 2025, the NFT market is thriving again, as July data reveals a 69% surge in NFT market cap, reaching $4.8 billion. Rather than speculation, the new NFT market is being driven by practical use cases, especially as gaming assets, which now account for 38% of total NFT volume. NFT market 2025-2029 outlook by Technavio The NFTs market capitalization is projected to reach $84.13 billion from 2025 to 2029, at a 41.9% CAGR. Why is NFT Marketing Important? 1. Visibility The target audience in the NFT market is relatively small compared to the broader cryptocurrency market. Not just that, hundreds of new NFT projects are launched every month. You could easily get lost in the noise without a solid marketing plan. 2. Trust The 90% price crash and scam-heavy 2022–2023 period eroded buyer confidence. You need to reassure your target audience by communicating your project’s roadmap, team, and long-term vision. 3. Community Back then, having a solid community was one of the top metrics buyers used to determine a good NFT project. That’s still the case even in the new NFT market setting. Good NFT marketing strategies like hosting AMAs, storytelling, and events can help you attract, engage, and retain a passionate community. 4. Highlight Utility NFT marketing is how you get to showcase your project’s real-world or digital benefits. That is how you capture attention and differentiate your projects from the thousands in the market. 5. Drive Sales Marketing and sales go hand in hand. Using NFT marketing techniques like teasers, countdowns, and behind-the-scenes content can generate the “hype” necessary for a successful drop. That’s how some projects are able to sell out faster than others. 15 Best NFT Marketing Strategies Here are our top 15 NFT marketing tips suited for the current NFT market to help your project gain visibility, trust, drive sales, and build a solid community. 1. List on Multiple NFT Marketplaces Listing on multiple NFT marketplaces allows you to spread the net wider to reach more buyers. Most of the popular NFT marketplaces today are multi-chain, including OpenSea and Magic Eden. This means that an Ethereum NFT collection launched on OpenSea can also be listed on Magic Eden, and vice versa. The same goes for non-fungible tokens on other blockchains like Base, Solana, etc. The benefit is that your project becomes visible to users of these platforms, which can result in more sales. 2. Build an NFT Community Building a community should be one of the first things to do before dropping your NFT collection. In fact, an engaged community is your most effective NFT marketing agency, per se. When your community members are passionate, they become brand ambassadors who share news, defend the project, and create a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) that attracts new buyers. All of these create organic hype and awareness, which is far more powerful and credible than any paid advertisement. Also, they are your top resource for constructive feedback, and listening to them makes them feel valued. That’s how you build trust. 3. Host Regular AMA Sessions Hosting “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) sessions is one way of grooming a solid community for your project. The benefits are far-reaching. When you host AMA sessions, usually on Discord or X (formerly Twitter), you put a face to your NFT project, demonstrating that the team is not hiding under an anonymous project. It’s also a two-way street where the community gets answers to questions and you get real-time feedback. AMAs are the best time to address concerns, share project roadmaps, and clarify utilities. 4. Collaborate With Influencers and Brands (Influencer Marketing) New NFT projects usually have limited reach on social media platforms, and it’s more difficult to grow an audience. In this case, the most effective NFT marketing technique would be leveraging crypto and NFT influencers, brands, and marketing agencies. That’s the shortcut. Partnering with well-known influencers or brands vouches for your project, and with them, you can instantly expose your non-fungible tokens to thousands or even millions of people who already trust the partner’s recommendations. It’s not just about growing followers and reaching millions. Collaborating with influencers can help you reach targeted communities. For instance, if your project is about gaming, partnering with gaming influencers brings your project in front of gamers. 5. Use Social Media Marketing At this point, it should already be clear that using social media is an indispensable NFT marketing strategy in 2025. Your target audience and potential collectors are mostly on social media platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. In order to reach them, you need to be active on there. Social media is where you get to interact and share updates on your project every step of the way. Also, you can run ads on these platforms with a marketing agency. Social media marketing is less expensive than the traditional route and can have a wider reach. 6. Try Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and NFT Advertising SEO is a much cheaper and sustainable NFT marketing strategy for driving traffic to your project outside of social media platforms. Optimizing your website, blog, and marketplace listings to rank for keywords like “NFT utility” or “Web3 gaming” on Google and Bing search engines draws more clicks. It’s also a vouch of authority and legitimacy for your project. Some of the basic SEO practices include optimizing your website structure to be fast, mobile-friendly, and easy to navigate, creating high-quality, valuable content, and adding descriptive titles and meta tags for every page and blog post on your website. 7. Submit Your NFT Collections to Digital Art Calendars NFT calendars, also known as drop listing websites, consolidate upcoming drops from various marketplaces, simplifying the search for collectors. Some of the popular ones include NFTCalendar.io , NFT Drops Calendar, Rarity Sniper, and Nifty Drops. The people browsing NFT calendars are not casual onlookers. They are either collectors, investors, or enthusiasts who are actively looking for new projects to mint. So, listing on one or more such platforms ensures the target audience finds your collection when browsing for vetted opportunities. A listing on a well-known NFT calendar can lend your project an air of legitimacy. Some of these platforms usually feature a countdown clock, which can create a sense of urgency and anticipation. 8. Use Email Marketing Email marketing may sound a bit traditional, but it’s still an effective strategy in NFT marketing. With email, you have a direct and reliable way of communicating or passing information to community members only. It basically allows you to pass important announcements, like an upcoming drop or an exclusive giveaway, exclusively to your community. Also, email marketing can help with conversion. You can craft messages with a single, clear call to action, such as “Mint Now,” “Join Discord,” or “View the Collection.” 9. Try Whitelisting Strategy Whitelisting is another important NFT marketing strategy, but there can also be downsides to it. When you whitelist your project with added perks like early or discounted access, it can create a sense of exclusivity and even FOMO (fear of missing out) among collectors. Also, whitelisting can help spread out the minting process and reduce the number of people competing at once, especially on blockchains like Ethereum, where a “gas war” can be a problem. However, you also have to make sure that the whitelisting process is not too strict, because it can inadvertently exclude some of the target audience who are unable to meet the requirements. 10. Use NFT Marketing Agencies If you have the budget or a small team lacking marketing skills, then it wouldn’t hurt to consider the services of an NFT marketing agency. NFT marketing agencies are another shortcut. They already have a finger on the pulse of the market. They know which platforms are trending on social media, which communities are active, and which strategies would be the most effective for your NFT projects. They usually have connections with influencers, communities, and platforms like X or Discord, which could give your NFT project instant access to a network that otherwise would have taken you months, if not years, to gain. 11. Launch Airdrops Airdrop is one of the most popular strategies that crypto and other digital asset projects use to grab attention. You can incorporate that, too, in your NFT marketing checklist. You can use airdrops to reward early adopters, your community members, and even get people to perform certain tasks. A well-promoted airdrop campaign can create a buzz that will lead to a surge in social media mentions, community sign-ups, and website traffic. Airdrops are not just about rewards. You can use it to add value to your NFT project and community. In 2021, Bored Ape Yacht Club famously airdropped “Mutant Serums” to their NFT holders, fueling the project’s hype and engagement during the NFT market’s speculative peak. BAYC Mutant Serums 12. Create Digital Assets Gamification Campaigns Gamification is one important NFT marketing technique to drive sustained engagement on your project. You don’t necessarily have to build a full-fledged game, but you can adopt some game mechanics, such as points, leaderboards, quests, and rewards, to create an interactive experience that motivates people to continually participate in your project. You can start by hiding clues or puzzles across your social media channels, website, and Discord server. The first people to solve the puzzles or find the hidden objects win a prize, such as a rare NFT, a whitelist spot for an upcoming drop, or a valuable cryptocurrency token. 13. Leverage a DAO DAO means a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). They are very influential in Web3, and leveraging them is somewhat of a unique NFT marketing strategy to tap into engaged communities. Having a DAO is also the ultimate form of community building. With it, you give your NFT holders the right to vote on proposals. They go from being collectors to co-owners, which gives a genuine sense of ownership and agency. A project governed by a DAO is inherently more sustainable because its direction is not dependent on a single founder or team. Crypto traders seem to love the idea of “community-run.” 14. Use Cross-Promotion With Other NFT Creators Cross-promotion is a marketing tactic where two different NFT projects work together to promote each other. It’s a “win-win” situation for both. We saw this happen a lot during the NFT market frenzy, where new and upcoming projects partner with well-performing ones, which is seen as a vote of confidence. In return, the new projects give exclusive whitelist access to members of the other community. There are many ways to execute cross-promotion. You can either try joint AMA sessions, giveaways, a limited-edition airdrop, or narrative collaboration. 15. Offer Staking or Reward Programs NFT staking is a process where a holder “locks” their non-fungible tokens in a smart contract for a set period to earn rewards. It is similar to staking cryptocurrencies, where users lock up their tokens to support a blockchain network and earn passive income. Staking adds tangible utility to your NFTs and gives the target audience a reason to buy and hold for the long term. It’s a good way to reduce the number of non-fungible tokens on the market and create a more stable “floor price.” Conclusion The NFT market is not dead, as data has shown it’s thriving and could reach $84.13 billion in market capitalization by 2029. However, the new NFT market dynamics have changed from what they used to be in 2021. The market is more mature and focused on utility, sustainability, and real-world applications. So, your NFT marketing plans should be built around this shift. If you intend to build a loyal community, you should consider NFT marketing plans like hosting regular AMAs, social media marketing, airdrops, and creating a DAO. If the goal is to boost, then cross-promotion, whitelisting, and collaborating with influencers should be on your bucket list of things to do.

Ronin, the sidechain best known for powering Axie Infinity, has announced its migration back to Ethereum Layer-2 networks. This move is designed to improve scalability, security, and interoperability—three critical factors for sustaining long-term adoption in the rapidly growing blockchain gaming industry. Amid these headlines, investor enthusiasm is heating up for presales, with MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as one of the most sought-after early-stage opportunities. The project has already surpassed $12.5 million in presale funding, highlighting just how much appetite there is for exposure to high-upside altcoins ahead of the next market rotation. Ronin Returns to Ethereum Layer-2 Ronin was originally created as a custom sidechain to serve Axie Infinity’s massive player base, providing faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum’s mainnet. However, the shift back to Ethereum Layer-2 solutions signals a new chapter for the network. By leveraging Ethereum’s established ecosystem and recent scaling advancements, Ronin aims to deliver a more secure and efficient gaming infrastructure. This migration reflects a broader trend of projects moving closer to Ethereum after experimenting with independent scaling solutions. With Ethereum’s rollup technology and modular design gaining traction, Layer-2 networks are becoming the preferred path for long-term sustainability and institutional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE Starting Momentum While Ethereum’s Layer-2 momentum captures headlines, early investors are turning their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE. The presale has become one of the hottest opportunities in 2025, crossing $12.5 million raised in record time. Analysts note that this kind of demand is rarely seen outside of meme coin frenzies, but what sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its structured ecosystem and long-term vision. The project has been compared to the early stages of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, where early movers enjoyed extraordinary gains. Forecasts suggest that $2,500 invested today could potentially multiply into $195,000 if MAGACOIN FINANCE follows similar breakout patterns. Such projections have placed the project firmly on the radar of forward-looking investors seeking the next big winner in altcoins. Why Ronin’s Move Matters for Ethereum Ethereum continues to assert itself as the central hub for decentralized finance, gaming, and tokenized assets. The return of Ronin reinforces Ethereum’s Layer-2 dominance and could spark similar migrations from other independent chains struggling to balance scalability and adoption. For investors, this highlights Ethereum’s unmatched ability to attract liquidity, projects, and developer activity even in the face of rising competition. If this trend accelerates, Ethereum Layer-2 networks may not just complement Ethereum but effectively become the backbone of blockchain gaming and high-frequency transactions. That long-term narrative is drawing capital from institutions, retail investors, and developers alike. Conclusion Ronin’s migration back to Ethereum Layer-2 underlines Ethereum’s growing strength in scalability and interoperability, setting the stage for broader adoption in gaming and beyond. At the same time, presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are proving to be a magnet for investor demand , with its $12.5 million raise underscoring the scale of interest. With forecasts hinting at exponential upside potential, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could emerge as one of the standout performers of this cycle .

50205300,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78782,1755388824,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Expert: This is the Hardest XRP Bull Market Ever, We Will Get Rich",https://timestabloid.com/expert-this-is-the-hardest-xrp-bull-market-ever-we-will-get-rich/,"Market analyst Steph has stated that XRP is undergoing its most difficult bull phase so far, but one that still has the potential to deliver significant returns. His comments follow the token’s renewed strength above the $3 mark . XRP briefly reclaimed this level in January 2025, the first time in seven years, before falling back below it and encountering repeated resistance. By mid-July, however, it had successfully regained the $3 threshold and had since established it as support, a development many observers view as technically favorable. Breakout From a Long-Term Trendline Steph’s analysis relies on the weekly chart, where XRP recently broke through a long-term descending trendline. This is the hardest #XRP bull market ever. Congratulations if you're still here. We will get rich! pic.twitter.com/cLltUs7MQj — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 12, 2025 He explained that such breakouts have historically preceded substantial price movements, although he described the current cycle as the hardest because it comes after extended consolidation and multiple failed attempts, conditions that often challenge market participants’ patience and risk tolerance. Historical Price Behavior Since 2022 The behavior of XRP around descending trendlines has been consistent since 2022. After the Terra market collapse in May of that year, the asset entered a prolonged downtrend. A breakout in September 2022 ended this stretch, carrying the price toward $0.55. Another descending line formed as XRP retreated from that level, remaining in place until July 2023. The favorable outcome in the SEC’s case against Ripple coincided with a breakout that pushed XRP to around $0.94. When the price later fell from that peak, it again established a downward structure, which persisted until the U.S. elections in November 2024. The subsequent breakout fueled a rally that culminated in a high of $3.4 in January 2025. Following this January peak, XRP declined and entered a five-month consolidation period around $2. This created yet another descending trendline, which was broken when the asset rallied above $3 in July. Steph regards this move as crucial, arguing that sustained closes above $3 confirm the breakout and strengthen the outlook for further gains. Conversely, a decisive loss of this level would weaken the bullish case and reintroduce the risk of $3 acting as resistance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts Set Target at $14 Steph projects that XRP could reach as high as $14 in this cycle. From the current price of $3.12, this would represent a gain of about 348%. He has congratulated those who held their positions through the initial reclaim of $3, noting that they are best positioned to benefit from a possible continuation. He has also reiterated his long-standing forecast, first outlined last November, that XRP could climb to $14 and that investors should consider preparing for such an outcome. Steph is not alone in this view. Earlier this year, the pseudonymous analyst Papa emphasized that XRP appeared to be “screaming higher” even while trading at $2, using Fibonacci targets to project a rally toward $14. Similarly, analyst JD suggested in March that $14 should be considered a minimum target for the ongoing market cycle. XRP’s repeated history of breaking descending trendlines and rallying afterward has created cautious optimism among analysts. The July reclaim of $3 is seen as a decisive step, and as long as this level holds, the technical structure supports the possibility of further upside, with $14 emerging as the dominant target.

50205404,https://thecoinrise.com/why-cold-wallet-could-be-next-big-crypto-as-toncoin-eyes-47-and-ethereum-surges/,1755388852,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50205404.jpeg,Why Cold Wallet Could Be Next Big Crypto As Toncoin Eyes $47 And Ethereum Surges,https://thecoinrise.com/why-cold-wallet-could-be-next-big-crypto-as-toncoin-eyes-47-and-ethereum-surges/,"In a market filled with speculation, three tokens stand out for different reasons. Toncoin (TON) market analysis shows a broad forecast, ranging from $2.38 to as high as $47. Ethereum (ETH) price surge is breaking key resistance with a possible path to $5,000. At the same time, Cold Wallet is solving adoption challenges before its official launch. Toncoin’s edge comes from Telegram’s billion-user base and in-chat token utility, creating a rare retail gateway. Ethereum’s momentum, boosted by institutional interest, continues to secure its role as the foundation of Web3. However, Cold Wallet enters with an advantage that neither TON nor ETH currently offers. It has 2 million preloaded users from the Plus Wallet acquisition, a cashback model that converts fees into rewards, and a Stage 17 presale price of $0.00998 against a $0.3517 listing price. For anyone asking what is the next big crypto, CWT combines adoption with visible upside. Toncoin Forecasts Range From $2.38 To $47 Toncoin (TON), the native token of Telegram’s network, trades around $3.40 today. Predictions differ widely. CoinDCX expects it to reach $43 to $47 by late 2025, supported by growing Telegram activity and better developer tools. Other cautious forecasts expect it to land between $3 and $14. CoinCodex places its range between $2.38 and $9.48. The broad spread shows both the risk and opportunity. The ability for Telegram users to send, stake, and use TON within chats adds real-world use. Investors may see value here, as TON’s integration into a billion-user platform makes it one of the few tokens with built-in mass adoption potential. If you are considering what crypto to invest in, TON’s forecast spread and live use case make it worth tracking. Ethereum Breaks Out: Is $5K Next? Ethereum has moved through major resistance points and entered a fast discovery stage, which could push it beyond $5,000 soon. Analysts argue that this breakout marks strong momentum and signals the chance for new record highs. This makes now an important moment to watch closely. Moving out of its past trading range could trigger a rapid rally. While all crypto carries risk, entering during a breakout phase allows traders to capture upside earlier. If you are searching for a play with strong price action, Ethereum (ETH) price surge suggests it may be heading for another big milestone, possibly beyond $5K. Cold Wallet Converts Crypto Costs Into Rewards As Stage 17 Nears $0.00998 Cold Wallet is tackling one of crypto’s biggest hurdles: the cost of using the network. For everyday users, gas charges, swap fees, and cross-chain costs remain barriers. Cold Wallet changes this by turning those costs into a system of rewards. Each transaction adds fuel for more activity, creating a cycle that keeps users engaged while building capital flow. Supporting this design is the Plus Wallet acquisition, which brings over 2 million users and instant liquidity from day one. With $6.2 million already raised, Cold Wallet enters the market fully prepared and ready to expand. Stage 17 of the crypto presale holds a $0.00998 price, still far below its fixed $0.3517 listing, leaving room for growth. Unlike most projects that start with no users, Cold Wallet launches with both infrastructure and a built-in audience. The mix of immediate adoption, proven utility, and discounted entry makes this presale one of the strongest setups for 2025. For those seeking a project that solves real problems and holds big potential, this chance may not stay open for long. Why Cold Wallet’s Stage 17 Setup Outshines TON And ETH In 2025 Toncoin (TON) market analysis points to promise, but forecasts remain wide and rely on the speed of Telegram adoption. Ethereum (ETH) price surge shows strength, but its gains depend on lasting institutional demand. Cold Wallet, by contrast, enters fully funded with $6.2 million secured, millions of users ready, and a cashback model that addresses crypto’s long-standing pain points. This is not a guess it is already working. The Stage 17 presale price of $0.00998, far below the $0.3517 listing, gives investors rare value while asking what is the next big crypto . While TON and ETH chase growth with uncertain outcomes, CWT begins with both a live user base and liquidity. In a market where delivery will matter more than hype, Cold Wallet is set not only to join the next phase of crypto growth but to help shape it.

The most promising crypto picks aren’t always the largest by market cap, they’re the ones that combine solid fundamentals, active communities, and near-term catalysts capable of sparking sharp rallies. Right now, a few standouts are in a prime position for meaningful upside, yet their potential isn’t fully reflected in current prices. From presales close to exchange launches to networks approaching technical breakouts, these projects are set for possible major moves. Here’s a closer look at four worth watching: BlockDAG, ADA, LINK, and XRP. 1. BlockDAG: Massive Presale with Big Exchange Goals BlockDAG has gained attention for its hybrid Layer-1 architecture, blending a Directed Acyclic Graph framework with Proof-of-Work and full EVM compatibility. This combination allows for fast transaction speeds, high security, and robust smart contract capabilities. The project’s presale is a key driver of interest, having raised over $375 million and sold 25.3 billion BDAG coins across 29 batches at $0.0276 per coin. Early buyers from Batch 1 are up about 2,660%, while current investors could see an 81% increase if the coin lists at $0.05. Analysts believe major exchange listings could eventually push BDAG toward $1, significantly multiplying returns for early participants. Its ecosystem is already thriving: the X1 Mobile Miner App has 2.5 million active users, more than 4,500 developers are building 300+ decentralized apps, and 19,300 mining units have been sold, with over 200,000 holders onboarded before launch. With confirmed listings on 20 exchanges and ongoing efforts to secure a spot on Coinbase and Gemini, the project could see a surge in demand. For many traders, BlockDAG is the most promising crypto to keep an eye on. 2. LINK: ICE Collaboration Fuels $30+ Target Chainlink (LINK) is trading around $24.05, with recent highs of $24.55 and lows of $23.31. It has been one of the stronger performers in the top 50, buoyed by whale buying, the Chainlink Reserve token buyback initiative, and a notable partnership with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. From a technical perspective, LINK has broken past key resistance at $19 and remains steady above $20, with support between $18 and $20. Analysts are eyeing short-term targets around $30, with some projecting as high as $95 if momentum sustains. The network’s Total Value Secured in DeFi has reached $95 billion, underscoring its critical role in blockchain infrastructure. With institutional partnerships and strong market structure, LINK holds its place as one of the most promising crypto investments available. 3. ADA: ETF Speculation & Whale Activity Boosting Strength Cardano (ADA) trades near $0.908, with recent price swings between $0.834 and $0.915. The trend has been bullish, supported by a golden cross and significant whale accumulation, with around 200 million ADA added to large wallets recently. Adding to the momentum, Grayscale has filed for a spot Cardano ETF, which could broaden accessibility for U.S. investors if approved. Analysts see potential for ADA to reach $1.50 if it can clear resistance at $1.10, with strong support holding near $0.70. Its long-term development roadmap and expanding ecosystem add to investor confidence. This mix of technical strength, large-scale accumulation, and possible ETF approval makes ADA a top candidate among the most promising crypto picks for the coming months. 4. XRP: Regulatory Clarity & Technical Base XRP is currently priced near $3.29, trading between $3.21 and $3.32. The big development is the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, which ended with a $125 million fine. This resolution removes a long-standing uncertainty and positions XRP for greater institutional adoption. The announcement triggered a more than 12% surge, lifting the price above $3.20 before stabilizing. Charts indicate strong support around $3 and resistance between $3.30 and $3.60. Some forecasts suggest a potential climb toward $4 in the mid-term. Technical analysts also point to a 7-year double bottom pattern, which could support a larger breakout. With legal clarity and a steady accumulation phase, XRP has re-emerged as one of the most promising crypto opportunities to watch. Evaluating the Most Promising Crypto Finding the most promising crypto isn’t about chasing short-lived hype, it’s about identifying projects with strong fundamentals and catalysts the market hasn’t fully priced in. BlockDAG offers a major presale, large community, and the possibility of high-profile listings. ADA has whale interest and ETF potential on its side. LINK is leveraging institutional deals and technical momentum. XRP now enjoys regulatory clarity and the potential for a technical breakout. Each of these projects has a unique path forward, but all share the possibility of delivering substantial returns to investors who position themselves before the next major market shift.

XRP’s breakout above a multi-year resistance level and Solana’s surge in liquidity are fueling a wave of optimism that could mark the start of a new altcoin rally. With institutional interest growing and retail investors looking for the next big opportunity, eight altcoins are emerging as top contenders for massive ROI potential. 1. Solana (SOL): Institutional Momentum Builds Solana continues to dominate headlines with its rising liquidity and growing use in tokenization projects. Major banks and financial institutions are tapping into its network for real-world asset applications, while technical improvements like the Alpenglow protocol enhance performance. If institutional adoption keeps accelerating, analysts believe SOL could be on track for new all-time highs in this cycle. 2. XRP: Breaking a Multi-Year Barrier After years of stagnation, XRP has finally pushed through a crucial resistance level. The move has reignited bullish sentiment, helped by growing regulatory clarity and whale accumulation. As adoption of its cross-border payment use case expands, XRP’s breakout could be just the beginning of a larger rally. 3. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Presale Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly risen to prominence with one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. Investors are eyeing it as a high-growth opportunity, with whale accumulation signaling strong confidence in its long-term trajectory. Market experts highlight MAGACOIN as a standout ROI contender this cycle, comparing its potential to early-stage breakout projects from previous bull runs. 4. Chainlink (LINK): The RWA and DeFi Backbone Chainlink is strengthening its position as the leader in decentralized data feeds. Its involvement in real-world asset tokenization and the launch of new features like Chainlink Reserve have reinforced its dominance. Market analysts suggest LINK could rally toward $100 by 2025 as its adoption deepens across DeFi and institutional finance. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): Expanding Ecosystem Avalanche is rapidly building momentum through its subnet architecture and enterprise-grade integrations. With strong developer engagement and institutional partnerships, AVAX has the foundation for significant growth. A breakout above key price levels could push it back into the spotlight as one of the most scalable networks in the industry. 6. Litecoin (LTC): Veteran Player with Staying Power Often considered the “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin remains a reliable choice in altcoin portfolios. Its proven track record, low transaction costs, and enduring presence in the market provide stability. As altcoin momentum rises, LTC could see renewed interest as investors seek established assets with upside potential. 7. Cardano (ADA): Long-Term Builder Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem through steady, peer-reviewed development. Known for its emphasis on scalability and sustainability, ADA has a strong base of developers and projects building on its network. Its measured approach may result in slower price action, but long-term fundamentals position it for growth as adoption increases. 8. HYPE (Hyperliquid): Speculative Moonshot For those seeking higher-risk plays, HYPE has emerged as a strong contender. The altcoin recently broke out of a bullish technical setup, generating buzz among short-term traders. Its volatility is extreme, but in the current market environment, many believe it could deliver extraordinary gains if momentum continues. Final Takeaway With Solana’s liquidity expansion and XRP’s breakout signaling renewed bullish momentum, the altcoin market appears primed for a major upswing. Established networks like Solana and Avalanche continue to push boundaries, while promising new projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing investor attention as potential multi-bagger opportunities. In a market where timing is everything, these eight altcoins are being closely watched as top contenders for explosive ROI potential in 2025.

Analyst’s August-September Prediction,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-and-crypto-market-to-crash-analysts-august-september-prediction/,"According to a new technical analysis, Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market could be mirroring historical post-halving cycle patterns. While the market has previously rallied through July and August, historical fractals point to a potential crash in September, followed by a push into a cycle peak later in the year. Related Reading: Trump Coin Jumps 10% On Canary Capital ETF Filing: Details September Proves Risky For Bitcoin And Crypto Market A recent X social media post by crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has highlighted a recurring pattern in Bitcoin’s price action that could have significant implications for the market over the coming months. His analysis shows that Bitcoin has consistently followed a post-halving cycle that exhibits distinct seasonal price movements, particularly around July, August, and September. The chart shared by Cowen illustrates that in previous cycles, Bitcoin has often rallied in July and August, fueling optimism and strong market sentiment. However, each time this has been followed by a September crash, leading to a reset before the final push toward the cycle top, which usually arrives in the last quarter of the year. According to the analysis, this repeating structure is not unique to a single cycle but has appeared across multiple past cycles, giving weight to the expert’s argument that history could be repeating. In 2013, 2017, and 2021, Bitcoin’s price behavior followed this pattern almost identically, showing strength in mid-summer and weakness in September. After a final rally to a peak, each of these cycles was eventually followed by an extended bear market phase, during which valuations corrected sharply from their highs. Based on Cowen’s report, the current cycle appears to be unfolding the same way, as Bitcoin already displayed strength in July and August this year, sparking concerns that a September pullback could be approaching. BTC Cycles Suggest Market Still Has Room To Grow A new technical analysis by crypto market expert TechDev also reveals a recurring pattern in Bitcoin’s long-term price cycles, arguing that, contrary to popular belief, the current market may still be far from its peak. The analysis, supported by a historical chart of BTC’s performance, shows that every market top has consistently occurred around 14 months after a specific cyclical signal. The chart outlines multiple Bitcoin cycles dating back to 2011, with tops and bottoms clearly marked with green and red indicators. Each upward run is followed by a significant correction and then a recovery accumulation phase. The data also revealed that each cycle top often aligned with a measured time frame of approximately 420 days. Related Reading: Chainlink Breaks 3-Month High Amid Record 2025 Enthusiasm Based on this model, current projections show that Bitcoin still has room to run. The most recent green marker on the chart signals that the market could already be transitioning out of its corrective phase.

Pi Network’s charts are hinting at a possible price rebound, and Uniswap is working on a governance-friendly legal model. Still, BlockDAG ’s dual-sport strategy gives it a unique market advantage. By building visibility in both U.S. rugby and cricket’s global fan base, the project is bridging markets in a way few can replicate. With $374M raised, over 24.7B coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29, priced now at $0.0276, BlockDAG’s momentum goes well beyond its numbers. Sports Partnerships Fuel BlockDAG’s Global Expansion BlockDAG is rolling out a sports-focused approach designed to secure attention across both North America and major international markets in one coordinated move. In the U.S., its partnerships with rugby franchises connect to a sport gaining momentum, boosted by increasing television coverage, packed stadiums, and strong community-driven engagement. On the other side, cricket alliances open the door to more than a billion fans across South Asia, the U.K., Australia, and other cricket-focused regions, audiences known for their passion and loyalty. This strategy ensures BlockDAG’s reach is not limited to a single demographic or location. Rugby offers a direct route into the North American market, which has high levels of crypto adoption and a growing appetite for innovative digital products. Cricket, meanwhile, delivers a massive international stage, particularly in mobile-first economies where blockchain-based fan tools, such as NFTs, exclusive digital content, and interactive voting systems, can translate into immediate and sustained adoption. On the financial side, the foundation is rock solid. BlockDAG has already raised $374M, sold 24.7B coins, and achieved a 2,660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29, with the current batch 29 price set at $0.0276. This substantial backing allows for a consistent presence in both markets, combining targeted regional entry with broad-scale visibility. The result is a growth plan built to convert sports passion into lasting blockchain engagement worldwide. Pi Network Charts Hint at Big Breakout Pi Network’s price charts are showing early signs of a potential rally, with multiple bullish formations emerging. On the 12-hour chart, a double-bottom pattern has developed near $0.40, with the neckline close to $1.66. If the move completes, it could open the door to a 154% jump. A descending wedge pattern is also present, often seen as a bullish setup as the range tightens before a breakout. Momentum signals add weight to the case. The RSI has climbed from an oversold 19.7 to around 52, reflecting improved buying strength. Meanwhile, the Percentage Price Oscillator has made a bullish crossover, hinting at a possible trend shift. If resistance levels break, this alignment of technicals could lead to higher price action, with buying activity likely picking up in the process. New Framework Could Streamline Uniswap Operations The latest Uniswap update centers on a proposal from the Uniswap Foundation to establish DUNI, a legal entity based on Wyoming’s Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association framework. The aim is to protect governance participants from liability while keeping decision-making decentralized. Under this plan, the Foundation would act as a ministerial agent, allowing the DAO to sign contracts, handle tax matters, and work with service providers without changing its on-chain governance. The proposal also sets aside 16.5M UNI to fund compliance efforts and create a legal defense reserve. By introducing a structured legal base, Uniswap is preparing for smoother protocol upgrades and the potential for fee distribution, while giving participants more confidence in engaging long-term. Final Thoughts From Pi Network’s chart setups to Uniswap’s governance framework, each project is paving its way forward. But BlockDAG’s sports-linked approach stands out for its blend of regional focus and worldwide visibility. With rugby anchoring its U.S. presence and cricket tapping into global fan engagement, BlockDAG is positioned to turn attention into adoption at scale. Backed by $374M in funding, 24.7B coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29, it pairs market reach with the capital strength to execute long-term growth. This combination makes its strategy one built not just for attention, but for sustained expansion.

Bitcoin’s dominance is starting to ease as institutional flows and retail momentum increasingly rotate into high-potential projects. Among the names at the top of expert lists are Solana, XRP, and the fast-emerging MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project that many believe could rival early-stage success stories of previous cycles. Solana’s Breakout Momentum Solana has become one of the most talked-about networks of 2025. Its rapid transaction speeds and growing developer base continue to attract strong attention from the DeFi and NFT sectors. The token has recently broken past key resistance levels, with analysts now forecasting potential upside to the $300–$460 range if momentum holds. Institutional filings for a spot Solana ETF in the U.S. are also fueling speculation that mainstream adoption could come sooner than expected. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction Alongside these established names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most promising new opportunities. The project has already gained momentum in its presale, with high demand and limited supply creating strong scarcity pressure. Analysts note that early participants could see dramatic upside if MAGACOIN FINANCE follows a similar trajectory to past breakout tokens. With a growing community and early adoption buzz, many are calling it a must-ow n for investors looking for multi-year returns. XRP’s Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Push After years of uncertainty, XRP is benefiting from the legal clarity that followed its settlement with the SEC. Institutional products are starting to take shape, including futures trading and ETF applications, which could significantly boost liquidity. Analysts now project XRP could reach between $3.50 and $5 by the end of 2025, positioning it as one of the strongest performers of the cycle. The Bigger Picture for Altcoins What makes 2025 different is the convergence of institutional infrastructure, retail enthusiasm, and project maturity. Solana and XRP are delivering strong fundamentals and regulatory progress, while MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the speculative early-stage opportunity that often defines a bull cycle. Together, they highlight why analysts believe altcoins will be at the center of the next wave of crypto adoption. Conclusion Altcoins are once again driving the narrative in 2025. Solana’s ecosystem strength, XRP’s institutional tailwinds, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum are positioning them as leaders of this market cycle. For investors aiming to capture the upside of the coming bull run, these three projects are at the top of expert watchlists.

From high-energy presales to billion-dollar DeFi leaders, these names show that utility, strong fundamentals, and sustained growth still lead the way. One crypto, Cold Wallet ($CWT) , is capturing attention with a presale that has already raised over $6.16 million, while Hyperliquid continues to lead blockchain fee revenue with exceptional performance. Solana has pushed past the $200 level, reigniting optimism, and Ethereum’s rally has analysts raising year-end forecasts. In a market where trends shift quickly, these four are not just holding ground but expanding their influence. Whether the focus is on ROI, adoption, or innovation, they stand out as prime examples of leadership in the current cycle. 1. Cold Wallet ($CWT): Cashback Utility and Instant User Base Drive Growth Cold Wallet is reshaping how crypto wallets operate, and the numbers back it up. Now in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998 per CWT, the project has raised over $6.16 million with momentum building as launch nears. Instead of letting gas, swap, and bridge fees eat into portfolios, Cold Wallet rewards users in CWT for everyday transactions, making it a utility-focused platform from day one. Its growth accelerated with the $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, instantly adding more than 2 million users to its ecosystem. Achieving this scale before launch gives Cold Wallet an edge, especially as competitors like MetaMask and Trust Wallet face user experience criticism. With tiered presale pricing, each stage raises entry costs and narrows the current 3,400%+ ROI potential. Positioned as a top bullish crypto for 2025, Cold Wallet offers an earning model, liquidity, and adoption strategy already in motion before it even lists. 2. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Dominating DeFi Revenue and Market Share Hyperliquid has emerged as one of DeFi’s strongest players, recently capturing 35% of all blockchain fee revenue, totaling about $97.7 million in July. This performance surpassed both Ethereum and Solana in fee generation. Its derivatives protocol has seen open interest soar to $15.3 billion, marking a 369% year-to-date increase, helped by its integration with Phantom Wallet. The token’s fundamentals remain appealing, with $4 million in daily buybacks creating steady demand. Trading currently hovers between $46.72 and $47.46, with the next price target projected at $54 to $55. A record deposit into Hyperliquid has fueled speculation of an imminent all-time high, keeping sentiment firmly in the bullish camp and securing its place as a top bullish crypto. 3. Solana (SOL): Leveraging Institutional Demand and Ecosystem Strength Solana continues to strengthen its position as a top bullish crypto, recently breaking above the $200 mark and sparking renewed investor enthusiasm. If current momentum holds, analysts see room for the price to move toward $250 and potentially as high as $350. On-chain activity is thriving, with total value locked reaching multi-year highs. Institutional participation is also climbing, with Solana-based funds recording $8.9 million in inflows last week even as broader crypto products saw $415 million in outflows. While some user activity has shifted to newer platforms like Hyperliquid, Solana’s core ecosystem remains robust. Strong technical performance, deep liquidity, and rising market sentiment all point toward continued upside potential. 4. Ethereum (ETH): Upgrades and ETF Flows Fuel Bullish Momentum Ethereum has reasserted itself among 2025’s top bullish crypto, climbing 41% over the past month compared to the broader market’s 9% gain. Now trading near $4,690, ETH’s rally is being fueled by optimism over potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the introduction of the U.S. “Genius Act” stablecoin framework, and increasing institutional inflows through ETFs. Upgrades like Pectra are enhancing transaction efficiency, further supporting long-term growth prospects. Analysts at Standard Chartered have raised their year-end target to $7,500, with an ambitious $25,000 forecast by 2028. However, whale selling of roughly $88 million in ETH could lead to short-term cooling before the next move higher, providing opportunities for strategic accumulation. Final Thoughts From innovative presales to dominant DeFi platforms and high-performance blockchains to established smart contract leaders, these projects showcase the strength of 2025’s top bullish crypto picks. Cold Wallet is redefining wallet economics ahead of its exchange debut, Hyperliquid is climbing to the top of DeFi revenue charts, Solana is holding firm above $200, and Ethereum is advancing with key upgrades and institutional backing. In a market where leadership can change quickly, their current momentum, adoption patterns, and strong sentiment point to lasting impact. For those seeking innovation with growth potential, watching these four could offer both strategic insights and profitable opportunities.

In a recent update, EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a prominent analyst, emphasized the importance of adopting a long-term outlook when evaluating XRP. He cautioned against panicking over minor price fluctuations, arguing that discipline and patience are critical in navigating this stage of the market. His post highlighted the diversity of his audience, ranging from professionals in medicine, aviation, and engineering to entrepreneurs and everyday workers, while making the case that the same principle of avoiding emotional reactions to short-term moves applies to all. #XRP – MACRO Perspective: Stay Calm & Focused ! I know many of you are new to this space, whether it's investing, trading, or navigating risks in general. I respect each and every one of you and I have a diverse community here, from medical professionals, engineers,… pic.twitter.com/e0V4I1yMoB — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 15, 2025 The $2 Threshold At the core of the analysis is a technical threshold. According to the analyst, XRP will remain in a “super macro bullish cycle” as long as it doesn’t close the monthly candle below $2. While XRP has struggled with this level in 2025, it has recovered every time. That monthly close level operates as the dividing line between maintaining or reevaluating the bullish case. By focusing on monthly candles rather than intraday or even daily volatility, he frames the strategy around larger structural signals. This approach provides clarity and avoids the distractions of smaller price swings . Chart Structure and Bull Flag Formation The chart he attached outlines a bull flag continuation pattern within an ascending channel. He showed historical examples of similar formations, showing how prior cycles resolved in significant rallies in 2017 and 2021. Notably, the bull flag breakout recently sent XRP to its all-time high of $3.65 , and EGRAG CRYPTO anticipates a continued climb for the digital asset. The chart also notes a breakout success rate of around 67% to 70%, suggesting a good chance that the asset will continue climbing. Measured targets are drawn at $21 and $27, both aligned with the upper boundary of the long-term channel. These projections are derived from the height of the flagpole and the strength of the channel trend, reinforcing the case for further upside should the breakout hold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Positioning for the Cycle Ahead EGRAG CRYPTO’s broader message is that XRP’s macro structure remains intact so long as the $2 threshold is respected. The bull flag within the rising channel and the measured targets provide an operational framework for traders. By combining patience with strict adherence to technical levels, participants can align their strategies with market structure and focus on long-term moves instead of making emotional decisions.

On Friday in Alaska, Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin ended their closely watched talks with no deal. By Saturday, Trump signaled a new goal. It was a broader peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, aligning more with Putin’s line, rather than a narrow ceasefire. He also reportedly supported Putin’s proposal that Ukraine surrender territory it currently controls in exchange for a Russian pledge not to attack again. Fortune noted that was a sharp turn from Trump’s pre-Alaska warnings, when he said Russia would face “very severe consequences” if Putin refused a ceasefire. Pressed on why he did not follow through, Trump said he would pause any new penalties for now and hinted the threat could return as diplomacy unfolds. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, Congress was upset . The Ukraine war is still on, yet Trump smiled and drove Putin in a private car. He said they agreed on “many, many points” but also said “there’s no deal until there’s a deal.” He refused new sanctions. Both parties—even usual allies—criticized him. He told Fox News “Because of what happened today, I think I don’t have to think about that now”. He added “I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don’t have to think about that right now.” Trump could hit Russia’s energy revenues with secondary sanctions Before the meeting, Trump had floated secondary sanctions on Russia’s oil sector. Oil and gas supply most of the Kremlin’s money, a weak point Washington could exploit. Targeting the “shadow fleet” of tankers that quietly move Russian crude could trigger a “deep financial crisis” for the war economy, said Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. He noted that after the Biden administration sanctioned nearly 200 ships in January, just before Trump returned to office, activity by those vessels collapsed. Yet another 359 ships already blacklisted by the European Union or United Kingdom have not been hit by U.S. measures. “Sanctioning these ships would be a hammer blow to the Russian war machine,” Brooks wrote. “There would undoubtedly be a sharp fall in the Urals oil price, reducing the flow of hard currency to the Russian state, and the Ruble would most likely depreciate significantly.” Alaska session buys Putin time on Ukraine front Foreign-policy analysts said the Alaska session amounted to a win for Putin, who avoided immediate punishment and gained time for his forces to push for more gains in Ukraine. Even so, Melinda Haring, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, stressed that Trump still holds powerful tools. “Let’s hope that Trump sees through Putin’s endless appetite to talk and tires of the Russian dictator’s pseudo-historical lectures,” she wrote. “Trump can squeeze the Russians; he seems to forget that the United States holds the cards, not Moscow.” Russia’s finances show strain. Oil and gas revenue fell 27% in July from a year earlier, and war spending is widening the budget gap. The National Wealth Fund, a key reserve, has shrunk from $135 billion in January 2022 to $35 billion by May and could be exhausted later this year, according to recent estimates. “Russia’s economy is fast approaching a fiscal crunch that will encumber its war effort,” economist and Russia scholar Anders Åslund wrote last week. “Though that may not be enough to compel Putin to seek peace, it does suggest that the walls are closing in on him.” Don’t just read crypto news.

50208752,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=786321,1755393788,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50208752.jpeg,Kraken halts Monero deposits as Qubic seizes 51% hashrate,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/kraken-halts-monero-deposits/,"Crypto exchange Kraken has temporarily suspended Monero deposits following an alleged 51% attack on the privacy-focused blockchain, sparking heated debate within the crypto community. This type of attack occurs when one mining pool controls more than 50% of a blockchain network’s total hashing power. This gives way to double-spending and reordering transactions on the ledger. In a statement, Kraken explained that Monero deposits were paused as a precautionary measure to protect network security. “As a security precaution, we have paused Monero deposits after detecting that a single mining pool has gained over 50% of the network’s total hashing power. This concentration of mining power poses a potential risk to network integrity.” Kraken halts Monero deposits amid rising network threats The suspicious activity was attributed to Qubic, a layer-1 blockchain and AI-mining pool. Earlier this week, Qubic said it achieved majority control in Monero hashrate and reorganized six blocks on the blockchain. This prompted denials of the attack from the Monero community. Monero, the 29th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization according to CoinMarketCap, is a leading privacy-focused protocol. The ongoing 51% attack on its network has rattled the community, sparking a flurry of reactions. “After a month-long, high-stakes technical confrontation, Qubic reached 51% of Monero’s hashrate dominance, successfully reorganizing the blockchain,” spokespeople for Qubic wrote on Tuesday. The mining pool was initially rebuffed in its attempt at a takeover, falling to the protocol’s seventh-largest miner. It was hit with an alleged denial of service attack on August 4. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack overwhelms a computer, network, or server with excessive fake traffic, clogging the system and blocking legitimate requests from being processed. According to Sergey Ivancheglo, who claimed responsibility for the 51% attack, the DDoS assault slashed Qubic’s hashrate from 2.6 gigahashes per second (GH/s) to just 0.8 GH/s. The Qubic pool eventually regained its hashing strength, seizing majority control of the Monero network’s computing power. “This event marks a pivotal moment in the crypto industry,” Qubic spokespeople continued, while highlighting the takeover of a $6 billion privacy protocol by a $300 million AI protocol. Monero, which trades as XMR, is currently the third-worst performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, and it’s down almost 25% in the last month. Economic incentives replace traditional malicious attacks in mining wars The 51% attack on Monero would be especially critical in the eyes of money launderers searching for untraceable transactions and iron-clad privacy features -innate Monero virtues. The network’s RandomX algorithm was explicitly created to deter ASIC mining and promote CPU and GPU mining in the game of decentralization. But Qubic introduced a unique “useful proof-of-work,” or uPoW, module, which it has also been using to incentivize the Monero CPU mines to be redeployed in support of its token economy. However, it plans to convert mined XMR into USDT stablecoins in order to purchase and burn QUBIC tokens using a deflationary model on its native coin. Instead of establishing a traditional attack for profit or disruption, the project has formed economic incentives that push miners away from distributed pools toward their centralized operation. This new attack category doesn’t rely on malicious intent but superior economic incentives.

Mutuum Finance token price at presale phase 6 is $0.035. It will increase by 14.29% to $0.04 during presale stage 7. Early investors will get at least 400% returns when the token goes live. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $14.45 million and attracted over 15250 investors. While XRP faces technical pressure, the buzz around the growth potential and unique DeFi positioning of Mutuum Finance is generating increasing investor interest, setting the stage for more serious investigation of shifting capital flows in the market. XRP Price Prediction: A Vital Support Point Determines Short-Term Trend XRP now hovers at around $3.28, with it holding close proximity to the critical $3.27 support level. Analyst Ali Martinez warns that losing this zone could send bullish momentum into reverse gear, with a rebound to over $3.29–$3.30 opening the gate to $3.60 short-term, indicating potential renewed ascending pressure. Longer-term forecasts are divided between conservative $3.12 levels towards the end of August and ambitious year-end ranges of $4 to $5.50, subject to regulation updates and market mood. While XRP navigates this testing time, attention is gradually directed towards emerging DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance that are commanding investor interest in the backdrop of shifting crypto narratives.

50208440,558371,1755394207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50208440.jpeg,Ripple-Backed Epic Chain To Launch XRP-Powered RWA Tokenization Platform,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-backed-epic-chain/,"Epic Chain, backed by Ripple, is taking a bold step into the future of finance with the launch of its XRP-native RWA tokenization platform. With Ripple’s support and XRP’s efficiency at its core, Epic Chain could lead the next wave of adoption, where trillions in real-world assets move seamlessly on-chain. Ripple Backs New Real-World Assets Platform In a release , Epic Chain is positioning itself at the center of the real-world assets (RWAs) tokenization wave , building an XRP-native platform to bring real estate, credit, commodities, and collectibles onto the blockchain. With the global RWA market estimated at over $50 trillion, Epic Chain’s positioning could be transformational. Related Reading: From Day 1: Ripple CTO Says XRPL Was Made For Global Financial Infrastructure Epic is currently valued at a modest $60 million FDV, and it trades on Binance, Bybit, and Kucoin, with further listings anticipated. Operating in over 150 countries, the project targets more than 100 million traders and is connected to over a million bank accounts, and has launched a $1 million adoption and liquidity program to drive global growth. According to Route 2 FI, initially launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, Epic is now migrating to an EVM-compatible XRP Ledger sidechain, unlocking native liquidity and tighter integration with XRP infrastructure. This pivot strengthens settlement speed, scalability, and ensures Epic Chain remains aligned with Ripple’s long-term vision of enterprise-grade blockchain adoption. One of the rare small-cap token survivors of multiple crypto market cycles, EPIC has transformed from a collectibles marketplace into a layer-2 RWA solution. Its integration with Ripple USD (RLUSD) allows native USD settlement, which is a critical feature for institutional yields, treasury management, and cross-border payments. The Epic Chain pushes adoption through its “Epic One” VISA crypto card, offering up to 8% XRP cashback with no daily limits, spendable in over 180 countries. Meanwhile, its collectibles platform Fanable continues to attract thousands of users through licensed IP deals. Epic Chain’s positioning at the intersection of RWA tokenization and XRP integration gives it strong potential despite the risk from its history of pivots and XRP’s slower corporate pace. For both retail adopters and institutional markets, Epic could serve as a gateway into the XRP economy. XRP Ledger As Backbone For Next-Gen Real Estate Finance Amid this bold move, the XRP Ledger is set to enable the tokenization of $228 trillion in institutional real estate to be brought on-chain through the XRP Ledger Asset Program on August 18th. According to the RealFI post on X, this breakthrough allows assets traditionally managed off-chain to be brought on-chain via the REAL Token, which signals a transformative shift in the global real estate market toward blockchain adoption.

Technical analysts now see the potential for notable price gains if current conditions persist, with one market strategist outlining both short-term targets and an ideal point to consider entering a position. At the time of writing, SHIB is valued at approximately $0.000014, representing a 1.6% increase over the past day and a 9% rise compared to last week. According to trader Rich X Cult, the recent breakout has created a near-term price objective between $0.00001471 and $0.00001600. This range, if achieved, represents a gain of roughly 13% from present levels. The breakout followed a rebound from lows near $0.00001120 on August 3, visible on the four-hour chart. Indicators also support the bullish sentiment, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) registering an elevated reading of 83.57, signaling strong upward momentum. Trading activity has been substantial, with 24-hour volume estimated at around $340 million, while the price has climbed above its 50-period moving average. SHIB Price Analysis: Bullish Breakout Overview: SHIB breaks falling wedge, signaling bullish momentum. Technical Analysis: • Price: ~$0.0000137 (+3.66% 24h). • Support: $0.00001242. • Targets: $0.00001471–$0.00001600. • Indicators: RSI 83.57, volume $241.07M, MA50… pic.twitter.com/LrGs4DR7Fi — Rich X Cult (@RichXCult) August 13, 2025 Key Technical Levels and Risk Considerations Rich X Cult identifies $0.00001242 as a critical support level and considers it an optimal entry point for traders awaiting a pullback. Should the market hold above this threshold, it could provide a base for another advance toward the $0.000016 target zone. Conversely, a close below $0.00001242 could signal a shift toward neutral or bearish conditions, opening the door for a decline to the next support near $0.00001170. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst has suggested a tactical approach that involves entering near the $0.00001242 level with a stop-loss placed slightly below it. However, given the current overbought RSI reading, he cautions that short-term volatility remains a possibility. Additional Market Perspectives Other market commentators share similar optimism for Shiba Inu’s potential. SHIB Knight previously projected a rise to $0.000018, citing the development of a higher low formation as evidence of upward pressure building. This estimate represents a 32% increase from current prices. Analyst Crypto Mullah is monitoring a larger falling wedge pattern on SHIB’s three-day chart. This formation has been in place since December 8, 2024, when the token reached $0.00003343 following a strong rally in November. Mullah believes a breakout from this structure could push SHIB back toward its December peak, which would be roughly 146.5% above current valuations. Similarly, analyst Javon Marks has pointed to a confirmed bullish divergence on SHIB’s two-day chart, suggesting a potential advance exceeding 156% from the divergence confirmation point, with a projected target of $0.000032. With several analysts aligning on the possibility of further gains, Shiba Inu’s recent breakout is attracting close attention from market participants. The sustainability of the move will likely depend on whether the key $0.00001242 support holds and broader market conditions remain favourable.

Analysts are calling this the start of a major rotation into altcoins, where smaller and mid-cap projects often deliver outsized returns compared to Bitcoin. For investors looking to position ahead of the wave, several key altcoins stand out. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most talked-about new entries, with growing community interest and forecasts of explosive returns. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains the leading altcoin by market cap and often serves as the benchmark for the broader market. Following record inflows into U.S.-approved spot ETH ETFs, institutional interest is soaring. If Ethereum can break past its previous all-time high near $4,878, analysts see upside toward $5,500–$6,000 in the near term, with long-term projections reaching $20,000 by 2026. XRP After years of legal uncertainty, XRP has regained its momentum. The asset surged more than 470% in the past year and trades below its ATH. XRP’s role in cross-border payments continues to expand, with some analysts expecting XRP to test levels between $7 and $13 this cycle. SUI SUI has quietly gained traction in 2025, with its DeFi ecosystem seeing a 42% surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) since January. Currently trading around $3.82, forecasts call for $4.75–$5.00 by late August, with long-term targets between $12 and $14 by October 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Among emerging projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured analyst attention for its explosive potential, receiving $12.5 million in fresh capital . With presale demand already outpacing expectations, early participants have seen returns of up to 7,800% , with forecasts suggesting even greater upside as adoption accelerates. The limited early supply and strong community engagement are fueling comparisons to the early days of Dogecoin, making it an incredible opportunity for investors seeking greeter gains before the next wave of capital floods in. Cardano (ADA) Known for its careful, research-driven development, Cardano is rolling out its Voltaire governance era, a milestone that brings on-chain community-led decision-making. Trading near $0.936, ADA could retest its all-time high above $3 if positive momentum continues into the year-end. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is a cornerstone of Web3, delivering secure data to smart contracts across DeFi and institutional finance. LINK, priced at $21.54, shows bullish chart patterns, with forecasts ranging from $25–$30 in the conservative case to as high as $100 in aggressive scenarios. Its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) remains a key growth driver. Solana (SOL) Solana has bounced back impressively in 2025, trading around $185. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has doubled this year, and the anticipated Firedancer validator could elevate throughput beyond one million transactions per second. Analysts suggest a potential rally to $300–$400, especially with growing speculation of a spot SOL ETF. Conclusion As the countdown to altcoin season accelerates, investors are turning their attention to assets beyond Bitcoin. Ethereum, XRP, SUI, Cardano, Chainlink, and Solana all present strong fundamentals and upcoming catalysts. But it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its explosive presale performance and scarcity-driven setup, that stands out as one of the boldest opportunities of this cycle.

The letter was signed by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Christopher Coons (D-Del.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The lawmakers’ letter responds to Trump’s Aug. 11 announcement that Nvidia and AMD would pay the U.S. government a 15% commission on chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. “Our national security and military readiness relies upon American innovators inventing and producing the best technology in the world, and in maintaining that qualitative advantage in sensitive domains,” the letter states. The letter emphasized that Trump’s arrangement, showing a willingness to negotiate away America’s competitive edge—which is key to national security—in exchange for a commission on the sale of AI-enabling technology to a main global competitor, is cause for serious alarm. Nvidia defends H20 chips amid national security concerns The senators also warned that exporting advanced AI chips, specifically Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308, could bolster China’s military systems — a claim Nvidia disputes. In a statement to CNBC, a Nvidia spokesperson said: “The H20 would not enhance anyone’s military capabilities, but would have helped America attract the support of developers worldwide and win the AI race. Banning the H20 cost American taxpayers billions of dollars, without any benefit.” AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Democrats asked the administration for a detailed response by Friday, Aug. 22, regarding the current Nvidia and AMD deal and any similar arrangements with other companies. “We again urge your administration to quickly reverse course and abandon this reckless plan to trade away U.S. technology leadership,” the letter concludes. The Trump administration, however, appeared to dismiss the national security concerns. “It’s quite rich to see Democrats and irrelevant ‘experts,’ who were totally MIA when Joe Biden’s administration let H20 chips and other advanced technologies freely flow to China, now pretend to care about our national and economic security,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC. China restricts Nvidia purchases despite U.S. export approvals Even with Trump permitting the chip sales to resume, China has not fully welcomed Nvidia’s return . Bloomberg reports that Chinese authorities are encouraging tech companies to avoid U.S. chips. “We’re hearing that this is a hard mandate, and that [authorities are actually] stopping additional orders of H20s for some companies,” said Qingyuan Lin, a senior analyst covering China semiconductors at Bernstein. Separately, The Information reported that Chinese regulators have ordered major tech firms, including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent, to halt Nvidia chip purchases until a national security review is completed.

In 2023, the left-leaning watchdog reported that ads from major brands were appearing beside antisemitic and other objectionable posts on X, Elon Musk’s social network. Many big advertisers then froze their spending on the platform . X, in turn, sued Media Matters. The company also brought cases against several advertisers and industry groups, alleging a “systematic illegal boycott.” After Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, the FTC launched a review into whether Media Matters unlawfully coordinated with advertisers. The agency requested records tied to the group’s reporting and its outreach to brands. According to a TechCrunch report , U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan sided with Media Matters on Friday and put the FTC’s effort on hold, concluding the organization is likely to prevail on First Amendment claims. Sooknanan, a Biden appointee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, wrote that the Media Matters article was “quintessential First Amendment activity” and called the FTC’s “expansive” demands “a retaliatory act.” In her ruling, she added “It should alarm all Americans when the Government retaliates against individuals or organizations for engaging in constitutionally protected public debate. And that alarm should ring even louder when the Government retaliates against those engaged in newsgathering and reporting.” She also referenced remarks by Andrew Ferguson from before he became the FTC’s chair, noting his appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast urging scrutiny of progressive groups that critique online disinformation, and that once in the role he “brought on several senior staffers at the FTC who previously made public comments about Media Matters.” Media Matters layoffs and WFA pulls back amid X litigation Regardless of how the litigation proceeds, X’s courtroom strategy has already altered the environment for the entities it targeted. Media Matters has cut staff; one displaced researcher is now running for Congress. The World Federation of Advertisers shut down a brand-safety initiative and reportedly warned members about financial strain. On Thursday, the WFA told members it was “discontinuing” activities for its Global Alliance for Responsible Media after X filed an antitrust case against the group earlier in the week. In an email seen by Business Insider, WFA CEO Stephan Loerke said the move was “not made lightly,” noting that GARM is a nonprofit with limited resources. He said the WFA and GARM will fight X’s allegations in court and are confident the case will “demonstrate our full adherence to competition rules in all our activities.” That note came two days after X filed suit in a Texas court, alleging that GARM participants worked together to “collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue” from Twitter, now called X. The complaint also identifies several GARM participants, including Unilever, Mars, CVS, and Ørsted. Sooknanan further wrote that the FTC’s inquiry produced its “intended effect,” saying Media Matters chose “against pursuing certain stories about the FTC, Chairman Ferguson, and Mr. Musk.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Tech|FTC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-17 01:51:00

On-chain data shows the wallet first executed a small test transaction before transferring its 334.7 ETH to a new wallet. The fresh wallet has yet to show any activity, but if the investor decides to cash out, the return would amount to roughly 14,269x at current prices. Notably, the original investing wallet remained inactive following the ETH ICO, which launched in July 2014. Dormant wallets reactivate as Ethereum gains momentum Following the incident about the early Ethereum investor, research from sources has revealed that several well-funded wallets that remained dormant for a long time have just recently been activated. A good example is a Satoshi-era investor who transferred significant funds to approximately $9 billion worth of Bitcoin. Galaxy facilitated the sale, and BTC’s price remained mostly stable following the massive move. *]:col-start-1 [&>*]:row-start-1 [&_[data-jw-placement-id]]:w-full [&_.jwplayer]:aspect-video [&_.jwplayer]:!w-auto [&_.jwplayer]:!h-auto [&_.jwplayer]:!z-1 ""> Ether has been on a big run of late, but it’s just getting started, according to Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick. Citing surging institutional demand, favorable regulation, and network upgrades, Kendrick lifted his year-end price target for ETH to $7,500 from $4,000 and his end-2028 target to $25,000 from $7,500. Up more than 50% over the past month, Ether is trading hands just beneath its record high of $4,406. *]:col-start-1 [&>*]:row-start-1 [&_[data-jw-placement-id]]:w-full [&_.jwplayer]:aspect-video [&_.jwplayer]:!w-auto [&_.jwplayer]:!h-auto [&_.jwplayer]:!z-1 ""> Alongside, he expects continued outperformance over Bitcoin, forecasting the ETH/BTC ratio to rise to 0.05 from the current 0.039. The second-largest cryptocurrency has also received a regulatory boost from the passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act in July, which paves the way for mainstream stablecoin adoption. Kendrick noted that more than half of all stablecoins are issued on Ethereum, and these cryptocurrencies already account for 40% of blockchain fees. BlackRock’s ETHA fund inflows hit headlines after amounting to 338.1 million Last week, U.S.-based Ethereum ETFs recorded a historic trading volume of roughly $18.2 billion , marking their highest ever. This nearly matched Bitcoin ETFs, which posted a trading volume of about $21.2 billion. In addition to trading activity, Ethereum funds saw strong weekly inflows of approximately $2.9 billion in new capital. Although the broader ETF market experienced a net outflow of $59.3 million, BlackRock’s ETHA fund, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, attracted about $338.1 million in fresh investments. Analysis from SoSoValue shows that these gains were partially offset by outflows elsewhere, including Fidelity’s FETH at $272.2 million and Grayscale’s ETHE at $101.7 million, along with smaller withdrawals from 21Shares’ CETH, Grayscale’s ETH, and Bitwise’s ETHW. Still, that day’s inflows marked BlackRock’s ETHA fund success, which lasted ten consecutive days. BlackRock’s ETHA fund currently oversees around $15.7 billion in assets. These assets represent 2.9% of Ethereum’s total market value. Get seen where it counts.

Related Reading: Trump Coin Jumps 10% On Canary Capital ETF Filing: Details According to a recent podcast episode featuring several crypto commentators, guests flagged “mania signals” as a way to spot when an asset is going mainstream. Some guests said they are now hearing XRP mentioned in casual settings, while others point to counterexamples that suggest the trend is not universal. Uber Drivers Talk Crypto Based on reports from the Unchained podcast and social posts, one guest said they had taken multiple Uber rides where drivers were trading XRP. That comment was later amplified on social media, with others sharing similar encounters. Reports have disclosed that another well-known community figure said Uber drivers in Nevada and Michigan even recognized him as “that XRP lawyer guy” after his advocacy in the Ripple–SEC case. Those anecdotes add color to claims of growing retail chatter. I’ve had 2 different Uber drivers in 2 different states (Nevada & Michigan) bring up XRP to me during the last 3 months. They said: “You look familiar” and “I know you.” I replied: “I ran for U.S. Senate against Elizabeth Warren.” Both quickly responded: “No that’s not it -… https://t.co/hsmppCsXRt — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 14, 2025 Small Survey Finds Little Uptake A separate, small experiment tested the idea directly. A commentator took 25 Uber rides in Ontario and asked each driver whether they held XRP. Most drivers were confused or said they did not own any crypto. One driver reported holding XRP, having bought at $1.67, and said they planned to hold long-term. Based on that sample, the experiment’s author concluded that the “Uber driver” story is overstated, or that early buyers may have already cashed out. Retail Buzz Versus Real Adoption Analysts differ on what these encounters mean. According to a Bloomberg ETF analyst cited in reports, institutional demand for a possible XRP ETF may start modest while retail interest could be greater. Other researchers in the community argue that institutions might be quietly building positions even if many retail investors remain unaware. Both lines of argument can be true at once: pockets of strong recognition can exist while broad adoption lags behind.

For now, though, the mix of big-signal stories and low-hit surveys means the claim of wide mainstream recognition is still unproven. These first-hand accounts are compelling because they are simple and human. They make a tidy headline and spark debate online. Reports so far say they are not yet a substitute for consistent, verifiable data. Some people are clearly talking about XRP in daily life. But the jury is still out on whether that talk has crossed into broad mainstream awareness.

Ethereum (ETH) traders took the hardest hit, with $159 million wiped out, followed by Bitcoin (BTC) at $41 million and Solana (SOL) at $22 million. Despite the downturn, this type of flush-out is often seen as an opportunity by seasoned investors, who view sharp corrections as entry points into strong assets and presales. While Ethereum’s wipeout shows how leveraged traders were caught off guard, it also underlines growing demand and speculation around the asset. Similar trends were seen in Bitcoin and Solana, highlighting the market’s volatility as investors navigate inflation reports, ETF inflows, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. In times like these, attention frequently shifts toward early-stage projects where upside potential remains massive. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining traction. Why Presales Are Attracting Attention After Liquidations MAGACOIN FINANCE has been labeled by analysts as one of the best presales of 2025, with projections suggesting that early backers could see exponential gains before the cycle peak. Its momentum is nothing short of ordinary and the rapidly rising prices are drawing investors from around the world. With presale allocations running low, the scarcity factor is building — a key driver for investors seeking to position themselves ahead of the next altcoin breakout. Market Reset Creates New Buying Opportunities Back in the broader market, liquidations of this size are not unusual during periods of consolidation. The cleansing effect can reset overheated leverage, giving assets like Ethereum and Solana room to build stronger bases. Many traders now expect Ethereum to regain momentum toward the $5,000 mark, while Bitcoin remains well-supported above six figures. As capital rotates, the presale narrative is becoming a dominant theme for those looking beyond established assets. Conclusion In summary, the liquidation wave shows the risks of high leverage but also underscores opportunities that surface in its aftermath. While Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana remain strong long-term bets, investors searching for the highest upside potential are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is emerging as one of the most compelling presales of 2025.

Cardano is pressing hard against the $1 ceiling after a strong double-digit rebound. SEI is flashing a series of bullish technical cues, hinting at the potential for a sizable push upward. Meanwhile, BlockDAG ’s Batch 29 entry point at $0.0276 is attracting strong attention, pairing competitive pricing with a presale total now standing at $374M. Its combination of broad utility, audience reach, and sports-linked exposure is helping it capture significant market share. For those tracking both quick trading opportunities and plays with long-term potential, these three projects are showing momentum that stands out in a crowded market. ADA Rallies with Strong Volume Support Cardano has staged a 16% rally, pushing just under the $1 threshold. On the 4-hour chart, ADA climbed from early August lows near $0.68 to touch $1.00, clearing resistance at $0.82, $0.88, $0.92, and $0.96 along the way. Trading volume rose sharply during this move, confirming heavy buying activity rather than a thin market pump. Open interest also reached about $369M, suggesting new positions are reinforcing the trend. Current positioning shows more short interest than long, opening the door for a squeeze if ADA maintains $0.95–$0.97 support. The $1.00–$1.02 zone is immediate resistance, with further upside possible toward $1.05–$1.10 if momentum holds. Support remains at $0.95–$0.97 and $0.90–$0.92. While the short-term trend is positive, the daily RSI near 74 hints at the possibility of a pause or minor pullback before any further breakout. SEI Breaks Out of Downtrend SEI is gaining traction after the TD Sequential indicator triggered a new buy signal, a tool that has previously marked its major turning points. Analyst Ali noted a green “9” candle appeared as SEI touched the $0.30 level, historically signaling reversals. This coincided with a break above a multi-week descending channel. The breakout sent SEI into a $0.32–$0.33 retest zone, now an important level for bulls to protect. Holding above it could pave the way toward $0.50, based on the height of the channel and the strength of the breakout. With both a clear chart pattern and supporting technical indicators, short-term momentum is leaning positive. However, slipping back below $0.32 could put the move on hold, making near-term price action crucial. $374M Raised: BlockDAG Builds Real-World Presence! While ADA and SEI are turning heads with price action, BlockDAG is building a deeper foundation designed to last well beyond short-term market swings. Its presale has brought in $374M so far, with Batch 29 pricing BDAG coins at $0.0276 ahead of a confirmed $0.05 launch price, already a 2,660% gain from Batch 1 buyers. One driver of its visibility is its sports partnerships. BlockDAG is the official blockchain partner of the Seattle Seawolves rugby team and Seattle Orcas cricket team, tapping into two fanbases with international reach. Through these links, it offers NFTs, fan coins, exclusive behind-the-scenes content, and match access, putting the BDAG name in front of millions worldwide. On the education front, the BlockDAG Academy delivers a structured, three-level blockchain training program with on-chain certification, blending learning with real blockchain integration. Mining access is also at the forefront, its X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware miner, first shown in a July live demo, allow easy entry for casual users and higher output for advanced setups. The X1 works through a simple app, while the X10 boosts capacity for serious mining performance. This mix of global sports exposure, structured blockchain education, and hands-on mining tools positions BlockDAG as more than just a market trend, it’s already building practical use cases before launch. Looking Ahead Cardano is closing in on the $1 milestone with strong trading activity backing the move. SEI’s combination of a confirmed breakout and buy signals suggests near-term potential for a sharp push higher. BlockDAG, however, is shaping up as the project with staying power, combining $374M in presale funding with sports tie-ins, blockchain education, and mining tools, all at a $0.0276 entry ahead of a $0.05 launch. In a market where many projects lean on hype alone, BlockDAG’s blend of real-world visibility, established partnerships, and ready-to-use features makes it one of the more complete plays on the table right now. Whether the focus is on quick trades or multi-year growth, these three assets are showing why momentum plus fundamentals can be a powerful mix.

If approved, it would mark a historic moment for the industry, allowing traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP through regulated stock exchanges. Much like the early 2024 approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, such a move would inject fresh capital into the market and potentially set the stage for a new wave of altcoin growth. For investors, the implications are massive. An XRP ETF would not only validate Ripple’s standing but also create momentum across the entire sector. Altcoins with strong fundamentals and clear adoption paths, like Solana, Render, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, are being highlighted as top picks to benefit from this potential shift. Solana (SOL) – Positioned for Explosive Upside Solana has established itself as one of the most scalable and cost-efficient blockchains. Capable of processing tens of thousands of transactions per second, its ecosystem spans decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and gaming. Institutional investors are already watching closely, with discussions of a potential Solana ETF surfacing in recent months. If an XRP ETF is approved, it could fast-track similar products for Solana. Analysts are projecting a bullish case where SOL targets $300 to $400 by late 2025, with some long-term forecasts suggesting far higher valuations as adoption continues to grow. Render (RNDR) – Real Utility Meets Growing Demand Render stands out for its real-world application, connecting creators and studios with GPU providers in a decentralized marketplace. Its relevance spans gaming, artificial intelligence, and the metaverse – sectors expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. The project’s shift to Solana has boosted its scalability and reduced costs, making it even more attractive. Market watchers believe RNDR could surpass its previous highs and climb past $20 to $30 in 2025, especially if optimism from an XRP ETF approval triggers a broad rally. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Breakout Presale Turning Heads While established players like Solana and Render lead on fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention as the presale with breakout potential. With the price rising with each round, the project is seeing surging demand from early investors. Each funding round has sold out at record speed, with forecasts suggesting gains as high as 7,800% before cycle peak for early participants. Its appeal lies in more than just hype – the project is actively building an expanding ecosystem with utilities designed to sustain long-term value. As major altcoins rally on institutional adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors a rare chance to secure a position before it lists on top exchanges. Conclusion The possible launch of an XRP ETF could be a turning point for the entire crypto sector, paving the way for institutional inflows and stronger regulatory clarity. Solana and Render are well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum with strong fundamentals and clear use cases. But for investors seeking early-stage upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the high-growth presale opportunity that could deliver staggering returns in 2025.

These three stand out among the best altcoins to buy in 2025, each offering a unique angle for those tracking high-growth portfolios. Solana Rally Back to $200 Solana (SOL) reclaimed the $200 level in mid-August after a sharp 15% jump. Whale activity has been active as one major holder moved nearly 40,000 SOL from Bybit after holding for months, securing almost $3 million in profit. This highlights the liquidity and price opportunities currently available in Solana’s market. The rally is linked to higher DeFi adoption, treasury company accumulation, and integrations across networks. According to reports , corporate holdings of SOL now total more than $675 million which underscore its role in institutional portfolios. Solana continues to regain ground and many analysts see its $200 price tag as a psychological milestone that could set the tone for how altcoins behave through the remainder of 2025. For those scanning the best altcoins to watch, Solana remains a core name on the list. Ethereum Nears All-Time Highs Amid Institutional Flows Also, Ethereum (ETH) continues to draw Wall Street attention by recently climbing above $4,700, close to its all-time high of $4,878. Institutional adoption is central to this rise. Companies like BitMine Immersion Technologies have laid out strategies to buy as much as 5% of the global ETH supply. Ethereum also anchors much of the stablecoin and real-world asset tokenization markets, with more than half of all stablecoins operating on its blockchain. These areas are linked to mainstream finance, which could help ETH maintain its leadership among altcoins. While competition from faster blockchains remains, Ethereum’s position in staking, infrastructure, and its central role in digital assets keep it firmly among the best altcoins to buy in 2025. Commentators like Tom Lee have said ETH price could reach $15,000 come December. MAGACOIN FINANCE: New Token Tipped for 800% Growth Alongside established leaders like Solana and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a featured altcoin for 2025 portfolios. Currently, the token is being highlighted by analysts who forecast up to 800% growth in the next year. With its active performance already outpacing some rivals, MAGACOIN has placed itself as one of the best altcoins to watch right now for high-growth potential. Main Takeaway For those tracking the best altcoins to buy in 2025, Solana and Ethereum remain anchors with market activity and institutional inflows. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE adds a fresh angle, with its sale phase marking it as a token to watch for outsized growth expectations. Balancing established leaders with rising names may offer a more complete approach to altcoin exposure. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

50210706,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78792,1755398013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Price Prediction 2025 – 470% Rally After $125M SEC Settlement, Analysts Target $12.60",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-prediction-2025-470-rally-after-125m-sec-settlement/,"XRP has re-emerged as one of the most closely watched cryptocurrencies in 2025 following its dramatic rebound from years of legal uncertainty. Earlier this year, Ripple Labs reached a $125 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), bringing a long-standing lawsuit to a close. Analysts now see further upside, with multiple forecasts targeting $12.60 as a fair-value mark by the end of the year. This rally not only restores confidence in XRP but also signals the importance of regulatory clarity in unlocking value across the broader crypto ecosystem. It also frames the conversation around other breakout contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts suggest could deliver gains that eclipse XRP’s current trajectory. Ripple’s Legal Victory Resets the Market The significance of the SEC settlement cannot be overstated. For nearly five years, XRP was burdened by uncertainty in the U.S. market, with exchanges hesitant to list the token and institutions wary of holding it. The $125 million resolution not only removed this overhang but also established a precedent for how regulators and crypto firms might resolve disputes in the future. For investors, this marked a clean slate, leading to renewed liquidity and institutional interest. Transaction volumes on the XRP Ledger surged in tandem, as fintech companies and regional banks resumed or expanded partnerships with RippleNet. In Asia and Latin America especially, XRP adoption for cross-border settlement has been accelerating, driving real-world demand that complements speculative inflows. Analysts argue this combination of regulatory clarity and practical adoption is what gives XRP the strength to sustain its rally toward the $12.60 target price . The Broader Altcoin Landscape While XRP is enjoying its moment, the broader altcoin market remains highly competitive. Ethereum continues to dominate DeFi infrastructure, while Solana and Avalanche compete in high-throughput environments. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu still command large communities, often driving short-term volatility. Yet investors are increasingly seeking asymmetric opportunities – early-stage projects that could replicate the exponential gains seen in the early days of XRP itself. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the spotlight, with projections suggesting it could outpace XRP’s growth potential with an estimated 120x upside in 2025 . Unlike established coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its formative stages – but that’s precisely what appeals to forward-looking investors. Each funding round has sold out rapidly, underscoring strong early demand. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its commitment to building real-world use cases and delivering value early in its lifecycle . By introducing mechanisms that reward strategic entry and cultivating a loyal base of supporters, the project has created a unique blend of scarcity, momentum, and utility. Analysts suggest that while XRP may capture institutional adoption headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer 120x returns for those willing to position early, making it one of the stealth breakout contenders of this cycle. Final Thoughts XRP’s rally following the $125 million SEC settlement underscores the importance of regulatory clarity and institutional trust in crypto markets. With analysts targeting $12.60 by the end of 2025, XRP has regained its place as one of the sector’s most resilient assets. Yet, as history shows, the biggest gains often emerge not from established giants but from underdog projects that seize the momentum of a new cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its strong community backing and 120x growth potentia l, is increasingly viewed as one such project, offering the kind of upside that could define the next chapter of altcoin investing.

According to him , the valuation required to support this price would dwarf not only the cryptocurrency market but also global financial benchmarks, placing it far outside the realm of possibility in the foreseeable future. Tony highlights that at $1,000 per token, XRP’s market capitalization would rise to levels never seen in financial history. To illustrate, such a valuation would make XRP four times more valuable than the entire global gold market. Gold , regarded as one of the most stable and valuable assets in existence, has maintained its dominance in world markets for centuries. Exceeding this by that margin would be unprecedented for any asset class, let alone a single cryptocurrency. Beyond gold, XRP at $1,000 would also eclipse the largest corporations in the world. Its market cap would be about fifteen times greater than that of Apple, the highest-valued publicly traded company. Tony argues that this comparison alone shows $1,000 target is unrealistic since no digital asset has ever come close to challenging the dominance of the world’s top companies. Comparisons With the Global Economy The scale becomes even clearer when viewed from a macroeconomic perspective. At $1,000 per token, XRP’s market capitalization would be equivalent to half of global GDP, effectively rivaling the value of half of all goods and services produced across every economy. According to Tony, this scenario is economically implausible, as no single asset or company in history has ever portrayed such a proportion of worldwide activity. Additionally, XRP at that valuation would account for half of the entire global stock market. This means one cryptocurrency would need to match the combined worth of thousands of companies listed on exchanges worldwide. Tony stresses that this kind of outcome is not compatible with current and foreseeable market conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expert Calls It “Fantasy Pricing” Given these calculations, Tony categorizes the $1,000 projection as “fantasy pricing.” He emphasizes that even with widespread adoption, regulatory clarity, and favourable market cycles, the distance between XRP’s present valuation and the trillion-dollar thresholds implied by a $1,000 price is too great to bridge within the next decade. He further notes that the idea of achieving this milestone by 2030 is not credible. While cryptocurrency markets are known for rapid growth and volatility, the structural limitations of the global economy place clear boundaries on how far a single digital asset can rise. Investors expecting XRP to reach such heights would likely be waiting for generations, with no assurance that it would ever occur. Tony’s assessment underscores the importance of realistic expectations within the cryptocurrency sector. While XRP may continue to grow and benefit from broader adoption, the prospect of it trading at $1,000 is economically unfeasible based on current global financial structures. His message for investors is clear: optimism is valuable, but it must be grounded in practical market realities.

50211658,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-smashes-6-2m-mark-with-ethereum-bullish-outlook-and-cardano-growth-ahead/,1755399623,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,Cold Wallet Smashes $6.2M Mark With Ethereum Bullish Outlook and Cardano Growth Ahead,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-smashes-6-2m-mark-with-ethereum-bullish-outlook-and-cardano-growth-ahead/,"Ethereum (ETH) bullish signs are emerging after whales collected $1.34B in just days, lifting price action near the $4,600 target. Cardano (ADA) market surge talk is also rising as whales grabbed 200M ADA in 48 hours, fueling hopes for a rally toward $1.50. Both highlight strong capital flows, but the outcome still depends on market confidence. Moreover, Cold Wallet (CWT) adds a different angle. From its Stage 1 entry at $0.007, every presale round has moved closer to its confirmed $0.3517 listing. With momentum growing and $6.2M already raised, the window for return potential keeps shrinking. Ethereum Whale Buys Point to Possible Move Toward $4,600 An unknown investor purchased $1.34B worth of ETH across just eight days, spreading the total of 312,052 ETH into ten wallets using FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and BitGo. This activity matches Ethereum’s building momentum and may hint at early institutional demand. Price charts show ETH near a Fibonacci level around $4,324. A clear push beyond could send it toward $4,587, though signals like the Relative Strength Index at 73 point to possible overbought risk. With fewer ETH held on exchanges and optimism rising, conditions suggest more upside, though traders remain alert for profit-taking along the way. For those tracking large-scale capital flows, this may be a key moment. Cardano Sets Sights on 76% Gain With Rally Toward $1.50 Cardano (ADA) has drawn attention after whales picked up 200M ADA worth over $170M within two days. This heavy buying move cut available supply and may boost upward price pressure. ADA now trades close to $0.85, a resistance point that has limited moves for months. Hopes for a U.S. Cardano ETF also add momentum, with analysts suggesting a 75% chance of approval. The mix of whale accumulation, tighter supply, and ETF speculation makes Cardano one of the most discussed assets in the market. If momentum holds, the conditions could drive a breakout toward $1.50. Cold Wallet Presale Crosses $6.2M as Stage 17 Price Nears Final Entry Point The Cold Wallet presale is advancing quickly, leaving limited time for new entries. In only a few weeks, it has gathered more than $6.2 million, and Stage 17’s $0.00998 price is showing signs that it will not stay open for long. This is not the standard model of raising funds first and then chasing users later. With the $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition, Cold Wallet begins its journey with over 2 million active users already in place, addressing the key challenge of adoption from the start. From the first stage at $0.007, every presale round has pushed closer to the set $0.3517 listing price, steadily reducing potential returns for late buyers. The calculation is clear: each completed stage narrows the chance for larger gains. With more than 735 million tokens already sold, available supply is shrinking at a fast pace. The difference with this presale is its direct utility. Cold Wallet is not focused on promises of future value; it already delivers cashback on every transaction, swap, or transfer. This creates a launch-ready system rather than a plan still in development. At the current rate, the window of opportunity appears to be measured in days instead of months. For those seeking maximum returns, waiting until listing could mean missing the strongest gains. Cold Wallet Builds Value Through Active Utility Instead of Market Hype Ethereum (ETH) bullish signals and Cardano (ADA) market surge discussions are filling headlines, yet both depend on outside factors such as ETF decisions, whale moves, and broad market conditions. Cold Wallet follows a separate path. Its presale is not based on speculation but on a working product where cashback rewards turn every swap, transfer, or network cost into value. With more than 735 million tokens sold since Stage 1 and a fixed $0.3517 listing price, the growth path is defined and time-limited. For market watchers, the choice between pursuing rallies already underway or entering a ready-to-launch system is increasingly pointing toward Cold Wallet.

50211659,https://thecoinrise.com/top-trending-crypto-blockdag-sui-hyperliquid-toncoin/,1755399632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50211659.jpeg,"Top Trending Crypto: BlockDAG, Sui, Hyperliquid & Toncoin",https://thecoinrise.com/top-trending-crypto-blockdag-sui-hyperliquid-toncoin/,"Recent activity in the market has highlighted which projects are truly gaining traction. The surge is coming from adoption, community involvement, and meaningful catalysts, not just short-term hype. If you’re looking for the top trending crypto in 2025, the focus should be on projects showing both momentum and strong fundamentals. From presales raising hundreds of millions to Layer-1 networks posting jumps in daily engagement, these projects stand out for very different reasons. Below is a breakdown of four names making headlines right now and why they’re part of the top trending crypto discussion. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Heavyweight with Exchange Ambitions BlockDAG is shaping up as one of the most compelling stories in the top trending crypto conversation. Built as a hybrid Layer-1, it combines a Directed Acyclic Graph structure with Proof-of-Work consensus and full EVM compatibility. This setup delivers high throughput, security, and smart contract functionality. Its presale has already pulled in over $375 million, selling more than 25 billion BDAG units across 29 batches at a price of $0.0276. Early participants in Batch 1 have notched 2,660% gains on paper, while those joining now could still see an 81% lift if the projected $0.05 listing materializes. Analysts suggest that listings on Coinbase and Gemini could even push it closer to $1. The groundwork is already substantial. More than 2.5 million people actively use the X1 Mobile Miner App every day, while 4,500 developers are building 300+ dApps. Add in 19,000 mining units sold, 200,000+ holders, and 20 confirmed exchange listings, and BlockDAG clearly has infrastructure and adoption in place before launch. This mix of momentum and readiness cements its position as a top trending crypto for 2025. 2. Sui: Network Activity Takes Center Stage Sui has gained attention thanks to a sharp spike in network usage. Priced at around $4.04 with a market cap near $14.17 billion, it recorded a 79% increase in daily active accounts within just 72 hours. That sudden rise in activity signals growing demand for its services and coincides with expectations of new liquidity events. Its Move-based architecture is drawing developers who are building gaming and DeFi apps, fueling ecosystem growth. Add in speculation about fresh exchange integrations, and the buzz only intensifies. With rising engagement and technical strength, Sui has earned its spot among today’s top trending crypto projects. 3. Hyperliquid: Growth Fueled by Buybacks Hyperliquid is trading at about $47.31 with a $15.80 billion market cap, distinguishing itself with a dual role as botha blockchain andan exchange platform. The buzz around it has been amplified by reports of daily buybacks exceeding $4 million, strengthening bullish sentiment. Revenue growth adds credibility, with its model supporting finance-focused dApps and high-volume transactions. Out of its 1 billion supply, about 333.9 million are circulating, leaving room for expansion without heavy dilution. With talk of community rewards and ongoing Layer-1 development, Hyperliquid continues to show why it belongs in the top trending crypto mix. 4. Toncoin: Telegram Advantage Drives Adoption Toncoin, priced near $3.55 with a $9.12 billion market cap, has one of the clearest adoption pipelines thanks to its direct link with Telegram. The integration brings a wallet mini-app to more than 87 million U.S. users, opening the door for simple crypto transactions inside an app people already use daily. On top of that, Telegram now accepts TON for selected in-app payments, adding real use to the network. With a supply of about 2.57 billion and ice stability in the mid-$3s, Toncoin combines community support with unique reach. That makes it an easy pick for the top trending crypto list in 2025. Final Thoughts Across presales, surging activity, exchange revenues, and direct app integration, these four projects highlight different ways to rise as a top trending crypto . BlockDAG leads with massive presale traction and a clear exchange strategy. Sui shows strength through rapid user growth. Hyperliquid pairs real revenue with strong buybacks. And Toncoin leverages Telegram’s user base for real-world adoption. Each project has its own strengths, but all four demonstrate that performance in 2025 comes from community engagement, adoption, and execution. For anyone tracking the top trending crypto story this year, these names are firmly at the center of the conversation.

While giants like XRP and Solana continue to lead the charge, a new contender is quickly rising as one of the best altcoins to buy : MAGACOIN FINANCE . If you’re scouting the best altcoins to buy before the next major rally, this could be your golden opportunity. Early-stage investors and analysts alike are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the top altcoins to watch in the run-up to 2026 — with potential gains of 10x to 15x in just the next few months. XRP: Legal Clarity Positions It as One of the Best Altcoins to Buy in 2025 August 2025 has been monumental for XRP , placing it firmly back on the list of the top altcoins to watch . The Ripple vs. SEC legal saga has officially ended, bringing long-awaited regulatory clarity to one of crypto’s most controversial tokens. Key Developments: SEC case officially concluded on August 8, 2025 $125M fine imposed, but XRP not deemed a security Institutional adoption expected to surge post-settlement With several major firms — including Grayscale, Bitwise, and ProShares — submitting ETF applications, analysts are labeling XRP as one of the best altcoins to buy before ETF approvals hit in October 2025 . If you’re looking for top altcoins to watch with major catalysts on the horizon, XRP deserves a place at the top of your list. Solana: Network Upgrades Make SOL a Top Altcoin to Watch Another powerhouse that continues to dominate headlines is Solana (SOL) — consistently named among the best altcoins to buy in 2025. Despite the SEC delaying ETF decisions until October 16 , bullish momentum remains strong. August Highlights: DeFi TVL up 60% to $14.18 billion Trading near $192 with strong institutional inflows Major network upgrades: Firedancer , new consensus mechanism, and block space doubling Solana’s on-chain metrics and technical upgrades reinforce its status as a top altcoin to watch for explosive growth. Analysts see price targets of $210–$220 in the short term, with longer-term upside much higher. Plus, with Solana onboarding more developers than Ethereum and dominating DEX volume, it continues to be one of the best altcoins to buy if you want exposure to DeFi, NFTs, and scalable infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Sleeper Hit Among Best Altcoins to Buy Now While XRP and Solana are proven giants, the real excitement is around emerging altcoins — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly being labeled by insiders as one of the top altcoins to watch for breakout returns in 2025.

Some analysts are already calling it the next 10x–15x altcoin — with even higher upside possible as crypto sentiment continues to improve. The Best Altcoins to Buy Are the Ones You Catch Early While XRP and Solana will likely remain on the list of the top altcoins to watch , the massive gains are harder to come by when much of the market already knows about them.

Ether's recent outperformance versus bitcoin suggests further rotation, making me cautious on bitcoin until relative strength improves. IBIT's volatility is at historic lows, and a 10% pullback to $61 would present a more attractive entry point for adding exposure. Seasonal weakness in August-September and bearish technical divergences warrant patience, but I remain bullish on bitcoin's long-term outlook. I turned neutral on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) in Q2. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency led the broader equity market recovery off the April low, catapulting from under $75,000 in the spring to, for a moment, a new all-time high last week above $124,000. My June hold rating looked at market data but bypassed what was happening on the chart, along with relative price trends to bitcoin’s little brother, ether. So, today I’m revisiting IBIT, but through a fresh and updated lens. I keep my hold rating when scanning these data. As holder of the fund myself (in a taxable account), I’ll call out other notable features that keep me bullish over the long haul. Bitcoin: An Unimpressive All-Time High Last Week, Back Below $120,000 StockCharts.com First, we must acknowledge the intense bullish price action with ether. In my view, this is part of the reason why bitcoin has not thrust much above its January high. The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain network was down 57% at the year-to-date low shortly after Liberation Day. Fast forward not even five months, and ETH is now outpacing bitcoin, gold, and the S&P 500 so far in 2025. Notice in the YTD performance chart below that the red line (bitcoin relative to ether) has been trending lower since late April. That augurs for a long play on the asset in the denominator (ether). For me to turn more bullish on bitcoin, I’d like to see it hook higher on this relative chart. To be clear, IBIT is higher by a more-than-respectable 25% since December 31, 2024. I’ll note later that it sports robust risk-adjusted returns, too. ETH > BTC YTD BTC YTD"" contenteditable=""false""> StockCharts.com Last week, ether caught an even larger tailwind when Fundstrat’s Tom Lee published a report predicting that the token could reach five figures by year-end. A $10,000 to $12,000 price target is bold, and (in my technical expertise) the sanguine outlook really depends on ether rising above its November 2021 all-time high. That remains to be seen. If the breakout occurs, I would not be surprised to see a bitcoin selloff a bit as more money rotates from bitcoin and into ether. Tom Lee: Ether Will More Than Double By Year-End Fundstrat These are incredible prices. I posted on X that, in a sign of the times, Strategy’s (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor is now (comfortably) wealthier than legendary hedge fund manager George Soros. Saylor ranks No. 441 on the world’s richest list, compared to 480 for Soros, largely thanks to bitcoin hovering near its all-time high. Sign Of The Times: Saylor Wealthier Than Soros Bloomberg To be clear, I like bitcoin long-term. Despite having a high correlation with the Nasdaq 100 over recent years, if we zoom out the chart, we see that bitcoin’s price action largely mimics the growth of the global M2 money supply. As illustrated below, Deutsche Bank asserts that the next leg higher in bitcoin may be overdue in light of the sharply rising amount of liquidity shuffling through markets. Bitcoin: A Practical Long-Term Hedge Against Money Printing Globally Deutsche Bank I hinted at bitcoin's solid risk-adjusted returns earlier. Indeed, last Friday’s Goldman Sachs US Weekly Kickstart report tallied bitcoin as on par with gold at the top of the 2025 performance stack. The Sharpe Ratio is well above 0, despite it being below that of gold and US junk bonds. I think that metric could improve over the months ahead. Let me explain. Asset Class Performances YTD Through August 15 Goldman Sachs You see, IBIT’s implied volatility is near an all-time low, under 40%. Its historical volatility is even more depressed, near 30%. The rally off the April low has been quite orderly. Should that persist through the end of the year, then the Sharpe Ratio would only improve further. Of course, IBIT holders know well that volatility can creep up with little notice. Are we due for a pullback? I would not be surprised. Let’s forge ahead with this technical view. IBIT: Very Low Implied Volatility, Even Softer Realized Volatility Fidelity August and September are the worst months of the year for bitcoin, historically speaking. Now through the end of Q3 has featured bouts of volatility, corrections, and even bear markets. So far, bitcoin bulls are holding their own, with the cryptocurrency up 1%. Ergo, a cautious stance is warranted through September, in my opinion. Bitcoin: Weak August-September Calendar Bias Barchart Bitcoin: Bearish Seasonal Trends Through Q3 Jeffrey Hirsch @AlmanacTrader Bitcoin Up Slightly In August, Half-Way Through The Month Koyfin Charts The Technical Take Now let’s point out some key price points on IBIT’s chart, something readers may have wished for in my previous assessment. Notice in the chart below that the technical situation looks decent on the surface—higher highs and higher lows. But there are risks. The RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph has printed a series of lower highs in what technical analysts would call bearish divergence to price. With waning upside momentum, I feel there is now a material chance that IBIT eventually tags its long-term 200-day moving average. I like that it is on the rise, but we saw during the April selloff and bounce that fast moves toward the 200dma can occur. When might that happen? It could take several weeks, based on where support is found. IBIT’s previous high in the range of $60 to $61 has confluenced with the symmetrical triangle (or coil) pattern from late in the first half to the start of the third quarter. That’s also where a high amount of volume by price enters the picture. Thus, a 10% pullback from here would make for a favorable entry point. IBIT: Expects A Dip To $61, Weakening Momentum StockCharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on IBIT. This refreshed look at the technicals, including relative price action to ether, which has come on strong since mid-April, asserts that there’s more near-term downside risk to bitcoin's price. I don’t plan to sell and would consider adding to the position if IBIT retreats to $61. The long-term outlook remains bright.",ETHA|ETH-USD|BTC-USD|IBIT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-17 03:15:50
