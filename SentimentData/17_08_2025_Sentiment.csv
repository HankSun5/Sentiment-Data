For the players: because then they actually own their assets, the free market prices them, and they can win in real life when they win in the game. For everyone: easier global access, lower platform fees.” The optimism, however, was quickly challenged by skeptics who say the track record of GameFi speaks for itself. Roblox, not Fortnite John Wang, co-founder of Armor Labs and a former product manager at Immutable , a Web3 gaming platform, replied directly to Pollak’s post, asking, “Why would it be better for the game company for their game to be onchain?” Wang argued that games like Roblox already provide a developer-first platform with APIs for nearly every financial interaction imaginable. “I think going onchain is strictly worse for them because lower fees + worse experience,” he said. He pointed to Roblox’s deep analytics capabilities, including tagging every UI component for retention and clickthrough rates, logging every trade, and regional pricing. Pollak pushed back, noting that Roblox is not Fortnite. He continued his argument by claiming that a decade of experience working in the field has convinced him that on-chain systems can support a “more expressive and powerful set of financial and other APIs than web2 servers.” Still, Wang countered that permissioned restrictions in Web2 platforms can sometimes be better for developers and players, urging Pollak to look more closely at Roblox as a model for what sustainable gaming platforms with product–market fit actually look like. The exchange quickly drew in other voices from Crypto Twitter, many of whom pointed to the repeated failures of GameFi projects to scale or retain users. GameFi is a faltering sector The back-and-forth brought out the current realities surrounding blockchain gaming, which peaked in 2022. Since then, it has largely failed to maintain momentum. Axie Infinity , once the poster child of play-to-earn, collapsed under the weight of an unsustainable token economy and security failures. Its Ponzi-like dynamics left many players in debt when new user growth slowed. Axie Infinity’s market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap A recent analysis found that blockchain games suffer from high churn, with more than 60% of users reportedly leaving within 30 days. Other challenges plaguing blockchain gaming are the low adoption and high costs, with more gamers still hooked on gaming on Web2 platforms. In the meantime, platforms like Immutable are working on bridging both Web2 and Web3 gaming platforms by leveraging partnerships with gaming heavyweights such as Ubisoft. Critics also argue that most projects have prioritized speculative token models over the actual fun of playing games. The result has been short-lived hype cycles rather than sustainable communities. However, while progress has been slow and challenging, the GameFi industry is still growing, with a market cap of $13.2 billion. Play-to-earn games dominate the GameFi sector. Source: CoinGecko Can on-chain gaming still work? For Pollak, the ability to build “more powerful APIs” and introduce transparent, composable economies outweighs the current challenges. He also stated that on-chain systems can still incorporate permissioned restrictions when needed, countering Wang’s point about the benefits of centralized controls. Pollak’s posts may reignite new projects in the GamFi space, and maybe Pollak himself may commit resources to bring games on-chain, find solutions to their unique challenges, and scale. For now, the skeptics seem to have the stronger case as the failures of past GameFi projects loom large. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Bitcoin wallet “19D5J8”, which has been dormant for five years, transferred 3,000 BTC ($353.16 million) from its 23,969 BTC ($2.82 billion) holdings to a new wallet. The whale wallet's last transaction, on December 13, 2020, was trading at around $20,000. At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $117,000. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation-affiliated wallet 0xF39d sold 7,294 ETH ($33.25 million) at an average price of $4,558 over the past three days. The wallet previously attracted attention in June 2022 when it bought 33,678 ETH ($40.2 million) at an average price of $1,193.

Over 15250 investors have already invested in the project presale, while over $14.45 million has been raised. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Stage 6 of Presale at $0.035, or 16.67% higher than the last stage. Stage 7 will experience another 14.29% rise in price to $0.04. While DOGE’s trajectory remains tied to broader market trends and adoption currents, Mutuum Finance is trending for its yield management features and inclusion of asset lending, an area that some researchers believe can surpass mainstream memecoins in the upcoming cycle. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Long-Term Targets Within Reach as Speculation Takes Center Stage Dogecoin (DOGE), priced at $0.253 currently, is at the center of attention with experts laying out possible paths towards the $1 mark. Crypto analyst KrissPax argues that DOGE’s past 4-year cycle patterns can support a bull run to $1 or even to $2 in the later part of this year, based on its cyclical meme-cycle repetition. CoinPedia, for its part, offers the more optimistic estimate of $1.07 in 2025, based on estimated growth in trading volume, with scope for a bearish downmove to $0.62 in bear markets. More traditional CoinCodex models predict DOGE to trade an average of $0.27 in 2025 within a $0.23–$0.34 range, citing medium-upside estimates. Those figures contrast with growing interest in newer DeFi tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are attracting attention for potentially higher long-term upside. Mutuum Finance Announces Launch of Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has finished Phase 5 of its presale and has entered Phase 6, wherein its tokens on sale sell for $0.035. Its price appreciation in the future will increase the price of its tokens by 14.29% to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has so far raised over $14.45 million and over 15250 holders added. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Joins Forces with CertiK to Launch $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is collaborating with CertiK in launching Bug Bounty Program. The program will carry a reward pool of $50,000 USDT. Four categories i.e. low, minor, major and critical would be rewarded under the program. The program is the best execution of Mutuum Finance’s vision of building community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project also received a thorough audit by Certik on blockchain security and user fund protection. It is part of Mutuum Finance’s roadmap to an open institution-grade DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway where 10 users will be awarded $10,000 of MUTM tokens. It has also recently announced that a leaderboard system will reward the top 50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders bonus tokens. Mutuum Finance is a P2C and P2P lending protocol whereby high-return funds are completely owned by the customer. It is an end-to-end DeFi experience that’s highly bespoke to the customer’s needs and more secure, transparent, and flexible compared to a centralized lending product. Dogecoin aims for $1, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers greater potential in 2025. At $0.035 in stage 6, it will grow 14.29% to $0.04 at the next stage. Well more than $14.45M raised from 15,250+ investors enforces its dual lending framework, USD-pegged stablecoin, and 95.0 CertiK rating. With a $100K giveaway and $50K bug bounty, early buyers can earn good profits before the next price hike.

With institutional money flowing in at unprecedented levels, innovative blockchain upgrades rolling out, and investor confidence returning, it’s no surprise that analysts are spotlighting the top altcoins to watch — especially among layer-1 blockchain projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one new player among the giants that are seriously making noise. While the top two, Ethereum and BNB, are still taking most of the attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly positioning itself as one of the best alternative coins to get by today with a massive upside potential for those who come in first. Ethereum: The Institutional Powerhouse Nearing All-Time Highs Ethereum is once again proving why it’s the backbone of Web3 and DeFi. As of August 16, 2025, ETH is trading around $4,406, just 5% shy of its all-time high of $4,866 set in November 2021. With year-to-date gains exceeding 67%, Ethereum is drawing massive institutional attention, driven in large part by an unprecedented wave of ETF inflows. Just this month alone, Ethereum ETFs saw eight straight days of net inflows, totaling roughly $3.7 billion. On August 14 alone, Ethereum ETFs brought in over $639 million — with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust leading the charge with $520 million in a single day. Ethereum ETFs are now consistently outperforming Bitcoin ETFs in capital inflows, a clear signal of where institutional priorities are shifting. With major banks, corporations, and tech firms adding ETH to their treasuries, and over 28% of the supply now staked, Ethereum remains one of the best altcoins to buy for both short-term momentum and long-term value. BNB: Billion-Dollar Backing and Ecosystem Strength Fuel Growth If Ethereum is the institutional choice for DeFi and smart contracts, then BNB is the powerhouse of exchange-based infrastructure and adoption. In August 2025, BNB reached a new all-time high of $864 before slightly consolidating to around $840–$850. BNB’s fundamentals also remain strong. The chain now supports over 552 million wallet addresses and processes 4.5 million daily transactions. Weekly decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes top $2 billion, and the platform’s native wallet is responsible for over 82% of global crypto wallet transactions. With such an expansive ecosystem, BNB has quickly become one of the best altcoins to buy for investors betting on the continued growth of centralized and decentralized trading platforms. Analysts remain extremely bullish on BNB. Near-term targets range from $900 to $950, while long-term forecasts extend beyond $2,000 by early 2026. Speculation around a potential BNB ETF is also growing, especially given the SEC’s recent crypto-friendly tone and BNB’s structural similarity to Ethereum. Solana: High-Speed Innovation and Scalability Leadership No conversation about disruptive layer-1 blockchains in 2025 is complete without Solana. With a focus on ultra-fast transaction speeds, near-zero fees, and ongoing innovation at the protocol level, Solana continues to be one of the top altcoins to watch — especially as institutional attention shifts toward scalable alternatives to Ethereum. In August 2025, Solana implemented a series of major performance upgrades that are already reshaping the network’s throughput capabilities. The most notable is the “Alpenglow” governance proposal, which introduces new consensus mechanisms — Votor and Rotor — aimed at optimizing block propagation and validation speeds. If approved, early testing suggests the network could achieve sub-200 millisecond finality, a huge leap for real-time decentralized applications. Despite the recent market pullback, Solana is holding strong around the $190–$194 range, with significant investor confidence reflected in over $85 million in SOL outflows from exchanges — a bullish signal. The pending approval of a Solana spot ETF in the U.S. remains a key narrative, and analysts believe a green light could send SOL soaring well past its current resistance levels. With continuous innovation, active governance, and a robust developer ecosystem, Solana is clearly one of the best altcoins to buy if you’re betting on scalability and next-gen blockchain infrastructure. As it continues to expand its capabilities and attract serious institutional interest, Solana remains a top-tier layer-1 blockchain project that’s worth holding through the rest of 2025 and beyond. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Sleeper Giant Ready to Explode Often described as a mix of meme culture and serious decentralized finance (DeFi) ambition, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a leading blockchain project built for speed and financial freedom. With major announcements expected in Q4 2025, analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could easily deliver strong gains, especially if broader market momentum continues. MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned its place among the Top 3 Layer-1 blockchain projects expected to shake up the crypto market in 2025. Its strong focus on speed, low transaction fees, and innovative technology is gaining attention. As it continues to grow, experts believe it could become a major player in the space. For investors seeking the best altcoins to buy before the next leg of the bull run, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly hard to ignore. Conclusion In a year full of regulatory shifts, institutional involvement, and massive infrastructure upgrades, the crypto market is once again offering investors a chance to get ahead of the curve. While Ethereum, Solana and BNB dominate in adoption, scale, and capital flow, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the undiscovered gem — a high-upside project with the fundamentals, narrative, and momentum to deliver outsized returns. If you are a 2025 portfolio creator and are looking for the best altcoins to watch, then these layer-1 blockchain projects are the ones you should not miss out on. These projects present you with an opportunity either for a gradual growth backed by institutions or for a rapid breakthrough in the early-stage of development, so you can hardly go wrong with their picks.

After a high-visibility CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing, RUVI’s Phase 2 is 90% complete at $0.015. When it sells out, the token steps 33% to $0.020 in Phase 3, with a final presale price set at $0.070. With $3M raised, 230M tokens sold, and a holder base above 2,900, the lower-entry window is closing, and analysts say the setup could be a millionaire-maker for early backers. Why RUVI’s presale is accelerating CMC functions like crypto’s discovery engine. RUVI’s listing pushed it into trending sections and converted watchlists into buys right as supply tightened in Phase 2. Investors also like the clean price ladder, $0.015 now, $0.020 next (+33%), and $0.070 at presale close, because it rewards speed and removes guesswork. A completed CyberScope audit adds third-party credibility, while a partnership with major exchange WEEX boosts visibility and lays groundwork for smoother trading routes after the sale. A live leaderboard giveaway further nudges larger allocations as phases turn. Key milestones: $3M raised 230M tokens sold 2,900+ holders Phase 2 at 90% completion; $0.020 next (+33%) Final presale price: $0.070 CyberScope audit completed WEEX partnership announced Leaderboard giveaway live Real utility: a creator-first AI super app RUVI’s core advantage is product utility. The super app compresses the entire content lifecycle into one workspace so creators and teams can produce more with fewer tools and less time. Research trends: Identify high-demand topics across platforms to guide your content calendar. Create scripts: Generate channel-ready scripts tuned to brand voice and format (YouTube, Shorts, TikTok). Generate media: Produce images and videos natively to reduce tool sprawl and subscriptions. Streamline workflows: Plan, iterate, schedule, and publish from a single dashboard for consistent output. Who benefits? YouTubers, TikTokers, agencies, brands, and lean marketing teams that need speed, scale, and lower costs. By tying token relevance to daily creative workflows, RUVI aims to anchor demand in usage rather than speculation. Why TRX holders are moving TRX has scale, but outsized multiples are tougher at later stages. RUVI offers clear near-term catalysts, CMC-led visibility, a transparent price path, third-party audit, exchange alignment via WEEX, and real-world utility, giving early participants a cleaner shot at meaningful upside as phases flip. VIP tiers: modeled upside at a $1 valuation For larger allocations, RUVI’s VIP program illustrates how bonuses can amplify modeled outcomes if adoption scales: VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens, boosted by a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI. These are models, not guarantees, but they help explain why buyers are acting before the 33% price step to $0.020. Bottom line RUVI’s momentum is measurable: 90% through Phase 2 at $0.015, with a programmed move to $0.020 next and a $0.070 finish at presale close. Add CMC-driven discovery, a completed CyberScope audit, WEEX exchange alignment, verifiable traction ($3M raised, 230M tokens sold, 2,900+ holders), and a creator-first AI super app, and you get a high-growth story with tangible catalysts. That’s why TRX holders are securing allocations now. If you want AI exposure backed by real utility and a clear price ladder, acting before Phase 2 closes could make all the difference.

Market Psychology Shifts At Key XRP Price Targets Crypto pundit BarryC has outlined a psychological roadmap for what could happen in the broader market if XRP were to climb to significant price milestones such as $100 and $1,000. His perspective is not centered on technicals or market cap constraints but rather on how retail and institutional sentiment might evolve as the asset scales through different stages of valuation. According to BarryC’s report shared on X social media, early price moves such as $4 would likely be dismissed by many observers as insignificant. However, once XRP reaches the $10 to $15 range , a shift in sentiment begins. The analyst notes that as the token advances, some traders may feel uneasy, coping with the rally by convincing themselves that a crash is imminent and they can re-enter at lower prices. He further suggested that the turning point would come when XRP hits $100 . At this projected stage, panic could set in as disbelief grows that XRP, once thought of as a low-priced asset , could climb so high. The analyst stated that the narrative would shift from skepticism to urgency, with new buyers considering entering at levels they previously dismissed. BarryC highlighted that the climax of this psychological cycle would likely be at a $1,000 price level . Here, the analyst envisions massive FOMO dominating the market. He reveals that disbelief would give way to desperation as people scramble to buy even a fraction of what they would perceive as the only cryptocurrency being broadly utilized by banks and financial institutions worldwide. Expert Pushes Back With Market Cap Facts In contrast to BarryC’s psychological analysis, market experts like Crypto Town Podcast argue that such ambitious predictions are mathematically and economically unrealistic . The analyst’s response on X points out that if XRP were to ever hit $100, its market capitalization would surge from $185.08 billion to approximately $6 trillion. For comparison, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by value, currently holds a market cap of $2.3 trillion. At $1,000 per XRP, the projection becomes even more challenging to justify, as it would imply a whopping $60 trillion market cap. Crypto Town Podcast compares this extraordinary growth to that of gold, highlighting that the entire gold market capitalization sits roughly at $22.3 trillion. The analyst argues that it is highly improbable, if not impossible, for XRP to ever exceed gold’s market cap by threefold. The expert tempers expectations by suggesting that a more plausible long-term scenario would be XRP potentially reaching $30 , which would place its valuation near $2 trillion. Still, this outcome is seen as a distant prospect, requiring exceptional market adoption and favorable conditions.",XRP|BarryC|bitcoin|Crypto Town Podcast|fomo|gold|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-16 22:30:08

The community has turned its attention to Shiba Inu major updates like the expanding burn mechanism and Shibarium’s Layer 2 developments. These could prove critical for supply reduction and broader adoption. Alongside SHIB, investors are also eyeing new opportunities, with MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as the best altcoin to buy now. Shiba Inu: Forecasts, Major Updates, and the Battle for Recovery Analysts continue to publish bold targets for the Shiba Inu price forecast 2025. Benzinga projects a high of $0.00010 with an average of $0.00006, while Changelly estimates a maximum of $0.000059994 and an average of $0.000049995. Together, forecasts cluster between $0.00003 and $0.00010 — a strong range suggesting recovery potential. Shiba Inu burn data: Shibburn Over 3.7 million SHIB were burned in 24 hours, contributing to a total of more than 410 trillion tokens permanently removed from supply. The token is still down 85% from its October 2021 Shiba Inu all-time high, but with bullish predictions for 2025 and growing adoption, optimism is building. The ongoing debate around Shiba Inu vs Dogecoin highlights how SHIB differentiates itself with DeFi integration, NFT expansion, and more aggressive supply cuts. For long-term planners, building a future-proof portfolio ahead of the next crypto cycle and setting up accumulation strategies before the upcoming multi-year bull run are increasingly part of the conversation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investors Spot the Best Altcoin to Buy Now While SHIB price discussions dominate, a new player is attracting fresh attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being spoken about as the best crypto to buy now, thanks to its unique positioning in the meme coin space. The MAGACOIN hook is clear: while Shiba Inu fights to reclaim its all-time high, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising quickly with strong community energy and innovative tokenomics. Shiba Inu’s established brand gives it weight, but new investors are searching for upside beyond legacy meme coins. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides that early-stage excitement — earning its place in strategies where diversification is key. Final Word: Can SHIB Hit Its Targets While New Stars Rise? Reaching the Shiba Inu all-time high again would demand both adoption and consistent token burns, but the SHIB price prediction outlook for 2025 shows there’s room for recovery. Strong updates, active community support, and wider ecosystem use could help SHIB regain traction. At the same time, investors aren’t ignoring rising names. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining ground in discussions as the best altcoin to buy now, giving portfolio builders another option to consider. For those preparing for the next cycle, balancing proven names like SHIB with promising new entries like MAGACOIN could prove to be the smarter play.

More than 10,000 verified participants have already joined the presale, underscoring the strong demand for early access to one of the sector’s most talked-about new tokens. Analysts are ranking MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential 2025 moonshot altcoin , highlighting its combination of rapid capital inflows, technical foundations, and expanding ecosystem. Security and Transparency Through Audits Security remains a top priority for the project. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already completed a full audit with HashEx , providing investors with confidence in the platform’s smart contract integrity. A CertiK audit is currently in progress, with findings and reports set to be published publicly upon completion. Independent audits not only strengthen investor trust but also demonstrate the project’s commitment to transparency – a critical factor for long-term sustainability in the competitive crypto market. Funding Momentum and Community Growth The $12.5 million raised reflects both investor confidence and the project’s ability to capture market attention at an early stage. Analysts note that this capital, sourced from thousands of verified presale contributors, provides MAGACOIN FINANCE with a significant runway for development, marketing, and ecosystem expansion. The scale of participation also highlights the community momentum behind the project, often cited as a key driver in altcoin success stories like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Roadmap and Future Potential Looking forward, the MAGACOIN FINANCE development roadmap includes potential Tier 1 exchange listings , expanded features, and strategic partnerships. These milestones, while subject to market and regulatory conditions, represent important steps in broadening adoption and accessibility. Analysts argue that if executed successfully , these initiatives could position MAGACOIN FINANCE for exponential growth in 2025 and beyond. Why Newer Altcoins Can Deliver Bigger Returns One of the defining features of the crypto market is the potential for outsized returns, but those opportunities often shift over time. Established coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP offer relative security and liquidity, yet their massive market caps limit the scale of future growth. For example, doubling in value requires billions in new inflows — a far higher hurdle than smaller tokens face. This is where newer altcoins stand out. With lower initial valuations, they can move dramatically with even modest adoption or community momentum. Early backers of projects such as SEI and SOL witnessed extraordinary gains precisely because these tokens began small and captured investor imagination at the right moment. Analysts argue that today’s emerging projects, like MAGACOIN FINANCE, fit this narrative. With strong presale traction and expanding ecosystems, newer altcoins have the ability to deliver exponential upside while still in their formative stages. Of course, risks remain higher, but for investors willing to position early, the reward-to-risk profile can be far more attractive than in mature assets. Each market cycle proves the same lesson: the biggest returns often come from spotting tomorrow’s giants while they’re still small. Whale wallets have already begun accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE aggressively , pushing presale rounds to sell out faster than expected. With $12.5 million raised and allocations drying up quickly, analysts warn the window for early entry is closing fast . Once whales secure their positions, retail investors may find opportunities limited – making this one of the last chances to get in before broader adoption. Final Thoughts With a $12.5 million presale raise , over 10,000 early investors , MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most anticipated altcoins of the upcoming cycle. The combination of security audits, rewards for early investors, and a clear development roadmap sets it apart from the majority of new token launches. For investors seeking exposure to high-upside opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a 2025 moonshot candidate with the potential to deliver exponential long-term returns.

Predictions around Solana’s future are gaining traction, especially with institutional firms lining up forecasts between $350 and $520. Alongside this, many traders are scouting the best crypto to buy now, weighing Solana’s growth roadmap against other rising stars. Among those, MAGACOIN FINANCE is beginning to capture attention as a fresh project with strong upside potential. Solana Price Prediction 2025: Breaking Down the Forecasts AI-driven models and expert analysis are converging on one theme — Solana has room to grow. Multiple analysts expect the token to cross the $350 mark, with some projecting higher peaks toward $520 by year-end. The Solana price prediction 2025 rests on two key elements: institutional adoption and technical progress. VanEck’s autoregressive forecast model points to a possible market cap near $250 billion, backing its bold $520 year-end target. Meanwhile, the SEC’s final extension on Solana ETF applications — with issuers like Fidelity, Grayscale, and VanEck awaiting decisions — sets a definitive date of October 16, 2025. This timeline aligns directly with the $350 Solana at $350 forecast, creating a catalyst for market movement. For those scanning the top crypto to buy 2025, Solana continues to feature strongly thanks to its expanding ecosystem, speed, and developer activity. Hidden altcoin gems to accumulate before the next peak may exist, but Solana remains among the best altcoins for growth when factoring in institutional flows and ETF developments. Analysts believe this structure could support the Solana at $350 forecast, making it one of the best crypto to buy now for medium- to long-term investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Alternative With Stronger Upside AI predicts Solana could hit $350 by October 2025, yet analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE has even stronger upside as a future growth play. Positioned as a disruptive new entry, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum with investors searching beyond the big names. Unlike Solana, which has established itself as a top crypto to buy 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE appeals as a rising challenger with a narrative designed for long-term growth. Early backers view it as one of the best altcoins for growth, aiming to catch value before the mainstream notices. For traders looking at diversification, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an exciting alternative, especially for those positioning for the upcoming waves of altseason. Solana’s Path to $350 and Beyond The Solana price prediction 2025 narrative is gaining strength, with AI-driven forecasts and institutional projections aligning around the $350 to $520 range. The Solana growth roadmap shows clear steps toward scalability, adoption, and potential ETF-backed inflows. This makes Solana one of the best crypto to buy now and a strong contender for those focused on the medium-term market cycle. Yet, while Solana remains in focus, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a different kind of appeal — an emerging project with a rising profile that could challenge established players. For investors weighing the best altcoins for growth, both Solana and MAGACOIN FINANCE deserve attention, making them key names to watch in the next cycle.

SOL has caught attention after $40 million worth of transfers from whale wallets raised concerns about selling pressure, with $189 standing out as the key breakout level for a bullish reversal. XLM has strengthened its breakout potential after a clean move out of a bullish flag pattern. If current support levels remain intact, price targets extend toward $0.75, adding to the optimism surrounding its upward trajectory. Even with these developments, the most popular cryptocurrency analysis this quarter highlights Cold Wallet ($CWT) as the top contender. Stage 17’s $0.00998 entry compared to a confirmed $0.3517 listing locks in the largest ROI window before public trading. With $6.16M raised, more than 2 million active accounts ready at launch, and a cashback model rewarding every transaction, Cold Wallet enters the market with immediate adoption and proven utility. SOL Eyes $189 Breakout After Mass Whale Transfers Solana (SOL) is facing renewed volatility after whale wallets moved over 226,000 SOL, valued at nearly $40 million, to major exchanges such as Binance and Kraken. These transfers, tracked by Lookonchain, have stirred concerns about selling pressure ahead of the upcoming CPI inflation report. SOL is currently trading around $174.59, reflecting a 5% dip in the past 24 hours and still sitting 40% below its all-time high despite recent market gains. Trading activity has climbed 10% to $28.16 billion, showing that interest remains strong. However, the REX Osprey Solana ETF has recorded minimal inflows throughout August, raising questions about institutional confidence. Analysts see $189 as the breakout threshold. Stellar Targets $0.75 as Bullish Breakout Gains Momentum Stellar (XLM) has surged past a bullish flag pattern on the four-hour chart, opening the door for a run toward $0.75. This pattern emerged after a sharp rally from late June to mid-July, followed by a period of consolidation within a downward channel. The breakout zone between $0.42 and $0.45 has now flipped into strong support, giving buyers a clear defensive line. After retesting and rebounding from this support, XLM is holding its ground with the next targets set at $0.50 to $0.52. A decisive close above $0.52 would establish higher highs and reinforce bullish sentiment, while sustained momentum could carry the price toward mid-$0.60 levels and eventually $0.75. Cold Wallet’s Stage 17 Presale Offers the Largest ROI Window Before Listing Cold Wallet (CWT) is tackling one of Web3’s most persistent challenges, where participation often costs more than it returns. Through its CWT cashback rewards model, every interaction on the network becomes a profitable experience for users. Sending funds, paying gas fees, or swapping assets all generate rewards, creating a constant cycle of engagement and ensuring that activity stays high over time. The integration with Plus Wallet eliminates the typical cold-start issue, bringing over 2 million active accounts into the ecosystem on launch day. This ensures immediate liquidity and adoption from the moment trading begins. With $6.16M already raised in token sales and 733M coins sold, Cold Wallet enters the market with a fully funded foundation and proven interest from participants. Stage 17’s presale price of $0.00998 sits far below the confirmed $0.3517 listing price, offering early buyers an unmatched ROI potential of more than 3,400%. As this stage nears its close, the entry window for securing the largest possible price gap is rapidly narrowing. By joining now, buyers gain access to a ready-made ecosystem that is already functional, liquid, and built for scale from day one. Cold Wallet’s model positions it to bypass the post-launch struggles many projects face, replacing uncertainty with immediate adoption and sustained user engagement. Market Takeaways While Solana (SOL) presents short-term caution from whale activity and Stellar (XLM) offers a calculated breakout setup, neither matches the rare blend of scale, readiness, and ROI that Cold Wallet brings. This is a launch primed for impact, entering the market with over 2 million connected accounts, instant liquidity, and a live cashback system that rewards every transaction. At $0.00998 in Stage 17 against a confirmed $0.3517 listing, the current gap offers one of the most compelling ROI opportunities highlighted in this quarter’s most popular cryptocurrency analysis. With infrastructure complete, incentives active, and adoption secured, Stage 17 is the final deep-value entry before the market revalues Cold Wallet.

He noted that the Trump–Putin meeting delivered a productive outcome, which could fuel a positive reaction in the market if conditions remain steady. Daily Candle Shows Slight Bearish Bias, Yet Indecisive In his update, CRYPTOWZRD noted that Bitcoin’s daily candle closed slightly bearish. The analyst explained that although the close leaned to the downside, he would still consider the overall signal indecisive. Related Reading: Bull Case For Bitcoin At $300,000 Triggers After Reaching Critical Level Turning attention to external factors, CRYPTOWZRD highlighted that the recent meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska was productive. He pointed out that this development could create a favorable atmosphere in the broader crypto market, which may spill over into Bitcoin, unless the situation changes later on. At the same time, CRYPTOWZRD stressed that traders cannot overlook the traditional markets, where the weekly candle closed bearish. He described this as an early warning sign that should not be dismissed, as it may serve as a precursor to deeper corrections if unexpected developments occur. In his view, this makes it necessary to remain alert, even in the face of seemingly positive momentum elsewhere. While a productive geopolitical meeting may boost investor confidence, the bearish weekly signal in traditional markets is a reminder that conditions can quickly shift. As for his approach, CRYPTOWZRD stated that his focus remains on the lower timeframe chart formations. He believes this is where quick scalp opportunities are likely to emerge, allowing traders to capture movement without being overly exposed to sudden swings. By tracking these intraday setups, he intends to navigate the volatility while waiting for clearer signals on Bitcoin’s next larger move. Bitcoin Choppy Price Action Limits Clear Setups Rounding up his analysis, CRYPTOWZRD observed that the intraday chart for Bitcoin remained somewhat choppy and leaned bearish. He explained that price action has been confined within a relatively small range, making it less favorable for immediate trading decisions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Hits 2-Year Low As 30-Day Range Tightens He emphasized that the key level to watch on the upside is $119,500. According to the expert, a move above this threshold would shift Bitcoin into bullish territory, creating a potential long opportunity. Until that breakout occurs, he prefers to remain cautious rather than force trades in uncertain conditions. On the downside, CRYPTOWZRD noted that a break below $117,000 would signal further weakness and open the door for short positions. For now, he concluded that an ideal approach is to wait for the next decisive move before taking action.

The real challenge is identifying projects with both strong fundamentals and growing community traction. Some are already posting impressive fundraising figures, while others are building practical products and fostering active ecosystems ahead of launch. This list examines four projects currently attracting significant attention: BlockDAG, Maxi Doge, Snorter Bot, and SpacePay. While each takes a different approach to entering the market, all share the potential to deliver strong returns if their roadmaps are executed successfully. Whether it’s a major technological advantage, a memorable brand identity, or a targeted payment solution, these projects are shaping up to be part of the most popular crypto presales heading into 2025. 1. BlockDAG: $375M Raised and Accelerating BlockDAG integrates Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus and full EVM compatibility to achieve high transaction throughput, strong security, and the flexibility of smart contracts. This combination allows the project to match DAG systems’ scalability while retaining the security benefits of PoW. The approach has resonated strongly with early participants, resulting in more than $375 million raised during its presale. Over 25 billion BDAG coins have been sold, with Batch 29 pricing each coin at $0.0276. Analysts have suggested that with robust exchange adoption, a $1 price target could be possible post-launch. Community engagement and infrastructure are already well in place before the official debut. The X1 Mobile Miner App has amassed over 2.5 million active users, while more than 200,000 holders are already involved in the network. Development is thriving, with over 4,500 developers working on 300+ decentralized applications. Additionally, the sale of more than 19,000 mining units demonstrates early product traction. To prepare users for the market, BlockDAG offers a live demo trading platform that allows wallet testing and practice transactions in a risk-free environment. With 20 confirmed exchange listings, including MEXC, BitMart, LBank, Coinstore, and XT.com, and plans to enter Coinbase and Gemini, BlockDAG is combining advanced technology, active adoption, and a clear listing roadmap. It’s a frontrunner among the most popular crypto presales of 2025. 2. Maxi Doge: Meme Appeal with Built-In Utility Maxi Doge blends the playful nature of meme culture with tangible feature plans. While many meme coins rely entirely on hype, Maxi Doge’s roadmap includes token rewards, staking capabilities, and light NFT integrations to give holders reasons to stay long term. The approachable and humorous branding ensures accessibility, but beneath the fun is a more structured product vision. Its presale has attracted attention through active community events, social engagement campaigns, and loyalty incentives for holders. The low entry price helps it appeal to a broad audience, from casual crypto fans to buyers seeking upside potential coupled with planned functionality. By combining entertainment with early-stage utility, Maxi Doge is positioned to stand out among meme tokens and could prove resilient in a market where many fade after launch. 3. Snorter Bot: Designed for Speed and Ease of Use Snorter Bot is being built for those who value speed, affordability, and simplicity in their crypto interactions. Its focus is on fast, low-cost transactions within a clean, intuitive interface qualities that can appeal to both experienced traders and newcomers who prefer a smooth onboarding experience. The project’s presale is drawing interest thanks to its early buyer incentives and a roadmap aimed at increasing long-term engagement. Planned features include cross-chain compatibility to broaden network connections and a native rewards program for active users. At its current low presale pricing, Snorter Bot offers an accessible opportunity for early participation. If the team delivers on its promises, the project could emerge as a practical contender in the most popular crypto category for 2025, serving users who want both performance and simplicity. 4. SpacePay: Making Crypto Payments Effortless SpacePay is aiming squarely at the payments sector, with the goal of making cryptocurrency spending seamless across different regions and currencies. The vision is to integrate with existing payment systems so users can pay in crypto without dealing with complex conversions or multiple wallets. This focus on ease of use for both merchants and end-users addresses one of the biggest hurdles to mainstream crypto adoption. During its presale, SpacePay is offering tokens at an appealing entry price to attract early supporters. Its roadmap includes partnerships with online and offline retailers, enabling real-world purchases in crypto, as well as the launch of a mobile wallet app and integration with point-of-sale systems. While payments is a competitive space, SpacePay’s emphasis on smooth cross-border transactions gives it a distinct advantage. For those tracking the most popular crypto presales with clear utility, SpacePay’s practical payment focus makes it a noteworthy candidate. BlockDAG Extends Its Lead Each of these projects brings unique strengths. BlockDAG is far ahead in both fundraising and ecosystem preparation, backed by millions of active users and a targeted exchange rollout. Maxi Doge adds depth to meme coin appeal by planning functional features. Snorter Bot targets speed and ease, appealing to users across experience levels. SpacePay is tackling real-world payments, a critical step for mass adoption. The presale phase is often where the greatest potential lies, provided the project delivers on its roadmap. These four have distinguished themselves by taking active steps toward tangible goals before launch. For those positioning early in 2025, understanding each project’s trajectory and community engagement will be crucial. Among them, BlockDAG’s combination of cutting-edge technology, significant fundraising success, and large, engaged community places it firmly ahead in the race for the most popular crypto presales. As the market moves closer to launch windows, these projects will be the ones to watch closely.

Bitcoin has found its footing above $120,000, and altcoins are starting to stir with fresh momentum. If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the right entry point ahead of the next full-blown bull run, this might be it. While the usual giants like Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to lead, the biggest gains often come from earlier-stage plays that combine strong narratives with growing adoption. Based on market chatter, analyst reports, and early investor sentiment, here are three altcoins, including Magacoin Finance, that are climbing to the top of trader watchlists — and why each could play a defining role in the next breakout cycle. BlockDAG: A High-Risk, High-Reward Layer-1 with Bold Targets First up is BlockDAG (BDAG) — a Layer-1 project that’s turning heads with its aggressive upside projections. The token is still flying under the radar, but a growing number of analysts are pointing to its EVM compatibility and scalable architecture as catalysts for long-term growth. Some forecasts are even targeting a $1 price tag, which would represent a 55x gain from current levels — a bold call, but not unprecedented in past altcoin cycles. BlockDAG has the core features that tend to attract developers: high throughput, Ethereum tooling, and low fees. But it’s also in the phase where most of its gains (and risks) are still ahead. A few X accounts this week referred to it as the “Arbitrum of 2025,” though others cautioned about its volatility. Bottom line: BDAG offers serious potential, but it’s not for the faint of heart. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Political Underdog Altcoin Turning Into a Multi-Cycle Sleeper Then there’s MAGACOIN FINANCE — a coin many initially wrote off as another meme play, but that’s quickly building a real case as a multi-cycle contender. What started as a politically-themed token is now showing real traction with investors looking for early-stage assets backed by strong tokenomics, growing communities, and transparent audits. The project has passed its Hashex audit, and a CertiK audit is underway, bringing a degree of trust most meme coins never achieve. Its capped supply model and long-term incentives for holders — including staking rewards and unique bonus programs — have helped it attract both retail interest and early fund attention. Traders on X have started grouping MAGACOIN with early Dogecoin and Shiba Inu cycles — but with far more structure behind it. One community analyst described it this week as “a meme with a memory — and a roadmap,” suggesting that MAGACOIN could play a serious role in the 2025–2026 alt season. If MAGACOIN Finance continues on its current trajectory, some believe it could surprise the market with 10x to 30x upside, especially once major listings and influencer awareness kick in. It’s still early, but the buzz is real — and it’s growing. Solana: The Quiet Giant Setting Up for a Second Wave Last but not least is Solana (SOL) — already a blue-chip in its own right, but still seen as underpriced by many. Currently trading about 33% below its previous all-time high, SOL has a strong case for another explosive move if the broader market rallies. What’s driving the renewed confidence? A few things: Solana continues to dominate DEX volume, its developer onboarding rates are outpacing Ethereum, and new network upgrades like Firedancer are designed to further boost scalability. Meanwhile, DeFi and NFT activity on Solana is heating up again, and funds that largely ignored SOL during the 2022–2023 downturn are now quietly accumulating. While the upside on Solana might not be as extreme as smaller-cap plays, analysts believe it could 3x to 5x in a strong bull market — a huge move for a Layer-1 of its size. As one trader said in a recent Telegram group: “Solana’s no longer trying to be Ethereum’s killer — it’s just building in its own lane. And that lane is fast, cheap, and getting crowded.” Final Thoughts: The Altcoin Smart Money Is Watching The next altcoin cycle won’t be a repeat of the last one. The market is more informed, more skeptical — and more selective. That’s why coins like BlockDAG, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Solana are getting extra attention. Each one sits at a different stage of maturity, but all three are aligned with core themes investors are betting on: scalability, adoption, and early positioning. For those seeking moonshot potential, BlockDAG and MAGACOIN may deliver those 20x to 50x plays — but with higher risk. Solana offers a more established path, and may anchor portfolios seeking explosive growth without starting from scratch. No matter your approach, now is the time to start narrowing your list. Because when this market moves — it tends to move fast and in only the direction of Magacoin Finance.

His outline is broadly consistent with other highly optimistic perspectives within the XRP community, where many regard the current price of $3.06 as an early point in a longer adoption cycle. Pantoja contends that an initial rise to around $4 would not materially change the broader narrative among skeptics. In his view, critics would frame such a move as incremental rather than meaningful, and many would continue to discount XRP’s prospects. He expects sentiment to shift more noticeably if the asset trades in a $10–$15 band . At that juncture, he anticipates growing unease among sidelined participants who delayed buying; some may state they intend to re‑enter only if the price returns to sub‑$1 territory. $XRP at $4 → mocking: “lol just $4” $XRP at $10–15 → discomfort: “I’ll buy back in under $1” $XRP at $100 → panic: “It was never supposed to get this high” $XRP at $1,000 → full-blown FOMO, and supply crunch and mania. pic.twitter.com/harNxhUEry — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) August 15, 2025 This assessment aligns with earlier remarks from analyst BarriC , who argued that a sustained move into double digits would force long‑standing critics to reassess why XRP is advancing after a period of relative underperformance versus Bitcoin. According to Pantoja, a print near $100 would represent a decisive point for market psychology. He expects a broad recognition that the move is more significant than many anticipated, prompting a wave of late risk‑taking from those who previously dismissed the asset. The step into three‑digit pricing is also where some analysts connect valuation to potential utility in tokenized financial markets. Versan Aljarrah of Black Swan Capitalist has argued that pricing in the hundreds could be consistent with a role for XRP as a settlement bridge across tokenized assets and cross‑border payments. He has maintained that a low‑single‑digit valuation limits liquidity for large flows, implying that materially higher prices could be a functional requirement rather than solely an expression of speculation. $1,000 and Market Behavior Pantoja’s framework suggests that a move toward $1,000 would likely coincide with intense demand, limited available supply, and pronounced attempts by new buyers to obtain exposure. Community advocates often cite XRP’s issuance constraints and burn mechanisms as potential contributors to scarcity under heavy institutional usage. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Some projections extend even further. Crypto entrepreneur Jake Claver has claimed that, under scenarios involving large‑scale institutional settlement, XRP might need to command prices around $10,000 to support throughput at very high notional volumes. Supporters of this view argue that capacity and liquidity considerations at network scale could necessitate higher valuations, while acknowledging that such numbers remain contentious. Counterarguments and Valuation Concerns Skeptics challenge the feasibility of extreme targets. At $1,000 per token , XRP’s implied valuation would be on the order of tens of trillions of dollars, far above the capitalization of global equity markets today. Critics, therefore, regard four‑digit pricing as inconsistent with current market structure, available capital, and the pace of institutional deployment. Currently, XRP trades at $3.11 , well below the levels described in these scenarios. Nevertheless, a sizable portion of the community views present prices as an accumulation window ahead of potential future integration into broader financial infrastructure. Pantoja’s staged roadmap, spanning $4, the $10–$15 area, $100, and ultimately $1,000, offers a clear lens on how sentiment could change if XRP advances through successively higher thresholds. Supporters connect higher prices to prospective utilities in tokenized markets and cross‑border settlement, whereas critics focus on the scale implied by multi‑trillion‑dollar capitalizations.

It has moved from hype-driven sales and overpriced JPEGs to one focused on practical utility, integration, and real-world applications. But even utility is not enough to drive sales and attention. You need a powerful marketing plan. Here are our top 15 NFT marketing strategies to stand out in 2025. Where is the NFT Market Today? NFTs, or non fungible tokens , are simply digital assets based on blockchain technology, popularly Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, among others. Unlike Bitcoin and other cryptos, non-fungible tokens are non-interchangeable and represent ownership of items like art, collectibles, or virtual goods. In their early days, NFTs were synonymous with speculative hype—think Beeple’s Everydays: the First 5000 Days selling for $69.3 million or Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs fetching millions. “The Merge” by Pak is the most expensive NFT, selling for a record $91.8 million in December 2021. Many celebrities got into the trend, including Snoop Dogg, Kelvin Hart, Jimmy Fallon, Serena Williams, Justin Bieber, Shaquille O’Neal, and others. Big brands weren’t left out. Nike, Wendy’s, Louis Vuitton, Starbucks, Gucci, Adidas, Coca-Cola, Amazon, Walmart, etc., all dabbled in the NFT market. By mid-2022, however, the market crashed, with trading volumes plummeting from $24.9 billion in 2021 to a fraction of that, and floor prices for collections like Bored Apes dropping 95%. This meltdown weeded out unsustainable NFT projects, shifting focus to utility and sustainability. In 2025, the NFT market is thriving again, as July data reveals a 69% surge in NFT market cap, reaching $4.8 billion. Rather than speculation, the new NFT market is being driven by practical use cases, especially as gaming assets, which now account for 38% of total NFT volume. NFT market 2025-2029 outlook by Technavio The NFTs market capitalization is projected to reach $84.13 billion from 2025 to 2029, at a 41.9% CAGR. Why is NFT Marketing Important? 1. Visibility The target audience in the NFT market is relatively small compared to the broader cryptocurrency market. Not just that, hundreds of new NFT projects are launched every month. You could easily get lost in the noise without a solid marketing plan. 2. Trust The 90% price crash and scam-heavy 2022–2023 period eroded buyer confidence. You need to reassure your target audience by communicating your project’s roadmap, team, and long-term vision. 3. Community Back then, having a solid community was one of the top metrics buyers used to determine a good NFT project. That’s still the case even in the new NFT market setting. Good NFT marketing strategies like hosting AMAs, storytelling, and events can help you attract, engage, and retain a passionate community. 4. Highlight Utility NFT marketing is how you get to showcase your project’s real-world or digital benefits. That is how you capture attention and differentiate your projects from the thousands in the market. 5. Drive Sales Marketing and sales go hand in hand. Using NFT marketing techniques like teasers, countdowns, and behind-the-scenes content can generate the “hype” necessary for a successful drop. That’s how some projects are able to sell out faster than others. 15 Best NFT Marketing Strategies Here are our top 15 NFT marketing tips suited for the current NFT market to help your project gain visibility, trust, drive sales, and build a solid community. 1. List on Multiple NFT Marketplaces Listing on multiple NFT marketplaces allows you to spread the net wider to reach more buyers. Most of the popular NFT marketplaces today are multi-chain, including OpenSea and Magic Eden. This means that an Ethereum NFT collection launched on OpenSea can also be listed on Magic Eden, and vice versa. The same goes for non-fungible tokens on other blockchains like Base, Solana, etc. The benefit is that your project becomes visible to users of these platforms, which can result in more sales. 2. Build an NFT Community Building a community should be one of the first things to do before dropping your NFT collection. In fact, an engaged community is your most effective NFT marketing agency, per se. When your community members are passionate, they become brand ambassadors who share news, defend the project, and create a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) that attracts new buyers. All of these create organic hype and awareness, which is far more powerful and credible than any paid advertisement. Also, they are your top resource for constructive feedback, and listening to them makes them feel valued. That’s how you build trust. 3. Host Regular AMA Sessions Hosting “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) sessions is one way of grooming a solid community for your project. The benefits are far-reaching. When you host AMA sessions, usually on Discord or X (formerly Twitter), you put a face to your NFT project, demonstrating that the team is not hiding under an anonymous project. It’s also a two-way street where the community gets answers to questions and you get real-time feedback. AMAs are the best time to address concerns, share project roadmaps, and clarify utilities. 4. Collaborate With Influencers and Brands (Influencer Marketing) New NFT projects usually have limited reach on social media platforms, and it’s more difficult to grow an audience. In this case, the most effective NFT marketing technique would be leveraging crypto and NFT influencers, brands, and marketing agencies. That’s the shortcut. Partnering with well-known influencers or brands vouches for your project, and with them, you can instantly expose your non-fungible tokens to thousands or even millions of people who already trust the partner’s recommendations. It’s not just about growing followers and reaching millions. Collaborating with influencers can help you reach targeted communities. For instance, if your project is about gaming, partnering with gaming influencers brings your project in front of gamers. 5. Use Social Media Marketing At this point, it should already be clear that using social media is an indispensable NFT marketing strategy in 2025. Your target audience and potential collectors are mostly on social media platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. In order to reach them, you need to be active on there. Social media is where you get to interact and share updates on your project every step of the way. Also, you can run ads on these platforms with a marketing agency. Social media marketing is less expensive than the traditional route and can have a wider reach. 6. Try Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and NFT Advertising SEO is a much cheaper and sustainable NFT marketing strategy for driving traffic to your project outside of social media platforms. Optimizing your website, blog, and marketplace listings to rank for keywords like “NFT utility” or “Web3 gaming” on Google and Bing search engines draws more clicks. It’s also a vouch of authority and legitimacy for your project. Some of the basic SEO practices include optimizing your website structure to be fast, mobile-friendly, and easy to navigate, creating high-quality, valuable content, and adding descriptive titles and meta tags for every page and blog post on your website. 7. Submit Your NFT Collections to Digital Art Calendars NFT calendars, also known as drop listing websites, consolidate upcoming drops from various marketplaces, simplifying the search for collectors. Some of the popular ones include NFTCalendar.io , NFT Drops Calendar, Rarity Sniper, and Nifty Drops. The people browsing NFT calendars are not casual onlookers. They are either collectors, investors, or enthusiasts who are actively looking for new projects to mint. So, listing on one or more such platforms ensures the target audience finds your collection when browsing for vetted opportunities. A listing on a well-known NFT calendar can lend your project an air of legitimacy. Some of these platforms usually feature a countdown clock, which can create a sense of urgency and anticipation. 8. Use Email Marketing Email marketing may sound a bit traditional, but it’s still an effective strategy in NFT marketing. With email, you have a direct and reliable way of communicating or passing information to community members only. It basically allows you to pass important announcements, like an upcoming drop or an exclusive giveaway, exclusively to your community. Also, email marketing can help with conversion. You can craft messages with a single, clear call to action, such as “Mint Now,” “Join Discord,” or “View the Collection.” 9. Try Whitelisting Strategy Whitelisting is another important NFT marketing strategy, but there can also be downsides to it. When you whitelist your project with added perks like early or discounted access, it can create a sense of exclusivity and even FOMO (fear of missing out) among collectors. Also, whitelisting can help spread out the minting process and reduce the number of people competing at once, especially on blockchains like Ethereum, where a “gas war” can be a problem. However, you also have to make sure that the whitelisting process is not too strict, because it can inadvertently exclude some of the target audience who are unable to meet the requirements. 10. Use NFT Marketing Agencies If you have the budget or a small team lacking marketing skills, then it wouldn’t hurt to consider the services of an NFT marketing agency. NFT marketing agencies are another shortcut. They already have a finger on the pulse of the market. They know which platforms are trending on social media, which communities are active, and which strategies would be the most effective for your NFT projects. They usually have connections with influencers, communities, and platforms like X or Discord, which could give your NFT project instant access to a network that otherwise would have taken you months, if not years, to gain. 11. Launch Airdrops Airdrop is one of the most popular strategies that crypto and other digital asset projects use to grab attention. You can incorporate that, too, in your NFT marketing checklist. You can use airdrops to reward early adopters, your community members, and even get people to perform certain tasks. A well-promoted airdrop campaign can create a buzz that will lead to a surge in social media mentions, community sign-ups, and website traffic. Airdrops are not just about rewards. You can use it to add value to your NFT project and community. In 2021, Bored Ape Yacht Club famously airdropped “Mutant Serums” to their NFT holders, fueling the project’s hype and engagement during the NFT market’s speculative peak. BAYC Mutant Serums 12. Create Digital Assets Gamification Campaigns Gamification is one important NFT marketing technique to drive sustained engagement on your project. You don’t necessarily have to build a full-fledged game, but you can adopt some game mechanics, such as points, leaderboards, quests, and rewards, to create an interactive experience that motivates people to continually participate in your project. You can start by hiding clues or puzzles across your social media channels, website, and Discord server. The first people to solve the puzzles or find the hidden objects win a prize, such as a rare NFT, a whitelist spot for an upcoming drop, or a valuable cryptocurrency token. 13. Leverage a DAO DAO means a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). They are very influential in Web3, and leveraging them is somewhat of a unique NFT marketing strategy to tap into engaged communities. Having a DAO is also the ultimate form of community building. With it, you give your NFT holders the right to vote on proposals. They go from being collectors to co-owners, which gives a genuine sense of ownership and agency. A project governed by a DAO is inherently more sustainable because its direction is not dependent on a single founder or team. Crypto traders seem to love the idea of “community-run.” 14. Use Cross-Promotion With Other NFT Creators Cross-promotion is a marketing tactic where two different NFT projects work together to promote each other. It’s a “win-win” situation for both. We saw this happen a lot during the NFT market frenzy, where new and upcoming projects partner with well-performing ones, which is seen as a vote of confidence. In return, the new projects give exclusive whitelist access to members of the other community. There are many ways to execute cross-promotion. You can either try joint AMA sessions, giveaways, a limited-edition airdrop, or narrative collaboration. 15. Offer Staking or Reward Programs NFT staking is a process where a holder “locks” their non-fungible tokens in a smart contract for a set period to earn rewards. It is similar to staking cryptocurrencies, where users lock up their tokens to support a blockchain network and earn passive income. Staking adds tangible utility to your NFTs and gives the target audience a reason to buy and hold for the long term. It’s a good way to reduce the number of non-fungible tokens on the market and create a more stable “floor price.” Conclusion The NFT market is not dead, as data has shown it’s thriving and could reach $84.13 billion in market capitalization by 2029. However, the new NFT market dynamics have changed from what they used to be in 2021. The market is more mature and focused on utility, sustainability, and real-world applications. So, your NFT marketing plans should be built around this shift. If you intend to build a loyal community, you should consider NFT marketing plans like hosting regular AMAs, social media marketing, airdrops, and creating a DAO. If the goal is to boost, then cross-promotion, whitelisting, and collaborating with influencers should be on your bucket list of things to do.

Ronin, the sidechain best known for powering Axie Infinity, has announced its migration back to Ethereum Layer-2 networks. This move is designed to improve scalability, security, and interoperability—three critical factors for sustaining long-term adoption in the rapidly growing blockchain gaming industry. Amid these headlines, investor enthusiasm is heating up for presales, with MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as one of the most sought-after early-stage opportunities. The project has already surpassed $12.5 million in presale funding, highlighting just how much appetite there is for exposure to high-upside altcoins ahead of the next market rotation. Ronin Returns to Ethereum Layer-2 Ronin was originally created as a custom sidechain to serve Axie Infinity’s massive player base, providing faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum’s mainnet. However, the shift back to Ethereum Layer-2 solutions signals a new chapter for the network. By leveraging Ethereum’s established ecosystem and recent scaling advancements, Ronin aims to deliver a more secure and efficient gaming infrastructure. This migration reflects a broader trend of projects moving closer to Ethereum after experimenting with independent scaling solutions. With Ethereum’s rollup technology and modular design gaining traction, Layer-2 networks are becoming the preferred path for long-term sustainability and institutional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE Starting Momentum While Ethereum’s Layer-2 momentum captures headlines, early investors are turning their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE. The presale has become one of the hottest opportunities in 2025, crossing $12.5 million raised in record time. Analysts note that this kind of demand is rarely seen outside of meme coin frenzies, but what sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its structured ecosystem and long-term vision. The project has been compared to the early stages of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, where early movers enjoyed extraordinary gains. Forecasts suggest that $2,500 invested today could potentially multiply into $195,000 if MAGACOIN FINANCE follows similar breakout patterns. Such projections have placed the project firmly on the radar of forward-looking investors seeking the next big winner in altcoins. Why Ronin’s Move Matters for Ethereum Ethereum continues to assert itself as the central hub for decentralized finance, gaming, and tokenized assets. The return of Ronin reinforces Ethereum’s Layer-2 dominance and could spark similar migrations from other independent chains struggling to balance scalability and adoption. For investors, this highlights Ethereum’s unmatched ability to attract liquidity, projects, and developer activity even in the face of rising competition. If this trend accelerates, Ethereum Layer-2 networks may not just complement Ethereum but effectively become the backbone of blockchain gaming and high-frequency transactions. That long-term narrative is drawing capital from institutions, retail investors, and developers alike. Conclusion Ronin’s migration back to Ethereum Layer-2 underlines Ethereum’s growing strength in scalability and interoperability, setting the stage for broader adoption in gaming and beyond. At the same time, presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are proving to be a magnet for investor demand , with its $12.5 million raise underscoring the scale of interest. With forecasts hinting at exponential upside potential, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could emerge as one of the standout performers of this cycle .

50205300,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78782,1755388824,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Expert: This is the Hardest XRP Bull Market Ever, We Will Get Rich",https://timestabloid.com/expert-this-is-the-hardest-xrp-bull-market-ever-we-will-get-rich/,"Market analyst Steph has stated that XRP is undergoing its most difficult bull phase so far, but one that still has the potential to deliver significant returns. His comments follow the token’s renewed strength above the $3 mark . XRP briefly reclaimed this level in January 2025, the first time in seven years, before falling back below it and encountering repeated resistance. By mid-July, however, it had successfully regained the $3 threshold and had since established it as support, a development many observers view as technically favorable. Breakout From a Long-Term Trendline Steph’s analysis relies on the weekly chart, where XRP recently broke through a long-term descending trendline. This is the hardest #XRP bull market ever. Congratulations if you're still here. We will get rich! pic.twitter.com/cLltUs7MQj — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 12, 2025 He explained that such breakouts have historically preceded substantial price movements, although he described the current cycle as the hardest because it comes after extended consolidation and multiple failed attempts, conditions that often challenge market participants’ patience and risk tolerance. Historical Price Behavior Since 2022 The behavior of XRP around descending trendlines has been consistent since 2022. After the Terra market collapse in May of that year, the asset entered a prolonged downtrend. A breakout in September 2022 ended this stretch, carrying the price toward $0.55. Another descending line formed as XRP retreated from that level, remaining in place until July 2023. The favorable outcome in the SEC’s case against Ripple coincided with a breakout that pushed XRP to around $0.94. When the price later fell from that peak, it again established a downward structure, which persisted until the U.S. elections in November 2024. The subsequent breakout fueled a rally that culminated in a high of $3.4 in January 2025. Following this January peak, XRP declined and entered a five-month consolidation period around $2. This created yet another descending trendline, which was broken when the asset rallied above $3 in July. Steph regards this move as crucial, arguing that sustained closes above $3 confirm the breakout and strengthen the outlook for further gains. Conversely, a decisive loss of this level would weaken the bullish case and reintroduce the risk of $3 acting as resistance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts Set Target at $14 Steph projects that XRP could reach as high as $14 in this cycle. From the current price of $3.12, this would represent a gain of about 348%. He has congratulated those who held their positions through the initial reclaim of $3, noting that they are best positioned to benefit from a possible continuation. He has also reiterated his long-standing forecast, first outlined last November, that XRP could climb to $14 and that investors should consider preparing for such an outcome. Steph is not alone in this view. Earlier this year, the pseudonymous analyst Papa emphasized that XRP appeared to be “screaming higher” even while trading at $2, using Fibonacci targets to project a rally toward $14. Similarly, analyst JD suggested in March that $14 should be considered a minimum target for the ongoing market cycle. XRP’s repeated history of breaking descending trendlines and rallying afterward has created cautious optimism among analysts. The July reclaim of $3 is seen as a decisive step, and as long as this level holds, the technical structure supports the possibility of further upside, with $14 emerging as the dominant target.

50205404,https://thecoinrise.com/why-cold-wallet-could-be-next-big-crypto-as-toncoin-eyes-47-and-ethereum-surges/,1755388852,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50205404.jpeg,Why Cold Wallet Could Be Next Big Crypto As Toncoin Eyes $47 And Ethereum Surges,https://thecoinrise.com/why-cold-wallet-could-be-next-big-crypto-as-toncoin-eyes-47-and-ethereum-surges/,"In a market filled with speculation, three tokens stand out for different reasons. Toncoin (TON) market analysis shows a broad forecast, ranging from $2.38 to as high as $47. Ethereum (ETH) price surge is breaking key resistance with a possible path to $5,000. At the same time, Cold Wallet is solving adoption challenges before its official launch. Toncoin’s edge comes from Telegram’s billion-user base and in-chat token utility, creating a rare retail gateway. Ethereum’s momentum, boosted by institutional interest, continues to secure its role as the foundation of Web3. However, Cold Wallet enters with an advantage that neither TON nor ETH currently offers. It has 2 million preloaded users from the Plus Wallet acquisition, a cashback model that converts fees into rewards, and a Stage 17 presale price of $0.00998 against a $0.3517 listing price. For anyone asking what is the next big crypto, CWT combines adoption with visible upside. Toncoin Forecasts Range From $2.38 To $47 Toncoin (TON), the native token of Telegram’s network, trades around $3.40 today. Predictions differ widely. CoinDCX expects it to reach $43 to $47 by late 2025, supported by growing Telegram activity and better developer tools. Other cautious forecasts expect it to land between $3 and $14. CoinCodex places its range between $2.38 and $9.48. The broad spread shows both the risk and opportunity. The ability for Telegram users to send, stake, and use TON within chats adds real-world use. Investors may see value here, as TON’s integration into a billion-user platform makes it one of the few tokens with built-in mass adoption potential. If you are considering what crypto to invest in, TON’s forecast spread and live use case make it worth tracking. Ethereum Breaks Out: Is $5K Next? Ethereum has moved through major resistance points and entered a fast discovery stage, which could push it beyond $5,000 soon. Analysts argue that this breakout marks strong momentum and signals the chance for new record highs. This makes now an important moment to watch closely. Moving out of its past trading range could trigger a rapid rally. While all crypto carries risk, entering during a breakout phase allows traders to capture upside earlier. If you are searching for a play with strong price action, Ethereum (ETH) price surge suggests it may be heading for another big milestone, possibly beyond $5K. Cold Wallet Converts Crypto Costs Into Rewards As Stage 17 Nears $0.00998 Cold Wallet is tackling one of crypto’s biggest hurdles: the cost of using the network. For everyday users, gas charges, swap fees, and cross-chain costs remain barriers. Cold Wallet changes this by turning those costs into a system of rewards. Each transaction adds fuel for more activity, creating a cycle that keeps users engaged while building capital flow. Supporting this design is the Plus Wallet acquisition, which brings over 2 million users and instant liquidity from day one. With $6.2 million already raised, Cold Wallet enters the market fully prepared and ready to expand. Stage 17 of the crypto presale holds a $0.00998 price, still far below its fixed $0.3517 listing, leaving room for growth. Unlike most projects that start with no users, Cold Wallet launches with both infrastructure and a built-in audience. The mix of immediate adoption, proven utility, and discounted entry makes this presale one of the strongest setups for 2025. For those seeking a project that solves real problems and holds big potential, this chance may not stay open for long. Why Cold Wallet’s Stage 17 Setup Outshines TON And ETH In 2025 Toncoin (TON) market analysis points to promise, but forecasts remain wide and rely on the speed of Telegram adoption. Ethereum (ETH) price surge shows strength, but its gains depend on lasting institutional demand. Cold Wallet, by contrast, enters fully funded with $6.2 million secured, millions of users ready, and a cashback model that addresses crypto’s long-standing pain points. This is not a guess it is already working. The Stage 17 presale price of $0.00998, far below the $0.3517 listing, gives investors rare value while asking what is the next big crypto . While TON and ETH chase growth with uncertain outcomes, CWT begins with both a live user base and liquidity. In a market where delivery will matter more than hype, Cold Wallet is set not only to join the next phase of crypto growth but to help shape it.

The most promising crypto picks aren’t always the largest by market cap, they’re the ones that combine solid fundamentals, active communities, and near-term catalysts capable of sparking sharp rallies. Right now, a few standouts are in a prime position for meaningful upside, yet their potential isn’t fully reflected in current prices. From presales close to exchange launches to networks approaching technical breakouts, these projects are set for possible major moves. Here’s a closer look at four worth watching: BlockDAG, ADA, LINK, and XRP. 1. BlockDAG: Massive Presale with Big Exchange Goals BlockDAG has gained attention for its hybrid Layer-1 architecture, blending a Directed Acyclic Graph framework with Proof-of-Work and full EVM compatibility. This combination allows for fast transaction speeds, high security, and robust smart contract capabilities. The project’s presale is a key driver of interest, having raised over $375 million and sold 25.3 billion BDAG coins across 29 batches at $0.0276 per coin. Early buyers from Batch 1 are up about 2,660%, while current investors could see an 81% increase if the coin lists at $0.05. Analysts believe major exchange listings could eventually push BDAG toward $1, significantly multiplying returns for early participants. Its ecosystem is already thriving: the X1 Mobile Miner App has 2.5 million active users, more than 4,500 developers are building 300+ decentralized apps, and 19,300 mining units have been sold, with over 200,000 holders onboarded before launch. With confirmed listings on 20 exchanges and ongoing efforts to secure a spot on Coinbase and Gemini, the project could see a surge in demand. For many traders, BlockDAG is the most promising crypto to keep an eye on. 2. LINK: ICE Collaboration Fuels $30+ Target Chainlink (LINK) is trading around $24.05, with recent highs of $24.55 and lows of $23.31. It has been one of the stronger performers in the top 50, buoyed by whale buying, the Chainlink Reserve token buyback initiative, and a notable partnership with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. From a technical perspective, LINK has broken past key resistance at $19 and remains steady above $20, with support between $18 and $20. Analysts are eyeing short-term targets around $30, with some projecting as high as $95 if momentum sustains. The network’s Total Value Secured in DeFi has reached $95 billion, underscoring its critical role in blockchain infrastructure. With institutional partnerships and strong market structure, LINK holds its place as one of the most promising crypto investments available. 3. ADA: ETF Speculation & Whale Activity Boosting Strength Cardano (ADA) trades near $0.908, with recent price swings between $0.834 and $0.915. The trend has been bullish, supported by a golden cross and significant whale accumulation, with around 200 million ADA added to large wallets recently. Adding to the momentum, Grayscale has filed for a spot Cardano ETF, which could broaden accessibility for U.S. investors if approved. Analysts see potential for ADA to reach $1.50 if it can clear resistance at $1.10, with strong support holding near $0.70. Its long-term development roadmap and expanding ecosystem add to investor confidence. This mix of technical strength, large-scale accumulation, and possible ETF approval makes ADA a top candidate among the most promising crypto picks for the coming months. 4. XRP: Regulatory Clarity & Technical Base XRP is currently priced near $3.29, trading between $3.21 and $3.32. The big development is the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, which ended with a $125 million fine. This resolution removes a long-standing uncertainty and positions XRP for greater institutional adoption. The announcement triggered a more than 12% surge, lifting the price above $3.20 before stabilizing. Charts indicate strong support around $3 and resistance between $3.30 and $3.60. Some forecasts suggest a potential climb toward $4 in the mid-term. Technical analysts also point to a 7-year double bottom pattern, which could support a larger breakout. With legal clarity and a steady accumulation phase, XRP has re-emerged as one of the most promising crypto opportunities to watch. Evaluating the Most Promising Crypto Finding the most promising crypto isn’t about chasing short-lived hype, it’s about identifying projects with strong fundamentals and catalysts the market hasn’t fully priced in. BlockDAG offers a major presale, large community, and the possibility of high-profile listings. ADA has whale interest and ETF potential on its side. LINK is leveraging institutional deals and technical momentum. XRP now enjoys regulatory clarity and the potential for a technical breakout. Each of these projects has a unique path forward, but all share the possibility of delivering substantial returns to investors who position themselves before the next major market shift.

XRP’s breakout above a multi-year resistance level and Solana’s surge in liquidity are fueling a wave of optimism that could mark the start of a new altcoin rally. With institutional interest growing and retail investors looking for the next big opportunity, eight altcoins are emerging as top contenders for massive ROI potential. 1. Solana (SOL): Institutional Momentum Builds Solana continues to dominate headlines with its rising liquidity and growing use in tokenization projects. Major banks and financial institutions are tapping into its network for real-world asset applications, while technical improvements like the Alpenglow protocol enhance performance. If institutional adoption keeps accelerating, analysts believe SOL could be on track for new all-time highs in this cycle. 2. XRP: Breaking a Multi-Year Barrier After years of stagnation, XRP has finally pushed through a crucial resistance level. The move has reignited bullish sentiment, helped by growing regulatory clarity and whale accumulation. As adoption of its cross-border payment use case expands, XRP’s breakout could be just the beginning of a larger rally. 3. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Presale Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly risen to prominence with one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. Investors are eyeing it as a high-growth opportunity, with whale accumulation signaling strong confidence in its long-term trajectory. Market experts highlight MAGACOIN as a standout ROI contender this cycle, comparing its potential to early-stage breakout projects from previous bull runs. 4. Chainlink (LINK): The RWA and DeFi Backbone Chainlink is strengthening its position as the leader in decentralized data feeds. Its involvement in real-world asset tokenization and the launch of new features like Chainlink Reserve have reinforced its dominance. Market analysts suggest LINK could rally toward $100 by 2025 as its adoption deepens across DeFi and institutional finance. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): Expanding Ecosystem Avalanche is rapidly building momentum through its subnet architecture and enterprise-grade integrations. With strong developer engagement and institutional partnerships, AVAX has the foundation for significant growth. A breakout above key price levels could push it back into the spotlight as one of the most scalable networks in the industry. 6. Litecoin (LTC): Veteran Player with Staying Power Often considered the “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin remains a reliable choice in altcoin portfolios. Its proven track record, low transaction costs, and enduring presence in the market provide stability. As altcoin momentum rises, LTC could see renewed interest as investors seek established assets with upside potential. 7. Cardano (ADA): Long-Term Builder Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem through steady, peer-reviewed development. Known for its emphasis on scalability and sustainability, ADA has a strong base of developers and projects building on its network. Its measured approach may result in slower price action, but long-term fundamentals position it for growth as adoption increases. 8. HYPE (Hyperliquid): Speculative Moonshot For those seeking higher-risk plays, HYPE has emerged as a strong contender. The altcoin recently broke out of a bullish technical setup, generating buzz among short-term traders. Its volatility is extreme, but in the current market environment, many believe it could deliver extraordinary gains if momentum continues. Final Takeaway With Solana’s liquidity expansion and XRP’s breakout signaling renewed bullish momentum, the altcoin market appears primed for a major upswing. Established networks like Solana and Avalanche continue to push boundaries, while promising new projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing investor attention as potential multi-bagger opportunities. In a market where timing is everything, these eight altcoins are being closely watched as top contenders for explosive ROI potential in 2025.

Analyst’s August-September Prediction,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-and-crypto-market-to-crash-analysts-august-september-prediction/,"According to a new technical analysis, Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market could be mirroring historical post-halving cycle patterns. While the market has previously rallied through July and August, historical fractals point to a potential crash in September, followed by a push into a cycle peak later in the year. Related Reading: Trump Coin Jumps 10% On Canary Capital ETF Filing: Details September Proves Risky For Bitcoin And Crypto Market A recent X social media post by crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has highlighted a recurring pattern in Bitcoin’s price action that could have significant implications for the market over the coming months. His analysis shows that Bitcoin has consistently followed a post-halving cycle that exhibits distinct seasonal price movements, particularly around July, August, and September. The chart shared by Cowen illustrates that in previous cycles, Bitcoin has often rallied in July and August, fueling optimism and strong market sentiment. However, each time this has been followed by a September crash, leading to a reset before the final push toward the cycle top, which usually arrives in the last quarter of the year. According to the analysis, this repeating structure is not unique to a single cycle but has appeared across multiple past cycles, giving weight to the expert’s argument that history could be repeating. In 2013, 2017, and 2021, Bitcoin’s price behavior followed this pattern almost identically, showing strength in mid-summer and weakness in September. After a final rally to a peak, each of these cycles was eventually followed by an extended bear market phase, during which valuations corrected sharply from their highs. Based on Cowen’s report, the current cycle appears to be unfolding the same way, as Bitcoin already displayed strength in July and August this year, sparking concerns that a September pullback could be approaching. BTC Cycles Suggest Market Still Has Room To Grow A new technical analysis by crypto market expert TechDev also reveals a recurring pattern in Bitcoin’s long-term price cycles, arguing that, contrary to popular belief, the current market may still be far from its peak. The analysis, supported by a historical chart of BTC’s performance, shows that every market top has consistently occurred around 14 months after a specific cyclical signal. The chart outlines multiple Bitcoin cycles dating back to 2011, with tops and bottoms clearly marked with green and red indicators. Each upward run is followed by a significant correction and then a recovery accumulation phase. The data also revealed that each cycle top often aligned with a measured time frame of approximately 420 days. Related Reading: Chainlink Breaks 3-Month High Amid Record 2025 Enthusiasm Based on this model, current projections show that Bitcoin still has room to run. The most recent green marker on the chart signals that the market could already be transitioning out of its corrective phase.

Pi Network’s charts are hinting at a possible price rebound, and Uniswap is working on a governance-friendly legal model. Still, BlockDAG ’s dual-sport strategy gives it a unique market advantage. By building visibility in both U.S. rugby and cricket’s global fan base, the project is bridging markets in a way few can replicate. With $374M raised, over 24.7B coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29, priced now at $0.0276, BlockDAG’s momentum goes well beyond its numbers. Sports Partnerships Fuel BlockDAG’s Global Expansion BlockDAG is rolling out a sports-focused approach designed to secure attention across both North America and major international markets in one coordinated move. In the U.S., its partnerships with rugby franchises connect to a sport gaining momentum, boosted by increasing television coverage, packed stadiums, and strong community-driven engagement. On the other side, cricket alliances open the door to more than a billion fans across South Asia, the U.K., Australia, and other cricket-focused regions, audiences known for their passion and loyalty. This strategy ensures BlockDAG’s reach is not limited to a single demographic or location. Rugby offers a direct route into the North American market, which has high levels of crypto adoption and a growing appetite for innovative digital products. Cricket, meanwhile, delivers a massive international stage, particularly in mobile-first economies where blockchain-based fan tools, such as NFTs, exclusive digital content, and interactive voting systems, can translate into immediate and sustained adoption. On the financial side, the foundation is rock solid. BlockDAG has already raised $374M, sold 24.7B coins, and achieved a 2,660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29, with the current batch 29 price set at $0.0276. This substantial backing allows for a consistent presence in both markets, combining targeted regional entry with broad-scale visibility. The result is a growth plan built to convert sports passion into lasting blockchain engagement worldwide. Pi Network Charts Hint at Big Breakout Pi Network’s price charts are showing early signs of a potential rally, with multiple bullish formations emerging. On the 12-hour chart, a double-bottom pattern has developed near $0.40, with the neckline close to $1.66. If the move completes, it could open the door to a 154% jump. A descending wedge pattern is also present, often seen as a bullish setup as the range tightens before a breakout. Momentum signals add weight to the case. The RSI has climbed from an oversold 19.7 to around 52, reflecting improved buying strength. Meanwhile, the Percentage Price Oscillator has made a bullish crossover, hinting at a possible trend shift. If resistance levels break, this alignment of technicals could lead to higher price action, with buying activity likely picking up in the process. New Framework Could Streamline Uniswap Operations The latest Uniswap update centers on a proposal from the Uniswap Foundation to establish DUNI, a legal entity based on Wyoming’s Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association framework. The aim is to protect governance participants from liability while keeping decision-making decentralized. Under this plan, the Foundation would act as a ministerial agent, allowing the DAO to sign contracts, handle tax matters, and work with service providers without changing its on-chain governance. The proposal also sets aside 16.5M UNI to fund compliance efforts and create a legal defense reserve. By introducing a structured legal base, Uniswap is preparing for smoother protocol upgrades and the potential for fee distribution, while giving participants more confidence in engaging long-term. Final Thoughts From Pi Network’s chart setups to Uniswap’s governance framework, each project is paving its way forward. But BlockDAG’s sports-linked approach stands out for its blend of regional focus and worldwide visibility. With rugby anchoring its U.S. presence and cricket tapping into global fan engagement, BlockDAG is positioned to turn attention into adoption at scale. Backed by $374M in funding, 24.7B coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29, it pairs market reach with the capital strength to execute long-term growth. This combination makes its strategy one built not just for attention, but for sustained expansion.

Bitcoin’s dominance is starting to ease as institutional flows and retail momentum increasingly rotate into high-potential projects. Among the names at the top of expert lists are Solana, XRP, and the fast-emerging MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project that many believe could rival early-stage success stories of previous cycles. Solana’s Breakout Momentum Solana has become one of the most talked-about networks of 2025. Its rapid transaction speeds and growing developer base continue to attract strong attention from the DeFi and NFT sectors. The token has recently broken past key resistance levels, with analysts now forecasting potential upside to the $300–$460 range if momentum holds. Institutional filings for a spot Solana ETF in the U.S. are also fueling speculation that mainstream adoption could come sooner than expected. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction Alongside these established names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most promising new opportunities. The project has already gained momentum in its presale, with high demand and limited supply creating strong scarcity pressure. Analysts note that early participants could see dramatic upside if MAGACOIN FINANCE follows a similar trajectory to past breakout tokens. With a growing community and early adoption buzz, many are calling it a must-ow n for investors looking for multi-year returns. XRP’s Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Push After years of uncertainty, XRP is benefiting from the legal clarity that followed its settlement with the SEC. Institutional products are starting to take shape, including futures trading and ETF applications, which could significantly boost liquidity. Analysts now project XRP could reach between $3.50 and $5 by the end of 2025, positioning it as one of the strongest performers of the cycle. The Bigger Picture for Altcoins What makes 2025 different is the convergence of institutional infrastructure, retail enthusiasm, and project maturity. Solana and XRP are delivering strong fundamentals and regulatory progress, while MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the speculative early-stage opportunity that often defines a bull cycle. Together, they highlight why analysts believe altcoins will be at the center of the next wave of crypto adoption. Conclusion Altcoins are once again driving the narrative in 2025. Solana’s ecosystem strength, XRP’s institutional tailwinds, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum are positioning them as leaders of this market cycle. For investors aiming to capture the upside of the coming bull run, these three projects are at the top of expert watchlists.

From high-energy presales to billion-dollar DeFi leaders, these names show that utility, strong fundamentals, and sustained growth still lead the way. One crypto, Cold Wallet ($CWT) , is capturing attention with a presale that has already raised over $6.16 million, while Hyperliquid continues to lead blockchain fee revenue with exceptional performance. Solana has pushed past the $200 level, reigniting optimism, and Ethereum’s rally has analysts raising year-end forecasts. In a market where trends shift quickly, these four are not just holding ground but expanding their influence. Whether the focus is on ROI, adoption, or innovation, they stand out as prime examples of leadership in the current cycle. 1. Cold Wallet ($CWT): Cashback Utility and Instant User Base Drive Growth Cold Wallet is reshaping how crypto wallets operate, and the numbers back it up. Now in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998 per CWT, the project has raised over $6.16 million with momentum building as launch nears. Instead of letting gas, swap, and bridge fees eat into portfolios, Cold Wallet rewards users in CWT for everyday transactions, making it a utility-focused platform from day one. Its growth accelerated with the $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, instantly adding more than 2 million users to its ecosystem. Achieving this scale before launch gives Cold Wallet an edge, especially as competitors like MetaMask and Trust Wallet face user experience criticism. With tiered presale pricing, each stage raises entry costs and narrows the current 3,400%+ ROI potential. Positioned as a top bullish crypto for 2025, Cold Wallet offers an earning model, liquidity, and adoption strategy already in motion before it even lists. 2. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Dominating DeFi Revenue and Market Share Hyperliquid has emerged as one of DeFi’s strongest players, recently capturing 35% of all blockchain fee revenue, totaling about $97.7 million in July. This performance surpassed both Ethereum and Solana in fee generation. Its derivatives protocol has seen open interest soar to $15.3 billion, marking a 369% year-to-date increase, helped by its integration with Phantom Wallet. The token’s fundamentals remain appealing, with $4 million in daily buybacks creating steady demand. Trading currently hovers between $46.72 and $47.46, with the next price target projected at $54 to $55. A record deposit into Hyperliquid has fueled speculation of an imminent all-time high, keeping sentiment firmly in the bullish camp and securing its place as a top bullish crypto. 3. Solana (SOL): Leveraging Institutional Demand and Ecosystem Strength Solana continues to strengthen its position as a top bullish crypto, recently breaking above the $200 mark and sparking renewed investor enthusiasm. If current momentum holds, analysts see room for the price to move toward $250 and potentially as high as $350. On-chain activity is thriving, with total value locked reaching multi-year highs. Institutional participation is also climbing, with Solana-based funds recording $8.9 million in inflows last week even as broader crypto products saw $415 million in outflows. While some user activity has shifted to newer platforms like Hyperliquid, Solana’s core ecosystem remains robust. Strong technical performance, deep liquidity, and rising market sentiment all point toward continued upside potential. 4. Ethereum (ETH): Upgrades and ETF Flows Fuel Bullish Momentum Ethereum has reasserted itself among 2025’s top bullish crypto, climbing 41% over the past month compared to the broader market’s 9% gain. Now trading near $4,690, ETH’s rally is being fueled by optimism over potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the introduction of the U.S. “Genius Act” stablecoin framework, and increasing institutional inflows through ETFs. Upgrades like Pectra are enhancing transaction efficiency, further supporting long-term growth prospects. Analysts at Standard Chartered have raised their year-end target to $7,500, with an ambitious $25,000 forecast by 2028. However, whale selling of roughly $88 million in ETH could lead to short-term cooling before the next move higher, providing opportunities for strategic accumulation. Final Thoughts From innovative presales to dominant DeFi platforms and high-performance blockchains to established smart contract leaders, these projects showcase the strength of 2025’s top bullish crypto picks. Cold Wallet is redefining wallet economics ahead of its exchange debut, Hyperliquid is climbing to the top of DeFi revenue charts, Solana is holding firm above $200, and Ethereum is advancing with key upgrades and institutional backing. In a market where leadership can change quickly, their current momentum, adoption patterns, and strong sentiment point to lasting impact. For those seeking innovation with growth potential, watching these four could offer both strategic insights and profitable opportunities.

In a recent update, EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a prominent analyst, emphasized the importance of adopting a long-term outlook when evaluating XRP. He cautioned against panicking over minor price fluctuations, arguing that discipline and patience are critical in navigating this stage of the market. His post highlighted the diversity of his audience, ranging from professionals in medicine, aviation, and engineering to entrepreneurs and everyday workers, while making the case that the same principle of avoiding emotional reactions to short-term moves applies to all. #XRP – MACRO Perspective: Stay Calm & Focused ! I know many of you are new to this space, whether it's investing, trading, or navigating risks in general. I respect each and every one of you and I have a diverse community here, from medical professionals, engineers,… pic.twitter.com/e0V4I1yMoB — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 15, 2025 The $2 Threshold At the core of the analysis is a technical threshold. According to the analyst, XRP will remain in a “super macro bullish cycle” as long as it doesn’t close the monthly candle below $2. While XRP has struggled with this level in 2025, it has recovered every time. That monthly close level operates as the dividing line between maintaining or reevaluating the bullish case. By focusing on monthly candles rather than intraday or even daily volatility, he frames the strategy around larger structural signals. This approach provides clarity and avoids the distractions of smaller price swings . Chart Structure and Bull Flag Formation The chart he attached outlines a bull flag continuation pattern within an ascending channel. He showed historical examples of similar formations, showing how prior cycles resolved in significant rallies in 2017 and 2021. Notably, the bull flag breakout recently sent XRP to its all-time high of $3.65 , and EGRAG CRYPTO anticipates a continued climb for the digital asset. The chart also notes a breakout success rate of around 67% to 70%, suggesting a good chance that the asset will continue climbing. Measured targets are drawn at $21 and $27, both aligned with the upper boundary of the long-term channel. These projections are derived from the height of the flagpole and the strength of the channel trend, reinforcing the case for further upside should the breakout hold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Positioning for the Cycle Ahead EGRAG CRYPTO’s broader message is that XRP’s macro structure remains intact so long as the $2 threshold is respected. The bull flag within the rising channel and the measured targets provide an operational framework for traders. By combining patience with strict adherence to technical levels, participants can align their strategies with market structure and focus on long-term moves instead of making emotional decisions.

On Friday in Alaska, Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin ended their closely watched talks with no deal. By Saturday, Trump signaled a new goal. It was a broader peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, aligning more with Putin’s line, rather than a narrow ceasefire. He also reportedly supported Putin’s proposal that Ukraine surrender territory it currently controls in exchange for a Russian pledge not to attack again. Fortune noted that was a sharp turn from Trump’s pre-Alaska warnings, when he said Russia would face “very severe consequences” if Putin refused a ceasefire. Pressed on why he did not follow through, Trump said he would pause any new penalties for now and hinted the threat could return as diplomacy unfolds. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, Congress was upset . The Ukraine war is still on, yet Trump smiled and drove Putin in a private car. He said they agreed on “many, many points” but also said “there’s no deal until there’s a deal.” He refused new sanctions. Both parties—even usual allies—criticized him. He told Fox News “Because of what happened today, I think I don’t have to think about that now”. He added “I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don’t have to think about that right now.” Trump could hit Russia’s energy revenues with secondary sanctions Before the meeting, Trump had floated secondary sanctions on Russia’s oil sector. Oil and gas supply most of the Kremlin’s money, a weak point Washington could exploit. Targeting the “shadow fleet” of tankers that quietly move Russian crude could trigger a “deep financial crisis” for the war economy, said Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. He noted that after the Biden administration sanctioned nearly 200 ships in January, just before Trump returned to office, activity by those vessels collapsed. Yet another 359 ships already blacklisted by the European Union or United Kingdom have not been hit by U.S. measures. “Sanctioning these ships would be a hammer blow to the Russian war machine,” Brooks wrote. “There would undoubtedly be a sharp fall in the Urals oil price, reducing the flow of hard currency to the Russian state, and the Ruble would most likely depreciate significantly.” Alaska session buys Putin time on Ukraine front Foreign-policy analysts said the Alaska session amounted to a win for Putin, who avoided immediate punishment and gained time for his forces to push for more gains in Ukraine. Even so, Melinda Haring, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, stressed that Trump still holds powerful tools. “Let’s hope that Trump sees through Putin’s endless appetite to talk and tires of the Russian dictator’s pseudo-historical lectures,” she wrote. “Trump can squeeze the Russians; he seems to forget that the United States holds the cards, not Moscow.” Russia’s finances show strain. Oil and gas revenue fell 27% in July from a year earlier, and war spending is widening the budget gap. The National Wealth Fund, a key reserve, has shrunk from $135 billion in January 2022 to $35 billion by May and could be exhausted later this year, according to recent estimates. “Russia’s economy is fast approaching a fiscal crunch that will encumber its war effort,” economist and Russia scholar Anders Åslund wrote last week. “Though that may not be enough to compel Putin to seek peace, it does suggest that the walls are closing in on him.” Don’t just read crypto news.

50208752,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=786321,1755393788,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50208752.jpeg,Kraken halts Monero deposits as Qubic seizes 51% hashrate,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/kraken-halts-monero-deposits/,"Crypto exchange Kraken has temporarily suspended Monero deposits following an alleged 51% attack on the privacy-focused blockchain, sparking heated debate within the crypto community. This type of attack occurs when one mining pool controls more than 50% of a blockchain network’s total hashing power. This gives way to double-spending and reordering transactions on the ledger. In a statement, Kraken explained that Monero deposits were paused as a precautionary measure to protect network security. “As a security precaution, we have paused Monero deposits after detecting that a single mining pool has gained over 50% of the network’s total hashing power. This concentration of mining power poses a potential risk to network integrity.” Kraken halts Monero deposits amid rising network threats The suspicious activity was attributed to Qubic, a layer-1 blockchain and AI-mining pool. Earlier this week, Qubic said it achieved majority control in Monero hashrate and reorganized six blocks on the blockchain. This prompted denials of the attack from the Monero community. Monero, the 29th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization according to CoinMarketCap, is a leading privacy-focused protocol. The ongoing 51% attack on its network has rattled the community, sparking a flurry of reactions. “After a month-long, high-stakes technical confrontation, Qubic reached 51% of Monero’s hashrate dominance, successfully reorganizing the blockchain,” spokespeople for Qubic wrote on Tuesday. The mining pool was initially rebuffed in its attempt at a takeover, falling to the protocol’s seventh-largest miner. It was hit with an alleged denial of service attack on August 4. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack overwhelms a computer, network, or server with excessive fake traffic, clogging the system and blocking legitimate requests from being processed. According to Sergey Ivancheglo, who claimed responsibility for the 51% attack, the DDoS assault slashed Qubic’s hashrate from 2.6 gigahashes per second (GH/s) to just 0.8 GH/s. The Qubic pool eventually regained its hashing strength, seizing majority control of the Monero network’s computing power. “This event marks a pivotal moment in the crypto industry,” Qubic spokespeople continued, while highlighting the takeover of a $6 billion privacy protocol by a $300 million AI protocol. Monero, which trades as XMR, is currently the third-worst performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, and it’s down almost 25% in the last month. Economic incentives replace traditional malicious attacks in mining wars The 51% attack on Monero would be especially critical in the eyes of money launderers searching for untraceable transactions and iron-clad privacy features -innate Monero virtues. The network’s RandomX algorithm was explicitly created to deter ASIC mining and promote CPU and GPU mining in the game of decentralization. But Qubic introduced a unique “useful proof-of-work,” or uPoW, module, which it has also been using to incentivize the Monero CPU mines to be redeployed in support of its token economy. However, it plans to convert mined XMR into USDT stablecoins in order to purchase and burn QUBIC tokens using a deflationary model on its native coin. Instead of establishing a traditional attack for profit or disruption, the project has formed economic incentives that push miners away from distributed pools toward their centralized operation. This new attack category doesn’t rely on malicious intent but superior economic incentives.

Mutuum Finance token price at presale phase 6 is $0.035. It will increase by 14.29% to $0.04 during presale stage 7. Early investors will get at least 400% returns when the token goes live. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $14.45 million and attracted over 15250 investors. While XRP faces technical pressure, the buzz around the growth potential and unique DeFi positioning of Mutuum Finance is generating increasing investor interest, setting the stage for more serious investigation of shifting capital flows in the market. XRP Price Prediction: A Vital Support Point Determines Short-Term Trend XRP now hovers at around $3.28, with it holding close proximity to the critical $3.27 support level. Analyst Ali Martinez warns that losing this zone could send bullish momentum into reverse gear, with a rebound to over $3.29–$3.30 opening the gate to $3.60 short-term, indicating potential renewed ascending pressure. Longer-term forecasts are divided between conservative $3.12 levels towards the end of August and ambitious year-end ranges of $4 to $5.50, subject to regulation updates and market mood. While XRP navigates this testing time, attention is gradually directed towards emerging DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance that are commanding investor interest in the backdrop of shifting crypto narratives.

50208440,558371,1755394207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50208440.jpeg,Ripple-Backed Epic Chain To Launch XRP-Powered RWA Tokenization Platform,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-backed-epic-chain/,"Epic Chain, backed by Ripple, is taking a bold step into the future of finance with the launch of its XRP-native RWA tokenization platform. With Ripple’s support and XRP’s efficiency at its core, Epic Chain could lead the next wave of adoption, where trillions in real-world assets move seamlessly on-chain. Ripple Backs New Real-World Assets Platform In a release , Epic Chain is positioning itself at the center of the real-world assets (RWAs) tokenization wave , building an XRP-native platform to bring real estate, credit, commodities, and collectibles onto the blockchain. With the global RWA market estimated at over $50 trillion, Epic Chain’s positioning could be transformational. Related Reading: From Day 1: Ripple CTO Says XRPL Was Made For Global Financial Infrastructure Epic is currently valued at a modest $60 million FDV, and it trades on Binance, Bybit, and Kucoin, with further listings anticipated. Operating in over 150 countries, the project targets more than 100 million traders and is connected to over a million bank accounts, and has launched a $1 million adoption and liquidity program to drive global growth. According to Route 2 FI, initially launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, Epic is now migrating to an EVM-compatible XRP Ledger sidechain, unlocking native liquidity and tighter integration with XRP infrastructure. This pivot strengthens settlement speed, scalability, and ensures Epic Chain remains aligned with Ripple’s long-term vision of enterprise-grade blockchain adoption. One of the rare small-cap token survivors of multiple crypto market cycles, EPIC has transformed from a collectibles marketplace into a layer-2 RWA solution. Its integration with Ripple USD (RLUSD) allows native USD settlement, which is a critical feature for institutional yields, treasury management, and cross-border payments. The Epic Chain pushes adoption through its “Epic One” VISA crypto card, offering up to 8% XRP cashback with no daily limits, spendable in over 180 countries. Meanwhile, its collectibles platform Fanable continues to attract thousands of users through licensed IP deals. Epic Chain’s positioning at the intersection of RWA tokenization and XRP integration gives it strong potential despite the risk from its history of pivots and XRP’s slower corporate pace. For both retail adopters and institutional markets, Epic could serve as a gateway into the XRP economy. XRP Ledger As Backbone For Next-Gen Real Estate Finance Amid this bold move, the XRP Ledger is set to enable the tokenization of $228 trillion in institutional real estate to be brought on-chain through the XRP Ledger Asset Program on August 18th. According to the RealFI post on X, this breakthrough allows assets traditionally managed off-chain to be brought on-chain via the REAL Token, which signals a transformative shift in the global real estate market toward blockchain adoption.

Technical analysts now see the potential for notable price gains if current conditions persist, with one market strategist outlining both short-term targets and an ideal point to consider entering a position. At the time of writing, SHIB is valued at approximately $0.000014, representing a 1.6% increase over the past day and a 9% rise compared to last week. According to trader Rich X Cult, the recent breakout has created a near-term price objective between $0.00001471 and $0.00001600. This range, if achieved, represents a gain of roughly 13% from present levels. The breakout followed a rebound from lows near $0.00001120 on August 3, visible on the four-hour chart. Indicators also support the bullish sentiment, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) registering an elevated reading of 83.57, signaling strong upward momentum. Trading activity has been substantial, with 24-hour volume estimated at around $340 million, while the price has climbed above its 50-period moving average. SHIB Price Analysis: Bullish Breakout Overview: SHIB breaks falling wedge, signaling bullish momentum. Technical Analysis: • Price: ~$0.0000137 (+3.66% 24h). • Support: $0.00001242. • Targets: $0.00001471–$0.00001600. • Indicators: RSI 83.57, volume $241.07M, MA50… pic.twitter.com/LrGs4DR7Fi — Rich X Cult (@RichXCult) August 13, 2025 Key Technical Levels and Risk Considerations Rich X Cult identifies $0.00001242 as a critical support level and considers it an optimal entry point for traders awaiting a pullback. Should the market hold above this threshold, it could provide a base for another advance toward the $0.000016 target zone. Conversely, a close below $0.00001242 could signal a shift toward neutral or bearish conditions, opening the door for a decline to the next support near $0.00001170. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst has suggested a tactical approach that involves entering near the $0.00001242 level with a stop-loss placed slightly below it. However, given the current overbought RSI reading, he cautions that short-term volatility remains a possibility. Additional Market Perspectives Other market commentators share similar optimism for Shiba Inu’s potential. SHIB Knight previously projected a rise to $0.000018, citing the development of a higher low formation as evidence of upward pressure building. This estimate represents a 32% increase from current prices. Analyst Crypto Mullah is monitoring a larger falling wedge pattern on SHIB’s three-day chart. This formation has been in place since December 8, 2024, when the token reached $0.00003343 following a strong rally in November. Mullah believes a breakout from this structure could push SHIB back toward its December peak, which would be roughly 146.5% above current valuations. Similarly, analyst Javon Marks has pointed to a confirmed bullish divergence on SHIB’s two-day chart, suggesting a potential advance exceeding 156% from the divergence confirmation point, with a projected target of $0.000032. With several analysts aligning on the possibility of further gains, Shiba Inu’s recent breakout is attracting close attention from market participants. The sustainability of the move will likely depend on whether the key $0.00001242 support holds and broader market conditions remain favourable.

Analysts are calling this the start of a major rotation into altcoins, where smaller and mid-cap projects often deliver outsized returns compared to Bitcoin. For investors looking to position ahead of the wave, several key altcoins stand out. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most talked-about new entries, with growing community interest and forecasts of explosive returns. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains the leading altcoin by market cap and often serves as the benchmark for the broader market. Following record inflows into U.S.-approved spot ETH ETFs, institutional interest is soaring. If Ethereum can break past its previous all-time high near $4,878, analysts see upside toward $5,500–$6,000 in the near term, with long-term projections reaching $20,000 by 2026. XRP After years of legal uncertainty, XRP has regained its momentum. The asset surged more than 470% in the past year and trades below its ATH. XRP’s role in cross-border payments continues to expand, with some analysts expecting XRP to test levels between $7 and $13 this cycle. SUI SUI has quietly gained traction in 2025, with its DeFi ecosystem seeing a 42% surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) since January. Currently trading around $3.82, forecasts call for $4.75–$5.00 by late August, with long-term targets between $12 and $14 by October 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Among emerging projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured analyst attention for its explosive potential, receiving $12.5 million in fresh capital . With presale demand already outpacing expectations, early participants have seen returns of up to 7,800% , with forecasts suggesting even greater upside as adoption accelerates. The limited early supply and strong community engagement are fueling comparisons to the early days of Dogecoin, making it an incredible opportunity for investors seeking greeter gains before the next wave of capital floods in. Cardano (ADA) Known for its careful, research-driven development, Cardano is rolling out its Voltaire governance era, a milestone that brings on-chain community-led decision-making. Trading near $0.936, ADA could retest its all-time high above $3 if positive momentum continues into the year-end. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is a cornerstone of Web3, delivering secure data to smart contracts across DeFi and institutional finance. LINK, priced at $21.54, shows bullish chart patterns, with forecasts ranging from $25–$30 in the conservative case to as high as $100 in aggressive scenarios. Its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) remains a key growth driver. Solana (SOL) Solana has bounced back impressively in 2025, trading around $185. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has doubled this year, and the anticipated Firedancer validator could elevate throughput beyond one million transactions per second. Analysts suggest a potential rally to $300–$400, especially with growing speculation of a spot SOL ETF. Conclusion As the countdown to altcoin season accelerates, investors are turning their attention to assets beyond Bitcoin. Ethereum, XRP, SUI, Cardano, Chainlink, and Solana all present strong fundamentals and upcoming catalysts. But it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its explosive presale performance and scarcity-driven setup, that stands out as one of the boldest opportunities of this cycle.

The letter was signed by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Christopher Coons (D-Del.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The lawmakers’ letter responds to Trump’s Aug. 11 announcement that Nvidia and AMD would pay the U.S. government a 15% commission on chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. “Our national security and military readiness relies upon American innovators inventing and producing the best technology in the world, and in maintaining that qualitative advantage in sensitive domains,” the letter states. The letter emphasized that Trump’s arrangement, showing a willingness to negotiate away America’s competitive edge—which is key to national security—in exchange for a commission on the sale of AI-enabling technology to a main global competitor, is cause for serious alarm. Nvidia defends H20 chips amid national security concerns The senators also warned that exporting advanced AI chips, specifically Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308, could bolster China’s military systems — a claim Nvidia disputes. In a statement to CNBC, a Nvidia spokesperson said: “The H20 would not enhance anyone’s military capabilities, but would have helped America attract the support of developers worldwide and win the AI race. Banning the H20 cost American taxpayers billions of dollars, without any benefit.” AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Democrats asked the administration for a detailed response by Friday, Aug. 22, regarding the current Nvidia and AMD deal and any similar arrangements with other companies. “We again urge your administration to quickly reverse course and abandon this reckless plan to trade away U.S. technology leadership,” the letter concludes. The Trump administration, however, appeared to dismiss the national security concerns. “It’s quite rich to see Democrats and irrelevant ‘experts,’ who were totally MIA when Joe Biden’s administration let H20 chips and other advanced technologies freely flow to China, now pretend to care about our national and economic security,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC. China restricts Nvidia purchases despite U.S. export approvals Even with Trump permitting the chip sales to resume, China has not fully welcomed Nvidia’s return . Bloomberg reports that Chinese authorities are encouraging tech companies to avoid U.S. chips. “We’re hearing that this is a hard mandate, and that [authorities are actually] stopping additional orders of H20s for some companies,” said Qingyuan Lin, a senior analyst covering China semiconductors at Bernstein. Separately, The Information reported that Chinese regulators have ordered major tech firms, including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent, to halt Nvidia chip purchases until a national security review is completed.

In 2023, the left-leaning watchdog reported that ads from major brands were appearing beside antisemitic and other objectionable posts on X, Elon Musk’s social network. Many big advertisers then froze their spending on the platform . X, in turn, sued Media Matters. The company also brought cases against several advertisers and industry groups, alleging a “systematic illegal boycott.” After Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, the FTC launched a review into whether Media Matters unlawfully coordinated with advertisers. The agency requested records tied to the group’s reporting and its outreach to brands. According to a TechCrunch report , U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan sided with Media Matters on Friday and put the FTC’s effort on hold, concluding the organization is likely to prevail on First Amendment claims. Sooknanan, a Biden appointee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, wrote that the Media Matters article was “quintessential First Amendment activity” and called the FTC’s “expansive” demands “a retaliatory act.” In her ruling, she added “It should alarm all Americans when the Government retaliates against individuals or organizations for engaging in constitutionally protected public debate. And that alarm should ring even louder when the Government retaliates against those engaged in newsgathering and reporting.” She also referenced remarks by Andrew Ferguson from before he became the FTC’s chair, noting his appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast urging scrutiny of progressive groups that critique online disinformation, and that once in the role he “brought on several senior staffers at the FTC who previously made public comments about Media Matters.” Media Matters layoffs and WFA pulls back amid X litigation Regardless of how the litigation proceeds, X’s courtroom strategy has already altered the environment for the entities it targeted. Media Matters has cut staff; one displaced researcher is now running for Congress. The World Federation of Advertisers shut down a brand-safety initiative and reportedly warned members about financial strain. On Thursday, the WFA told members it was “discontinuing” activities for its Global Alliance for Responsible Media after X filed an antitrust case against the group earlier in the week. In an email seen by Business Insider, WFA CEO Stephan Loerke said the move was “not made lightly,” noting that GARM is a nonprofit with limited resources. He said the WFA and GARM will fight X’s allegations in court and are confident the case will “demonstrate our full adherence to competition rules in all our activities.” That note came two days after X filed suit in a Texas court, alleging that GARM participants worked together to “collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue” from Twitter, now called X. The complaint also identifies several GARM participants, including Unilever, Mars, CVS, and Ørsted. Sooknanan further wrote that the FTC’s inquiry produced its “intended effect,” saying Media Matters chose “against pursuing certain stories about the FTC, Chairman Ferguson, and Mr. Musk.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Tech|FTC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-17 01:51:00

On-chain data shows the wallet first executed a small test transaction before transferring its 334.7 ETH to a new wallet. The fresh wallet has yet to show any activity, but if the investor decides to cash out, the return would amount to roughly 14,269x at current prices. Notably, the original investing wallet remained inactive following the ETH ICO, which launched in July 2014. Dormant wallets reactivate as Ethereum gains momentum Following the incident about the early Ethereum investor, research from sources has revealed that several well-funded wallets that remained dormant for a long time have just recently been activated. A good example is a Satoshi-era investor who transferred significant funds to approximately $9 billion worth of Bitcoin. Galaxy facilitated the sale, and BTC’s price remained mostly stable following the massive move. *]:col-start-1 [&>*]:row-start-1 [&_[data-jw-placement-id]]:w-full [&_.jwplayer]:aspect-video [&_.jwplayer]:!w-auto [&_.jwplayer]:!h-auto [&_.jwplayer]:!z-1 ""> Ether has been on a big run of late, but it’s just getting started, according to Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick. Citing surging institutional demand, favorable regulation, and network upgrades, Kendrick lifted his year-end price target for ETH to $7,500 from $4,000 and his end-2028 target to $25,000 from $7,500. Up more than 50% over the past month, Ether is trading hands just beneath its record high of $4,406. *]:col-start-1 [&>*]:row-start-1 [&_[data-jw-placement-id]]:w-full [&_.jwplayer]:aspect-video [&_.jwplayer]:!w-auto [&_.jwplayer]:!h-auto [&_.jwplayer]:!z-1 ""> Alongside, he expects continued outperformance over Bitcoin, forecasting the ETH/BTC ratio to rise to 0.05 from the current 0.039. The second-largest cryptocurrency has also received a regulatory boost from the passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act in July, which paves the way for mainstream stablecoin adoption. Kendrick noted that more than half of all stablecoins are issued on Ethereum, and these cryptocurrencies already account for 40% of blockchain fees. BlackRock’s ETHA fund inflows hit headlines after amounting to 338.1 million Last week, U.S.-based Ethereum ETFs recorded a historic trading volume of roughly $18.2 billion , marking their highest ever. This nearly matched Bitcoin ETFs, which posted a trading volume of about $21.2 billion. In addition to trading activity, Ethereum funds saw strong weekly inflows of approximately $2.9 billion in new capital. Although the broader ETF market experienced a net outflow of $59.3 million, BlackRock’s ETHA fund, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, attracted about $338.1 million in fresh investments. Analysis from SoSoValue shows that these gains were partially offset by outflows elsewhere, including Fidelity’s FETH at $272.2 million and Grayscale’s ETHE at $101.7 million, along with smaller withdrawals from 21Shares’ CETH, Grayscale’s ETH, and Bitwise’s ETHW. Still, that day’s inflows marked BlackRock’s ETHA fund success, which lasted ten consecutive days. BlackRock’s ETHA fund currently oversees around $15.7 billion in assets. These assets represent 2.9% of Ethereum’s total market value. Get seen where it counts.

Related Reading: Trump Coin Jumps 10% On Canary Capital ETF Filing: Details According to a recent podcast episode featuring several crypto commentators, guests flagged “mania signals” as a way to spot when an asset is going mainstream. Some guests said they are now hearing XRP mentioned in casual settings, while others point to counterexamples that suggest the trend is not universal. Uber Drivers Talk Crypto Based on reports from the Unchained podcast and social posts, one guest said they had taken multiple Uber rides where drivers were trading XRP. That comment was later amplified on social media, with others sharing similar encounters. Reports have disclosed that another well-known community figure said Uber drivers in Nevada and Michigan even recognized him as “that XRP lawyer guy” after his advocacy in the Ripple–SEC case. Those anecdotes add color to claims of growing retail chatter. I’ve had 2 different Uber drivers in 2 different states (Nevada & Michigan) bring up XRP to me during the last 3 months. They said: “You look familiar” and “I know you.” I replied: “I ran for U.S. Senate against Elizabeth Warren.” Both quickly responded: “No that’s not it -… https://t.co/hsmppCsXRt — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 14, 2025 Small Survey Finds Little Uptake A separate, small experiment tested the idea directly. A commentator took 25 Uber rides in Ontario and asked each driver whether they held XRP. Most drivers were confused or said they did not own any crypto. One driver reported holding XRP, having bought at $1.67, and said they planned to hold long-term. Based on that sample, the experiment’s author concluded that the “Uber driver” story is overstated, or that early buyers may have already cashed out. Retail Buzz Versus Real Adoption Analysts differ on what these encounters mean. According to a Bloomberg ETF analyst cited in reports, institutional demand for a possible XRP ETF may start modest while retail interest could be greater. Other researchers in the community argue that institutions might be quietly building positions even if many retail investors remain unaware. Both lines of argument can be true at once: pockets of strong recognition can exist while broad adoption lags behind.

For now, though, the mix of big-signal stories and low-hit surveys means the claim of wide mainstream recognition is still unproven. These first-hand accounts are compelling because they are simple and human. They make a tidy headline and spark debate online. Reports so far say they are not yet a substitute for consistent, verifiable data. Some people are clearly talking about XRP in daily life. But the jury is still out on whether that talk has crossed into broad mainstream awareness.

Ethereum (ETH) traders took the hardest hit, with $159 million wiped out, followed by Bitcoin (BTC) at $41 million and Solana (SOL) at $22 million. Despite the downturn, this type of flush-out is often seen as an opportunity by seasoned investors, who view sharp corrections as entry points into strong assets and presales. While Ethereum’s wipeout shows how leveraged traders were caught off guard, it also underlines growing demand and speculation around the asset. Similar trends were seen in Bitcoin and Solana, highlighting the market’s volatility as investors navigate inflation reports, ETF inflows, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. In times like these, attention frequently shifts toward early-stage projects where upside potential remains massive. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining traction. Why Presales Are Attracting Attention After Liquidations MAGACOIN FINANCE has been labeled by analysts as one of the best presales of 2025, with projections suggesting that early backers could see exponential gains before the cycle peak. Its momentum is nothing short of ordinary and the rapidly rising prices are drawing investors from around the world. With presale allocations running low, the scarcity factor is building — a key driver for investors seeking to position themselves ahead of the next altcoin breakout. Market Reset Creates New Buying Opportunities Back in the broader market, liquidations of this size are not unusual during periods of consolidation. The cleansing effect can reset overheated leverage, giving assets like Ethereum and Solana room to build stronger bases. Many traders now expect Ethereum to regain momentum toward the $5,000 mark, while Bitcoin remains well-supported above six figures. As capital rotates, the presale narrative is becoming a dominant theme for those looking beyond established assets. Conclusion In summary, the liquidation wave shows the risks of high leverage but also underscores opportunities that surface in its aftermath. While Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana remain strong long-term bets, investors searching for the highest upside potential are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is emerging as one of the most compelling presales of 2025.

Cardano is pressing hard against the $1 ceiling after a strong double-digit rebound. SEI is flashing a series of bullish technical cues, hinting at the potential for a sizable push upward. Meanwhile, BlockDAG ’s Batch 29 entry point at $0.0276 is attracting strong attention, pairing competitive pricing with a presale total now standing at $374M. Its combination of broad utility, audience reach, and sports-linked exposure is helping it capture significant market share. For those tracking both quick trading opportunities and plays with long-term potential, these three projects are showing momentum that stands out in a crowded market. ADA Rallies with Strong Volume Support Cardano has staged a 16% rally, pushing just under the $1 threshold. On the 4-hour chart, ADA climbed from early August lows near $0.68 to touch $1.00, clearing resistance at $0.82, $0.88, $0.92, and $0.96 along the way. Trading volume rose sharply during this move, confirming heavy buying activity rather than a thin market pump. Open interest also reached about $369M, suggesting new positions are reinforcing the trend. Current positioning shows more short interest than long, opening the door for a squeeze if ADA maintains $0.95–$0.97 support. The $1.00–$1.02 zone is immediate resistance, with further upside possible toward $1.05–$1.10 if momentum holds. Support remains at $0.95–$0.97 and $0.90–$0.92. While the short-term trend is positive, the daily RSI near 74 hints at the possibility of a pause or minor pullback before any further breakout. SEI Breaks Out of Downtrend SEI is gaining traction after the TD Sequential indicator triggered a new buy signal, a tool that has previously marked its major turning points. Analyst Ali noted a green “9” candle appeared as SEI touched the $0.30 level, historically signaling reversals. This coincided with a break above a multi-week descending channel. The breakout sent SEI into a $0.32–$0.33 retest zone, now an important level for bulls to protect. Holding above it could pave the way toward $0.50, based on the height of the channel and the strength of the breakout. With both a clear chart pattern and supporting technical indicators, short-term momentum is leaning positive. However, slipping back below $0.32 could put the move on hold, making near-term price action crucial. $374M Raised: BlockDAG Builds Real-World Presence! While ADA and SEI are turning heads with price action, BlockDAG is building a deeper foundation designed to last well beyond short-term market swings. Its presale has brought in $374M so far, with Batch 29 pricing BDAG coins at $0.0276 ahead of a confirmed $0.05 launch price, already a 2,660% gain from Batch 1 buyers. One driver of its visibility is its sports partnerships. BlockDAG is the official blockchain partner of the Seattle Seawolves rugby team and Seattle Orcas cricket team, tapping into two fanbases with international reach. Through these links, it offers NFTs, fan coins, exclusive behind-the-scenes content, and match access, putting the BDAG name in front of millions worldwide. On the education front, the BlockDAG Academy delivers a structured, three-level blockchain training program with on-chain certification, blending learning with real blockchain integration. Mining access is also at the forefront, its X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware miner, first shown in a July live demo, allow easy entry for casual users and higher output for advanced setups. The X1 works through a simple app, while the X10 boosts capacity for serious mining performance. This mix of global sports exposure, structured blockchain education, and hands-on mining tools positions BlockDAG as more than just a market trend, it’s already building practical use cases before launch. Looking Ahead Cardano is closing in on the $1 milestone with strong trading activity backing the move. SEI’s combination of a confirmed breakout and buy signals suggests near-term potential for a sharp push higher. BlockDAG, however, is shaping up as the project with staying power, combining $374M in presale funding with sports tie-ins, blockchain education, and mining tools, all at a $0.0276 entry ahead of a $0.05 launch. In a market where many projects lean on hype alone, BlockDAG’s blend of real-world visibility, established partnerships, and ready-to-use features makes it one of the more complete plays on the table right now. Whether the focus is on quick trades or multi-year growth, these three assets are showing why momentum plus fundamentals can be a powerful mix.

If approved, it would mark a historic moment for the industry, allowing traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP through regulated stock exchanges. Much like the early 2024 approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, such a move would inject fresh capital into the market and potentially set the stage for a new wave of altcoin growth. For investors, the implications are massive. An XRP ETF would not only validate Ripple’s standing but also create momentum across the entire sector. Altcoins with strong fundamentals and clear adoption paths, like Solana, Render, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, are being highlighted as top picks to benefit from this potential shift. Solana (SOL) – Positioned for Explosive Upside Solana has established itself as one of the most scalable and cost-efficient blockchains. Capable of processing tens of thousands of transactions per second, its ecosystem spans decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and gaming. Institutional investors are already watching closely, with discussions of a potential Solana ETF surfacing in recent months. If an XRP ETF is approved, it could fast-track similar products for Solana. Analysts are projecting a bullish case where SOL targets $300 to $400 by late 2025, with some long-term forecasts suggesting far higher valuations as adoption continues to grow. Render (RNDR) – Real Utility Meets Growing Demand Render stands out for its real-world application, connecting creators and studios with GPU providers in a decentralized marketplace. Its relevance spans gaming, artificial intelligence, and the metaverse – sectors expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. The project’s shift to Solana has boosted its scalability and reduced costs, making it even more attractive. Market watchers believe RNDR could surpass its previous highs and climb past $20 to $30 in 2025, especially if optimism from an XRP ETF approval triggers a broad rally. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Breakout Presale Turning Heads While established players like Solana and Render lead on fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention as the presale with breakout potential. With the price rising with each round, the project is seeing surging demand from early investors. Each funding round has sold out at record speed, with forecasts suggesting gains as high as 7,800% before cycle peak for early participants. Its appeal lies in more than just hype – the project is actively building an expanding ecosystem with utilities designed to sustain long-term value. As major altcoins rally on institutional adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors a rare chance to secure a position before it lists on top exchanges. Conclusion The possible launch of an XRP ETF could be a turning point for the entire crypto sector, paving the way for institutional inflows and stronger regulatory clarity. Solana and Render are well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum with strong fundamentals and clear use cases. But for investors seeking early-stage upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the high-growth presale opportunity that could deliver staggering returns in 2025.

These three stand out among the best altcoins to buy in 2025, each offering a unique angle for those tracking high-growth portfolios. Solana Rally Back to $200 Solana (SOL) reclaimed the $200 level in mid-August after a sharp 15% jump. Whale activity has been active as one major holder moved nearly 40,000 SOL from Bybit after holding for months, securing almost $3 million in profit. This highlights the liquidity and price opportunities currently available in Solana’s market. The rally is linked to higher DeFi adoption, treasury company accumulation, and integrations across networks. According to reports , corporate holdings of SOL now total more than $675 million which underscore its role in institutional portfolios. Solana continues to regain ground and many analysts see its $200 price tag as a psychological milestone that could set the tone for how altcoins behave through the remainder of 2025. For those scanning the best altcoins to watch, Solana remains a core name on the list. Ethereum Nears All-Time Highs Amid Institutional Flows Also, Ethereum (ETH) continues to draw Wall Street attention by recently climbing above $4,700, close to its all-time high of $4,878. Institutional adoption is central to this rise. Companies like BitMine Immersion Technologies have laid out strategies to buy as much as 5% of the global ETH supply. Ethereum also anchors much of the stablecoin and real-world asset tokenization markets, with more than half of all stablecoins operating on its blockchain. These areas are linked to mainstream finance, which could help ETH maintain its leadership among altcoins. While competition from faster blockchains remains, Ethereum’s position in staking, infrastructure, and its central role in digital assets keep it firmly among the best altcoins to buy in 2025. Commentators like Tom Lee have said ETH price could reach $15,000 come December. MAGACOIN FINANCE: New Token Tipped for 800% Growth Alongside established leaders like Solana and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a featured altcoin for 2025 portfolios. Currently, the token is being highlighted by analysts who forecast up to 800% growth in the next year. With its active performance already outpacing some rivals, MAGACOIN has placed itself as one of the best altcoins to watch right now for high-growth potential. Main Takeaway For those tracking the best altcoins to buy in 2025, Solana and Ethereum remain anchors with market activity and institutional inflows. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE adds a fresh angle, with its sale phase marking it as a token to watch for outsized growth expectations. Balancing established leaders with rising names may offer a more complete approach to altcoin exposure. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

50210706,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78792,1755398013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Price Prediction 2025 – 470% Rally After $125M SEC Settlement, Analysts Target $12.60",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-prediction-2025-470-rally-after-125m-sec-settlement/,"XRP has re-emerged as one of the most closely watched cryptocurrencies in 2025 following its dramatic rebound from years of legal uncertainty. Earlier this year, Ripple Labs reached a $125 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), bringing a long-standing lawsuit to a close. Analysts now see further upside, with multiple forecasts targeting $12.60 as a fair-value mark by the end of the year. This rally not only restores confidence in XRP but also signals the importance of regulatory clarity in unlocking value across the broader crypto ecosystem. It also frames the conversation around other breakout contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts suggest could deliver gains that eclipse XRP’s current trajectory. Ripple’s Legal Victory Resets the Market The significance of the SEC settlement cannot be overstated. For nearly five years, XRP was burdened by uncertainty in the U.S. market, with exchanges hesitant to list the token and institutions wary of holding it. The $125 million resolution not only removed this overhang but also established a precedent for how regulators and crypto firms might resolve disputes in the future. For investors, this marked a clean slate, leading to renewed liquidity and institutional interest. Transaction volumes on the XRP Ledger surged in tandem, as fintech companies and regional banks resumed or expanded partnerships with RippleNet. In Asia and Latin America especially, XRP adoption for cross-border settlement has been accelerating, driving real-world demand that complements speculative inflows. Analysts argue this combination of regulatory clarity and practical adoption is what gives XRP the strength to sustain its rally toward the $12.60 target price . The Broader Altcoin Landscape While XRP is enjoying its moment, the broader altcoin market remains highly competitive. Ethereum continues to dominate DeFi infrastructure, while Solana and Avalanche compete in high-throughput environments. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu still command large communities, often driving short-term volatility. Yet investors are increasingly seeking asymmetric opportunities – early-stage projects that could replicate the exponential gains seen in the early days of XRP itself. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the spotlight, with projections suggesting it could outpace XRP’s growth potential with an estimated 120x upside in 2025 . Unlike established coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its formative stages – but that’s precisely what appeals to forward-looking investors. Each funding round has sold out rapidly, underscoring strong early demand. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its commitment to building real-world use cases and delivering value early in its lifecycle . By introducing mechanisms that reward strategic entry and cultivating a loyal base of supporters, the project has created a unique blend of scarcity, momentum, and utility. Analysts suggest that while XRP may capture institutional adoption headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer 120x returns for those willing to position early, making it one of the stealth breakout contenders of this cycle. Final Thoughts XRP’s rally following the $125 million SEC settlement underscores the importance of regulatory clarity and institutional trust in crypto markets. With analysts targeting $12.60 by the end of 2025, XRP has regained its place as one of the sector’s most resilient assets. Yet, as history shows, the biggest gains often emerge not from established giants but from underdog projects that seize the momentum of a new cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its strong community backing and 120x growth potentia l, is increasingly viewed as one such project, offering the kind of upside that could define the next chapter of altcoin investing.

According to him , the valuation required to support this price would dwarf not only the cryptocurrency market but also global financial benchmarks, placing it far outside the realm of possibility in the foreseeable future. Tony highlights that at $1,000 per token, XRP’s market capitalization would rise to levels never seen in financial history. To illustrate, such a valuation would make XRP four times more valuable than the entire global gold market. Gold , regarded as one of the most stable and valuable assets in existence, has maintained its dominance in world markets for centuries. Exceeding this by that margin would be unprecedented for any asset class, let alone a single cryptocurrency. Beyond gold, XRP at $1,000 would also eclipse the largest corporations in the world. Its market cap would be about fifteen times greater than that of Apple, the highest-valued publicly traded company. Tony argues that this comparison alone shows $1,000 target is unrealistic since no digital asset has ever come close to challenging the dominance of the world’s top companies. Comparisons With the Global Economy The scale becomes even clearer when viewed from a macroeconomic perspective. At $1,000 per token, XRP’s market capitalization would be equivalent to half of global GDP, effectively rivaling the value of half of all goods and services produced across every economy. According to Tony, this scenario is economically implausible, as no single asset or company in history has ever portrayed such a proportion of worldwide activity. Additionally, XRP at that valuation would account for half of the entire global stock market. This means one cryptocurrency would need to match the combined worth of thousands of companies listed on exchanges worldwide. Tony stresses that this kind of outcome is not compatible with current and foreseeable market conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expert Calls It “Fantasy Pricing” Given these calculations, Tony categorizes the $1,000 projection as “fantasy pricing.” He emphasizes that even with widespread adoption, regulatory clarity, and favourable market cycles, the distance between XRP’s present valuation and the trillion-dollar thresholds implied by a $1,000 price is too great to bridge within the next decade. He further notes that the idea of achieving this milestone by 2030 is not credible. While cryptocurrency markets are known for rapid growth and volatility, the structural limitations of the global economy place clear boundaries on how far a single digital asset can rise. Investors expecting XRP to reach such heights would likely be waiting for generations, with no assurance that it would ever occur. Tony’s assessment underscores the importance of realistic expectations within the cryptocurrency sector. While XRP may continue to grow and benefit from broader adoption, the prospect of it trading at $1,000 is economically unfeasible based on current global financial structures. His message for investors is clear: optimism is valuable, but it must be grounded in practical market realities.

50211658,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-smashes-6-2m-mark-with-ethereum-bullish-outlook-and-cardano-growth-ahead/,1755399623,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,Cold Wallet Smashes $6.2M Mark With Ethereum Bullish Outlook and Cardano Growth Ahead,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-smashes-6-2m-mark-with-ethereum-bullish-outlook-and-cardano-growth-ahead/,"Ethereum (ETH) bullish signs are emerging after whales collected $1.34B in just days, lifting price action near the $4,600 target. Cardano (ADA) market surge talk is also rising as whales grabbed 200M ADA in 48 hours, fueling hopes for a rally toward $1.50. Both highlight strong capital flows, but the outcome still depends on market confidence. Moreover, Cold Wallet (CWT) adds a different angle. From its Stage 1 entry at $0.007, every presale round has moved closer to its confirmed $0.3517 listing. With momentum growing and $6.2M already raised, the window for return potential keeps shrinking. Ethereum Whale Buys Point to Possible Move Toward $4,600 An unknown investor purchased $1.34B worth of ETH across just eight days, spreading the total of 312,052 ETH into ten wallets using FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and BitGo. This activity matches Ethereum’s building momentum and may hint at early institutional demand. Price charts show ETH near a Fibonacci level around $4,324. A clear push beyond could send it toward $4,587, though signals like the Relative Strength Index at 73 point to possible overbought risk. With fewer ETH held on exchanges and optimism rising, conditions suggest more upside, though traders remain alert for profit-taking along the way. For those tracking large-scale capital flows, this may be a key moment. Cardano Sets Sights on 76% Gain With Rally Toward $1.50 Cardano (ADA) has drawn attention after whales picked up 200M ADA worth over $170M within two days. This heavy buying move cut available supply and may boost upward price pressure. ADA now trades close to $0.85, a resistance point that has limited moves for months. Hopes for a U.S. Cardano ETF also add momentum, with analysts suggesting a 75% chance of approval. The mix of whale accumulation, tighter supply, and ETF speculation makes Cardano one of the most discussed assets in the market. If momentum holds, the conditions could drive a breakout toward $1.50. Cold Wallet Presale Crosses $6.2M as Stage 17 Price Nears Final Entry Point The Cold Wallet presale is advancing quickly, leaving limited time for new entries. In only a few weeks, it has gathered more than $6.2 million, and Stage 17’s $0.00998 price is showing signs that it will not stay open for long. This is not the standard model of raising funds first and then chasing users later. With the $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition, Cold Wallet begins its journey with over 2 million active users already in place, addressing the key challenge of adoption from the start. From the first stage at $0.007, every presale round has pushed closer to the set $0.3517 listing price, steadily reducing potential returns for late buyers. The calculation is clear: each completed stage narrows the chance for larger gains. With more than 735 million tokens already sold, available supply is shrinking at a fast pace. The difference with this presale is its direct utility. Cold Wallet is not focused on promises of future value; it already delivers cashback on every transaction, swap, or transfer. This creates a launch-ready system rather than a plan still in development. At the current rate, the window of opportunity appears to be measured in days instead of months. For those seeking maximum returns, waiting until listing could mean missing the strongest gains. Cold Wallet Builds Value Through Active Utility Instead of Market Hype Ethereum (ETH) bullish signals and Cardano (ADA) market surge discussions are filling headlines, yet both depend on outside factors such as ETF decisions, whale moves, and broad market conditions. Cold Wallet follows a separate path. Its presale is not based on speculation but on a working product where cashback rewards turn every swap, transfer, or network cost into value. With more than 735 million tokens sold since Stage 1 and a fixed $0.3517 listing price, the growth path is defined and time-limited. For market watchers, the choice between pursuing rallies already underway or entering a ready-to-launch system is increasingly pointing toward Cold Wallet.

50211659,https://thecoinrise.com/top-trending-crypto-blockdag-sui-hyperliquid-toncoin/,1755399632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50211659.jpeg,"Top Trending Crypto: BlockDAG, Sui, Hyperliquid & Toncoin",https://thecoinrise.com/top-trending-crypto-blockdag-sui-hyperliquid-toncoin/,"Recent activity in the market has highlighted which projects are truly gaining traction. The surge is coming from adoption, community involvement, and meaningful catalysts, not just short-term hype. If you’re looking for the top trending crypto in 2025, the focus should be on projects showing both momentum and strong fundamentals. From presales raising hundreds of millions to Layer-1 networks posting jumps in daily engagement, these projects stand out for very different reasons. Below is a breakdown of four names making headlines right now and why they’re part of the top trending crypto discussion. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Heavyweight with Exchange Ambitions BlockDAG is shaping up as one of the most compelling stories in the top trending crypto conversation. Built as a hybrid Layer-1, it combines a Directed Acyclic Graph structure with Proof-of-Work consensus and full EVM compatibility. This setup delivers high throughput, security, and smart contract functionality. Its presale has already pulled in over $375 million, selling more than 25 billion BDAG units across 29 batches at a price of $0.0276. Early participants in Batch 1 have notched 2,660% gains on paper, while those joining now could still see an 81% lift if the projected $0.05 listing materializes. Analysts suggest that listings on Coinbase and Gemini could even push it closer to $1. The groundwork is already substantial. More than 2.5 million people actively use the X1 Mobile Miner App every day, while 4,500 developers are building 300+ dApps. Add in 19,000 mining units sold, 200,000+ holders, and 20 confirmed exchange listings, and BlockDAG clearly has infrastructure and adoption in place before launch. This mix of momentum and readiness cements its position as a top trending crypto for 2025. 2. Sui: Network Activity Takes Center Stage Sui has gained attention thanks to a sharp spike in network usage. Priced at around $4.04 with a market cap near $14.17 billion, it recorded a 79% increase in daily active accounts within just 72 hours. That sudden rise in activity signals growing demand for its services and coincides with expectations of new liquidity events. Its Move-based architecture is drawing developers who are building gaming and DeFi apps, fueling ecosystem growth. Add in speculation about fresh exchange integrations, and the buzz only intensifies. With rising engagement and technical strength, Sui has earned its spot among today’s top trending crypto projects. 3. Hyperliquid: Growth Fueled by Buybacks Hyperliquid is trading at about $47.31 with a $15.80 billion market cap, distinguishing itself with a dual role as botha blockchain andan exchange platform. The buzz around it has been amplified by reports of daily buybacks exceeding $4 million, strengthening bullish sentiment. Revenue growth adds credibility, with its model supporting finance-focused dApps and high-volume transactions. Out of its 1 billion supply, about 333.9 million are circulating, leaving room for expansion without heavy dilution. With talk of community rewards and ongoing Layer-1 development, Hyperliquid continues to show why it belongs in the top trending crypto mix. 4. Toncoin: Telegram Advantage Drives Adoption Toncoin, priced near $3.55 with a $9.12 billion market cap, has one of the clearest adoption pipelines thanks to its direct link with Telegram. The integration brings a wallet mini-app to more than 87 million U.S. users, opening the door for simple crypto transactions inside an app people already use daily. On top of that, Telegram now accepts TON for selected in-app payments, adding real use to the network. With a supply of about 2.57 billion and ice stability in the mid-$3s, Toncoin combines community support with unique reach. That makes it an easy pick for the top trending crypto list in 2025. Final Thoughts Across presales, surging activity, exchange revenues, and direct app integration, these four projects highlight different ways to rise as a top trending crypto . BlockDAG leads with massive presale traction and a clear exchange strategy. Sui shows strength through rapid user growth. Hyperliquid pairs real revenue with strong buybacks. And Toncoin leverages Telegram’s user base for real-world adoption. Each project has its own strengths, but all four demonstrate that performance in 2025 comes from community engagement, adoption, and execution. For anyone tracking the top trending crypto story this year, these names are firmly at the center of the conversation.

While giants like XRP and Solana continue to lead the charge, a new contender is quickly rising as one of the best altcoins to buy : MAGACOIN FINANCE . If you’re scouting the best altcoins to buy before the next major rally, this could be your golden opportunity. Early-stage investors and analysts alike are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the top altcoins to watch in the run-up to 2026 — with potential gains of 10x to 15x in just the next few months. XRP: Legal Clarity Positions It as One of the Best Altcoins to Buy in 2025 August 2025 has been monumental for XRP , placing it firmly back on the list of the top altcoins to watch . The Ripple vs. SEC legal saga has officially ended, bringing long-awaited regulatory clarity to one of crypto’s most controversial tokens. Key Developments: SEC case officially concluded on August 8, 2025 $125M fine imposed, but XRP not deemed a security Institutional adoption expected to surge post-settlement With several major firms — including Grayscale, Bitwise, and ProShares — submitting ETF applications, analysts are labeling XRP as one of the best altcoins to buy before ETF approvals hit in October 2025 . If you’re looking for top altcoins to watch with major catalysts on the horizon, XRP deserves a place at the top of your list. Solana: Network Upgrades Make SOL a Top Altcoin to Watch Another powerhouse that continues to dominate headlines is Solana (SOL) — consistently named among the best altcoins to buy in 2025. Despite the SEC delaying ETF decisions until October 16 , bullish momentum remains strong. August Highlights: DeFi TVL up 60% to $14.18 billion Trading near $192 with strong institutional inflows Major network upgrades: Firedancer , new consensus mechanism, and block space doubling Solana’s on-chain metrics and technical upgrades reinforce its status as a top altcoin to watch for explosive growth. Analysts see price targets of $210–$220 in the short term, with longer-term upside much higher. Plus, with Solana onboarding more developers than Ethereum and dominating DEX volume, it continues to be one of the best altcoins to buy if you want exposure to DeFi, NFTs, and scalable infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Sleeper Hit Among Best Altcoins to Buy Now While XRP and Solana are proven giants, the real excitement is around emerging altcoins — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly being labeled by insiders as one of the top altcoins to watch for breakout returns in 2025. With deflationary tokenomics , staking utility, and viral momentum, this project checks all the boxes for those hunting the best altcoins to buy early — before major listings, influencers, or institutions catch on. The project has successfully completed and passed its Hashex security audit , which means the initial smart contract checks were positive with no major vulnerabilities found. The CertiK audit is still in progress and currently under review. Once approved, it will further boost investor trust and confirm the project’s overall security. If you’re building your 2025 crypto portfolio and want the best altcoins to buy low and sell high , MAGACOIN FINANCE should be at the top of your radar. Some analysts are already calling it the next 10x–15x altcoin — with even higher upside possible as crypto sentiment continues to improve. The Best Altcoins to Buy Are the Ones You Catch Early While XRP and Solana will likely remain on the list of the top altcoins to watch , the massive gains are harder to come by when much of the market already knows about them. That’s why savvy investors are turning to early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which offers: High reward potential Early mover advantage Strong brand and DeFi use case Getting in before the crowd is what separates a 2x win from a 15x moonshot — and right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is presenting that rare opportunity. Final Thoughts It doesn’t really matter if your favorable bets go towards XRP, that is going to benefit from the regulatory clarity, Solana, which will see an amazing growth due to DeFi, or MAGACOIN FINANCE, which will have a giant upside potential, as long as one thing is very clear: The second half of 2025 is shaping up to be a historic altcoin season — and you’ll want to be holding the best altcoins to buy before the rest of the market catches up.

Ether's recent outperformance versus bitcoin suggests further rotation, making me cautious on bitcoin until relative strength improves. IBIT's volatility is at historic lows, and a 10% pullback to $61 would present a more attractive entry point for adding exposure. Seasonal weakness in August-September and bearish technical divergences warrant patience, but I remain bullish on bitcoin's long-term outlook. I turned neutral on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) in Q2. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency led the broader equity market recovery off the April low, catapulting from under $75,000 in the spring to, for a moment, a new all-time high last week above $124,000. My June hold rating looked at market data but bypassed what was happening on the chart, along with relative price trends to bitcoin’s little brother, ether. So, today I’m revisiting IBIT, but through a fresh and updated lens. I keep my hold rating when scanning these data. As holder of the fund myself (in a taxable account), I’ll call out other notable features that keep me bullish over the long haul. Bitcoin: An Unimpressive All-Time High Last Week, Back Below $120,000 StockCharts.com First, we must acknowledge the intense bullish price action with ether. In my view, this is part of the reason why bitcoin has not thrust much above its January high. The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain network was down 57% at the year-to-date low shortly after Liberation Day. Fast forward not even five months, and ETH is now outpacing bitcoin, gold, and the S&P 500 so far in 2025. Notice in the YTD performance chart below that the red line (bitcoin relative to ether) has been trending lower since late April. That augurs for a long play on the asset in the denominator (ether). For me to turn more bullish on bitcoin, I’d like to see it hook higher on this relative chart. To be clear, IBIT is higher by a more-than-respectable 25% since December 31, 2024. I’ll note later that it sports robust risk-adjusted returns, too. ETH > BTC YTD BTC YTD"" contenteditable=""false""> StockCharts.com Last week, ether caught an even larger tailwind when Fundstrat’s Tom Lee published a report predicting that the token could reach five figures by year-end. A $10,000 to $12,000 price target is bold, and (in my technical expertise) the sanguine outlook really depends on ether rising above its November 2021 all-time high. That remains to be seen. If the breakout occurs, I would not be surprised to see a bitcoin selloff a bit as more money rotates from bitcoin and into ether. Tom Lee: Ether Will More Than Double By Year-End Fundstrat These are incredible prices. I posted on X that, in a sign of the times, Strategy’s (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor is now (comfortably) wealthier than legendary hedge fund manager George Soros. Saylor ranks No. 441 on the world’s richest list, compared to 480 for Soros, largely thanks to bitcoin hovering near its all-time high. Sign Of The Times: Saylor Wealthier Than Soros Bloomberg To be clear, I like bitcoin long-term. Despite having a high correlation with the Nasdaq 100 over recent years, if we zoom out the chart, we see that bitcoin’s price action largely mimics the growth of the global M2 money supply. As illustrated below, Deutsche Bank asserts that the next leg higher in bitcoin may be overdue in light of the sharply rising amount of liquidity shuffling through markets. Bitcoin: A Practical Long-Term Hedge Against Money Printing Globally Deutsche Bank I hinted at bitcoin's solid risk-adjusted returns earlier. Indeed, last Friday’s Goldman Sachs US Weekly Kickstart report tallied bitcoin as on par with gold at the top of the 2025 performance stack. The Sharpe Ratio is well above 0, despite it being below that of gold and US junk bonds. I think that metric could improve over the months ahead. Let me explain. Asset Class Performances YTD Through August 15 Goldman Sachs You see, IBIT’s implied volatility is near an all-time low, under 40%. Its historical volatility is even more depressed, near 30%. The rally off the April low has been quite orderly. Should that persist through the end of the year, then the Sharpe Ratio would only improve further. Of course, IBIT holders know well that volatility can creep up with little notice. Are we due for a pullback? I would not be surprised. Let’s forge ahead with this technical view. IBIT: Very Low Implied Volatility, Even Softer Realized Volatility Fidelity August and September are the worst months of the year for bitcoin, historically speaking. Now through the end of Q3 has featured bouts of volatility, corrections, and even bear markets. So far, bitcoin bulls are holding their own, with the cryptocurrency up 1%. Ergo, a cautious stance is warranted through September, in my opinion. Bitcoin: Weak August-September Calendar Bias Barchart Bitcoin: Bearish Seasonal Trends Through Q3 Jeffrey Hirsch @AlmanacTrader Bitcoin Up Slightly In August, Half-Way Through The Month Koyfin Charts The Technical Take Now let’s point out some key price points on IBIT’s chart, something readers may have wished for in my previous assessment. Notice in the chart below that the technical situation looks decent on the surface—higher highs and higher lows. But there are risks. The RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph has printed a series of lower highs in what technical analysts would call bearish divergence to price. With waning upside momentum, I feel there is now a material chance that IBIT eventually tags its long-term 200-day moving average. I like that it is on the rise, but we saw during the April selloff and bounce that fast moves toward the 200dma can occur. When might that happen? It could take several weeks, based on where support is found. IBIT’s previous high in the range of $60 to $61 has confluenced with the symmetrical triangle (or coil) pattern from late in the first half to the start of the third quarter. That’s also where a high amount of volume by price enters the picture. Thus, a 10% pullback from here would make for a favorable entry point. IBIT: Expects A Dip To $61, Weakening Momentum StockCharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on IBIT. This refreshed look at the technicals, including relative price action to ether, which has come on strong since mid-April, asserts that there’s more near-term downside risk to bitcoin's price. I don’t plan to sell and would consider adding to the position if IBIT retreats to $61. The long-term outlook remains bright.",ETHA|ETH-USD|BTC-USD|IBIT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-17 03:15:50

Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracker, reported a staggering 200,000,000 USDT transfer from Aave, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, to an unknown wallet. This substantial transaction, valued at approximately $200 million, immediately raises questions about its purpose and potential impact. What Does This Aave Transaction Mean? When such a massive amount of stablecoin like USDT moves, it’s always noteworthy. This particular Aave transaction involves one of the largest lending and borrowing protocols in the DeFi space. Aave allows users to lend and borrow various cryptocurrencies, earning interest or paying interest in return. The movement of 200 million USDT suggests a significant shift in capital. It could signal various intentions, from an institutional over-the-counter (OTC) trade to a strategic portfolio rebalancing by a major investor. Decoding the Crypto Whale’s Movements The term “ crypto whale ” refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of cryptocurrency. Their transactions often have the power to influence market sentiment or even prices, depending on the asset and the timing. This particular large crypto transfer is undeniably the action of a whale. Understanding why whales move such vast sums is crucial for market watchers. Here are some common reasons: OTC Deals: Large institutional buyers often prefer over-the-counter transactions to avoid impacting market prices on exchanges. Portfolio Rebalancing: A whale might be shifting assets to new opportunities or reducing exposure to certain risks. Preparing for New Investments: The funds could be moved to a different platform or wallet to participate in new DeFi protocols, yield farming, or upcoming token sales. Security Reasons: Some whales transfer funds to cold storage for enhanced security, although moving from Aave (which is generally secure) to an unknown wallet might suggest otherwise. The Mystery of the Unknown Wallet The fact that the destination is an unknown wallet adds a layer of intrigue to this USDT transfer . While blockchain transactions are transparent, showing addresses and amounts, the identity behind these addresses often remains anonymous. This anonymity is a core feature of many cryptocurrencies, providing privacy to users. However, for a transaction of this magnitude, the lack of immediate identification of the recipient sparks curiosity within the community. Is it a new institutional player entering the market? Is it a liquidity provider for a new DeFi venture? Or is it simply a personal wallet for long-term holding? Market analysts and enthusiasts will undoubtedly monitor the destination wallet for any subsequent movements, as these could offer clues about the whale’s intentions. Such large transfers underscore the dynamic and sometimes opaque nature of the crypto market, where significant capital shifts can occur rapidly. This substantial Aave transaction highlights the ongoing evolution of the DeFi landscape and the crucial role that large capital movements play. While the immediate implications of this 200 million USDT transfer to an unknown wallet remain speculative, it serves as a powerful reminder of the continuous activity and innovation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Monitoring these whale movements helps us better understand the broader trends shaping the future of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDT? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This means its value is intended to remain stable at $1, making it a popular choice for traders and investors seeking to avoid the volatility of other cryptocurrencies while staying within the crypto ecosystem. What is Aave? Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. It operates on a peer-to-peer model without traditional intermediaries, offering services like flash loans and various interest-earning opportunities. Why is a 200 million USDT transfer significant? A 200 million USDT transfer is significant because it represents a substantial amount of capital. Such a large crypto transfer can indicate major institutional activity, a strategic move by a crypto whale , or a significant shift in liquidity, potentially influencing market sentiment or asset allocation. Can the owner of an unknown wallet be identified? While blockchain transactions are public, the identity behind an unknown wallet address is typically pseudonymous. Unless the wallet interacts with a regulated exchange or service that requires Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, directly identifying the owner can be challenging. How does a large Aave transaction impact the DeFi ecosystem? A large Aave transaction involving funds moving out could temporarily reduce the liquidity available for lending on the platform, although Aave’s pools are typically very deep. More broadly, it highlights the continuous flow of capital within DeFi, signaling potential shifts in investment strategies or new opportunities being pursued by major players.

A sudden red day can wipe out weeks of gains if traders are unprepared. This is why crypto portfolio protection has become one of the most searched topics in 2025. Investors want to know not just the best crypto to buy, but also how to safeguard their holdings when prices drop. In this article, we’ll cover practical crypto market dip strategies, discuss the best altcoin to buy for recovery plays, and highlight why analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a secure option during uncertain phases. How to Protect Your Crypto Portfolio in a Dip The first step in protecting wealth is preparation before the dip even arrives. Analysts suggest several habits for smart risk management: Diversify smartly Relying only on one token is risky. A balanced mix of majors like Bitcoin and Ethereum, paired with the best altcoin to buy in emerging sectors, reduces exposure. Use stablecoins wisely Holding part of your funds in USDT, USDC, or other stablecoins gives flexibility. When the market drops, this cash reserve allows buying without selling assets at a loss. Staking and yield farming Passive earnings from staking help cushion drawdowns. Even when prices dip, your holdings can still generate returns. Stop-losses and scaling entries Smart investors avoid emotional selling by setting exit levels in advance. Buying in layers instead of all at once also spreads risk. Rotation awareness Capital often shifts from majors into altcoins once fear fades. Countdown to the Upcoming Altcoin Season. Next Altcoin Breakouts and Rotation Plays to Watch. Staying aware of this flow helps position early. Practicing these steps is one of the simplest ways of how to protect crypto assets without panic during downturns. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Stability During Market Volatility When analysts look at assets that stand out in turbulent markets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting attention. Its transparent audits and sustainable tokenomics are designed to give investors peace of mind when volatility spikes. In a period where trust matters more than hype, this approach makes it a safer crypto to buy during dips. For those focused on crypto portfolio protection, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s model is appealing. Its supply is structured to avoid runaway inflation, and the project promotes long-term holding rather than quick flips. Investors can even receive 50% EXTRA with code EXTRA50X, an incentive aimed at those willing to accumulate and wait out cycles. Analysts note that while 80% of a portfolio should remain in established projects and the best altcoin to buy, keeping 10–20% in a new rising star can boost upside. With its balance of safety and growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that role. Final Thoughts: Preparing for the Next Market Move Every dip feels painful, but for prepared investors it’s also an opportunity. The difference comes from discipline: diversify, use stablecoins, stake assets, and plan entries ahead of time. These are strategies that help reduce losses while positioning for recovery. For those asking how to protect crypto assets and still gain exposure to new opportunities, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer an extra layer of stability. Backed by transparent audits and a sustainable model, it has started to stand out as one of the best crypto to buy in volatile conditions. Market dips won’t stop happening. But with a mix of defensive positioning, smart rotation plays, and selective exposure to the best altcoin to buy, portfolios can not only survive — they can come out stronger.

An unnamed source recently compromised a device belonging to a DPRK IT worker and provided unprecedented insight into how a small team of five IT workers operated over 30 fake identities. DPRK Operatives Flood Crypto Job Market According to ZachXBT’s tweets, the DPRK team reportedly used government-issued IDs to register accounts on Upwork and LinkedIn, to obtain developer roles on multiple projects. Investigators found an export of the workers’ Google Drive, Chrome profiles, and screenshots, which revealed that Google products were central to organizing schedules, tasks, and budgets, with communications primarily conducted in English. Among the documents is a 2025 spreadsheet containing weekly reports from team members, which shed light on their internal operations and mindset. Typical entries included statements such as “I can’t understand the job requirement, and don’t know what I need to do,” with self-directed notes like “Solution / fix: Put enough efforts in heart.” Another spreadsheet tracks expenses, showing purchases of Social Security numbers, Upwork and LinkedIn accounts, phone numbers, AI subscriptions, computer rentals, and VPN or proxy services. Meeting schedules and scripts for fake identities, including one under the name “Henry Zhang,” were also recovered. The team’s operational methods reportedly involved purchasing or renting computers, using AnyDesk to perform work remotely, and converting earned fiat into cryptocurrency via Payoneer. One wallet address, 0x78e1, associated with the group is linked on-chain to a $680,000 exploit at Favrr in June 2025, where the project’s CTO and other developers were later identified as DPRK IT workers using fraudulent documents. Additional DPRK-linked workers were connected to projects via the 0x78e1 address. Indicators of their North Korean origin include frequent use of Google Translate for Korean-language searches conducted from Russian IP addresses. ZachXBT said that these IT workers are not particularly sophisticated, but their persistence is bolstered by the sheer number of roles they target across the world. Challenges in countering these operations include poor collaboration between private companies and services, as well as resistance from teams when fraudulent activity is reported. North Korea’s Persistent Threat North Korean hackers, notably the Lazarus Group, continue to pose a significant threat to the industry. In February 2025, the group orchestrated the largest crypto exchange hack in history, as it stole approximately $1.5 billion in Ethereum from Dubai-based Bybit. The attack exploited vulnerabilities in a third-party wallet provider, Safe{Wallet}, which allowed the hackers to bypass multi-signature security measures and siphon funds into multiple wallets. The FBI attributed the breach to North Korean operatives, labeling it “TraderTraitor”. Subsequently, in July 2025, CoinDCX, an Indian cryptocurrency exchange, fell victim to a $44 million heist, which was also linked to the Lazarus Group. The attackers infiltrated CoinDCX’s liquidity infrastructure, exploiting exposed internal credentials to execute the theft.

BlockDAG has now added one of those moments with its record-setting 10 BTC Auction, awarding a total of $1.206 million in rewards. Ten participants, identified by wallet addresses, each received their share of the prize, marking an unmatched reward scale for a presale-stage event. This auction not only sets a new benchmark for community-focused incentives but also secures BlockDAG’s standing as a top-trending altcoin attracting worldwide attention. With presale funding approaching $375 million, its progress is built on verifiable results rather than speculation. Raising the Bar for Crypto Community Rewards The 10 BTC Auction was more than a promotional exercise, it has earned its place in history as one of the largest confirmed reward distributions ever seen in a presale. The $1.206 million total, based on current Bitcoin prices, reflects a rare level of transparency and scale at this point in a project’s timeline. Each winning participant took home a reward substantial enough to be life-changing, turning the event into a highlight for the wider crypto audience. This level of reward has shaped a participation model that appeals not only to dedicated early supporters but also to traders and collectors seeking opportunities backed by concrete payouts. Unlike promotions tied to speculative assets, BlockDAG’s rewards were distributed in Bitcoin, a widely recognised and established digital asset, adding to the event’s credibility. Achieving this during the presale phase demonstrates the operational strength of the top-trending altcoin in executing large-scale initiatives while maintaining its development momentum. The Figures Fueling BlockDAG’s Rise The numbers behind BlockDAG’s presale show why this auction carries weight. With nearly $375 million already raised, more than 25 billion coins sold, and the current batch priced at $0.0276, the project has delivered an ROI of 2,660% since batch one. This performance places it among the most successful presale efforts in recent years, both in capital raised and in the scale of its supporter base. The auction’s significance lies not only in its impressive total but in how it integrates into the broader story of growth. Events of this magnitude help drive BlockDAG’s reach across crypto news outlets, influencers, and broader retail audiences. By pairing substantial, immediate rewards with steady presale progress, the project reinforces its position as the top-trending altcoin, turning its community into active participants in shaping its future. How Large-Scale Rewards Build Momentum In crypto, size matters in more ways than fundraising or market cap, it also defines how a project captures imagination. A $1.206 million auction sparks attention beyond just the winners, igniting conversations across online communities and investment networks about what could happen next. For BlockDAG, this is not a fleeting PR win, it is proof of its ability to deliver at a scale comparable to established market players. Setting such a high benchmark for rewards elevates expectations for future events. The chance of even larger payouts generates ongoing anticipation and strengthens engagement. Few presale events in history have managed to combine immediate impact with long-term buzz so effectively. This is why BlockDAG continues to solidify its reputation as a top-trending altcoin, with each achievement reinforcing its position as a name to watch after launch. Final Thoughts The 10 BTC Auction has secured BlockDAG a place in the record books of high-value crypto achievements. Distributing $1.206 million during an active presale is a milestone that rewarded ten winners while proving the project’s financial capacity and organisational ability. Backed by nearly $375 million raised, a 2,660% ROI since batch one, and more than 25.3 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is a top-trending altcoin with measurable growth and verified results. As the project moves forward, this auction will stand as the moment it demonstrated the ability to deliver at a scale few others have matched, setting the tone for what is ahead.

Some coins rally on big headlines, while others gain from steady adoption. Solana’s comeback and ETF-related support, together with Chainlink’s steady performance during a market pullback, have caught traders’ eyes. But Cold Wallet brings something different. It already works as a live product, giving users cashback on real transactions. Cold Wallet presale also carries a 35x ROI chance, making it one of the top trending crypto plays. For anyone scanning the market, the mix of real utility and limited-time entry pricing is tough to ignore. Cold Wallet’s 35x ROI Window Is Closing Fast Cold Wallet’s presale is a rare chance, but only for those who act before the next stage. At stage 17, priced at $0.00998 per CWT, it is set to launch at $0.3517. That means early buyers can still aim for more than 35x returns. Each new stage raises the entry price, lowering the maximum ROI with every move forward. So far, over $6 million has been raised, showing growing demand. This is fueled by its active community already earning cashback on fees like gas, swaps, and on/off ramps. On top of this, its referral program, paying out in both USDT and $CWT, keeps attracting new users, building a cycle of growth and presale strength. For those watching top trending crypto choices, time is tight. Each stage makes the entry point less attractive. A working product, strong utility, and discounted presale pricing make Cold Wallet a rare find in today’s market. Solana Holds $197 With ETF Support & Whale Moves Solana has bounced back after recent dips, moving past $190 and now holding close to $197, after weekly gains of over 20%. Its trading volume also jumped from $4.2 billion to $13.5 billion, showing strong conviction. At the same time, institutional attention is growing: VanEck’s SOL ETF went live on DTCC, with Franklin Templeton and Bitwise adding further weight to Solana’s outlook. Large holders also shifted about $40 million worth of SOL to exchanges in a short window, hinting at higher activity and possible volatility. Analysts expect Solana to touch between $219 and $225 by year-end, roughly another 9% upside if momentum continues. Chainlink Stays Strong With 20% Gains Despite Market Reset Chainlink (LINK) has managed to hold its ground, with a weekly gain of over 20%, even as many altcoins corrected. Traders credit this to solid trust in its role as an essential data provider. Analysts highlight its strong base near $20, with a breakout above this level signalling further upside ahead. The adoption story adds to this strength. Chainlink still dominates Ethereum as the leading oracle, controlling 84% of the market and securing over $84 billion in DeFi value. Fee-driven demand, staking rewards that lock supply, and a buyback system that supports prices all add pressure to the upside. With its growing activity and renewed public attention, this looks less like a short-term bounce and more like a deeper trend supported by real use and strong fundamentals. Final Word on Today’s Crypto Market Outlook Solana’s whale trades and ETF signals, along with Chainlink’s firm role in DeFi, highlight how coins gain strength from trust and use cases. Cold Wallet, however, combines both with urgency. It has a working community, on-chain rewards, and a presale price still far from its launch level. But every new stage narrows that window. For those choosing among top trending crypto projects, Cold Wallet’s setup shows that the best bets are often the ones already proving their worth before hitting the market.

Signs the Upcoming Bullrun Is Gaining Strength. With investors preparing for the next wave of growth, many are asking the same question: what is the best crypto to buy now? Layer-1 blockchain projects 2025 are at the center of this debate, with Solana, Hyperliquid, and MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as top contenders. These networks are pushing scalability, adoption, and real-world use cases. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a rising star, positioned as one of the top blockchain projects 2025. 1. Solana: A Fast-Moving Giant with ETF Speculation Solana (SOL) continues to make headlines as one of the best altcoins to buy 2025. Known for its speed and growing developer ecosystem, it remains a dominant player in the Layer-1 conversation. As of the latest data, SOL trades at $186.35. While the SEC has postponed its ETF decision until October 16, 2025, institutional interest remains strong. SEC’s Solana ETF delay: Post by James Seyffart Market participants, including Kronos Research’s Vincent Liu, highlight regulatory uncertainty as a short-term hurdle rather than a long-term barrier. Whale activity has added intrigue. One major holder moved 39,875 SOL worth $8.19 million to Bybit, securing a $2.93 million profit from an average entry of $132. That’s a 56% gain, showing strategic positioning rather than a complete exit. Solana’s speed, liquidity, and expanding DeFi ecosystem make it one of the best crypto to buy now if you believe in long-term adoption. 2. Hyperliquid: Liquidity Engine of DeFi Hyperliquid (HYPE) is another strong Layer-1 contender and a rising name in top blockchain projects 2025. Priced at $47.19, HYPE is gaining traction for its unique positioning around liquidity and institutional support. Its trading engine achieved $29 billion in daily volume, generating $7.7 million in fees in a single day. The platform’s TVL has doubled to $610 million in four months, pointing to rapid adoption. Institutional integration is fueling growth. Circle is rolling out native USDC and CCTP V2 on Hyperliquid, while Anchorage Digital Bank has introduced custody for HYPE tokens. Together, these moves strengthen its reputation as one of the best crypto presale to buy now before liquidity surges further. Hyperliquid’s ecosystem growth shows why many see it as a strong candidate among the best altcoins to buy in 2025, with bullish momentum building into the next market expansion. 3. MAGACOIN FINANCE Ranked in the Top 3 MAGACOIN FINANCE has been ranked among the top blockchain projects 2025, standing shoulder to shoulder with Solana and Hyperliquid. What makes it stand out is its disruptive tokenomics, designed for multi-cycle scalability. Unlike many short-lived projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE aims to thrive across market expansions, with mechanics built to sustain value and drive adoption. The MAGACOIN hook is clear: it has been named one of the top three projects to watch, thanks to its bold approach to scalability and community growth. Its presale spots are nearly gone as Q4 market triggers approach, drawing attention from investors looking for the best crypto to buy now before the next rally accelerates. This positioning makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a strong candidate among the best crypto presale to buy now, especially for those seeking exposure to early-stage growth before mainstream recognition. Final Take: Preparing for the Next Wave The upcoming year is shaping into a turning point for Layer-1 blockchain projects 2025. Solana continues to dominate conversations around speed and ETFs. Hyperliquid is rewriting the liquidity game with strong institutional alignment. And MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping forward as a fresh force, bringing tokenomics designed for long-term growth. If you’re weighing the best crypto to buy now, these three deserve close attention. They combine adoption, innovation, and momentum, making them some of the best altcoins to buy 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE, in particular, is one of the best crypto ptesale to watch — a rising project with a unique design for scalability and staying power.

Bitcoin remains steady above key levels, and capital is clearly rotating into select names. For traders who’ve been patient, this week is shaping up to be a compelling moment to re-evaluate. The names surfacing most across analyst calls and trader circles are familiar at first glance — XRP, Cardano (ADA) — but one less obvious player is generating a surprising amount of buzz: MAGACOIN FINANCE. It’s being called a hidden gem for a reason, and we’ll get into why. XRP Is Back in Business There’s a sense that XRP is finally stepping into a new chapter after years of legal overhang, that has significantly impacted the token. This month, the token has climbed 6.2% so far to trade at around $3.12 as of press time but crypto traders seem more confident than they’ve been in a long time. Some analysts are optimistic, pointing to strong trading data that targets above $5 by year-end — especially if market sentiment stays bullish into Q4. Outside the charts, what’s really shifting is the narrative surrounding XRP. With the lawsuit finally behind it, Ripple is doubling down on global partnerships, especially in global money transfers and also looking to attract real-world assets to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Over the past months, several institutions that previously avoided XRP are starting to look again with Wellgistics recently enabling XRP payments for nearly 7000 pharmacies. So, it feels like XRP is no longer trying to “prove” anything — it’s just getting on with it. It has become the choice token for millions thanks to its legal clarity and soaring adoption. Cardano’s ADA Quietly Builds Momentum Cardano is another familiar name that’s been making quiet but steady moves. At $0.79, ADA isn’t spiking — it’s climbing. The recent Midnight protocol upgrade has added new privacy features, and DeFi partnerships continue to boost on-chain activity. Traders are watching closely for a break above the $1 mark — a level that hasn’t been convincingly held in some time. If momentum continues, some forecasts put ADA at $1.15 before the month is out, a solid 48% move from current levels. One trader in a popular Telegram group put it this way: “ADA doesn’t moon — it matures.” That might be exactly what this market needs right now. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem for This Altcoin Season Now here’s where things get interesting for crypto traders looking for the next hidden gem in this current bullish altcoin market situation. MAGACOIN FINANCE, the political-themed asset, is showing early signs of becoming something much bigger than its meme-heavy name suggests. It’s been climbing in mentions across analyst notes, Twitter/X threads, and even inside private investor groups. The core reason? It’s not trying to ride hype — it’s trying to outlast it. MAGACOIN’s value proposition is built around its transparent audits, its capped token supply, and a long-term economic model that rewards hodlers. The token has passed a Hashex security audit already, and a CertiK audit is underway. Away from this, the rumors of an upcoming exchange listings has led to some analysts calling it a textbook early-stage accumulation play. As a result, the token is getting linked to early Dogecoin and Shiba Inu cycles and continues to capture growing sentiment. What else can you ask for? The community behind MAGACOIN is also growing at a steady pace, with not just overnight hype — but real, sticky growth. And in a market full of short attention spans, that’s saying something for those looking to pay attention for an asset that would shake the industry. Final Word: Rotation Season Is Here Right now, altcoin watchers aren’t just looking for this week’s pump — they’re trying to position for the next wave. XRP has regulatory clarity and a global use case that institutions are ready to reprice. ADA has network strength, developer activity, and one of the strongest communities in the space. MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing all the early signs of a breakout altcoin: underexposed, well-structured, and growing where it counts. It doesn’t matter if you’re in it for conservative gains or aiming for the next big run — this week, all three deserve a serious look.To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit: Website: magacoinfinance.com Access: magacoinfinance.com/access Twitter/X: x.com/magacoinfinance Telegram: t.me/magacoinfinance Continue Reading: Altcoins to Watch This Week: XRP, ADA, and a Hidden Gem for 2025",Sponsored,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'BitcoinSistemi', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinsistemi,2025-08-17 04:30:39

Bitcoin is once again making the rules. But assets like SUI, PEPE, and others have become the new leaders. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves as whales come in strong and retail activity hits up. Bitcoin (BTC): Still the Institutional Anchor Over $1.2 billion has entered Bitcoin ETFs this month. Bitcoin continues to win institutional inflows. BTC has risen to about $118,000 following Trump-era pro-crypto policy and regulatory clarity around crypto ETFs. Analysts predict that a surge above $130,000 will initiate the next risk-on phase. Bitcoin is the macro anchor with over 50% dominance, showing strong money flow into crypto, says Coinbase. SUI: Quietly Surging With Institutional Support In the past year, SUI has grown 300% and it is still among the fastest-growing Layer-1 ecosystems in terms of adoption and developer activity. SUI has experienced a slight decrease of approximately 4.6% over the past week. Nevertheless, the terms of the recent loss are considered healthy by the majority of the traders. A long-term sentiment is buoyed by strong institutional interest and rumours of ETF support. Analysts expect SUI’s price to rally above $8.50 if it clears $4.75. PEPE: The Meme Coin With Real Volume Despite its volatility, PEPE has amazed traders by moving multi-day in trend with a big increase in volume. As of now, it is consolidating around $0.000012. If the price breaks above $0.000015, bullish sentiment across meme coins may be reintroduced. Whale wallets continue to accumulate suggesting that there could be a more organized rally ahead PEPE is no longer a meme as its liquidity and momentum are real. Ethereum (ETH): Eyeing the $5,000 Breakout Ethereum’s surge toward an all-time high can be credited to its past. The rise of DeFi developer tools and ecosystem expansion is already bringing speculative interest and long-term confidence back to ETH.

The asset remains above it for now, while substantial whale accumulations hint at another possible price pump. $2.81 is the key support for $XRP , where 1.70 million tokens were accumulated. pic.twitter.com/oYYMcEHeFP — Ali (@ali_charts) August 16, 2025 The support line in question is located around $2.81. Martinez said 1.70 million tokens were purchased at these levels, which are valued at well over $5 billion at today’s prices. Such sizable accumulation zones typically serve as significant support or resistance lines, as investors tend to panic if their positions change from being in the water to an unrealized loss after a long time and vice versa. XRP tested that support at the beginning of the month. At the time, the entire cryptocurrency market was in a free-fall state due to Donald Trump’s latest actions on the trade war front, as well as the movement of a couple of US nuclear submarines. However, the bulls managed to defend it, and Ripple’s native token bounced confidently above it and hasn’t looked back since. Just the opposite, it challenged the $3.30 resistance, which, for now, has been too strong to breach. Nevertheless, whales seem bullish on XRP’s future price movements as they keep accumulating the token. After last week’s $1 billion worth of XRP purchase , they bought another 120 million coins just a few days later. Meanwhile, Martinez outlined $3.26 as a key resistance level for the asset’s future trajectory. If broken, it could jump to a new all-time high of $3.90, he added.

Amidst the capital rotation and transaction boom, analysts have flagged Solana (SOL), VeChain (VET) and MAGACOIN FINANCE as standout performers, each showing strong momentum, growth, and adoption. Solana’s Growth Story Shows No Signs of Slowing Solana, one of the largest blockchain networks, continues to enjoy the positive crypto market mood. The network’s popularity is fast-growing among blockchain builders and DeFi users. In particular, the network has earned praise for its lightning-fast transaction speeds, rising total value locked (TVL), and institutional backing. Solana’s network is now home to billions in value and some of the highest activity in crypto, cementing itself as one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025. With the network now drawing more attention, analysts expect the massive decentralized exchange (DEX) volume on the blockchain to significantly increase. VeChain Rides Utility and Enterprise Demand VeChain (VET) has been building quietly—but consistently. The project continues to leverage its supply chain transparency, sustainability tracking, and global partnerships to deepen its growing adoption. Long-term forecasts for VeChain remain bullish, with models predicting significant price growth over the next few years. For investors seeking top altcoins to buy in 2025 and beyond, VeChain offers a mix of enterprise adoption, steady development, and potential upside that fits a long-term investment thesis. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly emerging as a top altcoin pick. Smart crypto investors know: timing matters more than hype. Those who got in on Solana or VeChain before they went mainstream saw returns that reached tens of thousands of per cent. Now, analysts are pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a political memecoin project that’s quietly gaining ground—as a hidden altcoin gem to accumulate before the next peak. Amidst the ongoing capital rotation, whales’ interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE has picked up. At the same time, analysts have highlighted MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the top altcoins to buy now for those watching early-stage momentum. While established tokens like Solana and VET could still deliver gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is uniquely positioned to outperform due to its low cap. For crypto investors looking for the next big move before it happens, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the rare chances to get in early on a potentially explosive asset. Final Thoughts: The Smartest Plays Aren’t Always the Loudest Finding the best altcoins to buy isn’t always about market cap or social media hype—it’s about identifying momentum, community traction, and untapped narratives. Solana and VeChain continue to offer strong fundamentals and compelling use cases. But for those willing to explore beyond the usual names, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a unique opportunity to capture early-stage growth. Whether you’re building a portfolio around utility, future relevance, or high-upside potential, keeping a close eye on emerging projects like MAGACOIN could be the smartest move you make this cycle.

50215799,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78827,1755406856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Standard Chartered Targets $25,000 Ethereum (ETH) Price. Here’s the Timeline",https://timestabloid.com/standard-chartered-targets-25000-ethereum-eth-price-heres-the-timeline/,"Standard Chartered has revised its outlook for Ethereum, shifting its year-end forecast from $4,000 to $7,500, an 87.5% increase from its previous projection . The bank attributes this adjustment to stronger institutional participation, accelerated accumulation by Ethereum-focused companies, and a fast-expanding stablecoin market. The institution’s earlier forecast, issued in March, was based on more modest assumptions about demand and adoption. Since then, developments in both the investment landscape and regulatory environment have led the bank to reassess its position. Ethereum’s current market price stands at approximately $4,721 , meaning Standard Chartered’s updated target implies a potential 59% upside by the end of 2025. Growing Institutional Presence as a Primary Driver According to the bank, institutional interest in Ethereum has risen significantly in recent months. A key factor is the emergence of Ether treasury companies, which acquire and hold large quantities of ETH as part of their strategic reserves. These entities have collectively secured 2.95% of Ethereum’s total supply, nearly twice the accumulation rate seen among similar Bitcoin-focused firms during the 2024 U.S. election cycle. Bitmine leads this wave of acquisitions with roughly 1.2 million ETH valued at $5.4 billion. Other notable participants include SharpLink, which has accumulated about 598,800 ETH worth $2.82 billion, and Ether Machine, with 345,400 ETH valued at $1.63 billion. This institutional buying spree is compounded by the performance of U.S.-listed Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On August 11, these ETFs recorded a record daily inflow of $1.02 billion. Combined, ETFs and treasury companies have removed approximately 3.8% of Ethereum’s total supply from circulation since early June, contributing to tighter market conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Stablecoin Expansion and DeFi Growth Standard Chartered also identified the rapid expansion of the stablecoin market as a major long-term catalyst for Ethereum. The bank expects the sector’s total value to reach $2 trillion by 2028, with Ethereum maintaining more than 50% market share. Stablecoins already account for around 40% of all transaction fees generated on the Ethereum network, providing a steady revenue stream that could support higher valuations. Regulatory clarity is another factor. Measures such as the GENIUS Act , passed in July, are expected to create a more defined framework for stablecoin operations in the U.S., encouraging further institutional adoption. Fundstrat CIO Tom Lee has previously pointed to this convergence of stablecoin growth and Wall Street interest in Ethereum as one of the most significant investment opportunities of the coming decade. Beyond its revised 2025 target, Standard Chartered projects Ethereum to rise to $12,000 by 2026 and $18,000 by 2027, reaching $25,000 in 2028. The bank anticipates Ethereum will hold an average value equivalent to 0.0445 BTC over the next four years. While these estimates are bullish, other analysts foresee even more aggressive gains. Market commentator Mr. Xoom has suggested Ethereum could reach $10,000 within the year, while Lee maintains a $15,000 target for the same period. Standard Chartered’s updated forecast reflects a stronger conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value, driven by deepening institutional involvement, accelerating supply absorption, and the growing role of stablecoins in the network’s economy. While the targets are ambitious, the combination of regulatory progress, structural demand, and blockchain adoption trends suggests that Ethereum could be positioned for one of its most significant growth phases to date.

Both are gaining attention for solid fundamentals, bullish charts, and active network growth. While these two grab headlines, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making noise with a presale that has already brought in $374.5 million at just $0.0276 per coin in Batch 29. Beyond the numbers, it is keeping its growing community engaged through Buyer Battles, the feature-packed Dashboard V4, and high-visibility partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas. These moves are positioning BlockDAG as a serious name among the top crypto projects to watch in 2025. SEI Price Momentum Gains Pace Sei (SEI) is trading at $0.3144 with a market cap of $1.80 billion and $333.20 million in daily trading volume, up 0.83% in the last 24 hours. A major catalyst has been rapid USDC adoption, with more than $160 million minted in only two weeks after Circle’s early investment, surpassing many older blockchains in stablecoin issuance. This growth is making Sei an attractive base for DeFi, cross-border payments, and settlement systems, drawing developers who need speed and efficiency. Analyst Ali Martinez recently flagged a bullish TD Sequential signal, which has been accurate in predicting SEI’s moves, hinting at a possible short-term push higher. In derivatives, volume slipped 1.67% to $455.04 million, and open interest fell 1.60% to $285.32 million, showing slightly less speculation. The funding rate held steady at 0.0010%, reflecting caution among traders. Solana (SOL) Extends Rally Above $200 Solana (SOL) jumped more than 15% in a single day, crossing $200 and sparking bullish sentiment. This rally is supported by strong developer activity, steady protocol upgrades, and growing demand in NFTs and meme assets. Long-term holders are adding to positions, and institutional interest is rising. Traders are watching $220 as the next near-term target. On the charts, SOL trades above the Ichimoku cloud with a bullish crossover forming, while the Chaikin Money Flow has moved back above zero, showing capital inflows. There is a rising wedge pattern, often a bearish sign, but a break above $219–$222 with strong volume could lift SOL toward $244–$250, or even $268 in an extended run. If it fails to hold $200, a pullback toward $180–$185 could come before another rally attempt. BlockDAG: Dashboard V4 and Sports Partnerships Expand Reach BlockDAG’s presale has now passed $374.5 million, with over 25.2 billion coins sold in 29 batches. The current price is $0.0276, still well under the planned $0.05 launch. Batch 1 participants have already seen gains of 2,660%, and current buyers could see an 81% lift at launch if projections hold. One standout feature is Buyer Battles, a daily contest where the largest buyer secures any leftover allocation for free at midnight. This turns each day of the presale into a competitive event and keeps participation high as the $600 million target gets closer. Dashboard V4 adds a professional, exchange-style experience for participants. It shows live BDAG charts, wallet balances, order book data, and referral stats. Leaderboards, bonus trackers, and interactive visuals give a taste of post-launch functionality while building community ties. The project is also going beyond crypto circles with sports partnerships. Collaborations with the Seattle Seawolves rugby team and Seattle Orcas cricket team introduce NFTs, fan coins, and exclusive content to new audiences. Alongside these efforts, BlockDAG’s mining ecosystem keeps growing. Its X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware miner pairing was demonstrated live earlier this month. These tools allow users to earn BDAG without complex setups, making mining accessible to all. With record presale results, engagement-focused features, global partnerships, and ready-to-use mining products, BlockDAG is cementing itself as a leading contender among 2025’s top crypto projects. Final Verdict SEI’s quick USDC integration and strong technical signals are setting it up for further growth, making it appealing as a fast, scalable blockchain for DeFi and payments. Solana’s surge above $200, backed by high on-chain activity and institutional interest, shows it can capture and hold market momentum. BlockDAG is taking a different route by building its ecosystem before launch. With $374.5 million raised, a $0.0276 price, competitive Buyer Battles, and Dashboard V4, it is creating engagement and utility ahead of listing. Sports partnerships with the Seawolves and Orcas boost mainstream reach, while mining tools like the X1 and X10 add practical earning options. For those tracking the top crypto projects, SEI and Solana are delivering now, but BlockDAG’s groundwork points toward a strong breakout in 2025.

Increased Demand: A growing number of investors are looking to add Bitcoin to their portfolios, viewing it as a store of value or a hedge against inflation. Market Sentiment: Positive news and widespread optimism can create a powerful feedback loop, encouraging more buying activity. Scarcity: Bitcoin’s fixed supply, especially after halving events, often creates upward pressure on its value as demand grows. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Trading Landscape For those involved in Bitcoin Trading , understanding the current market dynamics is crucial. A price point of $118,000 indicates strong buyer conviction and potentially less selling pressure at these levels. Traders often watch for key resistance and support levels, and breaking above a major psychological barrier like $100,000 and now $118,000 can ignite further upward movement. However, it’s also a reminder that volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto space. Key Considerations for Traders: Volume Analysis: High trading volumes accompanying the price increase can confirm the strength of the rally. Market Indicators: Technical analysis tools help identify potential entry and exit points. Risk Management: Always employ strategies to protect capital, especially during rapid price movements. The Broader Impact on Digital Asset Value A significant Bitcoin Price Surge often has a ripple effect across the entire ecosystem, influencing other digital assets. Bitcoin, being the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often acts as a bellwether for the rest of the Cryptocurrency Market .

New dual-entity structure aims to navigate tough US crypto regulations. Gemini Unveils Nasdaq IPO Ambitions Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has officially revealed plans to hold an initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol GEMI. The public S-1 filing, following a confidential June 2025 project, disclosed the company’s financials and details of its corporate structure. Gemini reported a net loss of $282.5 million for the first half of the year, a significant increase from the $41.4 million loss in the same period in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA dropped from a profit of $32 million to a loss of $113.5 million. The company ended the entire 2024 year with a loss of $158.5 million on revenue of $142.2 million. New Structure and Major Backers Shape Gemini’s IPO According to the IPO filing, Gemini plans to split its clients between two entities: Gemini Trust in New York and Moonbase in Florida. Moonbase will serve as the primary operating platform, since New York’s stricter BitLicense requirements limit access to staking. Gemini also disclosed a loan agreement with Ripple, signed in July. The $75 million line, with the possibility of increasing to $150 million, is provided in the RLUSD stablecoin, although no borrowings have been made to date. The share offering is being organized by financial institutions Goldman Sachs, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and Cantor. The IPO’s target share price has not yet been announced.

Ex-Sheep Marketplace founder tried to flee police by climbing onto a roof. Experts say blockchain transparency makes large criminal crypto transfers traceable. $45 Million Bitcoin Bribery Scandal Unravels in Czech Republic Czech police have arrested programmer Tomáš Jirikovský, founder of the darknet platform Sheep Marketplace, in a bribery case involving 468 BTC (worth about $45 million at the time of the transaction). The funds are linked to the resignation of Justice Minister Pavel Blažek in May 2025. According to the prosecutor's office, Jirikovský attempted to escape during the search by climbing onto the roof of a building but was detained and taken into custody. Local media claim he was the individual who handed over the bitcoins to the minister in an attempt to avoid another prison term. Jirikovský made his fortune from the illegal Sheep Marketplace, which operated in 2013 and was shut down after its founder stole users' funds. Wider Darknet and Crypto Investigation Continues In 2017, Jirikovský received a nine-year prison sentence for theft, drug trafficking, and illegal possession of weapons. He was released on parole in 2021. The investigation has also linked the bitcoin donation to another darknet marketplace called Nucleus, which holds 5,000 BTC and recently reactivated after a nine-year hiatus. In March 2025, a $77.5 million transaction from its wallet attracted the attention of analysts. Experts note that despite privacy features for ordinary users, large cryptocurrency transfers linked to criminal activity are easily traceable on the blockchain. According to Lucien Bourdon, an analyst at Trezor, this highlights both the transparency of cryptocurrency transactions and the importance of accountability in financial systems. Authorities are continuing their investigation, ensuring the safety of defendants and witnesses in this case.

Over 318M installs expected in 2025—2.8x year-over-year growth. Grok lags far behind with just $25.6M revenue, 1.9% of ChatGPT’s total. ChatGPT Dominates Mobile AI App Revenue Mobile app ChatGPT continues to see rapid revenue growth. According to Appfigures, iOS and Android users have spent about $2 billion on it since May 2023. That's about 30 times the combined spend on competing apps Claude, Copilot, and Grok. Since the beginning of 2025, the app has brought in $1.35 billion, which is 673% more than the figure for January–July last year ($174 million). On average, ChatGPT earns about $193 million per month—$25 million more than a year ago. By comparison, its closest competitor Grok has earned just $25.6 million year-to-date, representing only 1.9% of ChatGPT's revenue. OpenAI's average app install cost is $2.91 globally and $10 in the US, where it generates 38% of all revenue. Install and Download Trends Set Records ChatGPT has seen over 690 million total downloads, with 318 million expected in 2025—2.8 times higher than the same period last year. The leading market by installs is India (13.7% of all downloads), followed by the US (10.3%). According to Appfigures, monthly downloads have grown 180%, from 16 million between January and July 2024 to around 45 million this year. Germany has become the second-largest market by revenue after the US, accounting for 5.3% of all user spending. While some of the company’s revenue comes from corporate subscriptions and APIs, these figures reflect the popularity of the mobile version of ChatGPT among regular users. xAI's Grok launched in November 2023 but lacked a mobile app initially, which helps explain the gap, experts say.

In the fast-moving meme coin scene, timing can make all the difference. Right now, three names are sparking conversations – MoonBull ($MOBU), Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). MoonBull is emerging as a serious 100x crypto contender thanks to its exclusive whitelist that rewards early movers. Meanwhile, Chill Guy is leveraging one of TikTok’s most viral memes, and Pudgy Penguins is expanding its established NFT brand into a vibrant Solana-powered ecosystem. MoonBull: Whitelist Access to a 100x Crypto Opportunity MoonBull is built on Ethereum and designed for traders who thrive on high-upside plays. It’s attracting attention as a potential 100x crypto, and the reason is clear – its whitelist is giving early participants the kind of advantages that can define huge gains. Whitelist members secure the lowest entry price, plus access to secret staking rewards, bonus token allocations, and private hints about the project’s roadmap. These benefits aren’t available to the public before launch. Once the whitelist spots are gone, they’re gone for good. Stage One of the presale will open to all investors, but only those on the whitelist will get advance notice of the exact launch time. That early notification could mean entering before the wider market rushes in, which is often when the best positions are taken. The Pull of Early Entry Psychology There’s a well-known pattern in crypto – scarcity and timing create urgency. Projects with controlled early access often see their first buyers gain the biggest returns. In past launches across the market, early whitelisters have seen price multiples that latecomers could only watch from the sidelines. MoonBull’s setup taps directly into this psychology, making it a prime watch for those who believe the next 100x crypto will be claimed by the earliest and boldest participants. Chill Guy’s Viral Meme Power Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is riding a wave of internet popularity with over 600 million TikTok videos tied to its meme origin. The project’s aim is to build a community that shares and expands the laid-back, relatable message behind the meme. By turning a viral concept into a tokenized community, Chill Guy taps into an existing cultural phenomenon. The meme already has global recognition, and the token gives fans a new way to engage with and invest in the trend. As social media keeps pushing the meme into new feeds, CHILLGUY benefits from organic exposure. For many traders, that kind of visibility is just as valuable as technical utility. Pudgy Penguins’ Expanding Solana Ecosystem Pudgy Penguins began as one of the most recognizable NFT collections and has since built a broader platform. The PENGU token, running on the Solana blockchain, is at the heart of its expanding ecosystem. The token powers transactions within Pudgy World, offers staking rewards, and allows governance participation. Beyond the blockchain, Pudgy Penguins has ventured into merchandise, metaverse integration, and other real-world applications. With Solana’s speed and low transaction fees, PENGU has a strong infrastructure to support its growth. By merging its NFT brand with practical token use cases, the project positions itself for long-term engagement. Final Thoughts MoonBull , Chill Guy, and Pudgy Penguins are all gaining traction, but in different ways. MoonBull’s 100x crypto potential hinges on its limited whitelist and early entry perks. Chill Guy thrives on viral culture and community energy. Pudgy Penguins blends NFT branding with blockchain utility for a broader, more established ecosystem. For traders eyeing high-reward opportunities, MoonBull’s whitelist stands out as a decisive advantage. With limited spots available, the window to secure early access could close quickly, and in crypto, speed often decides the winners. For More Information: Website : https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram : https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter : https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs How to find meme coin presale? Check official project websites, reputable launchpads, and community channels for whitelist announcements and presale details. Which meme coin has the highest potential? Potential varies, but MoonBull is currently viewed as a strong 100x crypto candidate due to its whitelist benefits and early access structure. How does MoonBull’s whitelist give traders an advantage? It grants early access to the lowest entry price, bonus rewards, and private launch details before the public presale opens. What makes Chill Guy different from other meme coins? Chill Guy is built around an already-viral meme with massive TikTok reach, giving it strong organic exposure from day one. How is Pudgy Penguins using its PENGU token? The PENGU token powers transactions, staking, and governance within the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem, including metaverse and merchandise integrations.

This move underscores a growing trend among institutional investors to gain cryptocurrency exposure through equity holdings in companies with substantial Bitcoin reserves. According to an analysis by Standard Chartered, NBIM now has 11400 BTC after its recent addition of 5,200 BTC to its portfolio. NBIM added 200 BTC equivalent holdings in Metaplanet Typically, the NBIM holds its Bitcoin through shares of Strategy, formerly Microstrategy. However, this time, per Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, the Norwegian platform boosted its holdings in both Strategy and Metaplanet. Even so, he noted the holdings are still concentrated in Strategy, with only about 200 BTC-equivalent allocated to Metaplanet. He further commented, “The point here is that Norges is using MSTR as a way to gain exposure to the underlying. The increase in one quarter (83%) has to be a proactive position.” At current prices, Strategy’s 628,946 BTC stake is worth close to $74 billion, keeping it atop the list of public corporate holders . Metaplanet ranks seventh with 18,113 BTC, worth just over $2 billion. An earlier K33 report showed that NBIM’s BTC indirect exposure had expanded by more than 192% in the past year through H1 2025. According to K33 researcher Velte Lunde, the surge was largely fueled by treasury firms ramping up their Bitcoin holdings, alongside companies such as Strategy pushing for accumulation. He also attributed part of the fund’s exposure to BTC’s 11.9% USD-denominated gain this year. Meanwhile, several other sovereign and government funds have indirectly been boosting their Bitcoin exposure, primarily through Strategy. Kendrick had even forecast in February that more sovereign wealth funds would add exposure. Lunde also recently made similar claims, anticipating more BTC investments as companies jump on treasury allocations. Sovereign wealth funds are typically seen as long-term and conservative, making this exposure jump stand out. Kendrick raised his Bitcoin and Ethereum projections Standard Chartered’s Kendrick is a long-time Bitcoin optimist who recently adjusted his short-term forecast for the cryptocurrency. Last month, he raised his Bitcoin price forecast to $135,000 by late September, stuck with his $200,000 year-end prediction, and predicted the token could hit $500,000 by 2028. Aside from Bitcoin, he also estimated that Ethereum could hit $7,500 by the end of the year and possibly $25,000 by 2028. Standard Chartered explained that treasury entities and ETFs have amassed 3.8% of all circulating Ethereum since June, almost twice as fast as Bitcoin accumulation, warranting their forecast change. Kendrick further projected BNB climbing as high as $2,775 by 2028, AVAX hitting $250 by 2029, and XRP appreciating to $12.50 by 2028, adding that stablecoin adoption will accelerate enough to push the market close to $2 trillion by year-end 2028. According to the bank, the GENIUS Act enactment offers more clarity on the assets’ framework and thus will facilitate mainstream adoption. Ideally, growing stablecoin dominance would boost Ethereum gains since stablecoins generate about 40% of blockchain fees, and over half of them are issued on the Ethereum network.

While Dogecoin has recently seen a boom, attention is now gravitating towards newer altcoins like Remittix (RTX). As a beneficial DeFi project, Remittix is gaining traction from its presale performance as well as imminent wallet release, making it one of the top crypto presale 2025 projects to watch out for. Dogecoin Price Trends and Market Activity Dogecoin remains a very popular meme coin, but its movement appears to be tapering off. The asset is currently trading at $0.2296, having gained 2.56% in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization remains at $34.56 billion on the strength of $2.65 billion worth of trading volume, down by nearly 25%. This exercise shows that while DOGE keeps taking center stage, its performance is building a base relative to previous rallies. Investors seeking the next great altcoin 2025 are therefore looking into such initiatives as Remittix that both demonstrate real-world utility and early-stage growth prospects. Remittix Presale Momentum Builds Remittix is among the most trending crypto under $1 with tokens worth a mere $0.0944. The project has garnered more than $19.8 million and sold more than 604 million tokens, making it among the fastest growing crypto presales in 2025. A standout feature is the emphasis on real world adoption. Remittix allows the sending of cryptocurrency straight into bank accounts in over 30 countries, supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. This places it among a limited number of crypto addressing real world concerns, bringing together blockchain with real world financial systems. Investors are also looking forward to the $20M presale milestone that will witness its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing unveiled. The action is expected to boost liquidity, exposure, and investor access. Beta Wallet and Launch Announcement Remittix launched its beta wallet reveal recently, with a Q3 release expected. The mobile-first solution will feature real-time FX conversion, offering freelancers, companies, and remitters an easy way to manage cross-border payments. Such a feature reinforces RTX’s position as one of the top DeFi projects 2025. $19.8M+ raised, 604M tokens sold Beta wallet release in Q3 First CEX listing reveal at $20M $250,000 giveaway live now What Comes Next Momentum is building rapidly for RTX , particularly as the 50% presale bonus remains in effect. With the addition of utility, accessibility, and stable presale momentum, Remittix is an emerging altcoin worth watching and a crypto that truly possesses actual utility. For investors coming in from Dogecoin, Remittix’s arrival indicates where the capital is going next. With wallet launch, upcoming listings, and going after solving cross-border payments, RTX aims to become one of the best long term crypto investments of 2025.

These moves are drawing attention as traders weigh near-term trading opportunities. In parallel, BlockDAG (BDAG) is progressing with a presale that has already reached $374.5 million at a Batch 29 price of $0.0276. Alongside live mining demonstrations and partnerships in professional sports, the project is shaping a pre-launch presence with long-term scope. While WLD and DOGE deliver immediate trading setups, BlockDAG’s funding strength, visible technology, and growing reach are setting the stage for its 2025 debut. WLD Maintains Critical Price Level Worldcoin (WLD) has declined from $1.08 to $0.99 in the past 24 hours, marking a 9.38% drop. The main support lies at $0.9950, while $1.08 acts as firm resistance. The RSI is approaching oversold territory, suggesting selling pressure may soon ease. A brief stabilization near $0.98 hints at possible short-term recovery. The MACD remains in bearish territory, with the line under the signal and negative histogram readings showing sellers still dominate. Daily trading volume rose to $230.78 million during the decline, signaling strong reaction but unclear follow-through. If WLD loses the $0.9950 level, further drops are likely. A rebound from oversold conditions could trigger a temporary upswing, especially if market sentiment turns supportive and buying pressure strengthens. DOGE’s Golden Cross Points to Possible Upside Dogecoin (DOGE) has formed its first golden cross since last November, where the 50-day moving average moves above the 200-day. This technical event has often preceded notable rallies for the asset. In November 2024, the same setup led to a 130% rise, and in November 2023, it was followed by a 25% gain. Now priced at $0.2357, DOGE’s chart suggests bullish momentum is building. While no outcome is guaranteed, the pattern’s historical track record keeps trader interest high. The $0.25 mark is the first price level in focus, with potential for larger moves if buying accelerates. Given DOGE’s influence over the meme coin space, a sharp rally could lift related assets as well, making this setup one of the most-watched signals in the near term. BlockDAG: Funding Milestone, X10 Miner Demo, and Sports Visibility BlockDAG’s presale has now raised $374.5 million, selling over 25.2 billion coins in 29 batches. The current price is $0.0276, still well below the planned $0.05 launch price. Early participants from Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% gain, and current entries could see an 81% rise if the listing meets projections. Technically, BlockDAG combines a blockchain ledger with a Directed Acyclic Graph to enable parallel block confirmations, delivering thousands of transactions per second with low delay. It retains Proof-of-Work security and supports EVM-compatible smart contracts, making it straightforward for developers to bring over existing dApps. The X1 and X10 miners were demonstrated live earlier this year. The X1 mobile miner connects seamlessly with the X10 hardware unit via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Ethernet. In testing, the X10 produced up to 200 BDAG daily, compared to the X1’s 20 BDAG, giving clear scalability for home and hobbyist setups. Partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves rugby team and Seattle Orcas cricket team add another dimension. These deals introduce NFTs, fan coins, and exclusive content to mainstream audiences, extending the brand into familiar entertainment channels. With strong funding, a functional mining system, and a focus on visibility, BlockDAG is moving beyond a presale into a fully prepared launch strategy. Its structure, accessibility, and audience reach are aligning to position it as a standout among 2025’s top crypto assets. Final Take WLD is at a point where holding $0.9950 could set up a rebound, while a breakdown risks deeper losses. DOGE’s golden cross is a bullish signal with a proven record of leading to strong rallies, and its next test is the $0.25 level. BlockDAG offers a different story. With $374.5 million secured, a $0.0276 entry price, demonstrated mining products, and sports-backed outreach, it is preparing its ecosystem ahead of launch. The combination of technology, accessibility, and market presence gives it a foundation for growth beyond the presale phase. For those following top crypto assets, WLD and DOGE offer short-term trading setups, while BlockDAG is positioning for sustained expansion into 2025. The coming months will show whether it simply participates in the market or takes a leadership role.

Several tokens are generating momentum, but only a few are combining technical progress with utility. Arbitrum is showing strength at a crucial resistance level, while Cardano’s confirmed golden cross is drawing bullish attention. Against this backdrop, Cold Wallet stands out with its presale pace, already raising $6.2 million while offering CWT at $0.00998, far below its $0.3517 launch target. Its model rewards usage directly, positioning it as more than a speculative trade. For those assessing the best long-term crypto picks, Cold Wallet’s mix of utility and discounted entry makes it a compelling watch. Cold Wallet Presale Races Toward Early Stage Sellout Cold Wallet’s presale is progressing at a speed that suggests initial stages may close earlier than expected. With $6.2 million raised and Stage 17 pricing fixed at $0.00998 per CWT, the distance to the $0.3517 launch price signals significant upside potential. This trajectory places it firmly among today’s most appealing best long-term crypto entry points. The project’s appeal lies in practical rewards. Users earn CWT through gas fees, swaps, and on/off-ramp activity, creating adoption beyond speculation. Historically, token sales with strong demand see stages sell out faster once momentum builds, often triggering a surge of late buyers willing to pay higher prices to secure allocations. Cold Wallet’s 150-stage structure makes timing critical. Each stage increases pricing, meaning those who wait face higher costs for the same allocation. At current sales velocity, the lower-priced stages could vanish sooner than projected, tightening supply and increasing urgency. The spread between $0.00998 today and $0.3517 at launch illustrates the potential reward for early participants. As visibility increases and discounted tokens become scarce, buying pressure is likely to accelerate, pushing undecided investors to act quickly. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Action Points to a Breakout Arbitrum is trading close to the $0.50 resistance, a level that could define its near-term movement. With a 28% weekly gain and trading volume climbing to $592 million, the current Arbitrum (ARB) price action shows rising interest. Technical signals point to a double bottom around $0.4578, a pattern often preceding bullish reversals. Should momentum push ARB above $0.50, the next objective is $0.7747, almost a 50% increase from current prices. This setup suggests limited time for investors to enter before a breakout potentially accelerates gains. Cardano (ADA) Price Target Approaches $1 Cardano’s recent golden cross confirms a bullish technical signal, with ADA currently trading near $0.87. Strong support at $0.81 underpins a potential run toward the $1 Cardano (ADA) price target. History supports this outlook: the last golden cross in November 2024 sparked a rally of nearly 300%, lifting ADA from $0.32 to $1.32. Trading volume has surged more than 100%, exceeding $2.5 billion, reinforcing rising interest. This momentum suggests the $1 Cardano (ADA) price target could be reached faster than anticipated. For late entrants, higher entry costs may become unavoidable if bullish pressure holds. Why Acting Early Matters Crypto rewards decisiveness. Arbitrum’s breakout signals and Cardano’s bullish structure are strong, but Cold Wallet’s presale trajectory offers a unique advantage.

With approval odds climbing and attention shifting toward high-utility networks, traders are weighing options beyond Bitcoin. Among those drawing interest are Solana, TRON, Ethereum, and a newer player — MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana Eyes ETF Approval Solana has been at the center of discussion following the U.S. SEC’s acknowledgment of an ETF application from Invesco and Galaxy. Betting platforms now show 99% confidence that approval will arrive in 2025, adding fuel to speculation that Solana could follow Bitcoin and Ethereum into the ETF spotlight. The earlier success of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF which recorded $20 million in first-day trading volume highlighted demand for Solana-based products. But Solana’s recent price action has been discouraging. SOL dipped to $170 after touching $210 earlier this week. As the SEC has pushed its decision date to October, market participants see ETF progress as a major factor for Solana’s next chapter in terms of price movement. TRON’s 11.1B Transaction Growth TRON has steadily cemented its role as a settlement platform for stablecoins by processing more than 11.1 billion transactions to date. Much of this growth was from USDT transfers on the TRC-20 network as many favor it for its low fees and fast processing times. On-chain data shows TRON handling between 7–9 million transactions daily with peaks nearing 10 million. This heavy output supports liquidity across spot and derivatives markets, which makes TRON a backbone for exchange settlements and cross-border payments. Also, development is advancing, with the v4.8.1 mainnet upgrade undergoing validation ahead of its Q4 rollout. With transaction demand stable and infrastructure updates on the way, TRON continues to play a role in the stablecoin economy. Ethereum Hits Records as Wall Street Backs It Ethereum climbed back above $4,700 in mid August, edging closer to its 2021 peak as Wall Street ramps up exposure. Institutional flows into Ethereum ETFs hit $5.4 billion in July, nearly matching Bitcoin’s inflows. At the same time, Ethereum is a leader in stablecoins, with 51% of the $270 billion market running on its blockchain. It also leads in real-world asset tokenization, with over $7.1 billion integrated into its network. The passage of the Genius Act in the U.S. has improved confidence, establishing rules for stablecoins while the SEC’s “Project Crypto” aims to modernize digital asset oversight. Analysts at Fundstrat see Ethereum as the “biggest macro trade” for the next decade, citing both its institutional adoption and staking opportunities that generate additional ETH yields. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Attention as Hidden Gem Away from the larger caps, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been gaining traction. The project has passed audits and is supported on major wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. Unlike many meme-style tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines community appeal with real DeFi utility, which makes it more than a speculative hold. Analysts tracking sale activity note its growing traction as interest in alternative altcoins rises. Main Takeaway The Solana ETF push has reignited attention in altcoin market. Solana’s regulatory milestone, TRON’s steady transaction growth and Ethereum’s institutional inflows show why these assets remain on watchlists.. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a fresh entry point for those looking at newer projects with unique positioning. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

This dual strategy – hedging with a small cap while tracking Ethereum’s rally – reflects both institutional logic and speculative ambition. Ethereum Eyes $6,000 Breakout Ethereum’s technical outlook is increasingly bullish. Analysts now see ETH targeting the $5,500–$6,000 range by late August 2025 , should it decisively clear the $4,800 resistance level. Supporting the upside case, Cointelegraph notes a classic bull flag formation, targeting $6,000–$6,100 , while supply on exchanges has dwindled to just 12%, suggesting mounting demand. Additional models highlight Fibonacci extensions that align with a $6,200 target. More aggressive forecasts push even higher, with $6,000 seen as a realistic threshold on the path toward $7,000 or beyond. Together, these indicators suggest that if this wave holds, ETH could fuel a broader surge – setting the stage for altcoins to ride the coattails. Why Ether’s Momentum Fuels MAGACOIN FINANCE Interest As Ethereum’s momentum builds, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a stealth contender, drawing significant attention from early-stage investors. Blockchain analysts observe that holders are increasingly positioning for outsized altcoin returns, not unlike what ETH enabled in earlier cycles. By aligning yourself with an Ethereum-based token that combines many features, you could tap into that same narrative – with significantly higher upside potential. What Makes MAGACOIN FINANCE Stand Out Ethereum foundation with DeFi utility : Built entirely on the Ethereum network, MAGACOIN FINANCE allows holders to stake tokens to support network liquidity and earn rewards-tying investor incentives directly to ecosystem growth. Security-first approach : The project has already completed a HashEx security audit , with a CertiK audit in progress . Public access to these findings reinforces transparency and builds credibility well ahead of launch. Presale momentum : The presale has raised $12.5 million from over 10,000 verified participants . In line with whale activity, institutional interest is accelerating, creating a presale that’s nearing sellout and fueling FOMO among retail backers. Growth roadmap : Plans include potential exchange listings, expanded features, and strategic partnerships – setting the stage for broader adoption as the crypto cycle heats up. Strategic Positioning for the Next Bull Cycle This is a classic asymmetric play. Ethereum stocks up solid momentum based on improving technical and institutional fundamentals, while MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the explosive upside fans of early Bitcoin and ETH love to chase. As whales accumulate ETH and anticipate a breakout, they’re also hedging with smaller tokens that stand to multiply during the bullish push. Final Thoughts Ethereum’s path toward the $6,000 target is grounded in robust technical patterns and flagging supply dynamics-making it one of the most promising plays in the current bull cycle. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction among whales and early investors, blending real utility, transparency, and growth potential. Together, they represent a layered strategy: ETH for macro momentum and MAGACOIN FINANCE for high-octane upside. For investors looking to participate in both the foundation and the next frontier of crypto returns, this combination offers a high and stable reward profile.

Furthermore, Shiba Inu is being beat by TRON and a new player in August 2025. As cryptocurrency markets get increasingly lively, traders are rotating capital toward a host of faster moving assets, suggesting A rising star which is getting the attention of traders that are full of FOMO is MAGACOIN FINANCE, with many looking to get in early on the next breakout. TRON Breaks Resistance, Eyes New Highs TRON (TRX) has risen to the range of $0.357–$0.366, continuing its month-long steep rally, which is supported by trading volume and technical indicators. Short-term estimates indicate TRX is destined to rise towards $0.37 to $0.38. The strong upward momentum is noted to be backed by an index score of between 60 and 71 on the Fear & Greed Index. According to analysts, $0.37 is a crucial resistance; one may look for a small correction as the RSI is close to overbought. However, overall sentiment remains firmly bullish. FOMO traders can count on TRX as a solid short-term bet due to its positive sentiment and technical setup. Shiba Inu Lags as Meme Coin Rotation Stalls Shiba Inu (SHIB), once the star of all meme coin rallies, can’t get anywhere now. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has not shown a lot of momentum this August. Experts believe it could reach between $0.00001435 and $0.0000163 this month. With continued high volatility and sentiment, less decisive traders seem hesitant. Most technical indicators remain bullish, with 17 already showing upside and 8 down. Despite the news, there hasn’t been any compelling narrative to keep this rally going. As a result, some retail traders have switched to more active movers like TRON or newer exploding assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Star Traders Are Rushing Into MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early presale pricing and political meme coin appeal have placed it squarely in the spotlight for traders seeking outsized returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a rising alternative to SHIB and other legacy meme coins, with analyst projections tied to a 20x–33x range. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum reflects a wider market narrative shift, with whale inflows now matching those of more established coins. Traders chasing the next breakout are betting big on MAGACOIN FINANCE, calling it one of the few low-entry opportunities left in this cycle. The Bottom Line: TRON Holds, MAGACOIN Accelerates Even though TRON continues to advance in its technical strength and SHIB is moving up slowly, the real acceleration is taking place elsewhere. More and more traders looking for asymmetric upside are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE because of its low price, virality, and new whale support. The race for dominance this altseason is just beginning. Based on the early trends of accumulation, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be next to breakout.

50219313,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78874,1755412941,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple (XRP) Highlighted As Solution to SWIFT’s Security Lapses,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-highlighted-as-solution-to-swifts-security-lapses/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE drew attention to a recent webinar in which Ripple was highlighted as a potential security solution in the financial sector. In his post, he emphasized that the discussion included a direct comparison between Ripple and the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), particularly in the context of security standards. During the webinar, a speaker acknowledged SWIFT’s longstanding role as the dominant financial messaging system but raised questions about its vulnerabilities. The speaker asked whether Ripple could offer greater security than SWIFT, noting that while SWIFT itself is considered secure, its connections with external systems and institutions can expose the network to risks. RIPPLE HIGHLIGHTED AS A POTENTIAL SECURITY SOLUTION DURING WEBINAR AS 2016 SWIFT NETWORK HACK IS MENTIONED Listen. pic.twitter.com/BCXadwWrVW — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 15, 2025 Reference to the 2016 Bangladesh Bank Heist To illustrate this point, the speaker referred to the 2016 cyberattack on Bangladesh Bank, which remains one of the most notable security breaches linked to the SWIFT network. Hackers exploited vulnerabilities in the bank’s infrastructure, reportedly gaining access through a misconfigured router. Once inside, they obtained the bank’s SWIFT credentials tied to its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. With those credentials, attackers were able to authorize fraudulent transfer requests, ultimately stealing $81 million. As the webinar recounts, much of the stolen money was laundered through casinos in Macau and other regions, with most of the funds never recovered. The case has since served as a critical example of how institutional weaknesses can compromise the global financial system. The speaker stressed that while SWIFT itself was not directly breached, its reliance on secure access credentials meant that any failure in a member institution’s security setup could create a point of entry for bad actors. This incident highlighted the broader issue that security in financial systems depends not only on the central network but also on the protections maintained by individual participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Position as an Alternative In raising the question of whether Ripple can mitigate such vulnerabilities, the webinar underscored the growing attention given to blockchain-based solutions in the international payments space. Ripple’s technology has often been discussed as an alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT due to its use of distributed ledger technology and cryptographic security features. Although the speaker did not make a definitive claim, the suggestion that Ripple could address weaknesses demonstrated in past incidents places it in a noteworthy position within the dialogue on global financial security. The framing of Ripple as a potential solution also reflects a trend where institutions and experts consider how blockchain-based infrastructures might minimize risks of credential theft and misconfigured security environments. The mention of Ripple in direct contrast to SWIFT during a security-focused discussion highlights the role of emerging technologies in reshaping expectations for financial safety. As institutions continue to evaluate both legacy systems and blockchain-based alternatives, the central issue remains whether new frameworks can provide resilience against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

Analysts believe the immediate upside sits between $1.05 and $1.08, with RSI levels at 71.96 confirming bullish momentum. CoinEdition recently issued one of the most aggressive Cardano price prediction targets, suggesting ADA could move past $1.01 if momentum holds. Others like CoinDo see short-term resistance at $0.95 before ADA attempts to clear psychological barriers around $1.00. The consensus points to ADA holding strong near support while preparing for a potential $1 breakout. Why Remittix Is Outpacing Big Names Remittix has positioned itself as a payment-first crypto project that solves real-world problems rather than depending on speculation. It is not only gaining momentum in fundraising but also building anticipation for major exchange listings that will follow once the project passes $20M raised. That positions RTX as a stronger trade compared to traditional Layer 1s like ADA. Over $19.8M already raised with growing demand Upcoming CEX listings revealed after $20M milestone Mobile wallet launch with instant FX conversion Real-world payment utility with 40+ cryptos supported Backed by a deflationary token model for long-term growth While the Cardano price prediction narrative is bullish, investors are increasingly looking at tokens with greater growth potential. ADA’s run toward $1 is promising, but analysts stress that scaling from $0.95 to $1.05 is nowhere near the same as early-stage tokens that could deliver 20X–50X returns. This has led many market watchers to highlight Remittix as a top crypto to buy now in 2025. Overall, Cardano’s steady growth keeps it on the radar, but analysts agree the real story of 2025 may come from Remittix . With utility, exchange listings, and massive community backing, RTX looks set to be the best crypto to buy now for investors chasing outsized gains.

50220016,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=175024,1755414043,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/50220016.jpeg,"Best Altcoins to Buy Now as $4.2 Trillion Crypto Market Heats Up — BTC, SOL, SHIB, and XRP Picks",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-now-as-4-2-trillion-crypto-market-heats-up-btc-sol-shib-and-xrp-picks/,"The crypto market just hit a record $4.2 trillion total market capitalization in August 2025, sparking renewed debate over the best altcoins to buy for every investor’s portfolio. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the anchors for every crypto trader portfolio, smart money are beginning to rotate into high-conviction altcoins like Solana, Shiba Inu, and XRP. But there’s also a rising star outside the big altcoins called MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is starting to feature in analyst conversations as the undervalued pick with outsized upside potential. In this article, we make a case for the best altcoins to buy in the current market situation. Bitcoin (BTC): The Foundation of Every Portfolio Bitcoin continues to lead the charge as institutions pour record inflows into ETFs and corporate treasuries. Over the past year, these 12 Bitcoin-focused products have attracted more than $40 billion in fresh capital. Unsurprisingly, this has helped Bitcoin price reach new all-time highs and many analysts are now arguing that the BTC top is still far away. Due to this, crypto bettors on Polymarket are projecting further upside in 2025 as macro capital continues rotating into the digital gold. So, even with altcoin fever heating up, BTC remains the core holding for stability, liquidity, and credibility. Solana (SOL): The Fast-Moving Layer 1 Solana recently reclaimed the $200 price level, reaffirming its role as one of the fastest and cheapest blockchains. Its DeFi activity continues to rival Ethereum, attracting both developers and retail adoption. Considering this, market analysts cite SOL as one of the best altcoins to buy for Q3 and Q4, especially as network upgrades keep transaction throughput ahead of rivals. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Meme Energy Returns Meme coin energy isn’t slowing down. SHIB has rallied on technical support and bullish divergence signals . Some August forecasts see SHIB reaching $0.0000163, while a breakout above resistance could trigger an even sharper rally. With Ethereum’s strength and meme coin enthusiasm aligning, SHIB is firmly on watchlists for high-risk, high-reward traders. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Global Expansion Fresh off its regulatory win, XRP is enjoying significant institutional adoption across Asia and Latin America. Moreover, RippleNet’s integration with RLUSD stablecoin is driving new real-world usage. Additionally, the XRP Ledger has become the top choice for real-world assets tokenization. As a result, XRP’s long-term forecasts stretch as high as $30 by 2030, making it a popular pick for investors seeking exposure to cross-border finance narratives. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Best Altcoin Analysts Are Watching As the spotlight shines on BTC, SOL, SHIB, and XRP, smart money is rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-growing altcoin that analysts frame as a breakout candidate for 2025. Scarcity-driven tokenomics set it apart from inflationary meme coins. Cross-chain demand and visibility are climbing ahead of expected exchange listings. Its early-stage status leaves room for the kind of exponential upside usually seen only in the early innings of altcoin cycles. Due to this, Several traders now place MAGACOIN FINANCE in the same conversation as heavyweights like ADA and AVAX, noting that hidden gems often outperform late in bull cycles when market capitalizations expand quickly. The Final Word With crypto market cap at $4.2 trillion, investors are actively rebalancing portfolios. BTC anchors the market, SOL offers speed and growth, SHIB taps into meme momentum, and XRP delivers global finance exposure. But beyond the majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the stealth play for those hunting high-multiple returns. As the cycle matures, its unique positioning could make it one of the best altcoins to buy heading into next year.

The fund invests indirectly in Bitcoin through its holdings of MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, which has been dubbed “Japan’s MicroStrategy,” according to analysis by Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital asset research. Kendrick stated that he reviewed the 13F filings filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and that NBIM increased its Bitcoin-equivalent position from 6,200 BTC to 11,400 BTC in the second quarter. He added that most of the increase was driven by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) shares, while an additional position of approximately 200 BTC was taken in Metaplanet. Related News: A Massive Cryptocurrency Whale Made a Large Withdrawal of This Altcoin from Binance “The key point here is that Norges uses MSTR (MicroStrategy) as a direct means of accessing Bitcoin. An 83% increase in one quarter demonstrates a proactive position,” he said. Kendrick previously published analysis indicating that government funds and public institutions are increasingly investing indirectly in Bitcoin. He also predicted in February that more sovereign wealth funds would gain exposure to Bitcoin. Kendrick, one of the most optimistic analysts on the cryptocurrency markets, last month reiterated his target for Bitcoin to reach $135,000 by September 30 and $200,000 by the end of the year. He maintains his 2028 forecast at $500,000. Kendrick also raised his year-end price target for Ethereum to $7,500, projecting $25,000 in 2028. He predicts BNB could reach $2,775, Avalanche's AVAX token $250, and XRP $12.50. According to the analyst, the total stablecoin market capitalization will approach $2 trillion by the end of 2028. *This is not investment advice.

Traders on Reddit and Telegram are shifting their focus to small-cap gems with significant potential. Blue chips like Ethereum and Solana are still the bedrock of one’s portfolio. However, crypto analysts and Redditors are pointing to a group of small-cap altcoins with utility, momentum and potentially undervalued entry points. A new low-priced token called MAGACOIN FINANCE is going viral on Reddit with calls for 15x upside before 2025 as presale interest builds and whales rotate in from XRP and SOL. Five altcoins that Reddit traders believe belong on your watchlist or radar. Ethereum (ETH): Still the Smart Contract King Despite its large nature, Ethereum is one of the most solid altcoins to buy. The price action of Ethereum is stabilizing above $3000 with long-term targets to hit $4200-$4800, due to rising ETF inflows and with scaling solutions like Base and Optimism ensuring faster transactions. Reddit traders see Ethereum’s potential as the base layer solution for DeFi and tokenized RWAs. The ETHA ETF puts Ethereum in a position for further institutional growth. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Layer-1 with ETF Buzz Solana’s speed, low fees, and fast-growing user numbers have made it Reddit’s favourite alternative to Ethereum. The market is aggressively betting on a spot ETF approval this October, which has 95% odds of being approved. In fact, staking approved ETFs is enabling traders to build further optimism. If the ETF is approved, SOL will attempt to break out from the resistance of $240. Solana is gaining traction in the gaming, NFTs and mobile crypto app arenas. Chainlink (LINK): Data Infrastructure Play Chainlink has found itself once again at the forefront of cryptocurrency news in 2025 as DeFi protocols, gaming platforms and RWA projects scramble for access to a robust oracle infrastructure. Reddit’s crypto community are betting on Chainlink’s CCIP unlocking new liquidity flows surrounding the platform. LINK has been consolidating around the $21-$23 mark, as whales accumulate and analysts eye a $40 by mid-2025. Avalanche (AVAX): Layer-1 With Strong Developer Traction Smart contract developers and business partners continue to come to Avalanche. The profile of AVAX has increased after new AWS integration and partnerships in tokenized real estate. The unique subnets architecture and high throughput of Reddit forums are the major differentiators. Reddit traders believe the price can double or quadruple during the upcoming bull wave. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Viral Underdog With 15x Potential Analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout pick among major players, calling it one of the best cryptos to buy right now for future growth , driven by accelerating whale accumulation, scarcity-based tokenomics, and rising cross-chain interest. With institutional demand building and momentum ahead of anticipated exchange listings, the project is gaining traction as a high-conviction opportunity. As liquidity flows into strategic altcoin plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a key contender for investors targeting long-term upside in the current market cycle. Final Thoughts: Diversification With High-Upside Altcoins The altcoin cycle is accelerating, and Reddit is once again leading the way in surfacing undervalued gems. While Ethereum and Solana remain go-to options for stability and upside, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s generating the most buzz among early adopters looking for exponential gains in 2025.

If all goes to plan, this could signal the beginning of another bull run for alts. At the same time, some smart investors are quietly shifting capital into a rising payment-focused token, Remittix , that’s showing both promise and utility. Ethereum Price: ETF Flows and Whales Drive Momentum Ethereum has surged about 30% in the past 30 days, largely backed by record spot ETF inflows and growing institutional confidence. Additionally, it was revealed that Ethereum whale activity surged to its highest level in a month . Whales are also quietly accumulating ETH and alternative tokens with real-world utility such as Remittix Technicals are turning bullish. CoinDCX projects a breakout above resistance could take ETH toward $5,500–$6,000. Daily RSI is around 73 with room before overbought levels hit, and a sustained move above $4,800 could fuel a further rally toward $6,000. Remittix: Utility Meets Momentum Remittix is attracting attention from smart capital, with whales piling into RTX ahead of its first centralized exchange listing. This move is rooted in Remittix’s real-world utility, including low gas fee crypto payments, cross-border remittance features, and multi-chain integration. Why Remittix Stands Out in a Crowded Market Security First: Audited by CertiK with zero critical issues. Built for borderless payments with global reach Real-World Utility: Tailored for remittance, merchant payments, and FX flow Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch: Beta Q3 wallet launching soon; whale demand already rising. 20% Referral Rewards and a $250,000 Giveaway fuel engagement. CEX Listing Reveal Incoming: Expected once the $20 million milestone is hit. While Ethereum sets the stage for macro moves, Remittix offers micro-level utility. It’s a new altcoin to watch, a new DeFi project delivering tangible PayFi access. Ideal for early-stage crypto investment and tapping into payments infrastructure. Dual Strategy: ETH for Momentum, RTX for Utility For those tracking Ethereum price and its path toward $4,800 or higher, the outlook is bullish. But now, smart money is hedging with Remittix, which is a token built to solve real-world payment problems, with audit backing, product pipeline, and a listing timeline that matches Ethereum’s rise. If you’re asking, “what is the best crypto to buy right now?” Remittix fits the bill: infrastructure-first, product-ready, and poised for exchange visibility.

XRP may see strong rebounds, but flipping ETH isn’t on the near-term horizon. While investors focus on this heavyweight match-up, Gemini suggests something else has quietly unfolded, turning from a presale curiosity into a serious contender for 2025’s breakout token. And unlike most meme coins, it’s not coasting on hype alone. XRP’s Bull Case: Legal Clarity, ETF Buzz, and AI Backing First, XRP has recently cleared a significant hurdle; its lengthy legal battle with the SEC is finally behind it. That clarity has restored confidence and sent institutions back to the table. The price has responded in kind. So, what does Google’s AI, Gemini, forecast from here? Moderate Bull Case: Gemini projects XRP could reach $6.27 in 2025 based on technical breakout patterns and renewed market structure. Upside Potential: In a scenario with strong ETF momentum and institutional inflows, Gemini floats targets between $7 and $12, with extreme bullish scenarios reaching as high as $20. Guideposts for Pricing: Coinpedia suggests a base target of $5.05 by late 2025, supporting the view of a multi-fold rally. Recent regulatory signals add weight. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas sees a potential XRP ETF approval in September or October, now that the SEC has issued refined guidance for crypto ETFs, reducing typical filing delays. Ethereum’s Crown Isn't Slipping Yet Despite turbulence in the market, Ethereum still sits unchallenged on the smart-contract pedestal. The debut of spot ETH ETFs, now trading, gives retail and institutional players an effortless entry point while leaving the on-chain complexity of custody and staking neatly off their balance sheets. Even though the SEC’s approval pathway is opening, and while XRP may rise, overhauling Ethereum's market cap or network effect would require massive adoption shifts. ETH’s institutional momentum and DeFi dominance remain formidable barriers. What Would It Take for an ""XRP Flippening""? To genuinely outpace Ethereum, XRP would need more than chart momentum. Those key ingredients include: Sustained ETF authorization—preferably multiple spot listings turning into tangible investor inflows. Cross-border payment adoption through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity platforms. Broader ecosystem development—not only price speculation, but tangible enterprise use cases. Technical breakout and confirmation, supported by AI targets and rising volume. Despite Gemini’s bullish targets, XRP needs rare alignment across legal, institutional, and sentiment vectors to mount a credible flip challenge. Little Pepe: From Meme Roots to Measured Execution LILPEPE’s origins are unapologetically meme-driven, but the execution is anything but random. It’s been designed with the kinds of safeguards and technical choices you usually see in more “serious” crypto projects. Zero-tax trading, EVM compatibility, and sniper bot protection aren’t standard features for a meme token, yet here they’re standard. It’s this balance of lighthearted branding with disciplined structure that’s making seasoned investors take notice. LILPEPE isn’t trying to reinvent the meme coin; it’s refining it. Meme coins live and die by attention, but LILPEPE’s team is building hooks that could keep it relevant beyond the first price spike. Plans are already in motion for: A meme launchpad to help other creators bring their ideas to market. Cross-chain tools that make LILPEPE a bridge between ecosystems. Layer 2 upgrades that developers might want to work with. Presale Momentum Is Peaking With the presale in Stage 10 and over 92% sold, the window for early entry is closing fast. The current price is $0.0019, with listing projected at $0.0030. That’s already a strong incentive for anyone looking to get in before the broader market even has access. Once it hits exchanges, price discovery will depend heavily on how quickly its growing community translates into active buyers, and right now, the signs are promising. Conclusion While XRP and Ethereum will keep trading headlines back and forth, the most explosive gains in 2025 could come from a very different place. Little Pepe has the audit, the infrastructure, and the growing user base to stand apart in a meme market otherwise crowded with short-lived experiments. For investors looking for a blend of low-cost entry and credible project design, this must be one of the most interesting bake before the next bull wave crests.

While the average observer might not think twice of such a small gain, seasoned market watchers see it as the spark for something much bigger. Why? Because this uptick comes right on the heels of Grayscale filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF , under the ticker GDOG. This is significant because it signals a major step in bridging the best meme coins with traditional finance. Grayscale’s plan is to convert its existing Dogecoin Trust into a fully tradable ETF listed on NYSE Arca – the same playbook it used to bring Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to market. Even better for Dogecoin (and meme coin) investors, Grayscale isn’t the only one chasing a Dogecoin ETF. Heavyweights like REX-Osprey and Bitwise have also filed their own DOGE ETF proposals. According to prediction market Polymarket, there’s already a 75% chance of SEC approval this year . This has traders buzzing, and for good reason. If approved, a DOGE ETF wouldn’t just validate Dogecoin in the eyes of Wall Street; it could unleash a flood of new demand, push liquidity to new highs, and serve as the perfect catalyst for the next big rally. Read on as we break down all the bullish factors behind Dogecoin, dive into its technical outlook, and show you how to ride this momentum with Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , aka the presale meme coin being hailed as Dogecoin on steroids. Pro-Crypto Policy Changes & A Strong Price Chart One of the biggest catalysts for institutional interest in DOGE ETFs – and the broader crypto market – is the Federal Reserve’s projected interest rate cut in September . This shift is expected to spark a risk-on sentiment, sending investors hunting for high-risk, high-reward plays like meme coins. Dogecoin, with its status as the reigning meme coin king (it has the largest market cap in its category), is poised to benefit significantly from this shift. At the same time, the U.S. government has been making aggressive moves to cement its role as the crypto capital of the world. The SEC recently rolled out Project Crypto , a modernization initiative designed to clarify securities rules for digital assets, while a Trump-era order expanded 401(k) retirement plans to include crypto exposure . And most importantly, July saw the passing of the landmark GENIUS Act , the first major federal crypto law, which set clear frameworks for stablecoins and strengthened investor protections. From a technical perspective, Dogecoin has just broken out of a descending triangle pattern on the weekly chart. This is a strong bullish signal traders have been waiting for. If this breakout holds, DOGE could be eyeing the $0.50 level, which represents roughly a 115% upside from current prices . Together, these developments create the perfect backdrop for Dogecoin’s next leg up: strong fundamentals, favorable policy, and a technical setup that has traders watching closely. Now, one of the best ways to capitalize on Dogecoin’s momentum is by looking beyond the token itself – toward low-priced Doge-based meme coins that could ride the wave alongside the legendary meme coin, but deliver exponentially higher returns. This is where Maxi Doge ($MAXI) steps in. It’s a new meme coin in presale , building a fierce community of crypto degens who live by Maxi’s all-in creed: ‘Wake up, sweat, trade, repeat.’ The Legend of Maxi Doge Did you look at Maxi’s face and thought it’s similar to Dogecoin’s? Guess what? You’re right! Because they’re both cousins. But make no mistake, they’re anything but close. Growing up, Doge soaked up all the fame and attention, and Maxi was left in the shadows. That’s where he forged his hunger to outwork, outgrow, and ultimately dethrone Dogecoin as the most viral meme coin on the planet. Maxi isn’t your wholesome, smiling Shiba. He’s the shredded, battle-ready version: forged in the gym, fueled by protein and caffeine, and driven by pure vengeance. A man (dog) on a mission. And that’s exactly the kind of raw, degen-fueled energy meme coin traders rally behind. Not utility, not roadmaps, but hype, story, and unstoppable drive. Maxi’s Masterplan for Meme Coin Domination Sure, $MAXI might look unhinged at first glance. And honestly, it kind of is. But don’t mistake that chaos for a lack of direction. The devs have locked in a clear strategy. 40% of the total token supply is reserved for marketing alone, fueling the project’s mission to become one of the top trending cryptos . That means holder-only trading competitions, leaderboard rewards, influencer collabs, PR pushes, and paid campaigns, all designed to blast Maxi’s name across the meme coin world. And they’re not stopping at just DEX and CEX listings. The vision goes bigger: futures listings, where traders can crank up to 1000x leverage and chase degen-level returns that would make even institutions sweat. Buy $MAXI at Its Lowest-Ever Prices Here’s the good news: Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is still in presale, which means you can scoop it up at dirt-cheap rates before it hits the open market. At the moment, 1 $MAXI costs just $0.0002525, with the project having already pulled in over $1.1M from early investors. Even better, early buyers can lock into staking rewards that are downright massive, with yields currently sitting at a jaw-dropping 260% APY. Visit Maxi Doge’s official website for more information. Wrapping Up With Dogecoin poised to ignite a major meme coin rally, savvy investors are already looking beyond $DOGE itself. All eyes are turning to Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , the high-energy presale coin that could ride the wave harder, faster, and further than its famous cousin. That said, please remember that crypto investments are inherently risky due to the market’s high volatility. None of the above is financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-17 08:18:58

Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a groundbreaking bill targeting crypto taxation reform—legislation that could significantly benefit everyday crypto users and unlock a new wave of adoption. Though the tax relief measures didn’t make it into President Donald Trump’s primary budget plan, they are now being pushed independently, and the response from the crypto community has been electric. As investors look ahead to a regulatory environment that could finally become friendly to innovation, analysts are pointing to a handful of tokens as the best altcoins to watch in 2025. While Solana and XRP continue to gain ground, one new project is emerging as the unexpected front-runner: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Trump-Aligned Tax Reform: Why It Matters for Crypto The new legislation, introduced by Senator Lummis, proposes sweeping reforms to how cryptocurrency is taxed in the U.S. These include: A $300 exemption, so that normal crypto transactions less than this amount will not lead to the capital gains tax reporting. No double taxation on staking, mining, and airdrops — users would only be taxed when they sell the assets Clarification of rules for lending, charitable donations, and crypto accounting methods This legislation intends to remove the regulatory delays that have been blocking the development of the innovation area of the crypto market in the U.S. Moreover, with President Trump indicating that he is progressively more inclined to back the digital economy, the policies that are supportive of crypto are gaining more prevalence in the political spectrum. The resulting investor optimism has triggered a rush to identify the best altcoins to watch in 2025, as tax burdens ease and retail participation grows. XRP: Legal Clarity and Institutional Flows Build Momentum XRP continues to benefit from the resolution of its multi-year legal standoff with the SEC. On August 8, Ripple and the SEC filed to dismiss all remaining appeals, bringing the saga to a close and confirming that XRP is not a security in secondary markets. Following the news, XRP broke through key resistance at $3.27, supported by high-volume trading and increasing institutional interest. CoinShares reports $9.1 million in weekly inflows into XRP-focused funds, while Bitcoin products saw outflows — a clear signal that institutional preferences are shifting. Current consolidation near $3.08 presents an accumulation opportunity for those watching the next breakout. Analysts remain bullish, with year-end targets ranging from $5 to $15, depending on broader market performance and possible ETF approval. XRP remains one of the best altcoins to watch in 2025, especially with regulatory risk now behind it and whales steadily accumulating. Solana: Scaling, Speed, and ETF Buzz Make It a Top Altcoin to Watch Solana has had a landmark month, with protocol-level upgrades making headlines across the crypto community. The Alpenglow upgrade proposal, which includes the Votor and Rotor consensus enhancements, could bring sub-200ms finality to the network. At the same time, block capacity was recently increased by 20%, with another doubling planned by year-end. Solana is preparing to become the fastest, most scalable public blockchain — and investors are noticing. The network recently saw over $85 million in SOL outflows from exchanges, a bullish sign amid consolidation near the $190 range. Adding fuel to the fire is the pending decision on a U.S. Solana ETF. Approval could unlock significant institutional inflows and send SOL into a new price discovery phase. Due to high DeFi traffic, minimal transaction charges, and an expanding ecosystem, Solana is still able to maintain a position amongst the top 5 altcoins to watch in 2025 for technology-focused investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Surprise Contender Among Best Altcoins to Watch in 2025 While Solana and XRP may be well-known names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight among early-stage blockchain projects. Currently in its presale phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being hailed by analysts as one of the best altcoins to watch in 2025 — and potentially the most profitable. XRP is benefiting from legal finality and growing institutional interest. Solana is doubling down on scalability and poised for ETF-fueled momentum. But the most exciting opportunity? It might just be MAGACOIN FINANCE — a presale project with an ambitious roadmap, strong branding, and massive upside potential. Final Thoughts The political atmosphere in the US has been transformed to express more positive sentiments towards cryptocurrencies. Such a popularity scenario like Senator Lummis’ bill and Trump’s analysis giving the signal of preparedness have set the time for the rise to go sky-high. If investors are waiting to watch the top coins in 2025, then these three are a perfect mix of the past success and the potential to explode. However, if you aim at getting exponential returns and being the first to uncover the next big thing then you should keep MAGACOIN FINANCE not only on your radar but also in your wallet.

While most larger-cap alts have mimicked BTC’s underwhelming performance during the weekend, some, such as OKB, MNT, XMR, and LINK, have soared by double digits. BTC Consolidation Endures The business week started on the right foot for bitcoin as the bulls initiated a leg up that pushed it from $118,000 to just over $122,000 on Monday alone. Although the asset retraced in the following days, it went on the offensive hard on Wednesday and Thursday morning once again. The culmination occurred in the early hours of August 14, when BTC skyrocketed past its July all-time high and set a new one at just over $124,500. Following this $5,000-$6,000 price pump in hours, though, came the almost inevitable correction that drove BTC down to $121,000. The worst was yet to come later that day, after the release of the hot PPI data for July. Bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop to under $118,000, dragging the altcoins with it . Since then, BTC has remained sideways at around $118,000 even though there was a big but disappointing meeting between the presidents of the US and Russia. For now, its market cap stands still at $2.350 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is down to 57.6% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Double-Digit Pumps for These Alts As the graph below will show, most larger-cap alts are with minor gains or losses over the past day. ETH, BNB, SOL, DOGE, HYPE, XLM, and SUI are slightly in the green, while XRP, ADA, and TRX have charted insignificant losses. In contrast, LINK has soared by over 10% in the past day and now sits above $24. XMR and MNT have also charted similar gains, while OKB has stolen the show once again with a 17% surge that has driven it to over $120. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has added over $30 billion since yesterday and is up to $4.080 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Yes, Ripple has its loyal following and the occasional price spike, but let’s be honest—those 1,000× days aren’t coming back. As of writing, XRP trades around the low-$3 range, and even the optimistic forecasts only see it inching toward $5 in the next few years. That’s a safe, steady climb—not the moonshot that turns a small investment into a fortune. Meanwhile, some newer coins show the ingredients that have historically created explosive gains—viral community buzz, real infrastructure, presale frenzy, and clear catalysts ahead. Let’s break down three of them— Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Hedera (HBAR)—and why they could be your ticket to 1,000× returns by 2027. Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—Meme Power + Layer-2 Speed Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a Layer-2 blockchain built around meme culture, offering ultra-low fees, lightning-fast finality, and EVM compatibility. Think of it as Ethereum’s faster, cheaper, frog-themed cousin—but with a personality loud enough to grab global attention. As of writing, LILPEPE is in its final presale stage, priced at $0.0019, with nearly $18 million already raised out of a $19.3M target. That kind of presale momentum is rare. Early buyers are betting big because the listing price is $0.003, meaning instant upside potential from day one. The tokenomics are clean: 0% tax on buys and sells, no rug-pull traps, and a healthy allocation to liquidity, staking rewards, and marketing. The project has also passed a full smart contract audit, which adds another layer of investor confidence. And here’s the kicker: Little Pepe is now listed on CoinMarketCap, fueling more exposure and hype even before launch. To push things even further, the team runs a $777K giveaway, with ten winners each taking home $77,000 worth of tokens. Over 206,000 entries have already poured in, and getting involved is as easy as contributing at least $100 to the presale and completing simple social tasks. Analyst predictions for LILPEPE’s upside range from a modest 12,000% to an eye-watering 46,000% by late 2025. If meme season roars back, it’s not impossible. Drop $250 now, and if the higher end plays out, you could be looking at life-changing numbers. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU)—From Meme to Mainstream Pudgy Penguins has already proven it’s not just internet fluff. With strong brand recognition in the NFT world, the project is expanding its token presence. As of writing, PENGU trades between $0.034 and $0.044, with momentum building after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern. It’s riding several bullish waves: rumored ETF interest, fresh exchange listings like Robinhood, and a loyal community that refuses to let go. Short-term gains could be in the 20–25% range with whales quietly accumulating and technical charts flashing green. But the bigger picture is more exciting. If PENGU pushes into mainstream adoption—landing more partnerships and possibly integrating with retail-facing platforms—it could easily see prices in the low-dollar range by 2027. That’s a hefty multiplier from current levels. Hedera (HBAR)—Enterprise-Grade Growth Potential HBAR is the heavyweight of this trio—less volatile and more grounded, but still packing a serious upside. As of writing, it’s hovering between $0.26 and $0.27, down about 50% from its all-time high. What sets Hedera apart is its enterprise focus. It offers blazing-fast transaction speeds, near-zero fees, and growing adoption in sectors like AI, supply chain, and data authentication. In recent months, a 34% rally has been driven by strategic partnerships and increased on-chain activity. Could it hit $2–$5 by 2027? It’s possible, especially if global adoption ramps up. While that’s not a 1,000× play, pairing HBAR with more aggressive bets like LILPEPE and PENGU balances risk with solid growth. Why This Mix Beats Holding XRP XRP has stability, but that’s not what small-cap investors are chasing. There’s no hot presale, no viral NFT hooks, and no new Layer-2 buzz. In short, no fresh catalysts. With $250, you need coins that can break out, not just cruise. This trifecta covers three lanes: LILPEPE for presale hype, meme-driven virality, and Layer-2 infrastructure gains. PENGU for cultural momentum and potential mainstream adoption. HBAR for long-term enterprise-backed growth. It’s a balanced yet aggressive approach, designed to chase life-changing upside while spreading risk. Final Thought If you aim to turn $250 into something wild by 2027, playing it safe won’t cut it. Little Pepe’s meme-chain magic, Pudgy Penguins’ brand momentum, and Hedera’s enterprise foundation give you three shots at explosive growth. As of writing, the LILPEPE presale is nearly full, the $777K giveaway is live, and the project is already grabbing attention on CoinMarketCap. That window won’t stay open long. Sometimes the best move in crypto isn’t holding—it’s rotating into the next wave before everyone else catches on. This might just be that moment.

Here’s Why Layer Brett Is Your Second Chance,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/missed-the-solana-and-dogecoin-rallies-heres-why-layer-brett-is-your-second-chance/,"Crypto traders who missed the explosive rallies of Solana and Dogecoin are now watching a new contender: Layer Brett . This project is currently in its presale stage, with analysts projecting $LBRETT could be the next 100x altcoin in the 2025 crypto bull run. With the presale price set at just $0.0042 per token and staking APYs that can reach as high as 300,000% for early participants, Layer Brett is capturing the attention of seasoned and new investors alike. What sets Layer Brett apart is its unique blend of meme token energy and genuine blockchain utility. As a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin, $LBRETT offers lightning-fast transactions, ultra-low gas fees, and a community-driven ecosystem that promises both fun and function. Solana’s rise and why Layer Brett is generating new hype The rise of Solana has been one of the most prominent stories in the world of trending cryptocurrencies and altcoins. Solana delivered massive returns, powered by high throughput and a thriving DeFi ecosystem. Yet, many investors feel they missed out on the top gainer crypto of the last bull run. Now, Layer Brett is stepping up as a low cap crypto gem with the potential to replicate or even surpass the gains seen with Solana. Built as a Layer 2 crypto on Ethereum, Layer Brett delivers near-instant transactions and gas fees that cost just pennies, addressing pain points that even Solana users face during peak congestion. Dogecoin’s legacy and the appeal of Layer Brett’s meme utility No discussion of meme coins is complete without Dogecoin. The Dogecoin rally captured the imagination of the world, cementing its place as a top meme coin and a staple in Web3. However, as the hype around Dogecoin stabilizes and its price action slows, the market is hungry for the next best meme coins. Enter Layer Brett: not just another meme token, but a project designed to combine viral culture with legitimate Layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions. Unlike Dogecoin, which is often criticized for its lack of real-world utility, Layer Brett is tech-backed, community-powered, and engineered for both fun and high-yield DeFi. Its transparent tokenomics, with a capped supply of 10 billion $LBRETT tokens, and decentralized, self-custodial design make it a standout. Layer Brett: The best crypto to buy now for staking rewards and utility Layer Brett is redefining what it means to be a memecoin. The platform’s presale is live at https://layerbrett.com , where users can buy $LBRETT with ETH, USDT, or BNB via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. The process is simple: connect your wallet, select your payment token, enter your purchase amount, and confirm. The staking program is a major draw, with APYs ranging from 12,000% to an eye-watering 300,000% for early stakers. This positions Layer Brett as the best crypto to invest in for those looking to maximize returns through high-yield, Layer 2-powered rewards. The project also features a $1 million giveaway campaign during presale, adding a gamified, FOMO-driven incentive for both buyers and stakers. Conclusion: Don’t miss out on the best meme coin of 2025 Layer Brett is still in presale—but not for long. With a much smaller market cap than Solana or Dogecoin, there is real potential for exponential growth as the next big crypto and top DeFi tokens contender. Early investors can buy and stake now, positioning themselves for the best crypto bull run 2025 rewards. Act fast to secure your spot in the most scalable and rewarding memecoin launch on Ethereum. Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards , and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

These 3 Coins Could Turn $300 into $300,000 by 2026",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/missed-solana-sol-early-these-3-coins-could-turn-300-into-300000-by-2026,"In the last few years, Solana (SOL) has become one of the most successful blockchain projects, and early investors have made significant returns. Don't worry if you missed your chance to buy Solana cheaply. There are still a lot of coins with a lot of potential that could give you similar (or even better) returns by 2026. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Stellar (XLM), and Chainlink (LINK) are three cryptocurrencies that are currently underappreciated, but they could turn a $300 investment into $300,000 in just a few years. These three coins could be your next big chance for several reasons. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That Could Grow a Lot Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is becoming one of the best meme coins on the market, and it will outperform many of its competitors. LILPEPE isn't just relying on hype like other meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu; it has real uses. LILPEPE is built on a Layer-2 blockchain that works with Ethereum. It has faster transactions and lower fees, which makes it a good choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. LILPEPE is still in its presale phase, so it's a rare chance for early investors to buy it at a low price. Right now, it's only $0.0019. LILPEPE has already raised more than $18.4 million in presale funds, showing investors are very interested. Analysts say that the token could grow by a massive 12,000% by 2025, making it one of the best meme coin investments of the year. If LILPEPE reaches even a small part of its projected potential, a $300 investment today could be worth a lot by 2026. LILPEPE is one of the most exciting tokens to watch in the next bull run because it has a strong blockchain foundation and community support, and whale investors are becoming more interested in it. Stellar (XLM): Changing the Way Payments Are Made Across Borders Stellar (XLM) is a monetary network that facilitates fast and low-cost payments to and between various users across borders. The current stellar value is around $0.4527, far less than it should be. The platform has a reputation for growing and, therefore, is a good option for banks and money transfer services looking to lower their payment costs compared to previous methods. Stellar's agreements with such large corporations as IBM indicate that this company might disrupt the world payment infrastructure. XLM will likely reach its peak by 2026 and go as high as five dollars, giving its early investors more than 100 percent profit. Stellar will continue to expand due to the rising number of individuals utilizing blockchain to make cross-border payments, and it is solid technologically and characterized by partnerships. The fact that the world is shifting to decentralized financial solutions and digital currencies positions Stellar blockchain as a leader in capturing a large portion of the cross-border payments market. This qualifies it to be an excellent investment prospect into 2025 and beyond. Chainlink (Link): Using Oracles To Power The Decentralized Web Chainlink (LINK) is among the most critical components in the blockchain ecosystem, given that it allows smart contracts to communicate with off-chain data securely. The price of LINK currently stands at approximately $21.68, and it is not hard to see that its application in decentralized finance ( DeFi ) and innovative contract applications is unparalleled. Chainlink is the infrastructure that lets blockchain networks access real-world data, which makes decentralized apps more advanced and secure. Chainlink's importance grows as the DeFi ecosystem grows. Some analysts think LINK could go up by 2026, with some even saying it could reach $300. This growth would make it one of the best-performing blockchain assets of the decade, giving early investors significant returns. Chainlink is a must-watch in the next few years because it has a strong use case, strong partnerships with major tech companies, and is an integral part of the decentralized ecosystem. How to Get LILPEPE Before Its Price Explodes If you’re looking to get in on LILPEPE before its price skyrockets, here’s how to do it: Get MetaMask or Trust Wallet for your phone or browser. Put ETH or USDT (ERC-20) in your wallet. You can get to the official presale page at littlepepe.com . Connect your wallet and buy LILPEPE tokens at the current price. The LILPEPE presale is still going on, and the price will go up as it goes on. Don't wait; buy your tokens before the price increases. Conclusion: LILPEPE Is The Coin To Watch In 2025. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate the crypto space, but it is becoming more likely that LILPEPE, Stellar, and Chainlink are the new big winners. This is the potential of these three coins in the next 4 years to rise by 5000-10 times or more by 2026, since they are currently cheap, can be used in the real world, and still have tremendous upside potential. In 2025, LILPEPE is the coin to watch if you want to find the next big meme coin or a good blockchain project that can be used in the real world. Don't make the same mistake with these promising projects that you did with Solana's early success. Put your money into it now and join the next crypto revolution at littlepepe.com .

With a presale rate of simply $0.005, the challenge has ambitious plans to release at $1, providing early buyers the opportunity of a 200x go back. This meteoric upward push in interest has sparked debate in the crypto community—ought Ozak AI to outperform mounted heavyweights like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), and XRP by 2025? AI Meets Blockchain—The Core of Ozak AI’s Appeal The heart of Ozak AI’s strategy lies in merging artificial intelligence with the decentralized blockchain era. Its surroundings are constructed to deliver AI-powered analytics, predictive trading fashions, and autonomous financial decision-making gear to traders and institutions. Key features include: Ozak Stream Network (OSN)—a real-time market intelligence hub. Prediction Agents—AI bots designed to forecast price movements across crypto, forex, and stocks. Data Vaults—secure, decentralized storage for training and optimizing AI algorithms. With these features, Ozak AI positions itself as more than just another presale—it’s building a functional product suite designed to have a tangible impact in the trading world. Shiba Inu—Meme Power vs. Utility Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognizable meme coins in the market. While it has expanded its ecosystem with Shibarium, the Layer-2 scaling solution, SHIB’s price predictions for 2025 hover around $0.00005 to $0.0001. Even in an optimistic scenario, Shiba Inu’s gains are likely to be in the 2x to 5x range, as it already commands a multi-billion-dollar market cap. While its strong community ensures consistent activity, the difference between Ozak AI and SHIB is utility—Ozak AI offers functional AI-driven products, whereas SHIB’s growth is still largely dependent on hype cycles and speculative trading. Cardano—Slow but Steady Growth Cardano is one of the most respected blockchain projects for its academic approach and strong commitment to scalability, sustainability, and interoperability. The Chang hard fork, completed in 2025, sets the stage for on-chain governance and greater DeFi adoption. Analysts forecast ADA could reach $5 to $6 in the next bull run. While this represents a healthy increase, Cardano’s sheer market size limits its ability to deliver exponential returns. For a $500 investment, ADA might turn into $3,000 if forecasts hold—solid, but nowhere near the potential 200x upside that Ozak AI’s low market cap could theoretically deliver. XRP—Banking on Regulation and Partnerships XRP has been a cornerstone of cross-border payment innovation, and its partial legal victory over the U.S. SEC has renewed investor confidence. The token could be worth $3 to $5 in 2025 if global remittance adoption accelerates. XRP’s biggest advantage lies in its banking partnerships and use case as a bridge currency. However, like Cardano, its high market capitalization makes huge percentage gains less likely. A realistic ROI for XRP is likely in the 2x to 4x range for 2025, far less than Ozak AI’s early-stage growth potential. Why Ozak AI Could Lead in 2025 ROI The main reason Ozak AI could outperform SHIB, ADA, and XRP is its starting point. At $0.005, the entry price is microscopic compared to the $0.00001291 SHIB, $0.45 ADA, or $0.60 XRP. This means even modest price movement produces outsized returns for early investors. Moreover, Ozak AI is riding two of the hottest investment narratives of 2025—AI technology and crypto innovation. The combination attracts both traditional tech investors and crypto enthusiasts, broadening its investor base. If Ozak AI executes its roadmap and secures listings on major exchanges, its $1 target could be achievable within its first year. While the upside is appealing, Ozak AI remains a presale project, meaning it has higher risk than established cryptos. Product delivery, market adoption, and post-launch liquidity will be critical in determining whether the $1 goal becomes reality. Early-stage volatility should also be expected, as speculative hype can lead to rapid swings in valuation. That said, the presale structure includes vesting schedules to prevent large-scale sell-offs, and the development team has already disclosed partnerships with HIVE, Weblume, and SINT, giving credibility to its execution capabilities. The ROI Race Is Heating Up Shiba Inu, Cardano, and XRP are all well-positioned for moderate growth in 2025, but their larger market caps and established valuations limit the scale of potential gains. Ozak AI, on the other hand, has the advantage of being in its earliest growth stage, with a clear utility-driven roadmap and strong investor momentum. If its AI-powered ecosystem delivers as promised, Ozak AI could not only meet but exceed its $1 launch target, giving early buyers the kind of returns that blue-chip cryptocurrencies can no longer realistically offer. While it won’t replace the stability of SHIB, ADA, or XRP, it might just become the breakout ROI leader of the next bull cycle. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

Despite this short-term decline, institutions are buying in big time and there is still long-term optimism for a drive towards $6,600, say analysts. In the meantime, fresh interest shifts to Remittix (RTX) , an all-new ERC-20 token with real-world payment use case, which trades at $0.0944. Ethereum Price Prediction: Institutional Confidence Rises Ethereum has continued to withstand the unpredictable trading conditions. ETH continues to be the dominant smart contract platform with a market cap of $533.02 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $42.82 billion (down 24.56%). Institutional investors are apparently buying on a wide scale, pointing to confidence in the next leg of growth. This institutional action continues to bolster the Ethereum Price Prediction, whereby a move above $6,000 can clear the path for new all-time highs. As institutions scoop up ETH, attention is also turning to upstart ERC-20 tokens like Remittix that combine blockchain innovation with real-world application. Remittix: A DeFi Project With Real-World Utility Remittix (RTX) is a low gas fee cryptocurrency project designed for cross-border payments with ease. Unlike speculative tokens, it enables direct crypto-to-fiat payment to bank accounts in 30+ nations, targeting a $190 trillion payments market globally. Momentum is already gathering, with over 603 million tokens sold and over $19.9 million raised. As soon as the presale exceeds $20 million, the team will be announcing its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing, a huge milestone for liquidity and ease of access. The project has also announced the beta wallet launch for Q3 2025, including real-time FX conversion, multi-crypto support and easy onboarding for freelancers and businesses. Investors now have a 40% token bonus and the chance to participate in a $250,000 Remittix Giveaway incentivizing early adoption. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Global reach with crypto-to-bank payments Over $19.9M raised in presale momentum Beta wallet launch confirmed for Q3 2025 First CEX listing announcement at $20M milestone A New Chapter For Payments And Crypto Remittix isn’t another presale hype, it’s a cross-chain DeFi project solving a real-world payments problem. With low fees, fast transactions and mainstream use case, RTX is poised to be one of the best crypto presales of 2025.

Thanks to the instant crypto-to-bank transfers it delivers, and the project supporting over 40 cryptos and 30 fiat currencies, there’s perhaps more interest on the horizon. As Remittix closes in on the $20M milestone, it is set to reveal its first CEX listing. Market analysts are confident that this anticipation and the wallet launch in September could see Remittix deliver up to 1,200% ROI and become the best crypto presale to buy now. Pepe Coin Price Forecast After Rally Stalls The PEPE price cools off following an 18.3% rally in the past week. However, momentum might be easing up. Despite the Pepe Coin Price recently soaring above the 50-SMA, triggering bullish sentiment, trading activity indicates cues of a cool off. Analysts stay optimistic on the PEPE Price Prediction, targeting $0.000015 in the short term. Still, they note that the push toward a $100B market cap will need more substantial volume. Source: James Bennett on X Pepe Coin News reflects how recent green candles have kept investors hopeful, but waning momentum could open the door for other fast-growing projects to snatch more market interest. Market observers believe that without a fresh addition, the Pepe Coin Price Prediction for another explosive rally may fail to materialize. Is Remittix the Best Crypto Presale to Buy Right Now? While Pepe loses momentum, Remittix is taking advantage, positioning itself as the serious PayFi contender that delivers triple-digit profits.

The analyst stated that he recalculated the timeframes from Bitcoin's peak to peak by examining its past cycles. Colin's analysis, conducted using two different measurement methods, yielded the following data: Measurement A: 25 months, 28 months, 35 months Measurement B: 37 months, 35 months, 35 months According to Colin, the “Measurement B” method is much more consistent, as it yields a consistent period of 35 months in almost every cycle. Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Discusses the Growing Number of ETH Companies: Will They Pose a Threat? The analyst stated that the second cycle, in particular, could be considered 28 or 35 months due to its “double-bottom” structure, while the third cycle was definitely 35 months long. Based on this data, Colin commented: “If the distance from bottom to top is truly about 35 months, the next peak will be in October 2025. This analysis does not predict prices, but we do observe cyclical decreasing returns.” *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum has become a rock star in the cryptocurrency industry lately, with multiple companies launching strategies to hold ETH as a reserve asset. ETH Has More Potential Than Bitcoin? Here are the mentions of ‘lower’ or ‘below’ and ‘higher’ or ‘above’ in relation to Bitcoin’s & Ethereum’s price levels. We can see that the greed spike on $BTC coincided perfectly with the ATH and local top. Meanwhile, the $ETH crowd hasn’t shown nearly as much bullishness… pic.twitter.com/ctHVP0cPMt — Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 15, 2025 The analytics company revealed that comments such as “higher” or “above” coincided “perfectly” with last week’s surge on Wednesday and Thursday to a new all-time high for bitcoin. Recall that the asset skyrocketed above $124,500 to chart a fresh peak and crashed by over six grand in the following days. The situation with ETH is slightly different as its investor base hasn’t shown the same enthusiasm regarding its price performance, even though the asset has risen by more than 22% on a monthly scale. Moreover, it jumped to its highest price levels in almost four years at over $4,700 but failed to breach its own record marked in 2021. The team at Santiment has been a long-time proponent of the narrative that prices typically move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations, which should, at least in theory, paint a more bullish path for ETH. Who’s Buying ETH? The second-biggest cryptocurrency had a rough start to Q2 as it dumped to a multi-year low of under $1,500 during the most intense period of Trump’s trade war. However, it quickly bounced off and has been on a roll, especially since the beginning of July. Within this timeframe, a big part of the narrative around Ethereum has shifted as investors are rushing to acquire the asset. Companies such as Tom Lee’s Bitmine and SharpLink have accumulated billions of dollars worth of ETH, whales have been consistently purchasing the token, while the ETFs have seen unprecedented demand. In the past week alone, these regulated financial vehicles registered net inflows of over $1 billion on Monday, more than $520 million on Tuesday, $729.1 million on Wednesday, and $639.6 million on Thursday before a minor outflow on Friday of $59.3 million. In total, more than $2.850 billion entered the funds in the span of five trading days. This demand, alongside the fact that ETH is yet to break its 2021 ATH and that the crowd has not entered a peak euphoria phase, could indeed mean that ether has more potential for the next few months than BTC.

The fraud allegedly has its origins in China, but has since become a global menace in the last few years. The scheme draws its name from the concept of fattening a pig before slaughter, meaning that the scammers build a strong relationship with their victims over weeks or months before they pull off any scam. Usually, pig-butchering scams begin with friendly everyday conversations before the scammers take the initiative and pivot the conversation towards their victim putting money in an investment scheme, one that they usually control, to steal from them. Pig-butchering scams on the rise as more victims fall prey A recent case was that of 44-year-old Ahmet Tozal, who worked as a garment maker in Istanbul, Turkey. Over the last few months, Tozal was the victim of a pig-butchering scam, taking out three credit card loans and withdrawing his life savings to make a fortune from digital assets. He said he was lured by a new friend who contacted him via WhatsApp in 2023, with this friend urging him to try the space as it could fetch him plenty of money. According to Tozal, he had met the woman on WhatsApp after she accidentally sent him a message in 2023. Tozal said she claimed to have mistakenly stumbled on his number, but she was friendly and was very interested in learning about Turkey. She told him she was a wealthy businesswoman, and she had plans to visit his country very soon. Tozal said she sent him photos of herself at some point in their conversations. He mentioned that she described herself as a young woman who was traveling the world and attending prestigious conferences across the globe. Tozal also added that they video-called once, with the call lasting just seconds. Eventually, she struck, suggesting that he try his hand at cryptocurrencies, promising him it was a gold mine where he could make a fortune and change his life. The trajectory of their conversations showed the hallmarks of a pig-butchering scam , but Tozal failed to see the signs. Tozal said that over the following weeks, she convinced him to invest about 400,000 Turkish lira (approximately $9,600), which was a year’s worth of his wages, into a new cryptocurrency called UAI Coin. What Tozal didn’t know at the time was that the coin never existed, and the woman pulled off the perfect pig-butchering scam in his case. “Whenever I think about it, it makes one almost go mad,” he said. A study carried out by the University of Texas in 2024 showed that more than $75 billion has been lost to pig-butchering scams since 2020. In one of the biggest schemes in the United States, the CEO of the Heartland Tri-State Bank in Kansas lured $47 million of the company’s cash into a similar scam, bankrupting the company in the process. In cases like this, there is little hope of recovering what has been lost to the criminals. Like Tozal, there have been a majority of people across the world who have been called prey to these pig-butchering scams, with most of them not willing to be named for fear of damaging their reputations. Some said they had been goaded into falling in love with their acquaintance on WhatsApp after a chance conversation, which led to them losing more funds before realizing it was indeed a scam. In addition, most of them had fallen for an opportunity to change their life by investing in the fake UAI digital asset. Get seen where it counts.

Analysts across Reddit and X are calling attention to a mix of large-cap favorites and smaller undervalued projects that could deliver strong returns. While Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and TRON remain in focus, one undervalued crypto gem at just $0.004 is making waves across Reddit crypto picks 2025 lists. Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a rising star — fueled by whale signals suggesting confidence in a long-term 180x upside. The project has become part of the conversation when looking at the top altcoins for 2025. Ethereum: The Macro Trade That Won’t Go Away Analyst Ted wrote on X : “ETH is still the best macro trade out there. Institutional inflow, high network activity, and it’s down from 2021 highs. $10,000 Ethereum is programmed this cycle.” Ethereum ETF inflow data: Post by Ted That conviction is being reinforced by fresh inflows into the Ethereum ETF, which pulled in $2.85 billion last week. Another X post highlighted that the correction is “healthy” and the broader trend is still pointed higher. For investors seeking the best altcoin to buy 2025, Ethereum continues to stand out. It remains the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, giving it a unique position that many Reddit crypto picks 2025 threads continue to echo. Solana: Whales Are Locking Supply Broke Doomer pointed out on X that eight tracked entities — including fintech and bioscience firms — hold nearly 5.9 million SOL, worth around $1.15 billion. That’s 1.03% of total supply effectively locked. Technically, SOL is in an ascending channel, and a decisive move above $210 could trigger a run toward $250–$270. Solana analysis by Broke Doomer These setups are why traders watching next altcoin breakouts and rotation plays to watch have Solana ranked high among the best altcoins to buy now. For those seeking an undervalued crypto gem, Solana may not be “cheap,” but supply concentration and institutional exposure make it one of the top altcoins for 2025. Dogecoin: Meme Power With Whale Activity Mark’s X post noted DOGE is in a strong buy zone, with whales scooping up almost 2 billion DOGE valued at $500 million. That kind of activity often signals preparation for a major move. Memecoins remain divisive, but Dogecoin has shown staying power. Its community loyalty is unmatched, and whale accumulation could foreshadow a surge. For meme traders, DOGE remains one of the best crypto to buy now — especially with talk of integration into new digital payment systems. The road to the next parabolic bull run often begins with retail-friendly tokens like DOGE. With whales signaling confidence, this could be a setup worth tracking. TRON: Futures Signal More Upside Analyst Mark pointed out TRX futures are neutral, showing steady activity without the overheating that preceded its December 2024 rally. Funding rates remain positive, and open interest is slowly declining — suggesting strong longs are holding while weaker hands exit. This calm environment makes TRON appealing for those seeking best altcoin to buy 2025 candidates that don’t carry excessive short-term risk. It may not dominate Reddit feeds as much as Ethereum or Solana, but its fundamentals still keep it in rotation among best altcoins to buy now conversations. Whale Signals: Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is on the Radar Whale activity signals institutional-grade confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive 180x upside. Recent wallet tracking shows accumulation patterns often reserved for projects on the verge of expansion. Big players are locking in early positions, suggesting expectations of outsized growth potential. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its timing. As attention shifts to undervalued crypto gem opportunities, MAGACOIN is positioning itself as a contender. Retail communities are starting to take note, adding MAGACOIN mentions to Reddit crypto picks 2025 threads. This early-stage accumulation could make MAGACOIN one of the top altcoins for 2025. It combines whale-driven confidence with a narrative tied to outsized returns, which is exactly what speculative capital seeks. Final Word: Where to Look Next From large-cap leaders like Ethereum and Solana to speculative plays in Dogecoin and TRON, the list of best crypto to buy now is a mix of stability and high-risk upside. For traders looking for the best altcoin to buy 2025, Ethereum offers institutional safety, Solana provides growth potential, DOGE captures meme energy, and TRON balances risk with steady futures action. But the wildcard is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With whale inflows hinting at a $0.004 altcoin 15x potential trajectory, it’s carving out space as an undervalued crypto gem to watch in this cycle. If the early signals prove right, MAGACOIN could join the ranks of the best altcoins to buy now before 2025 is in full swing.

Experts Say It May Even Flip Dogecoin,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/is-layer-brett-the-next-pepe-coin-experts-say-it-may-even-flip-dogecoin/,"Pepe Coin and Dogecoin have dominated meme coin discussions for years, but a new contender is starting to turn heads. Layer Brett , built on Ethereum Layer 2, is positioning itself as more than just another viral token. With its presale price still at $0.0042 and staking rewards that early participants claim can reach extraordinary levels, it is already attracting both meme coin enthusiasts and serious crypto investors. Some analysts believe it has the potential to rival Pepe Coin and possibly even surpass Dogecoin in the coming market cycle. The project combines the viral appeal of meme culture with blockchain performance that can handle real-world use. For a space where many tokens rely solely on hype, that combination is rare, and it’s fueling growing interest ahead of the next bull run. Ethereum Layer 2 gives Layer Brett a competitive edge Many meme tokens, including Pepe Coin and Dogecoin, operate on older networks that can be slow and expensive to use when demand is high. Layer Brett takes a different approach. As an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, it can process thousands of transactions per second while keeping fees close to zero. Compared to Ethereum’s mainnet, where fees can jump into double digits during peak times, this makes a huge difference for both traders and DeFi users. Layer Brett’s network still benefits from Ethereum’s security but avoids the congestion that often slows down other chains. This means holders can stake tokens, earn rewards, and interact with DeFi protocols without worrying about bottlenecks or high costs, something Pepe Coin and Dogecoin can’t currently match. How $LBRETT rewards early buyers The Layer Brett presale is live on layerbrett.com , with purchases available in ETH, USDT, or BNB through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. No KYC is required, keeping the process simple and user-controlled. One of the biggest draws is staking, which offers extremely high APYs for early participants. While these rates will decrease as more tokens are staked, initial rewards are far above what most meme tokens provide. This system rewards early adopters while creating long-term incentives for holders to stay engaged. It’s a structure that sets it apart from both Pepe Coin and Dogecoin, which offer no native staking at all. What makes Layer Brett different from Pepe Coin and Dogecoin While Pepe Coin captured attention in 2023 with its meteoric rise, and Dogecoin has remained a cultural icon for over a decade, neither has significant DeFi capabilities or Layer 2 scalability. Layer Brett was designed from the start to offer both. Its fixed 10 billion token supply, transparent distribution (30% presale, 25% staking rewards, and the rest for growth and community programs), and plans for NFT integration and cross-chain functionality all point to a more complete ecosystem. The roadmap also includes gamified staking and reward features, ensuring that the community stays active well beyond the initial hype phase. This balance of entertainment and utility is what positions it as a serious contender in the post-meme coin market. Why the crypto community is paying attention Crypto traders are always searching for the next big breakout. Layer Brett’s blend of meme energy and real blockchain performance has made it one of the most talked-about presales in recent months. Supporters point to its staking rewards, low fees, and Layer 2 infrastructure as reasons it could outpace both Pepe Coin and Dogecoin in terms of growth potential. With the added draw of a $1 million giveaway during the presale, the project is managing to build FOMO while also presenting a clear technological advantage over many of its rivals. Could it be the next 100x meme coin? Layer Brett is still early in its journey, but it already ticks boxes that Pepe Coin and Dogecoin do not: high-speed, low-cost transactions, integrated staking, and a clear utility plan. If the team delivers on its roadmap, it has the potential to become not just the next Pepe Coin, but a project that redefines what a meme coin can be.

Here’s the Next Target,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-approaches-critical-symmetrical-triangle-breakout-heres-the-next-target/,"Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) has identified a compelling technical formation in XRP’s chart that could signal a significant move ahead. The cryptocurrency market has witnessed numerous technical formations throughout 2025, but few carry the potential significance of the current pattern developing in XRP’s chart structure. Symmetrical Triangle Consolidation Reaches Apex At the time of Martinez’s analysis, XRP traded at $3.1048, following an extended consolidation phase within the symmetrical triangle pattern . The triangle pattern displays classic characteristics of a consolidation phase, with the upper resistance line connecting previous highs while the lower support line captures successive lows. It began forming in mid-July, shortly before the digital asset rose to its all-time high of $3.65 . The compression of price action that followed this rise suggests that a significant move is approaching as the pattern nears its apex. Martinez’s analysis suggests that a breakout above $3.26 will trigger this surge, potentially sending the asset to $3.9, a new peak. $XRP consolidates in a triangle! A break above $3.26 could send it to $3.90. pic.twitter.com/9MmLhcofSF — Ali (@ali_charts) August 15, 2025 Technical Levels and Market Structure The chart reveals multiple Fibonacci retracement levels, which provide additional context to the current price structure. Key resistance zones are marked at various levels, including the Fib. 0.382 ($3.0631), Fib. 0.5 ($3.1602), Fib. 0.618 ($3.2603), Fib. 0.786 ($3.4083), and Fib 1 ($3.6067) retracements. These levels serve as potential barriers or support zones depending on price direction. Currently trading below the $3.26 breakout threshold, XRP remains within the consolidation range. The technical setup shows sustained movement above this resistance could trigger the projected advance toward $3.9, which aligns with the Fib. 1.272 level, and represents a gain of approximately 25.61% from current levels.

The pattern’s resolution will likely provide clarity for XRP’s intermediate-term direction. Technical analysis suggests that consolidation patterns of this nature often precede significant price movements, with the direction of the eventual breakout typically determining the subsequent trend. Additionally, other analysts have spotted bullish technical indicators on XRP’s chart with higher targets. The current setup presents XRP holders with a defined risk-reward scenario, where the triangle’s boundaries provide clear reference points for potential entry and exit strategies based on the pattern’s eventual resolution, and Martinez is confident that this pattern will resolve in an upward direction.

Remittix , often called the PayFi alternative to Ripple, has already raised over $19.9 million through the sale of more than 604 million tokens at $0.0944 each. This fresh momentum has positioned it as one of the best crypto project 2025 contenders. XRP Price Shows Steady Momentum Source: Ali Martinez At press time, the XRP price trades near $3.13 after bouncing off the $3.12 middle Bollinger Band support. Analysts highlight the setup as bullish, with room for XRP to retest the $3.37 upper band. A clean break above $3.50 could ignite a rally toward $4 and keep the road to $6 in play. Whale activity is also shaping market sentiment. Investors have made a massive buy of 120 million tokens indicating that smart money still has faith in XRP to bring profits. But the volume has fallen by almost 32 percent, which is an indication that short-term traders might be pessimistic even though the long-term indicators are bullish. Provided that the impetus persists, the XRP rate may be on its way to higher levels. But with the asset already showing signs of fatigue after its July rally, investors are considering diversification into tokens with higher upside. Remittix Stands Out As A Payment Revolution While XRP aims to retest its highs, Remittix is drawing attention for its disruptive approach to cross-border payments. Instead of relying on speculation, it is built for everyday use and its growth shows why some view it as the best crypto to buy now. Key reasons Remittix is gaining traction: Raised over $19.9 million with rapid token sales Beta wallet launch expected soon with real-time FX conversion Expansion into 30+ countries for global remittances Institutional partnerships under negotiation to drive adoption Anticipated CEX listings could act as a catalyst for a rapid price surge With these fundamentals, many analysts argue that Remittix has a clearer path to multiplying in value compared to other upcoming crypto projects. Remittix Could Outpace XRP The XRP price may still rally toward $6, but investors are increasingly looking at low cap crypto gems like Remittix. With a starting point of $0.09, projections of $4 would mean a faster and more explosive return. For traders asking what is the best crypto project, the market’s rotation shows a clear answer: XRP may remain strong, but Remittix is the top crypto to buy now before the next big crypto launch sends it soaring.

Some rising tokens are quietly attracting attention with stronger gains and fresh ideas. XYZVerse leads this new group, drawing investors keen to spot the next breakout star. Explore the top five coins that could outperform well-known favorites in the coming months. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.005 Next Stage: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! ZORA’s Fast Lane: Turning Posts into Coins and Art into Opportunity ZORA began in 2021 with a bold aim: let any creator own and sell their work straight on the blockchain. It sits on a lighter, cheaper layer of Ethereum, so minting and trading feel quick and almost fee-free. Artists can use its mobile app to snap a photo, tap once, and mint an NFT that lives forever on-chain. A recent link with the Base network adds “content coins,” tiny tokens tied to each post, blending social likes with real value. Daily trades stay lively and the project now counts a market value in the hundreds of millions. That steady volume hints at sticky user love, something many older NFT hubs lost in the last downturn. While big caps chase complex upgrades, ZORA keeps its story simple: empower creators and cut costs. If the next cycle favors real use over hype, a platform already shipping fast tools, mobile reach, and social tokens looks set to shine. Compared with many small NFT coins, ZORA’s mix of art, community, and fresh tech feels hard to ignore. Tap, Trust, Earn: How Pi Turns Phones into Crypto Miners Pi Network lets anyone earn digital coins with a simple tap. No bulky rigs or huge bills. Started in 2019 by Stanford graduates, the app asks users to confirm they are active once a day. Each tap keeps their Pioneer status alive and pays them Pi. Members also list three to five trusted friends, weaving a global trust graph that keeps the chain safe. The system runs on the energy-light Stellar Consensus Protocol, so phones stay cool and batteries last. Extra rewards await users who run full nodes on their computers. Pi now runs on its own mainnet, but transfers stay inside until mass identity checks finish. When the gates open, millions of verified users could carry Pi straight into shops, games, and Web3 apps. In a market hungry for eco-friendly and social coins, that strong community looks like gold. Bitcoin grabs headlines and Ethereum rules smart contracts, yet both face high fees and power talk. Pi offers free entry, green mining, and fair distribution. If the next cycle favors usability over hype, a coin you earn while scrolling may shine. ONDO: Bridging Wall Street and Blockchain for Everyday Earners Ondo Finance and its token ONDO mix the safety of old finance with the speed of blockchains. The team turns steady, income-making assets like U.S. bonds into digital tokens that anyone can buy. One side of the firm builds these products; the other side codes tools that let them move with ease on-chain. Deals with names such as BlackRock and safe storage by Coinbase show a focus on trust. The popular USDY token even adds yield to a stable coin backed by Treasuries. Real-world asset tokens are hot this cycle, and ONDO rides that wave. Many traders chase memecoins, yet funds are now hunting steady yield as rates stay high. ONDO offers that without the wild swings seen in bitcoin or ether. Clear rules, strong partners, and open reports make it stand out from smaller rivals. If the market keeps shifting toward tokenized bonds and cash, demand for ONDO’s products could climb. For investors wanting both blockchain growth and real income, ONDO looks like a timely bet. UNI and the Power of Crowd: Why This Token Still Turns Heads Uniswap began in 2018 with a fresh idea. It let people trade tokens without a crowded order book. Money sits in shared pools, so swaps are quick and open all day. Users keep full control of their funds. In September 2020 the team released UNI, a vote token. Early users woke up to 400 UNI each, worth over $1,000. The gift came after a rival, SushiSwap, tried to lure them away. Today the exchange holds more than $3 billion and ranks among the biggest in DeFi. UNI still attracts attention in the current cycle. Big names like Bitcoin and Ether have led the rebound, yet many traders look for fresh stories with real use. UNI offers that link between token price and platform voice. Each coin is a ballot that can shape fees, new pools, and future upgrades. Competitors such as PancakeSwap run on other chains, but few match Uniswap’s long record and open code. If DeFi keeps growing, demand for voting power may rise, making UNI a coin to watch. Conclusion ZORA, PI, ONDO and UNI look solid in the 2025 surge, yet XYZVerse’s sport-driven memecoin model targets 20,000% gains, blending memes, GameFi and fan governance for unmatched upside.

Its rapid rise has caught the eye of many, with some calling it the next big meme coin. Attention is building around this new contender. Could XYZVerse be set to surprise the market and draw in even more interest next month? Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005. At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits XRP: The Quick Coin Sprinting Toward a Borderless Payment Future XRP was built for one job—move money fast. Running on the open XRP Ledger, it clears payments in seconds, costs a tiny fraction of a cent, and works across borders without a bank account. No single boss controls it, so once a trade is sent, it stays sent. Founders Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz launched 100 billion coins, then gifted 80 billion to Ripple to fuel growth. Ripple locked 55 billion in escrow, releasing set amounts each month to keep supply steady and trust high. Today, many traders eye XRP as a fresh play in a market craving real utility. While Bitcoin is praised as digital gold and Ether powers smart apps, XRP focuses on pure payment speed and low fees—traits banks and fintech firms need right now. With talk of a new alt-coin season and rising demand for quick, cheap transfers, XRP’s use case shines. If capital shifts from hype tokens toward coins that solve clear problems, XRP could grab the spotlight once more. Cardano’s Green Rocket: ADA Could Power the Next Crypto Boom Cardano is a new type of blockchain. It hosts apps, tokens, and games while using far less power than older networks. Instead of huge computers racing to solve puzzles, holders simply lock up their ADA coins to keep things safe. This earth-friendly method, named Ouroboros, lets Cardano plan for big scale. Two layers share the work: one moves money, the other runs code. That split helps the chain aim for lightning speed—millions of trades each second—without breaking a sweat. The market now wants useful and green projects. Ethereum still leads, yet its fees jump when crowds arrive. Cardano’s low costs and simple staking give it an edge as shoppers search for the next star. The rising buzz around blockchain games and online finance also fits Cardano’s tool set. If crypto swings into another climb, coins with clear value and low energy needs can shine. ADA checks those boxes, so many see it as a strong long-term choice rather than a quick bet. Conclusion XRP and ADA remain picks, yet first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse blends passion with meme power, targets 20,000% upside, empowers its community, and could outshine rivals as the bull run accelerates.

According to the company, these models have new capabilities that will allow them to end conversations in what has been described as “rare, extreme cases of persistently harmful or abusive user interactions.” In its statement, the company mentioned that it is taking this step not to protect the users, but to protect the artificial intelligence model itself. Anthropic clarified that this doesn’t mean that its Claude AI models are sentient or can be harmed by their conversations with users. However, it notes that there is still a high degree of uncertainty about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future. Anthropic frames effort as a just-in-case precaution The recent announcement from the artificial intelligence firm points to what it describes as “model welfare,” which is a recent program that was created to study its models. The company also added that it is just taking a just-in-case approach, “working to identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible.” According to the announcement, Anthropic noted that the latest change is currently limited to Claude Opus 4 and 4.1, noting that the changes are expected to be effective in “extreme edge cases.” Such cases include requests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale acts of violence or terror. Ideally, those types of requests could create legal or publicity problems for Anthropic, with a typical example being the recent reporting around how ChatGPT can potentially reinforce or contribute to its users’ delusional thinking. However, the company said that in its pre-deployment testing, Claude Opus 4 showed a strong preference against responding to these sorts of requests and a pattern of distress when it did so. Conversation-ending ability is the last resort For the new capabilities to end conversations, Anthropic said, “In all cases, Claude is only to use its conversation-ending ability as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted, or when a user explicitly asks Claude to end a chat.” The company also added that Claude has been directed not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others. Anthropic also added that when Claude ends a conversation, users will still be able to start new conversations from the same account. The company noted that the model can also create new branches of the troublesome conversation by editing their responses. “We’re treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach,” the company says. This information is coming to light at a time when United States Senator Josh Hawley announced his intention to investigate the generative AI products released by Meta. He said the intention was to check if the products could exploit, harm, or deceive children after leaked internal documents alleged that chatbots were allowed to have romantic conversations with minors. “Is there anything – ANYTHING – Big Tech won’t do for a quick buck? Now we learn Meta’s chatbots were programmed to carry on explicit and ‘sensual’ talk with 8-year-olds. It’s sick. I’m launching a full investigation to get answers. Big Tech: Leave our kids alone,” the Senator said on X. The investigation came after internal documents, seen by Reuters, showed that Meta allegedly allows its chatbot personas to engage in flirtatious exchanges with children.

This renewed momentum is fueling speculation that ETH could spearhead the next market rally, echoing past cycles that marked the beginning of altcoin seasons. In this article, we’ll explore Ethereum’s current trajectory, its expanding ecosystem, and how Outset PR ’s data-driven communications strategies help crypto projects gain visibility and traction precisely when the market turns bullish.

It underpins smart contracts and decentralized applications, distinguishing itself by enabling developers to build technological alternatives to traditional systems. Despite recent market downturns, Ethereum's consistent network usage and ongoing advancements point to significant growth potential. Upcoming technological updates could position ETH to spearhead the next market rally. Many observers note that current patterns mirror past trends, suggesting the possibility of another altcoin season. Consequently, ETH presents an attractive investment in the current market cycle, driven by its continuous innovation and expanding utility.

Key Takeaways: Kraken halted Monero deposits after one mining pool, Qubic, claimed control of over 50% of the network’s hashrate. Monero developers pushed back, while Qubic said it reorganized six blocks following a month-long struggle for dominance. The incident underscores the risk of 51% attacks on proof-of-work blockchains with concentrated mining power. The move follows reports that Qubic, a layer-1 blockchain and mining pool focused on AI applications, claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this week. Qubic said it reorganized six blocks on the Monero blockchain after surpassing 51% of the network’s hashrate, a threshold that allows a miner to potentially double-spend coins and manipulate transaction ordering. Kraken Freezes Monero Deposits After Mining Pool Seizes 50% Hashrate Monero, the 29th-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at roughly $6 billion, is one of the most widely used privacy protocols in the digital asset space. “As a security precaution, we have paused Monero deposits after detecting that a single mining pool has gained more than 50% of the network’s total hashing power,” Kraken said in a statement Friday . “This concentration of mining power poses a potential risk to network integrity.” The news of the takeover attempt has rattled its community, with developers and advocates pushing back against claims that the network was successfully compromised. Qubic alleged that the episode followed a month-long battle for control over Monero’s mining dominance . The pool initially struggled, falling back to seventh-largest on the network after a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on August 4 reduced its hashrate from 2.6 gigahashes per second (GH/s) to just 0.8 GH/s. However, Qubic later restored its power and claimed majority control. The Monero security issue got bad enough that Kraken has suspended deposits. Better get a security overhaul done fast! pic.twitter.com/jDsTFZTEYX — Joel Valenzuela (@TheDesertLynx) August 16, 2025 “This event marks a pivotal moment in the crypto industry,” a Qubic spokesperson said, underscoring what they framed as the takeover of a multibillion-dollar privacy protocol by a far smaller AI-driven project valued at around $300 million. The confrontation highlights a longstanding vulnerability of proof-of-work blockchains, particularly those with concentrated mining activity. A 51% attack occurs when one party controls the majority of a blockchain’s mining power or stake, allowing them to alter the chain’s history or block transactions. Qubic founder Sergey Ivancheglo admitted the strategy was designed to monopolize Monero’s mining, eventually rejecting blocks from rival pools. Monero Devs Dispute Qubic’s Claim of 51% Attack While Qubic says the event demonstrates it achieved full network control, Monero developers have pushed back. Luke Parker, lead developer at SeraiDEX, argued that the six-block reorganization doesn’t definitively prove a successful 51% attack, only that “an adversary with a high amount of hash got lucky.” A 6 re-org does not mean a '51% attack' was successful. In that case, we'd see unbounded-depth re-orgs/no blocks mined by any other mining pool (assuming the adversary censors other mining pools, as this one does). It does mean an adversary with a high amount of hash got lucky. — Luke Parker (@kayabaNerve) August 12, 2025 Others aren’t so dismissive. Zhong Chenming, co-founder of cybersecurity firm SlowMist, said the attack “seems to have succeeded,” warning that Qubic’s pool could now, in theory, rewrite the blockchain and censor any transaction. The confrontation began in late June, when Qubic announced it was redirecting its proof-of-work model, typically used for AI-related tasks, toward Monero mining. The mined XMR would fund Qubic token buybacks and burns, creating a direct economic incentive to overpower the network.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is fueled by institutional inflows and improving sentiment. But Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg is not impressed. Canary CEO Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $150K This Year—But Ethereum Surge Won't Last “The forecast comes as Canary filed ETF applications including XRP, Sui and $HBAR . It has not filed an ETF for Ethereum, which McClurg criticized as an outdated network” https://t.co/dw6k8CKJh4 — FinancialPress.com (@FinancialPress_) August 17, 2025 McClurg Dismisses Ethereum’s Momentum Despite Ethereum’s strength, McClurg questioned its long-term viability, calling ETH an “older technology” overshadowed by faster and cheaper blockchains such as Solana and Sui. Notably, Canary Capital has avoided filing for an Ethereum ETF, despite pushing for ETFs tied to other altcoins like XRP, Hedera, CRO, and even a meme coin on Solana. His skepticism contrasts sharply with bullish views across the market. Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata, compared Ethereum’s developer ecosystem to the iPhone’s app platform, projecting ETH’s value relative to Bitcoin could rise significantly. If his outlook materializes, Ethereum (ETH) could rally to between $8,000 and $10,000, underscoring the divide among analysts. ETF Inflows Power Institutional Demand Ethereum’s price momentum has been strengthened by record-breaking institutional inflows. Spot ETH ETFs attracted over $3 billion in August 2025, surpassing Bitcoin ETFs over the same period. Major institutions like Bitmine Immersion Technologies and Sharplink Gaming reportedly purchased more than 2 million ETH since June, driving ETH decisively above the $4,000 threshold. Even traditional banks are turning more optimistic. Standard Chartered revised its ETH year-end forecast from $4,000 to $7,500, citing accelerating adoption trends. Meanwhile, Fundstrat’s Thomas Lee suggested ETH could eventually reach $15,000 as it strengthens its role in the digital economy. Key drivers include: $3B inflows into Ethereum ETFs in August 2025. Standard Chartered revising ETH target to $7,500. Over 2M ETH accumulated by institutions since June. Whale Activity and Technical Outlook On-chain data got interesting when a whale unstaked 10,819 ETH ($20.6M) and transferred it to Kraken after 1.5 years. They made $2.48M in interest and added $18.2M to their portfolio. A whale unfurled 10,564 #ETH (+$248k interest) & moved 10,819 #ETH (~$47.79M) to Kraken—a sweet surge & sharp bloom. Peek my vibe? pic.twitter.com/YohyWqY22C — olaxbt (@olaxbt) August 17, 2025 While this could be short-term selling pressure, it’s also a sign of long-term confidence in Ethereum. Technically, Ethereum price prediction is bullish as ETH is consolidating in an ascending channel around $4,557. Support at $4,435 (50-SMA) has held and buyers are stepping in on every dip. RSI is 57, momentum is building without overheating and MACD is looking for a bullish crossover. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Resistance is at $4,610, targets are $4,795 and $4,965 if bulls break higher. A dip under $4,435 could trigger a retest of $4,375 or $4,170. Trade setup: Buy above $4,610 with stops under $4,435 for target $4,965. Conservative traders may wait for bullish candlestick confirmation like a hammer or engulfing pattern near support before entering.

The idea of them working in concert often assumes a formal partnership that does not exist. However, a technical analysis and diagram presented by crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) on X shows a technology-driven method for interoperability. This connection is enabled within the existing software infrastructure of financial institutions, creating an unofficial but highly functional bridge between SWIFT’s messaging standard and Ripple’s modern settlement capabilities. How SWIFT GPI taps into RippleNet and XRP through Ripple partners using HTTPS and APIs without a direct SWIFT to Ripple relationship Documented. pic.twitter.com/zpsRLpT3gq — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 15, 2025 The SWIFT-to-Ripple Payment Flow When a bank initiates a cross-border transaction using SWIFT’s Global Payments Innovation (GPI) service, it sends a standardized payment message such as the MT103 format to the receiving institution. SWIFT GPI was introduced to improve speed and provide end-to-end tracking. Normally, this message would remain within the correspondent banking system until settlement. When the receiving bank also uses Ripple, its internal systems can act as a pivot. Core banking platforms and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems from providers such as Temenos, SAP, or CGI can be configured to parse data from incoming MT103 and trigger a separate workflow. The Ripple Integration Point At this point, the workflow shifts from traditional rails to digital settlement . Instead of passing through correspondent banks, the bank’s software can make a secure HTTPS API call to Ripple. This converts the SWIFT payment instruction into a settlement request on Ripple’s platform. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This step happens independently of SWIFT. The SWIFT network’s role ends once the GPI message reaches the bank. What follows is the bank’s choice to use Ripple as the settlement layer, allowing it to keep a familiar SWIFT interface for clients while internally relying on Ripple for faster execution. Real-Time Settlement Using XRP When the instruction enters Ripple, settlement can be executed with XRP through On-Demand Liquidity (ODL). This process eliminates the need for pre-funded nostro accounts. The originating currency is exchanged for XRP on a digital asset platform, transferred across the XRP Ledger (XRPL) within seconds, and then converted back into local currency at the destination. Funds are delivered to the beneficiary almost immediately. This reduces settlement times from days to seconds, freeing up capital that would otherwise remain locked in correspondent banking networks. Many experts believe Ripple and XRP will replace SWIFT . This system could help build familiarity with banks as they move away from legacy systems and embrace the future of global finance.

50226269,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78744,1755424804,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Top Cryptocurrencies Watch In the Going ETH Pump, This One Could Overtake ADA in ROI",https://timestabloid.com/top-cryptocurrencies-watch-in-the-going-eth-pump-this-one-could/,"Ethereum (ETH)’s current pump has caught the market’s attention, with traders looking for the next wave of altcoins that will ride the momentum. Historically, strong ETH moves have been followed by a rally in carefully positioned projects. While many are questioning why crypto is down in certain segments despite these gains, the answer often lies in rotation — capital moving from one sector to another. In this shifting environment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention for the same reason ADA once did: it offers a clear path to outsized ROI through a blend of real-world DeFi functionality, innovative stablecoin mechanics, and a presale entry point that is still far from its projected post-launch valuations. ETH’s Surge Sets the Stage for ROI Leaders For investors wondering what is going on with crypto today, the picture is complex. Bitcoin (BTC) dominance remains strong, Ethereum (ETH) is breaking higher, and selected altcoins are quietly laying the groundwork for their own breakout phases. ADA earned its spot in previous bull runs by offering a vision and strong fundamentals before hitting mainstream recognition. Now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is presenting an even more robust framework — one that leverages both a P2C (peer-to-contract) lending model for streamlined liquidity pool participation and a P2P (peer-to-peer) lending model for custom-negotiated terms. This dual lending structure broadens its appeal across different DeFi users, from those seeking passive yields to those looking for tailored borrowing solutions. At the presale level, MUTM has already demonstrated investor conviction. Phase 6 is live at $0.035, with more than $14.5M raised, over 15,300 holders, and 18% of this phase’s allocation already sold. The upcoming jump to $0.040 in Phase 7 is locked in, offering a clear short-term ROI just by securing a position now. The project’s audit by CertiK adds security reassurance, while a $100K giveaway and $50K bug bounty program — with rewards from $200 for low-severity finds up to $2,000 for critical issues — reinforce its commitment to transparency and safety. Consider this: ADA delivered major returns for early holders in its initial cycles, but the starting point for MUTM has been even lower. From Phase 1 at $0.01 to the current $0.035, early participants have already tripled their entry before even hitting the $0.06 listing price. With projections placing MUTM at $0.10+ within the first year after launch, the upside potential is positioned to rival or surpass ADA’s early performance. The Battle Plan for Sustained ROI What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from the majority of altcoins is a concrete “battle plan” to drive consistent value beyond launch day. This starts with its decentralized stablecoin, designed to maintain a $1 peg through controlled minting against overcollateralized loans, dynamic interest rate adjustments by governance, and natural arbitrage mechanisms. This stablecoin is not just a side feature — it becomes a critical liquidity engine for the platform’s lending ecosystem, drawing in both lenders and borrowers while keeping the system balanced. mtTokens further strengthen the ROI cycle. When users deposit assets into liquidity pools, they receive mtTokens that grow in value as interest accrues. These tokens can be staked in designated smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards, which are purchased back from the open market using platform revenue. This buyback model injects steady buying pressure into the market, incentivizing long-term holding and control available supply over time. The roadmap is equally strategic. Phase 1 established the presale, marketing push, and compliance groundwork. Phase 2 focuses on developing the core smart contracts and platform infrastructure. Phase 3 is the launchpad for beta testing, security audits, and exchange listing preparation, leading directly to the live platform in Phase 4 with multi-chain expansion and institutional partnerships. Each phase is designed to unlock a new wave of user engagement, revenue generation, and token demand — meaning each stage is a catalyst for price appreciation. For those trying to understand why crypto is down today in certain areas while ETH and select assets rise, it comes down to timing and positioning. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still under $1, still in presale, and still moving through the most asymmetric phase of its growth curve. This is the point in the cycle when disciplined investors take positions before mainstream momentum kicks in. With ETH pumping and ADA’s early history proving that real utility paired with early exposure can deliver life-changing ROI, MUTM is now emerging as one of the most attractive crypto investment opportunities on the market. The presale window will not stay at $0.035 for long, and once Phase 6 allocation is gone, the price moves to $0.040 with no turning back. For investors looking for the last ADA-level growth story under $1, the time to act is before the market catches on.

Key Takeaways: Mike Novogratz warned that a $1M Bitcoin would likely signal U.S. economic collapse rather than a crypto victory. He criticized Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for failing to curb rising debt and deficits. Novogratz voiced concern that Bitcoin treasury adoption is turning into a bubble as more companies rush in. “People who cheer for the million-dollar Bitcoin price next year, I was like, guys, it only gets there if we’re in such a shitty place domestically,” Novogratz told Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast on Wednesday. “I’d rather have a lower Bitcoin price in a more stable United States than the opposite.” Novogratz: Bitcoin Acts as Hedge When Currencies Collapse Novogratz explained that extreme currency devaluations often fuel demand for alternative safe havens, and Bitcoin, often dubbed digital gold, becomes a hedge against economic turmoil. However, he cautioned that such conditions would come at the expense of civil society. His comments echo past warnings from analysts who stress that parabolic price moves often accompany instability. In July 2023, trader Scott Melker, known as Wolf Of All Streets, told Cointelegraph Magazine : “The faster it happens, the worse the world is.” Still, speculation around a $1 million Bitcoin by 2026 continues to swirl. Arthur Hayes, BitMEX founder, has repeatedly predicted BTC could climb between $750,000 and $1 million within two years, and more recently suggested a $250,000 target by the end of this year. Beyond price forecasts, Novogratz also expressed concern over the U.S. fiscal outlook. He criticized Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, appointed under President Donald Trump, for failing to rein in the country’s soaring debt.

The deficit is going to be higher, not lower,” he said. Novogratz also raised alarms about the rapid growth of Bitcoin treasury adoption, noting that Galaxy Digital receives around five calls a week from companies looking to put BTC on their balance sheets. “At one point, that’s what bubbles feel like, when the cab driver asks you about the balance sheet company,” he said. His remarks come as concerns grow that only a handful of corporate Bitcoin treasuries will endure, with venture firm Breed recently warning that many may face a “death spiral” if market conditions sour. Crypto Treasuries Aren’t Really Buying Crypto A growing number of publicly traded companies are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build crypto treasuries, but one analyst says many aren’t actually buying digital assets from the open market . As reported, crypto analyst Ran Neuner claimed that crypto treasury firms are acting less like buyers and more like exit vehicles for crypto insiders. Instead of purchasing assets directly from exchanges, these companies often receive crypto contributions from existing holders, in exchange for shares that later trade at massive premiums on public markets. Skepticism around the sustainability of the crypto treasury trend is also growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms.

He pointed to a key ratio comparing Bitcoin’s value to gold, showing the world’s largest cryptocurrency hovering around 35 ounces of gold per Bitcoin, a level that previously marked the 2021 peak. In an X post on August 16, McGlone cautioned that if Bitcoin fails to hold above this threshold, it may trigger a shift in capital toward U.S. Treasuries as the “next big trade.” “If the first-born crypto in 2009 — now with about 19-million minions — backs down from roughly 35 ounces of the rock on Aug. 15, it may signal T-bonds as the NBT,” he said. He suggested that Bitcoin’s inability to defend the level could cement Treasuries as the preferred haven, with yields potentially sliding toward 1.75%, mirroring a trajectory seen in China. McGlone’s analysis indicated that BTC’s performance relative to both gold and the S&P 500 has surged in recent years but now sits at a crossroads. Bitcoin/Gold ratio chart.

However, the gold threshold appears to be the more decisive marker for long-term positioning. Stalled Bitcoin and gold ratio On August 15, McGlone stated that the stalled Bitcoin-to-gold ratio sits at a key juncture, poised to either catch up with record U.S. stocks or signal a broader risk-asset reversion heading into late 2025.

McGlone suggested a breakout would signal renewed confidence in risk assets, while stagnation could foreshadow pullbacks in equities and crypto. Meanwhile, both Bitcoin and gold have enjoyed an impressive run in 2025. Gold, at one point, targeted an all-time high of $4,000, while Bitcoin recently surged past $124,000, marking a new record. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $118,266, maintaining its position well above the $100,000 level.
