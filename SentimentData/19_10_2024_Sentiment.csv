Over the years, despite the crypto price boom and bust cycle, the platform has operated flawlessly without any technical hitches. Aave User Address Grew By 675% In One Week Since the beginning of the year, Aave has dominated headlines, mostly around its price performance and rising TVL. However, looking at other metrics, the lending platform is performing solidly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $95,000? Here’s What Needs To Happen First According to Santiment, Aave on Optimism is the fastest-growing protocol on their watch among platforms, commanding at least $500 million in TVL. The number of Aave addresses on Optimism grew by 675%, roughly twice that of KuCoin tokens (KCS). At this pace, Aave outperformed Maker–another lending and borrowing protocol on Ethereum, Chainlink on Optimism, and Raydium–a top decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana. Of note, Chainlink on Optimism and Raydium grew over the last week by 100%. The fact that Aave on Optimism grew faster than Raydium, the top DEX on Solana, is a milestone. By default, any meme coin launching on Pumpfun that achieves at least 69 SOL automatically lists on Raydium. Although only a small percentage graduate and are listed on Raydium, tens of thousands of meme coins launch on the meme coin launchpad on Solana. Santiment now thinks AAVE prices may likely benefit from this growth. Pointing to historical performance, the sentiment analytics platform said there is usually a strong correlation between rising utility and consistent growth with long-term gains. According to Dune, there are over 49,800 unique daily users of Aave v3 on Ethereum. Over the last two days, there were 70 new users. While there is growth in the number of cumulative users, as expected, the number of new users remains steady. Will Prices Rise To Fresh 2024 Highs? AAVE is trading above $150, trending at around 2024 highs. Although the token is in an uptrend, prices have moved sideways over the past four weeks. Technically, a close above $180 could drive demand, lifting prices to new 2024 highs in the coming days. Possible drivers include the recovery of DeFi and other project-related factors. As of October 17, 56% of all cbBTC–the Bitcoin stablecoin by Coinbase–was locked in Aave.

Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/100-uptick-for-shiba-inu-experts-eye-global-reversal-as-catalyst/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now priced at about $0.00001783, just below a key resistance zone which means that the market is in a good mood. Market analysts are ready to witness another possible rally in the meme coin space. Related Reading: Market Data Hints At 500x XRP Rally In Upcoming Altcoin Season Crypto influencer Davinci Jeremie noted that during the last bull cycle, Dogecoin (DOGE) reached a market cap of $88.8 billion, while SHIB peaked at $40 billion. The bull run will take the market cap of meme coins to a trillion dollars. Last cycle we saw $DOGE coin hit $88.8 billion market cap & $SHIB hit $40 billion. I think we’ll see memes as an asset class hit close to $1 trillion market cap this cycle — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) October 17, 2024 Currently, the market capitalization of meme coins has surged to $58 billion, although still behind other up-and-coming crypto sectors such as AI-based tokens and real-world asset cryptos, but still a solid amount nonetheless. On the bullish side, investors would have a pretty good chance of significant profits upon its break from resistance levels into $0.000028, with the current momentum at their side, there is hope that the rest of the meme coins might also witness good performance, too. The Current Status Of Meme Coins It might have ended its global trend reversal and gone off a prior downtrend but do not count it out yet since during the late parts of September 2024, SHIB saw a huge spike as it recorded an all-time high at $0.00002135. This peak successfully broke two strong resistance levels which can only mean good for the coin and other meme coins. From the technical analysis from PS Trade, there is a high resistance point that is at $0.00002052 where around 83.75 trillion tokens are kept at this price level. $SHIB Although the price of #SHIBUSDT is still not rising very confidently on the 3-day timeframe, the global downward trend reversal structure is complete. Therefore, our target for this cryptocurrency is 100% growth. pic.twitter.com/DhOcxx3j1T — PS trade (@PStrade2) October 16, 2024 PS Trade said the global downward trend reversal structure is complete even if the price of SHIBUSDT is still not increasing very strongly on the three-day period. For this coin, he said their aim is therefore 100% increase. It was found that by the end of September, a double local top had been formed in two successive days above its high made in the middle of July. However, the strongest resistance band lies between $0.000018 and $0.000020 since 439.16 trillion tokens are dispersed across 45,620 wallets. If the bullish trend of SHIB continues, then it might test the next major hurdle at $0.000028. Related Reading: Analysts On Bitcoin: 2024 US Election Could Steer The Crypto’s Future Shiba Inu: Technical Indicators And Market Challenges Large-position institutional investors pushed SHIB back below $0.000018. As the CMF is still negative at – 0.22, this presents selling pressure from the large holders. Meanwhile, the StochRSI has revealed that SHIB was already entering into an overbought position due to its values oscillating between 71 and 57. That makes it important that the oscillators and charts begin to show signs of short-term volatility and further corrections if the selling pressure continues. However, given the strong bullish setup, a further rally is quite possible. Investors need to keep an eye on key resistance levels as well as technical indicators for further movements in SHIB.

34868138,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648745,1729299602,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Survey Finds Almost 70% Of Ethereum Institutional Investors Engaged In ETH Staking,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/survey-finds-almost-70-of-ethereum-institutional-investors-engaged-in-eth-staking/,"Almost 70% of institutional investors in Ethereum (ETH) are participating in ETH staking, with 60.6% of them using third-party staking platforms. Ethereum Staking Landscape At A Glance According to a report by Blockworks Research, 69.2% of institutional investors holding Ethereum are engaged in staking the platform’s native ETH token. Of these, 78.8% are investment firms and asset managers. Related Reading: Ethereum Inflation Surge Casts Doubt On “Ultrasound Money” Claim: Report Notably, slightly more than one out of five institutional investors – or 22.6% – of the respondents said that ETH or an ETH-based liquid staking token (LST) constitutes more than 60% of their total portfolio allocation. The report notes a seismic transformation in the Ethereum staking landscape since the network transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism during the Merge upgrade. At present, there are close to 1.1 million on-chain validators staking 34.8 million ETH on the network. Following the Merge, Ethereum network participants were allowed to withdraw their ETH only after the Shapella upgrade in April 2023. After the initial phase of ETH withdrawals, the network has seen steady inflows, indicating strong demand for ETH staking. At present, 28.9% of the total ETH supply is staked, making it the network with the highest dollar value of staked assets, valued at over $115 billion. It’s worth noting that the annualized yield from staking ETH is around 3%. As more ETH is staked, the yield decreases proportionally. However, network validators can also earn additional ETH through priority transaction fees during periods of high network activity. Third-Party Staking Overshadows Solo Staking Anyone can participate in ETH staking, either as a solo staker or by delegating their ETH to a third-party staking platform. While solo staking gives the staker full control over their ETH, it comes with a high entry barrier of staking at least 32 ETH – worth more than $83,000 at current market price of $2,616. Conversely, holders can stake with as little as 0.1 ETH through third-party stakers but must give up on some degree of control over their assets. Recently, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stressed the need to lower entry requirements for ETH solo stakers to ensure greater network decentralization. Currently, about 18.7% of stakers are solo stakers. However, the trend shows that solo staking is losing popularity due to the high entry threshold and the inefficiency of locked capital. The report explains: Once locked in staking, ETH can no longer be used for other financial activities throughout the DeFi ecosystem. This means that one can no longer provide liquidity to a variety of DeFi primitives, or collateralize one’s ETH to take out loans against it. This presents an opportunity cost for solo stakers, who must also account for the dynamic network reward rates of staked ETH to ensure they are maximizing their risk-adjusted yield potential. As a result, third-party staking solutions are becoming more popular among ETH stakers. However, such platforms – dominated by centralized exchanges and liquid staking protocols – raise concerns about network centralization. Close to 48.6% of ETH stakers leveraging third-party staking platforms are using just one integrated platform such as Coinbase, Binance, Kiln, and others. The report highlights key factors driving institutional investors to use third-party platforms, including platform reputation, supported networks, pricing, ease of onboarding, competitive costs, and platform expertise.

Although the Ethereum staking ecosystem is evolving, this growth has not yet been reflected in ETH’s price. ETH has significantly underperformed against BTC for an extended period, only recently gaining traction after the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut interest rates. Nonetheless, some crypto research firms remain optimistic about ETH’s potential comeback against BTC later this year. As of press time, ETH is trading at $2,616, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

According to a renowned crypto analyst Javon Marks, based on the historical chart pattern, the memecoin may be on the brink of another parabolic run, similar to the explosive rallies witnessed in the past. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Sharp Decline: Over 106,000 Wallets Abandon The Memecoin Why An Over 400% Rally Is Plausible For Dogecoin Based on historical patterns, Marks revealed that Dogecoin may be in the early stages of a significant bull run, potentially heading toward a 431% price increase. Marks highlighted that Dogecoin could quickly reclaim its all-time high of $0.73905, supported by similar price behaviors seen in the past. This revelation was particularly made in a post on X accompanied with a historical price chart of DOGE whereby DOGE is showing a pattern known as the “falling wedge.” This technical formation occurs when the price of an asset consolidates between two downward-sloping trendlines before eventually breaking out. In Dogecoin’s case, Marks observed that DOGE had recently formed this falling wedge pattern and subsequently broken out to the upside. Historically, such breakouts have led to substantial rallies in Dogecoin’s price. Based on this breakout, Marks predicts a significant surge, potentially over 400%, as long as DOGE maintains its momentum. DOGE Recent Price Performance And Outlook Over the past few weeks, Dogecoin has shown gains, aligning with the bullish outlook shared by analysts. In the last 7 days alone, DOGE has surged by 23%, reaching a high of $0.135 in the early hours of today. This performance is notable, as Dogecoin has maintained its upward momentum despite fluctuations in the broader cryptocurrency market. When writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1333, representing a 9.5% increase in the past 24 hours. In addition to Javon Marks’ analysis, another prominent figure in the crypto space, Trader Tardigrade, has also weighed in on Dogecoin’s recent market structure. In a post on X, Tardigrade noted that Dogecoin has transitioned from a downtrend to an uptrend.

According to a recent CryptoQuant analysis, a key metric, “active address momentum,” paints a bullish picture for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bull Rally Hinges On $57K Support Level—Here’s Why It Matters Active Address Momentum Signals Upward Market Structure Active addresses represent the number of unique addresses conducting transactions on the Bitcoin network, providing insights into network activity and investor engagement. By applying a 30-day moving average (30DMA) and a 365-day moving average (365DMA) to this indicator, the CryptoQuant analyst could assess the network’s growing momentum. The analyst emphasized that the 30DMA has sharply risen recently and is closing in on the 365DMA. If a “golden cross” occurs, where the 30DMA surpasses the 365DMA, it could signal a further bullish trend for Bitcoin, dent reveals. The CryptoQuant analyst added that Bitcoin has seen high transaction volumes since the second half of the year, supporting increased network activity. While the current upward momentum is encouraging, the analyst also warned of potential volatility due to a “rising wedge” formation in Bitcoin’s price chart—a pattern that could lead to significant price swings if the wedge continues to tighten. Bitcoin Rally To $90,000 In Sight? Bitcoin’s recent price performance has added to the optimism among investors. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has surged by over 10%, and it has continued its upward trajectory, rising by an additional 1.98% in the past 24 hours to trade at $68,708 at the time of writing. This upward movement has helped Bitcoin break through a major resistance zone on its daily chart, sparking predictions of even higher prices. One notable prediction came from crypto analyst Javon Marks, who recently shared his outlook on X. Marks highlighted that Bitcoin has broken out of a “descending broadening wedge” pattern. Statistically, this pattern suggests that when the resisting line is broken, the price objective is reached in 81% of cases. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Move Imminent: 7 Key Reasons Behind The Bullish Outlook In Bitcoin’s case, Marks believes that this breakout could push the price of Bitcoin to a range between $90,000 and even more than $96,000. #Bitcoin (BTC) is now broken out of the displayed ‘descending broadening wedge’ pattern and statistics from this type of pattern states that in 81% of cases, the pattern’s price objective is reached when the resisting line is broken.

Here’s why this could be bad for Bitcoin, according to history. Dogecoin Has Registered A 9% Jump During Last 24 Hours While most of the cryptocurrency market has seen sideways price action during the past day, Dogecoin has shown to be different as its value has witnessed a notable increase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders In Profit Hits 95%: Is BTC Overheating? The below chart shows the trend in DOGE’s price over the past month. From the graph, it’s visible that the Dogecoin price has claimed the $0.134 mark with this rally and has surpassed the high from last month. The memecoin is now close to the July top, so if this run continues, the memecoin can potentially have a go at it as well. In terms of the weekly returns, the latest jump has meant that DOGE is now up more than 24%, which has made it the best performer among the top 50 coins by market cap. Dogecoin isn’t the only memecoin that has been rallying; the asset’s cousin Shiba Inu (SHIB) has also enjoyed bullish momentum during the past day, although its jump of 5% is less impressive than DOGE’s. This latest focus on meme coins may not be the best sign for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole. Market Topped Out The Last Time Memecoins Got The Attention According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, the Social Dominance of the memecoins had spiked during the recent Bitcoin top above the $68,000 level. The “Social Dominance” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage of the discussions related to the top 100 coins on social media that a given coin or group of assets is occupying right now. Here is a chart that shows how the Social Dominance of the top 6 layer 1 assets has compared with that of the top 6 meme coins recently: As displayed in the above graph, the Social Dominance of the memecoins had shot up earlier as Bitcoin and others had rallied, suggesting that investors had started paying attention to these speculative assets. This interest in the meme coins, though, ended up coinciding with the market top. “Typically, markets correct when focus shifts away from layer 1’s and toward more speculative assets due to greed,” explains the analytics firm. With Dogecoin and Shiba Inu pulling away from the pack during the past day, it seems the investor greed is still high, which can potentially lead to more bearish action for Bitcoin and other top assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Transfers See Massive Spike: Sign Of Profit-Taking? From the chart, it’s visible that the market has tended to reach bottoms when attention has shifted back to the layer 1 networks, so it’s possible that this may have to happen again if the sector-wide run has to continue.

After reaching its latest ATH of $1.56 a week ago, the cryptocurrency has been on a 7-day downtrend. The memecoin unsuccessfully attempted to break above the trendline earlier this week, facing a correction toward the $1.2 support level. Popcat bounced 16.6% from this zone on Thursday, propelling the token’s surge toward the $1.3 resistance level. On the last day, the cryptocurrency retested the trendline twice after surpassing the $1.4 mark. A successful reclaim of this zone could propel the price toward a new ATH. A market watcher considers that if Bitcoin’s price holds, Popcat should successfully break this level by next week. It’s worth noting that the cat-themed token followed BTC’s lead on Friday morning, surging 2.4% as the flagship cryptocurrency neared the $69,000 mark. Is A Correction Looming? Crypto analyst Sanchez noted that the memecoin’s price was “running flat” in the four-chart on Friday morning. To the analyst, the cat-themed token’s performance “looked good” for another leg up but suggested the possibility of another correction ahead of the breakout. Ideally, we get a good reaction around ~1.29 to make the C more complete, and the cat starts popping again A drop from the $1.3 mark could send Popcat’s price toward the $1.1-$1.0 mark. Trader Crypto Tony suggested that the cryptocurrency could see a retest of the monthly opening of around $1.01 in case of a rejection. Despite the correction forecast, the memecoin has seen a 7% increase in the last 24 hours, trading 8.7% below its ATH. Popcat reclaimed the $1.3 mark and is attempting to confirm the breakout and regain the $1.4 resistance level.

Analyst CryptoGodJohn stated that the cryptocurrency “looks like it wants new ATHs and beyond this weekend” following its recent performance. Additionally, crypto trader Bluntz noted that Popcat’s price could achieve a 30% surge toward a new all-time high. To Bluntz, a rise toward the $1.7 mark might be coming short-term after “getting real close to a biddable level” this week, but “would like to see one more sweep.” As of this writing, Popcat trades at $1.41, an 8.3% surge in the weekly timeframe.

Meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have also enjoyed a fair share of the attention in the last seven days. According to the latest on-chain data, these asset classes have been topping the social charts in the past few days, with the majority of the crypto crowd talking about them, especially after price rallies. Here’s how the rising social sentiment can impact the prices of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Will FOMO Sustain The Meme Coin Rally? In a recent post on the X platform, Santiment shared that large-cap meme tokens have been drawing a great deal of social media attention in the past few days. According to the blockchain analytics firm, top meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are seeing their most crowd discussion since May. Related Reading: Aave Address Count On Optimism Rapidly Growing, Will Price Rise To New 13-Month High? This on-chain observation is based on the Santiment Social Dominance metric, which reflects the share of the discussions in crypto media referring to a particular asset or phrase. Santiment said in the post on X: Top meme coins (DOGE, SHIB, etc.) [are] seeing [their] most crowd discussion since May (crowd FOMO may soon cause top). Indeed, this positive shift in investor sentiment might signal renewed faith in the meme coin market. However, the increasing crowd hype is often a warning sign of a potential price top, as rising FOMO (fear of missing out) can dampen the momentum of developing price rallies. Fear of missing out, commonly called FOMO, is a phenomenon where investors hastily purchase assets in high demand out of fear of forfeiting potential gains. While FOMO has been known to drive a coin to a higher value in the short term, excessive FOMO often leads to unsustainable upward trends and subsequent corrections. Furthermore, crypto prices historically tend to move in the opposite direction of the crowd. Hence, if the crypto crowd is paying this much attention to top meme coins, investors might want to approach the market with caution. Interestingly, Santiment pinpointed top Layer 2 tokens, including Arbitrum and Optimism, as potentially lucrative investment alternatives due to their extremely low social dominance. “Speculative coins can certainly still pump a bit longer, but historical data shows that it pays to go where the crowd isn’t looking,” the on-chain firm added. Dogecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Dogecoin has broken above the $0.14 level, reflecting an almost 6% increase in the past day.

This projection comes amidst a staggering performance by these Bitcoin ETFs in the past few days where they have attracted over $2 billion in weekly netflows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaking Out Of 7-Month Accumulation Channel: Expert Predicts Further Upside Spot Bitcoin ETFs To Surpass Gold ETF In 2 Years, Analyst Says The spot Bitcoin ETFs rattled the global financial markets this week recording net inflows of $2.13 billion according to data from SoSoValue. This massive influx of investments occurred as Bitcoin surged by 9.23%, approaching a critical resistance zone at the $70,000 price mark. Amidst this market euphoria, Nate Geraci has predicted the spot Bitcoin ETFs to record a higher cumulative total netflows than the Gold ETFs in the next two years. This forecast is largely unsurprising considering the exponential growth of these Bitcoin ETFs since their launch on January 11. For context, the Gold ETFs currently boast of combined net inflows of around $55 billion in comparison to $20.66 billion aggregate net inflows in the spot Bitcoin ETFs market. However, the Bitcoin ETFs have been trading for barely a year compared to the Gold ETFs which have been around for over 20 years. Furthermore, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas recently highlighted that spot Bitcoin ETFs have amassed over $65 billion in total net assets, a milestone that took Gold ETFs nearly five years to achieve. This figure is also over 25% of the total assets under management in the global Gold ETF market. In addition, Geraci’s theory is further strengthened by the few 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs currently trading compared to the almost 5000 Gold ETFs on the global financial market. Therefore, these Bitcoin ETFs may actually be poised to overtake their Gold counterparts, especially considering the upcoming crypto market bull run and current adoption levels of digital assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $95,000? Here’s What Needs To Happen First Bitcoin Set For Price Recorrection Amidst Market Surge In other news, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared that Bitcoin may soon experience a “short-term dip” following its recent price rally. As earlier stated, the crypto market leader gained by over 8% moving from around $63,000 to nearly breaking above $69,000. While the BTC market is currently bullish, Martinez states that the TD sequential is currently indicating a sell signal on the 4-hour chart which is strengthened by a bearish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). If Bitcoin’s price were to decline, investors would turn their attention to the $60,000 price zone at which lies its next support level. Albeit a strong selling pressure may cause the premier cryptocurrency to trade as low as $55,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $68,428 with a 0.98% gain in the last day.

This Golden Cross Suggests So,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/can-bitcoin-price-reach-a-new-all-time-high-golden-cross/,"The Bitcoin price and the bull run appear to be back on the right track after recording its best weekly performance in the past month. Despite starting the week quietly and hovering around the $63,000 level, the premier cryptocurrency received fresh bullish momentum mid-week, pushing its value to almost $69,000 on Friday. The latest on-chain observation has revealed that the activity level of the Bitcoin network has been on the rise over the past few weeks. While this development might have contributed to the recent price surge, the question is — how far can it push the value of the flagship cryptocurrency? Golden Cross Could Push Bitcoin Price Past $73,737 In a recent Quicktake post on the CrypoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Yonsei_dent revealed that Bitcoin price might be forming an upward structure. This bullish prognosis is based on the growth rate of active addresses, which represents the number of unique addresses showing significant activity on the Bitcoin network. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs See $1.6B Inflows This Week – Is BTC Reaching A New ATH Soon? An increase in the number of these active addresses offers insight into the network activity, investor behavior or sentiment, and general market trends. Hence, observing the growth momentum of these unique addresses using moving averages (MAs) of various timelines can be quite useful in assessing current price trends. In their latest analysis, the CryptoQuant analyst utilized a 30-day moving average (30DMA) and a 365-day moving average (365DMA) to capture the growth momentum of the Bitcoin active addresses. As shown in the chart below, the 30-day moving average has witnessed a sharp spike over the past month and appears to be approaching the 365DMA. According to Yonsei_dent, the Bitcoin price could experience a positive shift in bullish momentum if the 30DMA eventually reaches the 365DMA and crosses it to the upside (making a golden cross.) In crypto terms, a golden cross refers to a bullish chart that is characterized by a relatively short-term moving average crossing above a long-term moving average. Typically, a golden cross indicates the potential of a long-term bull market starting or resuming. Ultimately, this indicates that the price of Bitcoin could be readying for a charge towards its all-time high of $73,737. ‘Bitcoin Is Establishing An Upward Structure’ — Here’s How As of this writing, the Bitcoin price is about 7% adrift of its record-high level. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at $68,540, reflecting an over 2% increase in the past day. According to Yonsei_dent, the price of Bitcoin has been forming progressively increasing highs and lows since July, suggesting an “upward market structure.” Related Reading: BTC Held On Exchanges Hits Lowest Point In 5 Five Years, Here’s What It Means For Bitcoin Price However, It is worth noting that these highs and lows appear to be printing a “rising wedge” pattern, which could be bearish for the Bitcoin price.

In this context, net flow measures the difference between the amount of ETH deposited and the amount of ETH withdrawn from derivative exchanges, which are standard trading platforms for products such as options and futures contracts. Therefore, a positive net flow indicates a higher amount of ETH has been deposited than withdrawn on the last day. Analyzing the implications of this development on Ethereum’s price, Amr Taha has postulated two situations. First, the analyst states that a positive net flow to derivative exchanges could indicate a potential rise in selling pressure as traders may be looking to offload their ETH either by opening a short position or selling through a futures contract at a predetermined price. Alternatively, a positive net flow may indicate that traders are depositing ETH to use as collateral for margin or future contracts betting that the price of ETH will rise, thus expressing confidence in the token’s profitability. Essentially, this massive positive ETH net flow holds significant potential to swing Ethereum’s price either way based on traders’ actions.

Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 12.89% and is valued at $17.06 billion. However, despite these positive metrics, data from CoinMarketCap shows that market sentiment towards the altcoin is largely bearish as investors perhaps anticipate a price retracement following the ETH’s recent gain in the last week. Interestingly, the Ethereum daily chart shows the token is approaching a key resistance level at $2,700 which has served as a strong rejection zone over the last two months. Albeit, the relative strength Index is still some significant distance away from the overbought zone indicating Ethereum’s price rally may be far from over and may break past this resistance level. In addition, analysts have observed an ascending triangle pattern on the ETH hourly chart indicating strong bullish potential to surge past $2,700 reaching as high as $2,870 in the coming days.

As the market continues to push higher, most analysts and investors are anticipating a potential surge for SOL, especially with the $160 resistance level appearing to weaken under recent upward pressure. The crypto community is closely watching these developments, as breaking through this key resistance could lead to substantial gains for the altcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs See $1.6B Inflows This Week – Is BTC Reaching A New ATH Soon? Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis that paints an optimistic picture for Solana’s price action in the next few hours. According to Runefelt, the weakening resistance could pave the way for a breakout, with bullish momentum carrying SOL to higher targets. While the market remains volatile, confidence in Solana’s ability to overcome current challenges is growing. If the supply level is breached, it could mark the start of a new upward trend, making SOL a focal point for traders looking for opportunities in the current market landscape. The next few days will be critical in shaping Solana’s trajectory, as investors will closely monitor whether the price will confirm the anticipated rally. Solana Bullish Pattern Signals Momentum The entire crypto market is experiencing heightened volatility, and Solana has not been immune to it, with its price fluctuating between $148 and $160 since Monday. This consolidation phase has left traders eager to see which direction the altcoin will take in the coming days. Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that Solana is breaking out of a 1-hour Falling Wedge pattern, a bullish signal. The immediate upside target is $159.6, a level that, if broken and sustained, could lead to a massive surge toward $185—a significant move that would position Solana near its yearly highs. Despite this bullish setup, the market remains cautious, and there is still the risk that Solana could fail to reclaim key levels. If the price struggles to break and hold above the $159.6 resistance, the current consolidation could persist or even lead to a potential pullback, with downside targets near $148. Such a scenario would disappoint bulls looking for a rally and could dampen market sentiment temporarily. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Pattern Signals Upcoming Rally – Analyst Sets $2,870 Target A confirmed breakout and sustained momentum could signal the beginning of a new bullish phase, attracting both retail and institutional investors. However, the risk of a failed breakout looms, keeping market participants on edge. Traders are watching closely as Solana’s next move will likely set the tone for its performance over the next few weeks. If it breaks through resistance, SOL could be well on its way to challenging yearly highs. Technical Levels To Watch Solana is currently trading at $154 after finding support at the 200-day moving average (MA) at $150.7, a critical level that signals long-term strength if it holds as a demand zone. This MA has historically acted as a key indicator for market trends, and holding above it would reinforce the bullish outlook for SOL. For bulls to maintain momentum, the price must stay above the 200-day MA and push to break the crucial $160 resistance, a level that has capped Solana’s upward movement since early August. Breaking through this resistance would signal a potential surge in price, opening the door to further gains in the coming weeks. However, if SOL fails to hold above the 200-day MA and cannot overcome the $160 resistance, it risks a corrective move. A drop below the 1D 200 MA could lead to a decline toward $140, a level that will play a pivotal role in determining the next phase of Solana’s price action.
