Over the years, despite the crypto price boom and bust cycle, the platform has operated flawlessly without any technical hitches. Aave User Address Grew By 675% In One Week Since the beginning of the year, Aave has dominated headlines, mostly around its price performance and rising TVL. However, looking at other metrics, the lending platform is performing solidly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $95,000? Here’s What Needs To Happen First According to Santiment, Aave on Optimism is the fastest-growing protocol on their watch among platforms, commanding at least $500 million in TVL. The number of Aave addresses on Optimism grew by 675%, roughly twice that of KuCoin tokens (KCS). At this pace, Aave outperformed Maker–another lending and borrowing protocol on Ethereum, Chainlink on Optimism, and Raydium–a top decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana. Of note, Chainlink on Optimism and Raydium grew over the last week by 100%. The fact that Aave on Optimism grew faster than Raydium, the top DEX on Solana, is a milestone. By default, any meme coin launching on Pumpfun that achieves at least 69 SOL automatically lists on Raydium. Although only a small percentage graduate and are listed on Raydium, tens of thousands of meme coins launch on the meme coin launchpad on Solana. Santiment now thinks AAVE prices may likely benefit from this growth. Pointing to historical performance, the sentiment analytics platform said there is usually a strong correlation between rising utility and consistent growth with long-term gains. According to Dune, there are over 49,800 unique daily users of Aave v3 on Ethereum. Over the last two days, there were 70 new users. While there is growth in the number of cumulative users, as expected, the number of new users remains steady. Will Prices Rise To Fresh 2024 Highs? AAVE is trading above $150, trending at around 2024 highs. Although the token is in an uptrend, prices have moved sideways over the past four weeks. Technically, a close above $180 could drive demand, lifting prices to new 2024 highs in the coming days. Possible drivers include the recovery of DeFi and other project-related factors. As of October 17, 56% of all cbBTC–the Bitcoin stablecoin by Coinbase–was locked in Aave.

Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/100-uptick-for-shiba-inu-experts-eye-global-reversal-as-catalyst/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now priced at about $0.00001783, just below a key resistance zone which means that the market is in a good mood. Market analysts are ready to witness another possible rally in the meme coin space. Related Reading: Market Data Hints At 500x XRP Rally In Upcoming Altcoin Season Crypto influencer Davinci Jeremie noted that during the last bull cycle, Dogecoin (DOGE) reached a market cap of $88.8 billion, while SHIB peaked at $40 billion.

I think we’ll see memes as an asset class hit close to $1 trillion market cap this cycle — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) October 17, 2024 Currently, the market capitalization of meme coins has surged to $58 billion, although still behind other up-and-coming crypto sectors such as AI-based tokens and real-world asset cryptos, but still a solid amount nonetheless. On the bullish side, investors would have a pretty good chance of significant profits upon its break from resistance levels into $0.000028, with the current momentum at their side, there is hope that the rest of the meme coins might also witness good performance, too. The Current Status Of Meme Coins It might have ended its global trend reversal and gone off a prior downtrend but do not count it out yet since during the late parts of September 2024, SHIB saw a huge spike as it recorded an all-time high at $0.00002135. This peak successfully broke two strong resistance levels which can only mean good for the coin and other meme coins. From the technical analysis from PS Trade, there is a high resistance point that is at $0.00002052 where around 83.75 trillion tokens are kept at this price level. $SHIB Although the price of #SHIBUSDT is still not rising very confidently on the 3-day timeframe, the global downward trend reversal structure is complete. Therefore, our target for this cryptocurrency is 100% growth. pic.twitter.com/DhOcxx3j1T — PS trade (@PStrade2) October 16, 2024 PS Trade said the global downward trend reversal structure is complete even if the price of SHIBUSDT is still not increasing very strongly on the three-day period. For this coin, he said their aim is therefore 100% increase. It was found that by the end of September, a double local top had been formed in two successive days above its high made in the middle of July. However, the strongest resistance band lies between $0.000018 and $0.000020 since 439.16 trillion tokens are dispersed across 45,620 wallets. If the bullish trend of SHIB continues, then it might test the next major hurdle at $0.000028. Related Reading: Analysts On Bitcoin: 2024 US Election Could Steer The Crypto’s Future Shiba Inu: Technical Indicators And Market Challenges Large-position institutional investors pushed SHIB back below $0.000018. As the CMF is still negative at – 0.22, this presents selling pressure from the large holders. Meanwhile, the StochRSI has revealed that SHIB was already entering into an overbought position due to its values oscillating between 71 and 57. That makes it important that the oscillators and charts begin to show signs of short-term volatility and further corrections if the selling pressure continues. However, given the strong bullish setup, a further rally is quite possible. Investors need to keep an eye on key resistance levels as well as technical indicators for further movements in SHIB.
