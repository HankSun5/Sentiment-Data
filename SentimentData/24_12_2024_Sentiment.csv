Table of Contents Cardano and Toncoin: A decline in investor confidence Why Lightchain AI shines Future outlook Cardano (ADA) and Toncoin (TON) are seeing their momentum slow as Lightchain AI (LCAI) emerges as a more promising opportunity in the market. Currently priced at just $0.003 in its presale phase, Lightchain AI is drawing attention for its potential to transform decentralized applications (dApps) and governance. Cardano and Toncoin: A decline in investor confidence Cardano and Toncoin have been seen as good blockchain plans, but new market signs show a drop in trust from investors. Cardano‚Äôs growth speed, though bold, often gets bad remarks for holdups in adding important parts, making some wonder if it can stay up with quicker changing systems. Likewise, Toncoin, with its special blockchain setup tied to the Telegram world, has a hard time keeping up due to few userÕès outside its small group. These issues have made investors skeptical, especially in a market where new projects give better chances for growth. Lightchain AI, for example, has changed its aim by offering a new AI-blockchain mix during its presale phase, pulling in investors looking for fresh ideas and gain. As such, ADA and TON are falling back to smart projects like LCAI. You might also like: Dogecoin targets $2 but Lightchain AI could be the winner with $10 and a 30,000x return Why Lightchain AI shines Lightchain AI distinguishes itself from Cardano and Toncoin through its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Central to Lightchain AI‚Äôs architecture are the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. The AIVM is designed to optimize the execution of AI-specific tasks, enabling efficient and scalable dApps. Lightchain AI‚Äôs tokenomics are structured to ensure sustainability and equitable distribution. The total supply of LCAI tokens is capped at 10 billion, with 40% allocated for presale, 30% for ecosystem development, 20% for team and advisors, and 10% reserved for future partnerships and strategic initiatives. This allocation strategy aims to foster long-term value for ecosystem participants. Moreover, the roadmap for Lightchain AI is ambitious, focusing on the seamless integration of AI and blockchain to address challenges such as scalability, privacy, and trust. Key milestones include the development and deployment of the AIVM, implementation of the PoI consensus mechanism, and the launch of a suite of AI-driven dApps. LCAI‚Äôs presale phase is priced low at just $0.003 per token, offering investors an opportunity to buy into a potentially disruptive technology at an early stage and reap exponential returns. With limited tokens available during this phase, investors are scrambling to secure their piece of the future through LCAI. Future outlook The Lightchain AI presale has drawn significant attention from blockchain enthusiasts and investors who see its potential to transform the industry. With its future-oriented approach to integrating AI and blockchain, LCAI is positioned to lead the next wave of disruptive technologies. As Cardano and Toncoin experience a slowdown in investor confidence, LCAI‚Äôs momentum continues to build, making it the choice for those seeking growth and transformative technology in their blockchain investments.

A publication from the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Structured Finance sheds light on major global banks collaborating with Ripple to create a potential alternative to SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. The financial institutions mentioned‚ÄîBank of America, Santander, UniCredit, Standard Chartered, Westpac Banking Corporation, and Royal Bank of Canada‚Äîrepresent a substantial segment of the global banking industry. Their collaboration with Ripple underscores a pivotal shift in how financial transactions might be conducted, moving towards the adoption of blockchain technology for cross-border payments.

Blockchain‚Äôs ability to process secure and bilateral transactions in near real-time offers a significant advantage over legacy systems, which can be slow, expensive, and prone to error. Using distributed ledger technology, Ripple aims to simplify and accelerate global money movement while reducing associated costs. Traditionally, SWIFT has dominated the cross-border payments space, serving as the backbone for international transactions. However, its reliance on multiple intermediaries often results in delays and increased transaction fees. Through innovative blockchain solutions, Ripple promises instant settlements with reduced costs and a robust audit trail, making it a formidable alternative to SWIFT. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The participation of major banks in this initiative reflects growing confidence in blockchain‚Äôs potential to transform global financial systems. Ripple‚Äôs established network, RippleNet, allows financial institutions to connect seamlessly, facilitating secure and efficient international transactions. The Future of Cross-Border Payments The collaboration signifies a notable moment for blockchain adoption in traditional banking. By leveraging Ripple‚Äôs technology, these banks aim to reduce the capital tied up in the global trade settlement system and enhance the speed and reliability of their services. This move aligns with a broader industry trend of adopting blockchain to improve transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions. While the details of this collaboration are still emerging, the implications for the broader financial ecosystem are profound. If Ripple‚Äôs solutions prove successful, they could disrupt SWIFT‚Äôs longstanding dominance, paving the way for a new era in international finance.

According to a scoop shared by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the Helio deal is worth about $150 million. If successful, this will mark the largest acquisition made by the Miami-based firm since its inception. Moonpay and Helio as the Power Duo While much detail has not emerged regarding the terms of the deal, many in the ecosystem are already weighing the potential. Notably, Helio will enable Moonpay to compete directly with Coinbase Commerce as a self-service crypto payments outfit. Helio enables content creators and ecommerce merchants to get paid for their products and services using crypto. Among the available products includes Solana Pay, the payments engine powering the DexScreener platform. As Terrett highlighted, the Solana Pay outfit is also integrated into Shopify.

It currently powers a lot of crypto payments services with an extensive partnerships record. As reported by Coingape in October, it landed a Venmo partnership to enable crypto access to 60 million users worldwide. With crypto adoption growing, the need for more merchant integrations have grown considerably. Moonpay is among the infrastructure firms benefitting from these growth and Helio might help amplify this. Growing Corporate Investments in Crypto Since the victory of Donald Trump as president-elect last month, the corporate alignment has increased. Suddenly, companies are beginning to revamp their investment strategies in a bid to benefit from the potential incoming pro-crypto administration. From Justin Sun investing $30 million into World Liberty Financial to Tether‚Äôs latest $775 million investment in Rumble, firms are largely diversifying their portfolios. While M&A activities beyond the potential Moonpay deal might appear too formal, the presence of Bitcoin and Ethereum-based ETF products is removing entry barriers for firms. BlackRock invests in IBIT , setting a precedent for state pension funds to also join the trend. Asset management firms are doubling down on other crypto ETF products to grant firms more access to gain exposure to the crypto industry.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

Early investors reaped significant profits, and a passionate community rallied around the project. PEPE‚Äôs roadmap outlines ambitions for major exchange listings and a meme takeover. While its future performance remains uncertain, for those drawn to the high-risk, high-reward nature of meme coins, PEPE presents an intriguing option in the current market landscape. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has forged its own path. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, tapping into its vast ecosystem. SHIB‚Äôs integration with Ethereum opens doors to various applications. One example is ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange for trading tokens. Plans for an NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system could give SHIB more utility. In the current market, SHIB stands out for its unique features and strong community. While meme coins are known for volatility, SHIB‚Äôs utility might make it more appealing. As the crypto market evolves, SHIB could be one to watch for those interested in memes with real-world use.

Despite this, Japan-based Metaplanet has reaffirmed its confidence by buying nearly 620 BTC. Interestingly, the latest acquisition marks its largest Bitcoin purchase to date. Metaplanet‚Äôs Largest Single BTC Acquisition According to the company‚Äôs official press release , the acquisition, executed as part of its Bitcoin Treasury Operations, involved the purchase of 619.7 BTC, worth around $60.6 million. This latest transaction brings Metaplanet‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to 1,761.98 BTC, which is valued at almost $168 million. Over the past six months, Metaplanet has leveraged multiple capital market activities, including stock rights issuances and zero-coupon bonds, to fund its Bitcoin purchases.

William Shane Garrow ‚Äì who was senior vice president and a private banker at BOK until being fired early this year ‚Äì is accused of embezzling $4,277,227 from at least 16 customer accounts and funneling the funds to himself, FOX23 reports . Garrow, who was hired in 2007, allegedly began committing the crimes on September 9, 2012, and continued all the way to April 10, 2024. He‚Äôs accused of draining cash from customer accounts without them knowing and transferring the funds to accounts that he controlled at other financial institutions. He‚Äôs also alleged to have written false cashier checks from client accounts and made them payable to himself. If a client noticed discrepancies, Garrow simply told them there was some sort of error, and that BOK would correct it. Says an affidavit seen by FOX23, ‚Äú[Garrow] knowingly executed, and attempted to execute, a scheme‚Ä¶to defraud a financial institution, and to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, and other property owned by‚Ä¶a financial institution.‚Äù Garrow is facing one count of bank fraud along with a separate count of willfully making and subscribing a false federal income tax return. In a statement to the media, BOK said it is cooperating with law enforcement. ‚ÄúShane Garrow‚Äôs employment was terminated earlier this year upon the discovery that he had breached company policy. We have conducted a thorough internal investigation and worked with law enforcement on their investigation.

Between December 16 and 22, MicroStrategy acquired 5,262 BTC, investing approximately $561 million, the company announced on December 23. The firm purchased Bitcoin at an average price of roughly $106,662 per BTC, marking the highest cost it has ever paid for the cryptocurrency. As of December 22, 2024, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries held a total of 444,262 BTC, acquired for a cumulative $27.7 billion at an average price of $62,257 per BTC. The latest purchase is part of a December buying spree, during which the company accumulated 42,162 BTC now valued at $4 billion. However, the latest acquisition accounts for only about 12% of the company‚Äôs total December purchases and represents the smallest amount of BTC bought since mid-2024, when it acquired 169 BTC. MicroStrategy‚Äôs latest Bitcoin purchase is 191% smaller than the acquisition announced on December 16 and 309% smaller than the one disclosed on December 9. The slowdown in BTC buying coincides with concerns raised by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes about a potential market drop tied to the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Hayes‚Äô fund, Maelstrom, plans to clear some positions and re-enter the market later at lower prices. Additionally, rumors suggest MicroStrategy may enter a blackout period in January 2025, halting its issuance of shares and convertible bonds to fund further Bitcoin purchases.

The new sports event trading product allows users to bet on events like the National Football League‚Äôs Super Bowl. Before this time, not much was heard of the prediction market. During the 2024 US presidential, the niche became quite popular, a success that could be attributed to Polymarket. In a blog post , Crypto.com informed its customers, ‚ÄúSports Event Trading is a CFTC-regulated derivatives trading feature available in the Crypto.com App and on the Crypto.com Web.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt presents you with a straightforward Yes/No decision based on whether you believe an outcome of a sporting event will occur,‚Äù the crypto exchange added. Crypto.com Prediction Market: Shift from Polymarket In the days leading to the November 5th US election, Polymarket recorded more than $3 billion¬†in bets. One French man went home with almost $80 million just for placing a wager on Donald Trump winning the election. So far, Polymarket has secured approximately $1 billion¬†of bets that attempted to predict which team will win the next Super Bowl in February. Once Crypto.com‚Äôs sports prediction market is activated, Polymarket may have to share its dominance to accommodate the new addition. The crypto exchange‚Äôs existing roots in the sports industry may serve as an edge for gaining traction quickly. In August, Crypto.com signed a multi-year partnership with the UEFA Champions League. As a result, the exchange became the official sponsor of Europe‚Äôs top tournament soccer club. Crypto.com Picks And Drops Lawsuit Against SEC In another Crypto.com news, the global exchange has decided against moving forward with its lawsuit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Two months ago, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the US SEC involving Gary Gensler and the agency‚Äôs four Commissioners. The legal action responded to an initial Wells Notice, but Crypto.com took no chance before filing a lawsuit. The exchange is challenging what it perceives as an unlawful expansion of SEC jurisdiction over its operations. This latest development followed after a meeting between the exchange‚Äôs CEO, Kris Marszalek, and President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on December 16.

Cardano Price Needs to Break This Level to Revive Rally,https://cryptonews.com/news/will-a-santa-rally-save-ada-cardano-price-needs-to-break-this-level-to-revive-rally/,"The Cardano (ADA) price is holding above its 50DMA in the low $0.90s on Monday, as the cryptocurrency market attempts the beginnings of a rebound during a holiday-shortened week. The final trading days are normally bullish in the stock market, with the crypto bulls also hoping for a recovery after last week‚Äôs Fed-fuelled market rout. The Cardano price dropped as low as $0.76 last week, and at current levels above $0.92, it remains 30% down from the highs it hit in early December above $1.30. The Fed shocked markets last week by only forecasting two rate cuts in 2025, less than hoped for. Whilst that has created short-term macro headwinds, crypto has plenty of bullish narratives to fall back on that could support a recovery into the year‚Äôs end. Namely, the incoming Trump administration and Congress are more pro-crypto than most crypto investors/industry participants could have possibly imagined just a few months ago. That means crypto is on the cusp of entering a new golden age, at least in the US, next year. ADA was hurt badly in recent years by regulatory uncertainty. However, the prospect of its founder Charles Hopkinson becoming an advisor to incoming US President Trump on crypto affairs means the future for the Cardano ecosystem is likely very bright. Cardano in 2025 will be insane ‚Äî Deezy.eth (@deezy_BTC) December 23, 2024 The recent market turmoil, thus, likely isn‚Äôt the end of altcoins. Rather, its more likely to have just been a hiccup. However, a rally at the end of the year hasn‚Äôt been confirmed yet. Here are the levels that Cardano needs to clear. Cardano Price Recovery Into The Year‚Äôs End? ADA Needs to Clear This Level A key level of resistance that might block the Cardano price from advancing into the year‚Äôs end is around $1.0. Not only is this a key level of psychological significance, but it also lines up with the downtrend form the yearly highs. Once this level breaks, the likelihood of a retest of yearly highs shoots up. But, for now, ADA remains in a technical downtrend, so in the absence of a broader recovery in risk appetite, traders shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the market reverses lower again in the short-term. However, for those with the ability to hold through short-term price bumps, 2025 promises to be a spectacular year for major altcoins like Cardano. A realistic target for this bull market would be the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the 2023 lows traced back to the 2021 record highs just above $3.0, which is near $5.0. That could mean Cardano could still deliver gains of as much as 5x from current levels, despite already being up around 3x from its October levels. Of course, many bulls are predicting even bigger things for the Cardano price, but no one can really be sure how high the crypto will fly during the upcoming bull market. Cardano to $10 ‚Äî Crypto Jebb (@_CoffeeNCrypto_) December 23, 2024 That means Cardano is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy right now . However, a concern is the lack of major adoption of the blockchain, despite having been around for many years and boasting a large and dedicated community. Rather than putting their eggs all in one basket, a better strategy in crypto is to diversify amongst different coins. Bitcoin , the most established crypto that continues to lead global adoption (national strategic reserves coming in 2025?), should probably be the cornerstone of any investor‚Äôs portfolio. Other major altcoins like Ethereum , Solana and XRP also warrant consideration. But ADA certainly has its place, and could be a major winner in the long run. The post Will a Santa Rally Save ADA?

Speaking in an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Tenev revealed that internal discussions about maintaining Bitcoin reserves occur periodically. However, the company currently has no plans to add Bitcoin to its treasury for investment purposes. Robinhood CEO Explains Bitcoin Strategy Amid Crypto Expansion In a recent interview , Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev explained the company‚Äôs position on holding Bitcoin as part of its reserves. While the topic of Bitcoin reserves arises periodically during internal discussions, Robinhood does not intend to follow companies like MicroStrategy or Tesla by holding Bitcoin for investment purposes. Tenev emphasized that Robinhood remains focused on its role as a trading platform and not as an investment manager. According to Vlad Tenev, adding BTC to the company‚Äôs treasury could complicate investors‚Äô perceptions, casting Robinhood as a ‚Äúquasi Bitcoin-holding play.‚Äù Despite Robinhood CEO statements about not holding Bitcoin for investment purposes, institutional BTC adoption continues to gain momentum. Recently, Matador Technologies announced plans to purchase $4.5 million worth of Bitcoin this month as part of its strategy. The company‚Äôs leadership highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value amid growing concerns over fiat currency devaluation. Stock Correlation With Bitcoin Price Although Robinhood does not hold Bitcoin, its stock (HOOD) has demonstrated a close correlation with Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. The company‚Äôs stock price has surged 202% year-to-date in 2024, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 110% growth in the same period. Robinhood CEO noted that this correlation exists without the need for Robinhood to hold Bitcoin in its treasury. This reinforces the company‚Äôs current strategy of providing crypto trading services rather than direct Bitcoin investment. Moreover, Robinhood‚Äôs crypto-related revenues are projected to grow by 20% by the end of 2025, according to Bernstein analysts. Cryptocurrencies are expected to account for 38% of the platform‚Äôs total revenues, driven by growing user interest and favorable market conditions under Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency. More so, the company‚Äôs planned acquisition of top crypto exchange Bitstamp is set to close in early 2025. This move will boost Robinhood‚Äôs crypto offerings and position the platform as a stronger competitor to exchanges offering more crypto options. Robinhood has traditionally taken a conservative approach to its crypto services. It provides fewer digital assets and trading options compared to its competitors. However, analysts predict that this strategy may evolve as the company integrates Bitstamp and explores new opportunities during the current market cycle. Most recently, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev commented on Bitcoin‚Äôs rally , highlighting its evolution from being dismissed to a serious financial asset. Speaking on CNBC, Tenev attributed the surge to institutional adoption and Federal Reserve Chair Powell‚Äôs comparison of Bitcoin to gold. He also expressed optimism about Paul Atkins‚Äô nomination as SEC Chair.

The potential reasons behind this bullish outlook include the current market sentiment and the positive price action that ADA has displayed in recent days. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming level Since the beginning of December 2024, ADA has experienced a price decline of over 40%, falling below the $1 level. However, with notable attention from traders and investors, the altcoin‚Äôs price appears to be recovering and gaining upward momentum. According to expert technical analysis, ADA appears to be consolidating within a tight range near a strong resistance level of $0.95. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if ADA breaks out of the consolidation zone and closes a daily candle above the $1 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 30% to reach the $1.25 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View Conversely, if the altcoin fails to close above this level and falls below the $0.85 mark, it may find support around the $0.72 level in the future. On a positive note, ADA‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands near the oversold area, indicating potential upside momentum in the days ahead. On-Chain Metrics Support ADA‚Äôs Bullish Outlook This bullish outlook appears to have attracted both long-term holders and traders, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from ADA‚Äôs spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $98 million worth of ADA tokens in the past week. Sourcr: Coinglass In addition to long-term holders, trader participation seems to have skyrocketed. According to the data, ADA‚Äôs open interest has surged by 8%, indicating heightened trader activity and suggesting potential upside momentum. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.94 and has experienced a price surge of over 5.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 18% and continues to rise steadily, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors following the bullish outlook.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 22:58:58

Metaplanet Increases BTC Holdings To 1,762 The recent crypto market downturn from its all-time highs (ATH) does not appear to bother Metaplanet, as the Tokyo-listed firm made its largest BTC purchase to date, buying 619.7 BTC worth $ 61 million at an average price of around $96,000. Related Reading: Metaplanet To Expand Bitcoin Holdings With $11.3 Million Bond Sale To recall, Metaplanet started buying BTC earlier this year in May with a purchase of 97.9 BTC. Since then, the company has purchased BTC every month, barring September, and crossed the 1,000 BTC milestone in November. The latest acquisition has pushed Metaplanet‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to 1,762, bought at an average price of $75,600 per BTC. Notably, this $61 million purchase is nearly double the value of Metaplanet‚Äôs previous largest acquisition, which occurred in November and was worth close to $30 million. The company‚Äôs consistent BTC accumulation has earned it the nickname ‚ÄúAsia‚Äôs MicroStrategy,‚Äù in reference to the US-based business intelligence firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy. It is worth highlighting that today‚Äôs BTC purchase comes a week after Metaplanet raised $60.6 million through two tranches of bond issuance for the purpose of ‚Äúaccelerating BTC purchases.‚Äù Metaplanet‚Äôs latest purchase also makes its BTC reserves the 12th-largest among publicly listed firms globally.

The firm emphasized that this strategy is designed to be ‚Äúaccretive to shareholders.‚Äù Despite today‚Äôs significant BTC purchase, Metaplanet‚Äôs stock price saw little movement, closing at $22.5, down 0.98% for the day. However, on a year-to-date basis, the company‚Äôs stock has surged by an astounding 1,982%, reflecting the long-term benefits of its Bitcoin-centric strategy. Bitcoin Supply Crunch To Hasten Adoption? With Bitcoin‚Äôs total maximum supply capped at 21 million, the digital asset has solidified its reputation as an inflation-resistant store of value. A recent report highlights that BTC supply on crypto exchanges has hit multi-year lows, indicating that holders are increasingly withdrawing BTC from exchanges, reducing circulating supply and potentially driving prices higher.

38023737,https://coingape.com/?p=230694,1734996077,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"XRP Whales Move $132M Ahead Of Santa Claus Rally, ATH Looming?",https://coingape.com/xrp-whales-move-132m-ahead-of-santa-claus-rally-ath-looming/,"According to blockchain tracker Whale Alert, XRP whales have seen a significant transfer of 60 million XRP, valued at $132,202,106, between two unidentified wallets. This large transaction has drawn attention as market analysts predict a possible rally in XRP‚Äôs price, with some suggesting a new all-time high could be on the horizon. Massive XRP Whale Transfer Sparks Speculation The 60 million XRP transfer, first reported by blockchain monitoring platforms, involved a substantial movement of XRP tokens, raising questions about potential strategies by large holders. XRP whale movements are often linked to preparation for major market events or price shifts especially with the XRP ETF increasing launch potential. EGRAG Crypto, a notable market commentator, expressed optimism about XRP‚Äôs trajectory, predicting a surge to $27. He pointed out that XRP is hovering above its Break of Structure (BOS) level while aligning with the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which could pave the way for a bullish breakout. Additionally, data from CryptoQuant revealed that XRP is the most traded alternative cryptocurrency on Binance‚Äôs futures market this December, with $116.6 million in trading volume. Analysts suggest this heightened activity may indicate increasing interest in the asset ahead of the potential Santa Claus rally. Historical Patterns Indicate Potential Breakout Market chartists have drawn comparisons between XRP‚Äôs current price movements and its behavior during the 2017 bull run amid the XRP whales moves. A trader, known as Crypto Vilian, highlighted XRP‚Äôs price pattern, which mirrors its 2017 trajectory of a steep decline, recovery, consolidation, and eventual explosive breakout. Crypto Vilian noted that XRP price recently broke out of a prolonged bearish trend, entering a consolidation phase that historically preceded significant upward movements. He also suggested that XRP‚Äôs market cap could exceed $1 trillion in this cycle, translating to a price of over $17 per token. However, he emphasized that this outcome would depend on broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. XRP Price Faces Short-Term Bearish Patterns Despite long-term bullish expectations, XRP‚Äôs daily chart reveals a descending triangle pattern, indicating potential short-term bearish pressure. According to TradingView, the support level lies near $2.19, while the downward trendline of lower highs may lead to a drop to $1.69 if breached. On the other hand, analysts see room for recovery if XRP bounces from its current support level. A break above the $2.50 resistance could invalidate bearish predictions and set the stage for XRP to retest its recent high of $2.90. Meanwhile, on-chain data from Messari shows that XRP addresses holding over one million tokens have been reducing their balances, signaling profit-taking by large holders during the asset‚Äôs consolidation phase. This activity has added to market pressure in recent weeks prompting worries XRP price may not be heading for a rally soon unless bouyed by the Ripple SEC case end and Gary Gensler stepping down in January.

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the FSC told media representatives the reports were ‚Äúnot true.‚Äù Will Regulator Let South Korean Companies Buy Crypto? Reports circulated at the start of the month claiming that the FSC was prepared to allow universities and schools to trade donations made in crypto for fiat. This, the reports claimed, would represent the first step on a roadmap. This same roadmap would eventually allow South Korean firms to buy coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , they added. [Press Release] The Financial Services Commission held a meeting to review business financing conditions and response strategies with officials from policy financial institutions and related businesses on December 19. https://t.co/QtSVRIB88h ‚Äî Financial Services Commission ‚Äì FSC Korea (@FSC_Korea) December 19, 2024 The reports also claimed that the FSC would let ‚Äúordinary‚Äù firms buy crypto before the banking sector. ‚ÄúWe are still discussing whether we will allow corporations [to buy and sell crypto].

The Financial Services Commission‚Äôs Virtual Assets Division has not confirmed anything about this matter.‚Äù South Korean Financial Services Commission spokesperson South Korean law does not explicitly prevent firms from holding crypto. However, to trade BTC, ETH, and altcoins, private individuals need to open crypto exchange -linked bank accounts. The regulator‚Äôs guidelines instruct financial institutions to reject all such applications from corporate clients.

They claim they have been left behind by their international rivals in the US and Japan. American firms like MicroStrategy and Japanese companies like Remixpoint have built up considerable Bitcoin reserves in recent years. However, the FSC has refused to allow South Korean companies to do likewise. It has claimed that further discussion is required beforehand. The same FSC spokesperson also denied reports that the regulator had scheduled a timeframe for approving crypto spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The official also said these reports were ‚Äúcompletely groundless,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúWe have not discussed the timing of the launch of virtual asset ETFs.‚Äù Crypto hackers from North Korea stole $1.3 billion in funds in 2024, new data released this week from Chainalysis shows. #NorthKorea #CryptoHackers https://t.co/TQYgKiaQ22 ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2024 ‚ÄòHuge Demand‚Äô Other media outlets, citing anonymous sources, have claimed the FSC is still consulting with ‚Äúministries, organizations, and private experts‚Äù before deciding on new crypto regulations.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has shown steady performance, currently trading around $3,315, highlighting its resilience in the volatile crypto space. Meanwhile, EOS is making waves with strategic initiatives and partnerships aimed at improving scalability and usability. At the same time, Qubetics ($TICS) has achieved an impressive milestone with its presale success, selling over 372 million tokens to more than 11,500 holders. Qubetics is setting itself apart by tackling the complexities of cryptocurrency management, making it accessible and efficient for users worldwide. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Crypto Transactions Qubetics is breaking barriers with its Non-Custodial Multi Chain Wallet, designed to simplify cryptocurrency management. By integrating with payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay, the wallet aims to make crypto transactions as seamless as everyday payments, whether you‚Äôre on iOS, Android, or desktop. A standout feature of the Qubetics wallet is its smart contract conversion mechanism. This tool automatically converts digital assets into fiat currencies at the point of sale, protecting users from market volatility and ensuring smooth transactions. For example, imagine a global freelancer who deals with clients paying in various cryptocurrencies. With Qubetics, payments are instantly converted to their desired fiat currency, eliminating exchange rate concerns and market fluctuations. Currently, the Qubetics presale is in its 14th stage, having sold over 372 million tokens and raising $7.5 million. At $0.0377 per token, now‚Äôs the perfect time for investors to join before the price increases by 10% in the upcoming 15th stage this weekend. With its mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, Qubetics is making a significant impact in the crypto world. Ethereum (ETH): Consistent Growth and Network Upgrades Ethereum continues to solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Trading at approximately $3,315, Ethereum has shown steady growth even amidst market volatility. Its consistent performance highlights the trust and reliance the crypto community places in Ethereum. Ethereum 2.0 upgrades have been instrumental in enhancing the platform‚Äôs scalability, security, and energy efficiency. These improvements have attracted more developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its network, further boosting its utility and adoption. Consider a scenario where a startup leverages Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain for smart contracts. The platform‚Äôs robust infrastructure and widespread adoption make it an ideal choice for businesses looking to implement secure and scalable blockchain solutions. As decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to flourish, Ethereum remains a critical foundation for the ecosystem. Analysts predict that with growing institutional interest and network developments, Ethereum could reach new milestones in the coming year, reaffirming its place among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. EOS (EOS): Aiming for Scalable Solutions EOS is carving its niche in the competitive world of cryptocurrencies by focusing on scalability and developer-friendly infrastructure. Currently trading at approximately $0.79, EOS has experienced fluctuations but remains a viable option for dApp developers. Recent partnerships and upgrades have aimed at improving transaction speeds and reducing costs, positioning EOS as a cost-effective alternative for blockchain-based applications. For instance, a gaming company exploring blockchain integration for in-game assets can benefit from EOS‚Äôs efficient infrastructure to provide a seamless user experience. Despite challenges, EOS‚Äôs community remains active, driving forward initiatives that enhance the platform‚Äôs utility and adoption. Its ability to cater to developers seeking scalable solutions makes it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. Conclusion The crypto market offers diverse opportunities, and Qubetics, Ethereum, and EOS are leading the way. Qubetics is redefining digital transactions with its innovative wallet, Ethereum continues to dominate with consistent growth and network enhancements, and EOS is providing scalable solutions for dApp developers. Based on the latest research, we recommend considering Qubetics ($TICS), Ethereum (ETH), and EOS (EOS) as some of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 .

Kalshi, one of the sharpest platforms out there, says there‚Äôs now a 77% chance that one of the Magnificent 7 companies (Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia, or Alphabet) will take the plunge and buy Bitcoin in 2025. A few months ago, those odds were sitting at 49%. What happened? Michael Saylor, a man who treats Bitcoin like religion, has been out here pushing companies like Microsoft to stop playing it safe and start stacking sats. Let‚Äôs call it what it is: the market smells blood, and by blood, we mean Bitcoin. 2025 could be even better than 2024 has already been. These guys have been circling the crypto waters for years, and the odds are now higher than ever that one of them is finally going to bite. Let‚Äôs take a look at what they think about Bitcoin *now.* Alphabet keeps Bitcoin at arm‚Äôs length Company number one is Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, which has been doing that thing where it dips a toe into the crypto pool but doesn‚Äôt want to admit it‚Äôs swimming. Back in 2018, it banned crypto ads altogether because, apparently, scams are bad for business. Fast-forward to this year, and they seem like they‚Äôve realized blockchain technology might actually be worth something. Google Cloud is exploring blockchain for enterprise clients, focusing on things like security and transparency. Meanwhile, Alphabet‚Äôs financials are looking good. Google Cloud revenue hit $11.4 billion in Q3, up 35%. The company‚Äôs stock is up more than 30% since September, making it a top performer in that market. Amazon‚Äôs boardroom brawl Amazon‚Äôs shareholders aren‚Äôt exactly the same though. In December, they told the board to put their money where the future is. Specifically, they want Amazon to invest 5% of its $88 billion in cash reserves into Bitcoin. That‚Äôs $4.4 billion, for those keeping score at home. But wait, there‚Äôs more. Insiders reportedly say Amazon is already thinking about dropping $250 million on Bitcoin. Why? Because new accounting rules from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) make it easier to hold crypto on the books. Meanwhile, rumors are going around that Amazon could start accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano as payment soon. Amazon‚Äôs stock is trading at $225, up 20% for the year. With a market cap of $2.36 trillion, they‚Äôre incredibly powerful. If they jump into Bitcoin, it‚Äôll be like Tyson stepping into a middleweight ring. Apple sticks to its lane As for Apple, it isn‚Äôt exactly rushing to buy Bitcoin. Instead, they‚Äôre making it easier for their customers to buy it. Earlier this month, the company partnered with Coinbase to let users buy cryptos directly through Apple Pay. That‚Äôs all we got on them for now. Apple‚Äôs stock is trading at $180, with a market cap north of $2.8 trillion. They‚Äôre playing it safe, but their users? Not so much. Might be time to give the people what they want. Meta pivots to NFTs while Microsoft backs the blockchain Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been pushing NFTs hard, integrating them into Instagram and Facebook. Reports say NFT transactions on Meta‚Äôs platforms are up 40% since launch. But let‚Äôs not forget Meta‚Äôs bigger play: the metaverse. They‚Äôre betting on blockchain to power virtual transactions, and that means they‚Äôre not done with crypto yet. Meanwhile, Microsoft is keeping things corporate. Azure, its cloud platform, has rolled out Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS). Over 500 companies are already using it to build decentralized apps. Microsoft is also throwing cash at startups in DeFi and NFTs. The stock is $380 a share and the company has a $2.8 trillion market cap. But when Michael Saylor suggested that they add Bitcoin to their balance sheet just some weeks back, they told him NO. Tesla and Nvidia: Bitcoin holdings and mining wars Tesla‚Äôs Bitcoin story is well-known. They‚Äôve got $1.5 billion in Bitcoin on their books and are thinking about bringing back Bitcoin payments for their cars. Elon Musk might be polarizing, but Tesla‚Äôs crypto strategy isn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre holding steady while pushing for greener mining practices. Their stock? Trading at $280, with a market cap of $900 billion. Then there‚Äôs Nvidia. Their GPUs are the backbone of crypto mining, especially for Bitcoin miners. But Nvidia‚Äôs relationship with crypto isn‚Äôt all roses. They‚Äôre facing a Supreme Court case over allegations they misled investors about crypto revenue back in 2018. Still, their stock is trading at $140, with a market cap of $3.42 trillion. Legal drama aside, the company has staged nothing short of a remarkable performance this year.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

It‚Äôs an unmissable opportunity that you can unlock with the BIG50 code. Floki Inu‚Äôs ICO ‚Äì The One That Got Away Floki Inu is a meme coin that managed to make waves from the moment it launched. The project took inspiration from Elon Musk‚Äôs beloved dog, Floki, and launched with an ICO that attracted a lot of buzz.

Now, let‚Äôs assume the price rises to $0.0006 (which is very likely, considering the presale hype and the project‚Äôs strong fundamentals). That‚Äôs an 837% return on your initial investment, turning your $5,000 into $46,875.

38025659,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322221,1734999492,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38025659.jpeg,Dogecoin‚Äôs Third Leap Incoming? Analyst Predicts Explosive Rally After Dip,https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoins-third-leap-incoming-analyst-predicts-explosive-rally-after-dip/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) could be in for a prolonged period of pain, following by an explosive rally starting in April 2025. That‚Äôs according to the analysis of X user Master Kenobi, who outlined this interesting take in a recent tweet. What if DOGE‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶is gearing up for its third and final leap in such a scenario? A slow drop until April 15, followed by a strong pump starting May 5, reaching its peak around mid-August? Not saying it will happen, but it caught my eye, and I thought I'd share it with you‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/M2kcNs7JPT ‚Äî Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) December 21, 2024 Master Kenobi looked at the price action of Dogecoin in 2024, where it saw a surge to highs in the $0.23 area, before then stagnating for months ahead of a breakout in the final final months of 2025 to new yearly highs above $0.40. If this price pattern repeats, that could mean Dogecoin is in for a period of stagnation until mid-April, before then breaking out again around the mid-point of next year. Could a Dogecoin Rally Come Sooner? Its an interesting theory. But the Dogecoin bulls will be pleased to hear that risks are very much tilted in favor of the Dogecoin price rallying much sooner than next April. Why? The facetiously named Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) , headed by none other than Elon Musk (an ardent Dogecoin supporter for years now) is set to officially land in Washington in January. Incoming US President Donald Trump , whose administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, has given DOGE a mandate to reduce fraud and waste in government spending. Musk is already having an impact in Washington ‚Äì his vocal criticisms on X of a recent Congressional spending bill resulted in the bill being reduced from over 1500 pages in length to a little over 100. Expect D.O.G.E to dominate the headlines in 2025, all but ensuring that Dogecoin retains a commanding portion of mindshare in the meme coin markets . That means as the Trump trade returns to lift crypto prices higher, as is likely in the coming weeks, DOGE will be a prime candidate to outperform. However, chart analysis continues to point to downside risks for the Dogecoin price, for now. Last around $0.32, Dogecoin fell under its 21 and 50DMAs following its price collapse last week. And DOGE is yet to retest its early 2024 highs in the $0.23 area, which will be a key target for the bears. Chart analysis suggests DOGE could be headed lower in the short term. However, if it does reach the low $0.20s, it could be a great coin to buy on the dip. With Dogecoin likely to vault above $1.0 and post gains in the 5x region this bull market, it‚Äôs a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now . Dogecoin Alternative to Consider ‚Äì Flockerz (FLOCK) While Dogecoin could do very well in 2025, there are many smaller, lesser-known meme coins that could post far larger gains. The team at crypto news.com keeps a close eye on the meme coin market as they hunt for high-potential projects. And one new meme coin they like a lot is an exciting new DAO-powered vote-to-earn meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) . Big Announcement for The Flock In just 30 days the Flockerz presale will end. This is your last chance to get in on the ground floor, to grab your share of the presale head on over to: https://t.co/HKN509Un5J It's time to join The Flock! pic.twitter.com/OWkEzSXu3u ‚Äî Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 23, 2024 One of the reasons analysts at crypto news.com are so excited about this token is the impressive pace at which is has been raising funds from earlier investors. Despite only launching a few weeks ago, Flockerz (FLOCK) has already attracted over $7.6 million from eager buyers. Couple that with its impressive social media metrics, and this token is looking like a meme coin that could really pop. With new meme coins like Fart Coin recently hitting a $1 billion market cap, the appetite for novel new meme coins appears elevated. FLOCK could easily become one of the best meme coins to launch in 2024. ClayBro outlines in the video below why he thinks FLOCK is set to launch at the perfect time, just ahead of a new meme season.

This round adds to the $6 billion raised earlier this year, bringing the company‚Äôs total funding to $12 billion. The capital injection positions xAI to expand its generative AI initiatives and enhance its competitive edge. Elon Musk xAI Achieves $12B Total Funding After Latest $6B Round According to a recent report , Elon Musk xAI has successfully secured $6 billion from investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Fidelity, Nvidia, and others. This latest funding round exclusively involved previous investors, many of whom had supported Musk‚Äôs acquisition of X (formerly Twitter). The funds bring xAI total capital raised to $12 billion. The company plans to use this funding to accelerate the development of its generative AI model, Grok, and expand its ecosystem. This substantial financial backing positions the firm to compete with industry leaders such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Moreover, the Grok AI model, developed by xAI, powers a range of features on X, including a chatbot available to premium and free users in select regions. Known for its functionality, Grok can generate images through the Flux generator, analyze visuals, and summarize trending news. In October, xAI launched an API allowing developers to integrate Grok into third-party apps and platforms. The company also introduced a standalone iOS app for testing, further extending its generative Artificial Intelligence capabilities. Memphis Data Center and Infrastructure Upgrades To support its ambitious goals, Elon Musk xAI operates a Memphis data center equipped with 100,000 Nvidia GPUs. The facility, constructed in just 122 days, currently relies partly on diesel generators. According to the blog post, the company has plans to double the center‚Äôs capacity in 2025, securing approval for additional power. The upgraded infrastructure will also benefit Tesla, with plans to integrate xAI‚Äôs developments into autonomous driving technologies. This expansion reflects Elon Musk‚Äôs vision to enhance AI applications across industries. While Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI has made rapid advancements, it continues to face fierce competition. Rivals such as Anthropic and OpenAI have also secured billions in funding. Following the growing competition, earlier this month, the Tesla CEO filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI coerced investors to avoid supporting rivals like Musk‚Äôs xAI. Musk‚Äôs legal team claims that Microsoft‚Äôs $13 billion investment in OpenAI led to conflicts of interest and market manipulation In addition, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the need for stricter oversight to prevent nonprofit entities from exploiting their status for financial gain. Joining Elon Musk, Zuckerberg called for a formal investigation into OpenAI‚Äôs transition, highlighting potential misuse of tax-exempt donations and resources.

Among these metrics, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for long-term holders has particularly emerged as a critical tool for assessing investor sentiment and market resilience. Long-term holders, defined as investors holding Bitcoin for over 155 days, are often viewed as a stabilizing force in the market. Their selling patterns can significantly influence price trends, making SOPR an indicator worth watching. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Leverage and Coinbase Premium: What Recent Data Reveals Long-Term Holder Trends And Market Sentiment Recent analysis from a CryptoQuant analyst known as Cryptoavails highlights that Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term holder SOPR metric continues to exhibit notable patterns as Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends upward. Historically, SOPR values above 1 indicate that long-term holders are selling at a profit, while values below 1 suggest they are offloading their holdings at a loss. This behavior reflects broader market confidence or capitulation during periods of price decline. Currently, the SOPR metric remains consistently above 1, signaling that long-term holders are selling profitably without adding significant downward pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. The analysis from Cryptoavails tracks key phases in the Bitcoin market over the past two years, highlighting significant shifts in SOPR values. For instance, in early 2022, the SOPR metric showed high volatility with frequent spikes, suggesting intense profit-taking activity by long-term holders. Amid these sales, Bitcoin‚Äôs price experienced a downward trend, reflecting persistent selling pressure during that period. This trend gradually shifted in late 2022 and early 2023 when the SOPR metric mostly remained below 1, indicating that long-term holders were selling at a loss as the market sought to find stability. By mid-2023, the SOPR began trending upwards, signaling renewed confidence among long-term investors. The metric consistently moved closer to or above the critical level of 1, suggesting that long-term holders were once again selling at a profit while market confidence began to recover. This upward trend has remained intact into 2024, supported by Bitcoin‚Äôs rising price levels. Importantly, there have been no significant sell-offs by long-term holders, reinforcing the broader market‚Äôs stability, according to the crypto analyst. SOPR As A Forward Indicator For Market Growth Overall, Cryptoavails¬†mentioned that the current state of Bitcoin‚Äôs SOPR suggests a healthy market dynamic, with long-term holders contributing to a stable price structure. Despite periodic corrections, the sustained presence of SOPR above 1 indicates that selling pressure remains controlled. Related Reading: What‚Äôs The Worst Case Scenario For Bitcoin Right Now? Analyst Explains The analyst also pointed out that this behavior reflects market maturity, where long-term investors are not rushing to offload their holdings despite Bitcoin‚Äôs price appreciation. Regardless, Bitcoin has continued to consistently decrease in price since its sharp drop below $100,000 last week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at a price of $93,991 down by 1.6% in the past 24 hours.

33767162,[object Object],1735000244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,BlackRock‚Äôs Ethereum ETF Soars Past 1 Million ETH ‚Äì Can Price Follow?,https://bitcoinist.com/blackrocks-ethereum-etf-soars-past-1-million-eth-can-price-follow/,"While Ethereum (ETH) has once again failed to break through the stubborn $4,000 resistance level, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust ETF has quietly accumulated over one million ETH. This milestone reflects strong institutional demand for Ethereum, even as its price performance in 2024 remains lackluster. Institutional Interest In Ethereum On The Rise Year-to-date (YTD), Ethereum ‚Äì the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap ‚Äì has risen by 43%, climbing from approximately $2,280 on January 1 to $3,283 at the time of writing. While this is notable, ETH‚Äôs performance has been overshadowed by other cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana (SOL), and SUI, which have posted significantly higher gains in the same period. However, Ethereum holds a key advantage over most altcoins ‚Äì direct access to institutional investors through regulated ETFs, akin to Bitcoin‚Äôs position in the market. In a recent post on X, crypto entrepreneur Dan Gambardello highlighted that BlackRock‚Äôs Ethereum ETF has now surpassed one million ETH in holdings. Gambardello noted that ETH‚Äôs consolidation below its all-time high (ATH), combined with growing institutional interest, sets the stage for a potential altcoin season ‚Äúunlike any we‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù Recent ETH ETF inflow data appears to support this outlook. According to data from SoSoValue, US spot ETH ETFs have had four continuous weeks of net inflows, attracting more than $2 billion in capital. The total net assets held across all US spot ETH ETFs stand at $12.15 billion, equivalent to almost 3% of Ethereum‚Äôs total market cap. Crypto analysts remain optimistic that Ethereum, the leading smart-contract platform, is on track to reach a new ATH. For instance, CryptosRus pointed out that historically, Ethereum has demonstrated bullish price action during the first four months of the next year, following US presidential elections. The chart below shows that after the 2016 US election, ETH rallied significantly during the first quarter of 2017. A similar pattern was observed in 2021 following the 2020 election, with Ethereum recording four consecutive weeks of price increases. From a technical perspective, crypto analyst @CryptoPoseidonn shared an 8-hour ETH chart, suggesting that ETH may bottom around the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), marked in green. The analyst stated: The first pullback since the last significant upside move, and fear is at its peak. I believe this is where we print a higher low. Dips like these are opportunities to increase your spot exposure. Is The Market Correction Nearing Its End? The total crypto market cap has dropped from $3.9 trillion on December 16 to $3.4 trillion at the time of writing ‚Äì a $500 billion loss in a week. Data from Coinglass reveals that over $289 million worth of liquidations occurred in the past 24 hours alone. Despite this downturn, seasoned crypto analyst Pentoshi suggested on the 3-day chart that the crash could serve as a retest of the previous crypto market cap ATH recorded in November 2022. If so, this level might act as a base for the next upward rally. However, not all analysts are bullish in the short term.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 344,000 YouTube subscribers that the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/ BTC ) pair is flashing a ‚Äúmajor altcoin signal.‚Äù However, he warns that altcoins still have a bit further to drop before market sentiment turns around and sparks a rally. ‚ÄúETH/BTC in November got a bounce but again it still has not broken past at least the 4% level and the major level that I‚Äôm watching for an overbalance in price here is 0.046 [BTC]. That‚Äôs going to give us an overbalance in price to the upside and ideally if [the 0.032 BTC] low isn‚Äôt taken out, it‚Äôll be overbalanced in time as well and that would be that major altcoin signal, when everyone has that extreme greed, the excitement and the belief that these markets are just not going to come back down. We‚Äôre still not there yet so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too crazy to think that we‚Äôd see further at least consolidation but until that happens, you‚Äôre probably not going to get that same extreme excitement to the upside.‚Äù According to the trader, ETH/BTC is mirroring the same pattern it did in 2020 before taking off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs similar to what happened in December of 2020 and what followed December 2020 is your massive January bar: big, big volume, big reversal‚Ä¶ So we have a look back to January [2021]. Y ou start to see that volume really pick up early on and just come back out of nowhere. You can see [December 27th, 2020] it started to pick up and [on] the 3rd of January [2021], [a] nice big move. Third and fourth [of January], [ETH/BTC] starts to break those tops and then consolidate above those support levels. You can see they‚Äôre around 3% and then it started to move again ‚Äì sure it came back down, but that gives you the overbalance that you‚Äôre looking for, meaning more buyers for a longer period of time and they‚Äôre holding the price up. That‚Äôs exactly what we need to see, and we haven‚Äôt seen it yet with the ETH/BTC chart.‚Äù ETH/BTC is valued at 0.0342 BTC ($3,264.68) at time of writing.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

JasmyCoin (JASMY) Imagine having full control over your personal data and deciding how it‚Äôs used. JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a project from a Tokyo-based company called Jasmy Corporation that aims to make this possible. They specialize in the Internet of Things (IoT), connecting devices like computers, cars, and phones. By combining IoT with blockchain technology, Jasmy creates a secure platform where users can safely store and exchange their data. In this system, your personal information becomes your own asset, and you have the power over it. In today‚Äôs market, data privacy is more important than ever. JasmyCoin stands out by focusing on protecting individual data rights. Unlike some other coins that prioritize speed or scalability, JASMY puts data ownership front and center. This aligns with a growing trend where people want more control over their digital lives. As concerns about data security rise, a coin that empowers users could draw more interest. While the crypto market is always changing, JasmyCoin‚Äôs unique approach to data democratization makes it an intriguing player to watch. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency world, born from the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Launched on the Ethereum blockchain, this deflationary memecoin has captured the attention of many. It follows in the footsteps of other meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. By embracing its meme origins and keeping things simple with a no-tax policy and being upfront about its lack of utility, PEPE appeals to those who enjoy the fun side of crypto. In late April and May of 2023, PEPE‚Äôs value skyrocketed, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion at its peak. Early investors saw huge gains, and a strong community formed around it. This surge sparked what some call a ‚Äúmemecoin season,‚Äù with new memecoins popping up and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE‚Äôs roadmap includes plans for major exchange listings and aims for a ‚Äúmeme takeover.‚Äù Whether PEPE will reach new heights remains uncertain, but with the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a Bull Run, many are watching closely. For those intrigued by meme coins and high-risk, high-reward opportunities, PEPE might be an attractive option in the current market. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is an innovative project founded in 2017 and launched on Binance in 2019. It‚Äôs building an open, decentralized machine learning network powered by blockchain technology. Fetch.ai aims to make AI accessible to everyone through a permissionless network.

With its unique blend of AI and blockchain, Fetch.ai has significant potential. In the current market, the coin looks promising, especially as interest in AI and decentralization grows. Price predictions suggest FET could gain value in the coming years, reaching over $1 by 2025 and $1.19 by 2030. Compared to other AI-focused coins like SingularityNET or Ocean Protocol, Fetch.ai stands out with its autonomous agents and practical applications. As demand for AI solutions increases, Fetch.ai might be a project to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Stellar Lumens (XLM) Stellar Lumens (XLM) is changing the way money moves around the globe. Founded in 2014, Stellar is a decentralized network that uses blockchain technology to make sending funds fast and affordable. It doesn‚Äôt pick favorites among currencies. Instead, it allows people to transfer any type of money, whether it‚Äôs a national currency or a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Over the years, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and teamed up with major companies. With Stellar apps, individuals can send money worldwide, and businesses can build their own blockchain tools or use the network for payments and currency exchanges. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies that aim to replace traditional financial systems, Stellar wants to work with them. It offers a platform where different financial systems can collaborate. This approach sets it apart in the current market, where cooperation is becoming more important. The Stellar Development Foundation, supported initially by Stripe, helps promote the network‚Äôs use. It works on projects like NFT creation and smart contracts. As the crypto market evolves, Stellar‚Äôs focus on bridging old and new financial worlds might make it stand out among other coins. Its technology and partnerships could play a key role in the future of global finance.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price shifts in recent times. Over the past week, its value dropped by 15.25%, marking a significant decline. In the last month, the price decreased by 2.48%, and over six months, it edged down by 2.16%. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range of $3648.43 to $4137.17, reflecting the volatility in the market. Technical indicators hint at possible future movements for Ethereum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.07, approaching oversold levels, suggesting a potential rebound. The Stochastic indicator stands at 21.50, also indicating an oversold condition. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -21.52, showing bearish momentum. The price hovers near its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $3331.27 and $3461.32, respectively. Ethereum‚Äôs immediate resistance level is at $4318. If the price breaks above this point, it could aim for the second resistance at $4807, an increase of around 11%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3340.38. A drop below this could lead to the second support level at $2851.64, a decrease of about 15%. Given the current indicators and support levels, Ethereum may be poised for a turnaround or further decline, making this a critical juncture for the asset. XRP (XRP) Over the past six months, XRP has seen a remarkable increase of 366.94%. This significant rise reflects strong interest and trading activity around the cryptocurrency. In the last month, XRP‚Äôs price climbed by 77.14%, showcasing a robust upward trend. However, the past week experienced a dip of 7.81%, indicating some short-term volatility. Currently, XRP is trading between $2.03 and $2.73. The nearest resistance level is at $3.02, a point that, if surpassed, could lead to testing the second resistance at $3.73. On the other hand, the nearest support lies at $1.61, with a secondary support at $0.9041. These levels are key indicators of potential price movement in either direction. Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $2.24 and $2.28 respectively, suggesting the market is consolidating. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.72, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0059, which could point to a mild bearish sentiment. Monitoring these indicators can provide insight into XRP‚Äôs potential price direction in the near future. Solana (SOL) SOL has faced notable price shifts recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 18.80%, and over the last month, it decreased by 30.50%. Despite these declines, Solana has grown by 34.97% over the past six months. The current trading range is between $205.85 and $239.87, showing significant volatility. Technical indicators suggest the bearish trend might persist. The RSI is at 38.29, nearing oversold levels. The MACD is negative at -1.376, and the Stochastic oscillator is low at 26.34. These figures point towards potential further declines, but they could also hint at an upcoming reversal if buyers step in. Solana‚Äôs nearest support is at $188; falling below this could lead to a drop to the next support at $154. On the upside, resistance levels are at $256 and $290. To reach the first resistance, Solana needs to rise by about 8%. A decline to the nearest support means a decrease of around 10%. The 10-day SMA is $182.89, and the 100-day SMA is $193.52, indicating recent prices are above average. Conclusion Though ETH, XRP, and SOL are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely merges sports and memes, positioning itself for significant growth in the current bull run.

Among the many players in this space, Qubetics , Tron, and Immutable X stand out for their distinct approaches and recent developments. Each of these altcoins offers unique insights into the evolving blockchain landscape. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at their current status and potential. Qubetics: Transforming Financial Interactions Through Blockchain Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in blockchain innovation with a mission to revolutionise how financial transactions occur. By offering a secure, user-friendly, and inclusive platform, Qubetics allows individuals and institutions to manage tokenised assets effortlessly while conducting efficient cross-border payments . Its goal is to redefine global finance through accessible financial services, tokenised asset trading, and innovative payment solutions. In Presale Phase 14 , Qubetics has captured significant attention due to its structured presale model. Weekly phases see a 10% price increase, and the final stage promises a 20% hike, creating a sense of urgency for early investors. Priced at $0.037 per $TICS token, the project has raised over $7.5 million, boasts more than 11,500 holders, and sold 372 million tokens. The anticipated post-presale price of $0.25 signals an ROI of 630% for current buyers, making it an enticing opportunity. Analysts further predict that the token could rise to between $10 and $15 after the mainnet launch, highlighting its long-term potential. With a clear vision, strong presale momentum, and a strategic roadmap, Qubetics is a project to watch closely in blockchain. Tron (TRX): Challenges Amidst Market Pressure Tron, once a prominent player in the DeFi space, has recently faced significant hurdles. Its native token, TRX, has been on a consistent downward trajectory, recording a 10.56% loss over the past week. The decline has raised concerns among investors, especially as the network struggles to compete with Ethereum in the supply of USDT. Tether‚Äôs recent minting activities have seen Ethereum secure a larger share of the $2 billion in USDT issued since early November, leaving Tron behind. This shift has added to the mounting challenges TRX faces, further diminishing its appeal in the eyes of investors. Adding to the pressure, large-scale holders or ‚Äúwhales‚Äù increasingly highlight newer projects like Lunex Network, which offer high growth potential. While Tron‚Äôs robust infrastructure and active community suggest that it retains the capacity for recovery, the network must innovate and address these challenges to regain investor confidence and market relevance. Immutable X (IMX): Volatility Ahead of Token Unlock Immutable X, a blockchain platform based in Sydney, Australia, has established itself as a leading Ethereum Layer 2 solution specialising in NFTs and gaming. However, the platform faces significant price volatility as it approaches a major token unlock event. Immutable X plans to release 24.5 million IMX tokens, valued at over $33 million, as part of its tokenomics strategy. This monthly release, a standard feature of the project‚Äôs design, introduces additional supply to the market, often leading to downward price pressure. IMX‚Äôs price has declined to its lowest since November 21, falling below critical support levels. Analysts predict further declines leading up to the unlock event on December 27, with the token potentially approaching a support zone around $1.1720. A Diversified Approach to Investing The stories of Qubetics, Tron, and Immutable X underscore the diversity of opportunities within the cryptocurrency market. Qubetics offers a promising presale phase with exceptional ROI potential and a transformative vision for blockchain-based financial services. Tron‚Äôs challenges reflect the competitive nature of the DeFi sector, yet its infrastructure and community offer hope for a turnaround. Despite short-term volatility, Immutable X continues to innovate in the NFT and gaming space, making it a key player in these expanding industries. Investors must assess their risk tolerance, investment goals, and market trends to make informed decisions about these altcoins. As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, these projects highlight cryptocurrencies‚Äô dynamic possibilities.

As established tokens grapple with changing trends, attention is turning to this new contender. The developments ahead could alter market perceptions and ignite fresh interest among investors and enthusiasts. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life ‚Äî posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That‚Äôs the DOGEN lifestyle ! If you‚Äôre the kind of guy who‚Äôs always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win . HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market This thing is about to explode! We‚Äôre talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up ‚Äî and that‚Äôs just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you‚Äôre already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain , running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat ‚Äî all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN‚Äôs flying under the radar, but it‚Äôs about to set new records in this bull run. You don‚Äôt want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‚Äòcause they‚Äôre holding an airdrop ! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you‚Äôll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! Floki: From Meme Coin to Utility Token with Real-World Applications Floki, inspired by Elon Musk‚Äôs June 2021 tweet about naming his Shiba Inu ‚ÄúFloki,‚Äù began as Floki Inu coin but has evolved beyond a meme coin. It provides utility and charity, such as building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria. Recognized by The Economic Times as a top meme coin to buy in 2023, Floki has projects like the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and DeFi service FlokiFi. Its partnership with NOWPayments and the Floki Card allow tokens to be used for real-world transactions. This diversification into NFTs, DeFi, and real-world use differentiates FLOKI from other meme coins. The coin may appear attractive in the current market cycle due to its expanding utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. The coin started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB aims for broader utility by developing platforms like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and governance system. Its integration with Ethereum allows for potential growth in decentralized applications. Conclusion While FLOKI and SHIB show shifting patterns and may have less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN anticipates 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with potential for massive returns. Following successful tokens like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

XRP, Ripple‚Äôs native token, has seen significant whale activity, suggesting a major price move ahead. Large-scale purchases by whales indicate growing confidence in XRP‚Äôs future, with potential price targets of $3 to $7.5 by 2025. Similarly, SUI, the native token of the Sui Network, has experienced a remarkable surge, with its price pumping 231% over the past year. Dubbed the ‚ÄúSolana killer,‚Äù SUI‚Äôs growth is attracting attention from investors seeking the next big opportunity in crypto. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves by addressing challenges that earlier cryptocurrencies have struggled to overcome. By focusing on user-friendly solutions and seamless integration with existing financial systems, Qubetics aims to make cryptocurrency transactions as straightforward as traditional payment methods. This approach not only simplifies the user experience but also bridges the gap between digital and fiat currencies, fostering broader adoption among businesses and individuals. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Digital Transactions Qubetics is on a mission to streamline digital asset management with its Non-Custodial Multi chain Wallet. This innovative wallet integrates seamlessly with major financial platforms like Apple Pay and Google Pay, making crypto transactions as simple as swiping a card.

Tokens are currently priced at $0.0377, with a 10% price increase anticipated in the upcoming 15th stage this weekend. This presents a timely opportunity for investors to join before the next price surge. Ripple (XRP): Whale Activity Signals Potential Surge XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple, has recently garnered significant attention due to increased whale activity. Large investors have accumulated substantial amounts of XRP, indicating a bullish sentiment and the potential for a significant price movement. For instance, consider a scenario where a major financial institution decides to adopt Ripple‚Äôs technology for cross-border payments. This move could streamline their operations, reduce transaction costs, and expedite processing times. Such real-world applications highlight XRP‚Äôs utility and its potential to revolutionize traditional financial systems. Market analysts have responded to this whale activity with optimistic forecasts for XRP‚Äôs future. Predictions suggest potential price targets of $3 to $7.5 by 2025, based on current accumulation trends and investor confidence. SUI (SUI): A Rising Star in the Crypto Space SUI, the native token of the Sui Network, has been making significant strides in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past year, SUI‚Äôs price has surged by 231%, reflecting growing interest and investment in the platform.

The United States Department of Justice announced that the pair face charges including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and stalking. According to prosecutors, Hay and Mayo promoted various NFT and digital asset projects, providing misleading roadmaps and making ‚Äúmaterially false and misleading statements‚Äù about their intentions to fulfill project promises. One such project, Vault of Gems, was marketed as the first NFT project ‚Äúpegged to a hard asset.‚Äù However, prosecutors claim the duo abandoned the initiative after collecting millions from investors. Principal Deputy Attorney General Nicole Argentieri stated: ‚ÄúGabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo allegedly defrauded investors in digital asset projects of tens of millions of dollars and threatened an individual who attempted to expose their roles in these fraudulent schemes.‚Äù When a project manager revealed their involvement in another NFT project, Faceless, Hay and Mayo allegedly resorted to harassment and intimidation, targeting the individual and their family. The Justice Department revealed that the duo used similar tactics across multiple projects, including Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Dirty Dogs, MoonPortal, and Squiggles. To obscure their involvement, they reportedly misrepresented others as the project owners. Argentieri emphasized the Justice Department‚Äôs commitment to combating digital asset fraud, saying: ‚ÄúFraudsters take advantage of new technologies and financial products to steal investors‚Äô hard-earned money.‚Äù Officials vowed to work with law enforcement to uproot crypto fraud schemes and protect investors.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Metaverse|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 02:12:21

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solaxy nears $5M presale goal, offering low entry prices and high staking APY to early investors on Solana‚Äôs Layer 2. Table of Contents Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Solaxy (SOLX) is developing a Layer 2 solution to enhance the user experience on Solana , and investors are taking notice. Less than two weeks have passed since the presale started, and the project‚Äôs funds are just $419,000 away from the $5 million mark. Since the project is still in its early stages, investors have a chance to secure their share of SOLX at a low price and benefit from a massive staking APY to maximize their investment. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at this project and what it‚Äôs all about. You might also like: Crypto.com launches U.S. trust company Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum The Solaxy presale officially opened its doors to early investors on December 12th, and it has already raised over $4.5 million. While the project‚Äôs scope plays its part in attracting investors, Solaxy is featured on Best Wallet‚Äôs Upcoming Tokens section, making it available to the app‚Äôs 100,000+ monthly users and boosting its visibility further. This makes it very similar to Pepe Unchained (PEPU), an Ethereum -based Layer 2 blockchain project that successfully ended its presale phase with over $73 million raised. Once its presale ended, PEPU launched on Uniswap and soared by more than 600% in the first 48 hours, securing listings on LBank, BingX, MEXC, and other exchanges as its price rose. Comparing the early success of these two presales puts Solaxy ahead, as Pepe Unchained took more than a month to raise $4.5 million. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1870529241072173066 To enter the presale, investors can purchase SOLX using BNB, ETH, USDT , or a bank card. No minimum investment is required. Currently, SOLX costs $0.001576 each, but its per-token price will increase in just one day or if the presale raises another $273,000 by tomorrow. If Solaxy keeps its momentum, it could surpass PEPU‚Äôs success and potentially deliver better returns on launch. Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Solana is among the top three blockchains by transaction volumes, and its daily transaction count has only increased with pump.fun‚Äôs launch. As such, its ecosystem is prone to network overloads and congestion that can result in failed transactions or slow transaction speeds. Solaxy intends to resolve these issues with its Layer 2 blockchain, which will reduce the burden on Solana‚Äôs Layer 1 chain by bundling up and processing transactions in its stead. This won‚Äôt just make Solana more scalable but also more cost-effective for its users. Plus, the bundled transactions will still be finalized on Solana‚Äôs network, leveraging its robust security. The development of the Solaxy Layer 2 blockchain is in full swing, fueled by 30% of the project‚Äôs total 138 billion token supply. Crypto analyst ClayBro has reminded his 134,000-strong audience on YouTube of the congestion issues Solana users faced in March, April, and June of 2024 during meme coin booms. As he anticipates a meme coin supercycle, ClayBro is impressed by Solaxy‚Äôs goal to improve Solana‚Äôs performance and advises his followers to enter the presale while it‚Äôs in its early stages. Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Despite Solaxy‚Äôs ambitious goals and the utility of its upcoming Layer 2 blockchain, it‚Äôs a meme coin first, and as such, its success largely depends on the strength and trust of its community. The project‚Äôs 4-phase roadmap reveals it has a strong focus on community building. Its first phase prioritizes marketing, for which the project allocated 15% of its total token supply, and that has already attracted over 22,000 followers across Solaxy‚Äôs X (Twitter) and Telegram channels. The presale also adopts a dynamic model for staking rewards to encourage early adoption. As more SOLX gets added to the staking pool, the staking yields reduce, which rewards early participants with the best returns. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 Currently, the project offers an 859% staking APY, allowing investors to nearly 9x their token holdings long-term. Solaxy‚Äôs developers also emphasize investor security, with 10% of the total token supply reserved for liquidity to ensure a safe trading environment. Plus, Coinbase , a security firm, audited the project‚Äôs smart contract and found no issues in its code. Although volatility is as high as ever in the meme coin space, Solaxy stands a solid chance to explode following its DEX launch and the subsequent release of its Layer 2 blockchain.

Dogecoin & Other Top Memecoins Have Seen A Decline In Social Dominance In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about how cryptocurrency market sentiment on social media has changed amid the latest bearish downturn. The indicator of relevance here is the Social Dominance, which keeps track of the percentage of social media discussions related to the top 100 coins by market cap that a particular asset or group of assets is contributing right now. The indicator measures the degree of discussion or talk related to an asset by counting up the number of posts that are making unique mentions of it. The reason it doesn‚Äôt count up the mentions themselves is that they can provide a false picture of the trend being followed in the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Top Above $168,500 Based On This Indicator, Analyst Reveals Focusing on just the posts means that a few outlier ones with hundreds of mentions can‚Äôt skew the data by themselves and the metric only registers a spike when discussion is spread across the major social media platforms. In the context of the current topic, the Social Dominance of two asset classes is of interest: the Layer 1 Top 6 and the Memecoin Top 6. The former includes the six largest layer 1 networks (that is, blockchains that handle their own security and aren‚Äôt built on top of another network, like Bitcoin) and the latter the six largest meme-based tokens (like Dogecoin). Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Social Dominance for these two types of cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks: As displayed in the graph, the Social Dominance of the Memecoin Top 6 was high a couple of weeks ago, implying social media users were highly interested in Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and other such tokens. Since then, however, the metric has followed an overall downward trajectory for this class of assets. It would appear that investor attention has shifted to Bitcoin and other layer 1 assets, as their combined social dominance has risen during the same period. Historically, whenever Dogecoin and other memecoins have been at the center of attention in the market, it has been a sign that the investors are becoming greedy. Related Reading: XRP Could Be The Altcoin To Recover Quickly, CryptoQuant Analyst Explains Why Cryptocurrency markets generally tend to move against the expectations of the majority, so it may not be a surprise that this greedy sentiment was followed by a downturn in the sector. The shift in Social Dominance to safer investments like Bitcoin would imply the investors are now becoming fearful. It‚Äôs possible that the sector would continue to decline in the coming days, but at least with the sentiment seeing a flip, there is more of a chance that a bottom can be reached. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.31, down more than 24% over the last seven days.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

Conclusion With excellent profits in 2017, Ethereum changed the scene of distributed apps (dApps) and smart contracts. Then, in 2021, Solana attracted the market‚Äôs interest by blazing blockchain scalability and speed. One issue many investors wonder about as the sector develops is which altcoin will copy these spectacular profits in 2025. One competitor that stands out is Rexas Finance (RXS) , a concept ready to rethink asset tokenization completely. Rexas Finance is a top choice for investors wishing to profit from the next great opportunity since analysts estimate gains of up to 10,000% by 2025. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Ethereum‚Äôs 2017 ascent The explosive climb of Ethereum in 2017 was just amazing. Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain‚Äôs release helped distributed apps (dApps), distributed finance (DeFi), and ‚Äî above all‚Äî smart contracts ‚Äî which let developers create programmable assets‚Äîto emerge. Ethereum surged from roughly $8 in early 2017 to over $1,400 by January 2018 due to this invention, generating a tsunami of demand from institutional investors, developers, and regular users. Ethereum‚Äôs success came from its strong ecosystem of projects and developers and its unique capacity to offer a venue for creating distributed apps. Despite significant obstacles, including high transaction fees and scalability problems, Ethereum stayed a prominent participant in the market, and its success encouraged a fresh round of blockchain initiatives. Solana: The 2021 sensation By 2021, Solana became the next major altcoin with significant potential profits. Early investors would find exceptional gains as SOL‚Äôs price skyrocketed from about $1 at the start of the year to over $200 by the year‚Äôs conclusion. The scalability of Solana and the expanding DeFi and NFT ecosystems created on its platform drove its success. Solana is still a prominent player in the blockchain market despite network failures and technical problems in 2022; many think it has great potential for development in the following years. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 Rexas Finance: The next 10,000% altcoin? One altcoin that is attracting significant attention as we approach 2025 is Rexas Finance . Rexas Finance addresses a distinct challenge: tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), while Ethereum and Solana concentrate mainly on dApps and blockchain scalability. The project seeks to tokenize tangible and financial assets, including real estate, commodities, and intellectual property, generating more liquidity and accessibility for investors. Rexas Finance could upset established asset markets using blockchain technology to permit fractional ownership and enable smooth trade of tokenized assets. This invention will democratize access to valuable assets, appealing to regular consumers and institutional investors. The project‚Äôs ecosystem includes a suite of tools for asset tokenization, including the Rexas Token Builder, QuickMint Bot, and the GenAI system, simplifying the process of creating and managing digital assets. The presale performance of Rexas Finance is among its most interesting developments. With tokens valued at $0.15 in Stage 10, Rexas Finance is in the middle of a successful presale as of writing. $29,341,073 has been raised for the presale so far, and early backers of the project are hopeful about its exponential expansion once it launches on tier-1 exchanges in 2025. Being an exciting altcoin for long-term expansion, some analysts estimate RXS might experience a price spike of up to 10,000% by the end of 2025. Why might Rexas Finance be the next major altcoin? Rexas Finance‚Äôs unique value proposition and capacity to solve critical issues in the asset management field define its potential for significant returns. By allowing the tokenization of actual assets, Rexas Finance is opening doors for most people, opening previously unreachable investing possibilities. Furthermore, appealing to institutional investors seeking blockchain-based solutions to manage their assets, the project emphasizes security, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Moreover, the success of Rexas Finance‚Äôs presale and expanding community will help indicate its significant expansion in 2025. Because of its constant creativity and emphasis on streamlining asset tokenization, Rexas Finance could be a candidate for the best altcoin with a 10,000% ROI in 2025. Conclusion Rexas Finance could be the next major altcoin to provide tremendous gains in 2025. With its emphasis on real-world asset tokenization, successful presale, and roadmap addressing important asset management issues, Rexas Finance is positioned for exponential development.

This is coming off the back of a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) by one of the leading voices in crypto security, Tayvano, also known as Tay, who raised concerns about the activities of hackers linked to the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK) on the Hyperliquid bridge. Tayvano‚Äôs post referenced some addresses linked to DPRK hackers who lost over $700,000 in trading on Hyperliquid. The alarm seems to have triggered major FUD in the Hyperliquid community, leading to a movement of over $114 million in USDC from the platform. According to Tayvano, the loss of $700,000 from those trading addresses wasn‚Äôt a mistake but a test to check for vulnerabilities on the platform. She said, ‚ÄúYall, DPRK doesn‚Äôt trade. DPRK tests.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the kind of news Hyperliquid expects after it recently recorded over $13 billion in a 24-hour trading volume thanks to increased trading activities on its platform fueled majorly by its airdrop event, which happened less than a month ago. Ironically, its liquidity could also be why it popped up on the hackers‚Äô radar. It‚Äôs worth noting that this isn‚Äôt the first time Tayvano has called the attention of the Hyperliquid team to the activities of North Korean hackers on its trading platform. Tay raised an alarm two weeks ago and offered to work with the Hyperliquid team to mitigate the risks DPRK hackers may pose to the platform. A trail of losses due to the Hyperliquid FUD As of this writing, Hyperliquid hasn‚Äôt released any comments, and its token, HYPE, is currently down by over 20%. Two major whales are liquidating close to $4 million of their assets. According to Entropy Advisors on X, Hyperliquid has four validators, and if three of these four validators are compromised, it can lead to a loss of $2.2 billion in USDC across the bridge. While this hasn‚Äôt happened yet and may never happen, the prospect hasn‚Äôt helped quell the ongoing FUD as it calls into question the security of the Hyperliquid platform. It also presents an ongoing issue for bridges in general. Blockchain bridges like Hyperliquid have been touted as the future of on-chain transactions; however, these bridges have been known to be relatively vulnerable to hacks . They account for over 31% of the total value of funds lost to hacks, according to Defillama . Popular bridge hacks such as the Ronin, Binance, and Nomad bridge hacks have resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions. Orbit chain, socket and ALEX bridge are the most recent bridges to suffer hacks and lose millions as a result of cross-chain vulnerabilities that exist on bridges. False alarm or sound advice The alert Tayvano raised has brought other players in the blockchain security space with opposing views into the conversation. Some professionals are advising the Hyperliquid team to look into the concerns Tayvano raised. The other side of the argument has referred to her as a prophet of doom who is deliberately trying to undermine the Hyperliquid team and cause FUD because the team won‚Äôt work with her. An X user (@PixOnChain) observing the impact of Tayvano‚Äôs post on users mentioned that the fear of a potential hack has led to the loss of over $2 billion off Hyperliquid‚Äôs market cap. The X user added that continuous education, collaboration, and strengthened security will help defend against FUDs. In a now-deleted post on X, Jared Grey, the ‚Äúhead chef‚Äù at Sushi Labs, while admitting his respect for Tayvano wrote that he believes that having an open forum to address claims of security issues on any protocol should be encouraged. He believes addressing these issues without generating FUD among users is easy and with the right coordination, attacks will be reduced. DPRK government-sponsored hackers are at the forefront of crypto hacks, accounting for the majority of the crypto thefts recorded. They are reported to have raked in over $1.34 billion from doing that this year alone. These hackers are known to carry out large-scale and small-scale operations, leading to intensified efforts by the US and other governments to clamp down on their activities. The campaign to crack down on these bad actors has led to increased sophistication in North Korean hacker operations, who also invent creative ways of gaining unauthorized access into crypto circles, including as staff members.

Table of Contents DOGEN: The ultimate meme token for true alphas ready to conquer the market Toncoin (TON): Cryptocurrency of the decentralized open network Aave: Decentralized lending and borrowing on Ethereum Sui: A scalable and user-friendly Layer-1 blockchain platform Aptos (APT): A scalable blockchain focusing on safety and flexibility Conclusion The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly changing, with emerging tokens poised to make significant moves. Some lesser-known digital assets might outperform major players like Solana and TRX by the end of 2024. This article uncovers five small-cap cryptocurrencies that could experience remarkable growth, capturing the attention of investors seeking the next big opportunity. You might also like: ETH and FLOKI set for breakouts, DOGEN smashes records with $4M presale DOGEN: The ultimate meme token for true alphas ready to conquer the market Imagine a life where luxury cars line a driveway, the bank account overflows with cash, and everyone keeps looking. That‚Äôs not just a fantasy ‚Äî that‚Äôs the DOGEN lifestyle. Designed for the ambitious, fearless, and always victorious, DOGEN isn‚Äôt just another meme coin; it‚Äôs the ultimate statement of dominance in the crypto space. HODL like a titan and rule the market DOGEN isn‚Äôt here to play small ‚Äî it‚Äôs here to dominate. With a jaw-dropping 700% surge projected before the presale even wraps up, this token is on track to hit the kind of explosive, thousand-fold gains that meme coins are known for this season. Ready to lead the charge? DOGEN is the opportunity to leave the competition in the dust. Get in early, lock position, and let others watch from the sidelines as early investors climb straight to the top. WIF, Popcat, Ponke? That was then ‚Äî DOGEN is now DOGEN is staking its claim as the alpha of the Solana blockchain, running shoulder-to-shoulder with giants like BONK, WIF, and Popcat; all of which have delivered legendary 1000% gains. This token is still flying under the radar, but not for long. With market trends shifting in its favor, DOGEN is positioned to smash through the charts during this bull run, setting new records and redefining what‚Äôs possible for meme coins. Build a DOGEN empire and get rewarded DOGEN isn‚Äôt just about gains ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building a legacy. The token‚Äôs airdrop campaign gives users the chance to flex an influence and stack massive rewards. All someone needs to do is spread the word on social media, grab tokens during the presale, and use a referral link to recruit others into the DOGEN movement. For every recruit, the user will earn a whopping 20% of their Golden Points from token purchases. The bigger the network, the more substantial their rewards, and the faster they rise to the top. DOGEN isn‚Äôt just another cryptocurrency; it‚Äôs a movement for those bold enough to seize the moment. The presale is heating up, the rewards are stacking high, and the path to dominance has never been clearer. Toncoin (TON): Cryptocurrency of the decentralized open network Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized, open-source layer-1 blockchain supported by the TON Foundation and community contributors. Initially developed by Telegram as Telegram Open Network with the ‚ÄòGram‚Äô token, the project was discontinued in May 2020 following an SEC court order. Renamed and continued by the community, Toncoin operates on a proof-of-stake consensus model, enhancing scalability and reliability. It aims to provide fast, secure payment services with minimal fees and develop an ecosystem that includes decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Toncoin shows potential for growth, suggesting attractiveness in the current market cycle. Aave: Decentralized lending and borrowing on Ethereum Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. Using smart contracts, Aave ensures transactions are managed by code rather than institutions. The platform supports 17 cryptocurrencies for lending and borrowing. Lenders receive aTokens, which represent their deposits and earn interest. A unique feature is flash loans, which are instant, require no collateral, and must be repaid within the same blockchain block. AAVE tokens offer benefits like fee reductions and voting rights on protocol changes, and can be used as collateral with added perks. The Safety Module provides a staking mechanism for risk mitigation. With its innovative technology, Aave holds significant potential in the DeFi space. Sui: A scalable and user-friendly Layer-1 blockchain platform Sui is a blockchain platform designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to use. It uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language to address issues in older blockchain systems. By introducing features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions, Sui aims to make blockchain applications more accessible to users. These innovations could help Sui gain wider adoption in the Web3 space. In the current market cycle, Sui‚Äôs focus on user experience and scalability may make it an attractive option for developers and users seeking efficient blockchain solutions. Aptos (APT): A scalable blockchain focusing on safety and flexibility Aptos (APT) is a new blockchain designed to address high transaction fees and network congestion found in systems like Ethereum before its Proof-of-Stake transition. Developed by Aptos Labs, founded by key contributors from Meta‚Äôs Diem project, it employs a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Aptos uses the Move programming language for smart contracts, highlighting safety, scalability, and flexibility. It supports a wide range of web3 applications. With its strong development team and focus on solving existing blockchain issues, Aptos has significant potential. In the current market cycle, its innovative approach to scalability and security may make it an attractive option for users and developers. Conclusion Though TON, AAVE, SUI, and APT show promise, they may offer less potential in the short term. DOGEN stands apart for those seeking the best in life, embodying luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of the presale with potential thousand-fold returns, it follows successful tokens like BONK and Popcat. DOGEN is building a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

With a presale price that‚Äôs less than your daily coffee fix (under $0.003), LCAI is gearing up to shake things up in both the AI and blockchain worlds. Some experts are throwing out bold predictions, with guesses as high as $2 in just 12 months‚Äîtalk about a glow-up! Let‚Äôs dive into why LCAI might be the next big thing to watch (and maybe invest in). 1. Unique AI-Blockchain Integration with Real-World Use Cases One of the main reasonsÕè for LCAI‚Äôs chance is its special skill to merge smart thinking with block chain tech. This mix makes LCAI different from many other coins in the market. While some projects may look at simple uses like DeFi or NFTs, LCAI brings AI-powered dApps to the block chain. This tech has many uses in the real world, across fields like money, health care, moving things and smart rule making. These areas are quickly using AI tools, and LCAI‚Äôs blockchain setup gives a place for these tools to grow well. As AI gets more and more key in digital change, the need for LCAI‚Äôs new tech will very likely soar, pushing its cost up. 2. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) ‚Äì A Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism Another factor that makes LCAI a strong contender for future growth is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW), PoI rewards network participants for performing AI computations‚Äîa first for the blockchain industry. By incentivizing meaningful AI tasks such as training machine learning models and running inferences, PoI ensures that the network is both secure and productive. This innovation not only makes LCAI more efficient but also provides tangible real-world value. As more developers and businesses realize the utility of LCAI‚Äôs PoI mechanism, the token could see rapid adoption and a corresponding price increase. 3. Deflationary Tokenomics Driving Long-Term Value LCAI‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics are another key reason why investors believe it could reach $2 within the next year. A portion of transaction fees in the LCAI network is burned, decreasing the total supply of tokens over time. This built-in scarcity mechanism creates upward pressure on the token‚Äôs price as demand increases. The burning of tokens also means that, over time, the total circulating supply of LCAI will be reduced, which can drive long-term value appreciation. As the demand for LCAI increases due to its real-world use cases and technological advancements, the deflationary model will help push the token‚Äôs price higher. 4. Institutional Whale Interest A Sign of Strong Future Growth LCAI has been attracting the attention of institutional investors and whales during its presale . This is a strong indicator of confidence in the token‚Äôs future potential. Large-scale investors typically focus on projects with strong technological foundations, real-world applications, and long-term growth potential. Whale interest in LCAI signals that these investors see a significant upside in the token. As more institutional players enter the market, the price of LCAI could see a dramatic surge, as these whales often control a significant portion of the supply, creating price pressure. Additionally, institutional backing often leads to increased market credibility, encouraging more retail investors to jump on board. LCAI‚Äôs Path to $2 With its unique AI and blockchain integration, innovative PoI consensus mechanism, deflationary tokenomics, and growing institutional interest, LCAI is primed for significant growth. While the current price is still under $0.003, the trajectory points toward substantial upside. With projected growth to $2 within the next 12 months, LCAI could become one of the top-performing assets in the crypto market. As the world continues to embrace AI technology and digital transformation, LCAI could become a major player in this space, making it an exciting token to watch for potential investors.

Amidst this fervor, an intriguing altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) , is quietly gaining momentum, promising an astonishing upside that could reach 50,000%. As the Bitcoin price continues to capture headlines with its potential rally toward $150,000, the cryptosphere is also witnessing the emergence of hidden altcoin gems like RCOF, which may redefine investment strategies in this dynamic market. Bitcoin Price Targets $150,000: A Perfect Storm of Catalysts The remarkable Bitcoin price journey in 2024, characterized by a 140% surge and a groundbreaking milestone of $100,000, has set the stage for an even brighter 2025. This rally was fueled by pivotal events, including the launch of Bitcoin Spot ETFs and Bitcoin‚Äôs fourth halving, which reduced block rewards and increased issuance scarcity. Institutional investors eagerly embraced the newly available ETFs, with holdings now accounting for 5% of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply. This institutional demand underscored Bitcoin‚Äôs growing appeal as an asset and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. The pro-crypto political shift in the United States further boosted the Bitcoin price performance. Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the 2024 presidential election ushered in policies that foster a favorable crypto environment, including a proposed national Bitcoin reserve. Technical analysis forecasts that the Bitcoin price potential will exceed $150,000 in 2025. The convergence of these catalysts has positioned Bitcoin not just as the market leader but as a beacon of transformative financial potential for the years ahead. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Hidden Altcoin Gem Amidst the Bitcoin price projected rally, RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a noteworthy altcoin, attracting attention for its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). RCOF integrates AI to improve trading strategies, offering real-time market analysis, automated trading, and personalized investment guidance. The platform‚Äôs standout feature is its advanced crypto AI robo-advisor, designed for novice and seasoned investors alike. This tool analyzes individual user profiles, assessing financial goals and risk tolerances to create tailored investment strategies that evolve with market conditions. Unlike conventional trading platforms, which require constant monitoring, RCOF‚Äôs robo-advisor operates autonomously, making real-time portfolio adjustments based on fluctuating market dynamics. RCO Finance sets itself apart with advanced AMM, using AI to automate trades, reduce human error, and optimize execution for consistent returns. Audited by SolidProof, its secure smart contracts improve user confidence in a crypto industry often plagued by fraud, ensuring reliability and efficiency for investors. Another key aspect of RCOF is its expansive access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate and commodities. This diversity allows investors to construct well-rounded portfolios that not only mitigate risks but also maximize potential returns. The tokenization of RWAs democratizes investment opportunities previously reserved for institutional players, enabling fractional ownership and opening new avenues for wealth generation. Moreover, RCO Finance offers an impressive leverage option of up to 1,000x, a rarity in the crypto space. This high leverage allows traders to amplify their investments significantly, achieving substantial returns even with smaller capital outlays. Why RCOF Altcoin is the Perfect Investment Option RCO Finance is currently conducting an altcoin presale, allowing early investors to acquire RCOF tokens at a favorable price point. In its fourth presale stage, RCOF altcoins are priced at $0.0777 each, with an additional 25% extra altcoins on purchase using the code RCOF25. Projections suggest that the token value could reach $0.60 at launch, offering early investors over 600% ROI. Beyond presale gains, RCOF token holders may benefit from reduced transaction fees, dividend distributions, and voting rights in governance decisions, providing financial incentives and a voice in the platform‚Äôs development. As the Bitcoin price oscillates towards a $150,000 rally, now is the time to consider diversifying your portfolio with promising projects like RCO Finance, as the altcoin market will follow a similar trend. Don‚Äôt miss this chance; join the RCO Finance presale today and capitalize on the potential market uptick!

FXGuys ($FXG) is quickly gaining attention as one of the most promising tokens for such returns. Unlike speculative projects like Bonk or storage-based solutions like Filecoin, FXGuys brings real utility to the table. Its focus on trading rewards, staking, and its Trader Funding Program makes it stand out. Let‚Äôs dive into what makes FXGuys the token to watch. What Sets FXGuys Apart? FXGuys is more than just a crypto token. It‚Äôs part of a larger ecosystem designed for traders and investors. Built as a top PropFi project , it merges traditional finance tools with decentralized finance innovation. Key Features Trade2Earn Model : Every trade earns users $FXG tokens , whether they make a profit or not. This encourages activity and drives token utility. Trader Funding Program : FXGuys gives traders access to up to $500,000 in trading capital , allowing them to profit without risking their own money. Staking Rewards : Users can stake $FXG tokens and earn passive income, creating steady demand for the token. These features show that FXGuys is focused on long-term growth and real-world value, unlike the speculative nature of Bonk or the niche use case of Filecoin. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Why FXGuys Beats Bonk Bonk gained popularity as a meme token, but its value relies on hype and speculation. It lacks meaningful utility, which limits its long-term potential. In contrast, FXGuys has a solid foundation. The Trade2Earn model ensures that $FXG remains valuable because it‚Äôs tied to actual activity on the platform. Traders earn rewards while adding liquidity and utility to the ecosystem. Bonk might offer short-term spikes, but FXGuys provides sustainable growth, making it a better choice for investors looking to turn $100 into $10,000. Why Filecoin Can‚Äôt Compete Filecoin offers decentralized storage solutions, making it a useful project within its niche. However, its growth depends on enterprise adoption, which can be slow and unpredictable. FXGuys , on the other hand, appeals directly to crypto traders‚Äîa highly active and growing market. The Trader Funding Program attracts professional and retail traders, ensuring consistent demand for $FXG tokens. Filecoin‚Äôs utility is limited to storage, while FXGuys powers trading, staking, and rewards, making it more versatile. How FXGuys Delivers $100 to $10,000 Returns FXGuys combines multiple revenue streams and growth drivers to achieve explosive potential. 1. High Utility The Trade2Earn model ensures that $FXG tokens are in constant demand. As trading activity increases, the token‚Äôs value grows. 2. Staking Opportunities Staking $FXG tokens not only generates passive income but also reduces circulating supply, creating scarcity that drives up prices. 3. Trader Funding Program The funding program brings more traders to the platform, increasing liquidity and overall ecosystem activity. This consistent growth boosts the token‚Äôs long-term value. 4. Community and Adoption FXGuys is attracting both professional and retail traders, creating a diverse and active user base. The more users join the platform, the greater the demand for $FXG tokens. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The Road Ahead for FXGuys FXGuys isn‚Äôt just about speculation; it‚Äôs about creating real value for users. By offering tools like the Trader Funding Program and staking rewards , it has built an ecosystem that rewards participation. Bonk‚Äôs reliance on hype and Filecoin‚Äôs niche focus can‚Äôt compete with FXGuys‚Äô broader appeal. Investors seeking massive returns should consider FXGuys for its utility, scalability, and market-driven growth. Conclusion FXGuys is a token built for the future. It combines real-world utility, trading rewards, and staking to create an ecosystem that grows with its users. Bonk may capture attention in the short term, and Filecoin serves its niche, but FXGuys offers the best chance to turn $100 into $10,000 . For investors looking to capitalize on a high potential altcoin , FXGuys is the token to watch. Its innovation and long-term focus make it a standout choice in the ever-evolving crypto market.

This Viral Layer-1 Presale is Set to Be a Crypto Game-Changer,https://thecoinrise.com/didnt-catch-binance-coin-this-viral-layer-1-presale-is-set-to-be-a-crypto-game-changer/,"The cryptocurrency market has been on fire recently, with new developments shaking up the blockchain landscape. Binance Coin (BNB), the trusted token of the Binance ecosystem, has continued to be a cornerstone in the crypto world. At the same time, an exciting new player, Qubetics ($TICS) , has emerged as a viral Layer-1 project that‚Äôs already breaking records. These two tokens couldn‚Äôt be more different, but they‚Äôre both among the top cryptos to watch right now. Let‚Äôs dive into why Binance Coin is still a favourite for many, and how Qubetics is setting the stage to become a game-changer. Whether you‚Äôre chasing established reliability or early-stage innovation, this comparison will help you decide where to focus your energy. Qubetics ($TICS): The Revolutionary Layer-1 Blockchain Qubetics isn‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill crypto project. As the first Web3 aggregator, it‚Äôs designed to unify blockchain functionalities in a way that no one has done before. Already in its 14th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 372 million tokens, raising more than $7.5 million from 11,500 holders. Priced at $0.0377 per token, this presale is creating quite the buzz, especially with a 10% price hike set to kick in by the weekend. Analysts are calling Qubetics one of the top cryptos to watch right now, with jaw-dropping ROI predictions. With a $100,000 investment today, you could snag about 2.65 million $TICS tokens. At the projected price of $15 post-mainnet launch, that could turn into a mind-blowing $39.7 million. Cross-Border Payments: Real-Life Solutions for Everyone Imagine a startup in Kenya needing to pay a freelance developer in India. Traditional bank transfers can take days, and fees often eat into profits. With Qubetics, that transaction becomes instantaneous and nearly free. Its cross-border payment feature removes the need for intermediaries, making global payments faster and more affordable. Small businesses, freelancers, and even large corporations stand to benefit. A logistics company in Dubai can now streamline payments to suppliers in Southeast Asia without worrying about fluctuating exchange rates or banking delays. This is what makes Qubetics so revolutionary‚Äîit addresses real-world pain points and bridges gaps left by traditional systems. Why Qubetics is a Must-Watch With its viral presale and practical applications like cross-border payments, Qubetics is poised to reshape the crypto landscape. It‚Äôs not just a token; it‚Äôs a solution. If you‚Äôre looking for the top cryptos to watch right now , Qubetics offers innovation and potential that are hard to match. Binance Coin (BNB): The Reliable Cornerstone Binance Coin has been a staple in the crypto space for years, thanks to its role in the Binance ecosystem. As the utility token of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange, BNB has maintained its position as a go-to token for traders and developers alike. Trading at $224, it has weathered market volatility better than most, proving its reliability. Binance‚Äôs ongoing expansion, including regulatory compliance and licensing in major markets, has strengthened BNB‚Äôs position. The recent upgrades to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have added even more use cases, making it a hub for DeFi projects, NFTs, and dApps. Real-World Use Cases Driving Demand Think of Binance Coin as the Swiss Army knife of crypto. From paying lower transaction fees on Binance to participating in token launches, BNB‚Äôs versatility is unmatched. Its integration into the Binance Card and Binance Pay systems allows users to make everyday purchases seamlessly. For instance, someone in New York could buy coffee with BNB, while a traveller in Paris could pay for a hotel stay. The BSC ecosystem is also booming. Developers prefer its low transaction fees and high speeds, making it a popular choice for building decentralised applications. This constant demand ensures BNB remains a top contender among the top cryptos to watch right now. Why Binance Coin Deserves Its Spot Binance Coin‚Äôs strength lies in its stability and utility. While it may not offer the sky-high ROI potential of a presale like Qubetics, its reliability and widespread adoption make it a cornerstone for any diversified portfolio. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics and Binance Coin are both among the top cryptos to watch right now, offering unique benefits tailored to different investment goals. Qubetics represents the thrill of innovation, with its revolutionary Layer-1 blockchain and practical features like cross-border payments. Its viral presale success and staggering ROI potential make it an opportunity that‚Äôs hard to ignore. On the other hand, Binance Coin offers stability and proven utility. Its integration into everyday use cases and its role in the thriving Binance ecosystem make it a solid choice for long-term investors. If you‚Äôre ready to explore the future of crypto, consider joining the Qubetics presale at $0.0377 per token before the price hike this weekend. Whether you prefer the innovation of Qubetics or the reliability of Binance Coin, these two projects are shaping the crypto market in their own unique ways.

The benefits would be captured by a new oracle, a Smart Value Recapture (SVR), which was released on December 23. The SVR oracle will capture profits from maximum extractable value (MEV) to benefit DeFi protocols. At the same time, Aave suggested adding SVR ‚Äúto recapture MEV from Aave liquidations and return it to the Aave ecosystem.‚Äù Blockbuilders have occasionally enjoyed profits from MEV by simply reordering transactions before releasing finished blocks to the public blockchain ledger. Aave plans to redirect 40% of MEV profits to users With Aave, users can use other crypto assets as collateral while borrowing cryptocurrency. However, the user risks forfeiting the collateral if its value declines too much. Part of the proposal reads: Whenever a position needs to be liquidated, [a third-party] liquidator repays some debt and receives the equivalent value in collateral, plus a percentage on top denominated liquidation bonus. The system has been classic, but recently, there has been a problem that calls for an update of the MEV system. The forfeiture or liquidation bonus is a clear and direct chance for MEV to create a good profit for the builder. Yet, in this case, the builder does the minimum. On the contrary, the protocol users receive very little in proportion. This needs rectification. According to Aave, Chainlink‚Äôs SVR is a service that sells, via an MEV-Share auction, ‚Äúthe right to back-run‚Äù Chainlink‚Äôs price-feed oracle and profit from liquidations. To benefit users, the DeFi protocol intends to redirect nearly 40% of MEV profits to Aave DAO. Ethereum users and protocols turn to private transactions for MEV protection Users and protocols are currently protecting against MEV. Most protocols and users across the Ethereum network are deliberately trying to run away from the costs of harmful MEVs. There are a lot of private transactions in Ethereum‚Äôs order flow as users are out to protect trades. Users prefer to go through the dark pool arrangement , sending transactions directly to validators instead of sending orders through the public queue. Private orders are sent to validators directly for protection against MEV.

PEPE: The deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary meme coin launched on the Ethereum network, inspired by the early 2000s internet meme, Pepe the Frog. It seeks to emulate the success of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, featuring no transaction taxes and embracing a pure meme coin identity with no utility. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and sparking a meme coin frenzy. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. The coin incorporates a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, supporting its stability. In the current market cycle, PEPE continues to attract interest due to its strong community and unique features. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. The coin started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB aims for broader utility by developing platforms like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and governance system. Its integration with Ethereum allows for potential growth in decentralized applications. Conclusion While PEPE and SHIB may offer limited short-term gains, DOGEN is designed for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and the potential for thousand-fold returns during this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. Building a community of alpha leaders, it provides real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 03:55:00

Analysts are still optimistic, as the XRP price has slightly recovered in recent hours, even after being weighed down by macroeconomic factors like the Federal Reserve‚Äôs revised rate cut. Similarly, amidst this uncertainty, investors are shifting to an emerging altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF). This innovative altcoin integrates AI-powered Robo-advisor and blockchain technology to transform how we invest. Additionally, analysts predict a 12,000% ROI by January, which could outpace the XRP price performance. XRP Price: Is it the Beginning of a Bear Market? The XRP price experienced a significant single-day loss, falling by 7% amidst the broader market downturn, with the 24-hour range between $1.98 and $2.70. At press time, the XRP price is trading at $2.16, a 7.3% decline in the past 24 hours. The XRP price decline coincided with the Federal Reserve announcement to reduce expected rate cuts for 2025, which has dampened optimism in risk markets such as crypto. Despite the XRP price decline, the token has found strong support just below its current level, giving hope to investors. Similarly, analysts remain optimistic about the XRP price recovery. One analyst, Dark Defender, tweeted on X, noting that a clear breakout is on the daily chart, and predicted that the XRP price might test the $2.42 level. If the momentum continues, the XRP price will push past $2.92. As the XRP price wavers, the spotlight is shifting to more dynamic projects like RCO Finance, an altcoin with a focus on redefining trading using cutting-edge AI technology and blockchain technology. RCO Finance: The Rival Altcoin Poised for 12,000% ROI by January While XRP struggles, RCO Finance (RCOF) is making headlines as an altcoin with exponential growth potential. The RCOF altcoin‚Äôs innovative blend of AI and blockchain technology will transform investors with cutting-edge tools for wealth creation. The RCOF altcoin‚Äôs main appeal is its AI-powered Robo-advisor . This tool analyses market conditions in real-time to provide investors with personalized investment strategies. It‚Äôs like having a personal finance advisor available 24/7 to optimize your portfolio and minimize risks. For example, the crypto market is quite volatile making many investors struggle with decision-making. With the Robo-advisor, the tool can monitor market fluctuations and identify actionable insights to help investors minimize losses and maximize returns. Similarly, with RCOF altcoin, users can stay ahead of market changes regardless of expertise level. Again, the RCO finance platform gives users access to over 120,000 tradable assets, including crypto, stocks, bonds, FX, ETFs, and real-world assets like commodities and real estate. With this diversification, investors can spread risks and maximize their returns. The RCO Finance platform prioritizes privacy and anonymity with its KYC-free approach. This enables a frictionless onboarding process by avoiding the lengthy ID verification. Investors who prefer anonymity and privacy will find value in the RCOF altcoin. Besides these gains, the RCOF users will enjoy reduced transaction fees and dividends and actively participate in the platform‚Äôs governance decisions. This gives investors direct influence over the RCOF altcoin growth and development. Finally, the RCOF altcoin prioritizes security. Hence, SolidProof has rigorously audited the platform to confirm that it‚Äôs free from vulnerabilities. Adherence to high-security standards boosts investor confidence in the RCOF altcoin. Is RCO Finance Worth the Investment? While the XRP price is battling bearish trends and market skepticism, the RCOF altcoin numbers speak for themselves.

Now Telegram, the hottest crypto town square, has an ICO right in the middle of it for the first time ever. It‚Äôs being fed directly to crypto noobs and veterans alike. And they don‚Äôt even need to leave their beloved messaging app. Buy, claim, and hold DOGIZ all from within Telegram. What‚Äôs more, simply holding an ICO gives Dogizen an advantage. Dogizen‚Äôs close competitors all unleashed their tokens via airdrop: good for rapid token distribution, bad for token price. This has caused Hamster Kombat, Catizen, DOGS, and Notcoin to all see tragically large slumps post-launch. Dogizen has learned from these mistakes. How the crypto bull run is ready to supercharge DOGIZ Every investor looking at the billion-dollar Telegram gaming market that Dogizen sits within has likely noticed something. Pretty much all of Dogizen‚Äôs competitors have, a) had Binance listings and b) smashed market caps of between $100 million and over $2 billion. And that‚Äôs despite their terrible, airdrop-induced performance. This success was happening before Q4 of this year when the market got really spicy. Unlike its competitors, Dogizen will hit the open market in Q1 of 2025. With Trump in office and a likely flood of pro-crypto regulation , Dogizen is set to catch the perfect wave. Dogizen is listing at what looks like a deliberately modest market cap of around $10 million. With no airdrop sell pressure and perfect market conditions inbound, Dogizen‚Äôs chart is eyeing up plenty of green. If Dogizen reaches the market caps of the Telegram gaming average, investors can expect a 50x. And for investors getting involved today, an additional 41.56% gains are in store. Dogizen is priced at just $0.000077. For now. You can buy DOGIZ on the official Dogizen website .",Sponsored,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 04:24:02

Led by CEO Ivan Soto Wright, the platform helps investors buy and sell cryptos as well as NFTs easily. It is like a PayPal but for cryptocurrencies. The project is capturing the spotlight as there are news about them acquiring Helio pay, a crypto payment gateway. MoonPay Role in Crypto Space MoonPay has launched innovative crypto payment solutions like MoonPay Balance. This is a fiat to crypto transfer tool that works seamlessly with wallets like MetaMask. Rolled out in 27 European countries last month, this feature gives users a straightforward way to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. But the company isn‚Äôt stopping there. A potential acquisition of Helio Pay, rumored to cost $150 million, might be their next big leap. Helio Pay Acquisition News Helio Pay is no small name in the crypto world. The platform is like Coinbase Commerce, helping over 6,000 merchants and creators accept payments in Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital currencies. It even integrates Solana Pay into Shopify, a platform with millions of users globally. This is going to be an amazing combo as MoonPay already serves more than 20 million users in over 160 countries. According to Eleanor Terrett from Fox Business, MoonPay is in in talks to acquire helio for about $150 million. Source : X.com If this acquisition goes through, this is going to be a big thing for crypto space especially for e-commerce merchants and their users. MoonPay will get to expand its reach and e-commerce will get enhancement with its services. How great would it be if you could use crypto to buy stuff online just like using a credit card ‚Äî easy and simple. Why This Matters This potential deal highlights MoonPay‚Äôs ambitions of making crypto transactions easier for individuals. This will reshape how businesses and users interact with cryptocurrencies. Adding Helio Pay to their portfolio would strengthen their infrastructure. This would finally bring crypto payments into the mainstream. As crypto adoption grows globally, this is the perfect time to bring such enhancements to crypto payments. What to Expect Next If the Helio acquisition deal is closed, this will likely spark even more innovations in the crypto payment space. The company already has a bright name because of its focus on easing the crypto payments, the new takeover will shine the name even more.

The uptick has been largely driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), government acquisitions, and MicroStrategy‚Äôs ramping up of its BTC strategy, which has seen its stash grow to over 440,000 BTC. ETFs, MicroStrategy, Drive Institutional Inflows According to statistics shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, most of the known Bitcoin holdings are in the hands of miners and crypto exchanges.¬†However, MicroStrategy, ETFs, and several governments have eaten into their shares. Launched earlier in the year, spot BTC ETFs have seen billions of dollars in inflows from traditional financial institutions, with the likes of BlackRock‚Äôs iShares recording a staggering $1.4 billion in net weekly inflows as of mid-December. Collectively, data shows the sector accounts for more than 1.3 million BTC, valued at an eye-popping $124.89 billion. MicroStrategy is also a major holder of the number one cryptocurrency. Its treasury, consisting of roughly 2% of BTC‚Äôs circulating supply, is worth $46.15 billion. The company has bought the cryptocurrency several times in the last few years, breaking the record for the biggest monthly purchase in November when it acquired 134,480 BTC in three successive tranches of 27,200, 51,780, and 55,500. The Virginia-based firm‚Äôs success has spawned several copycats, including Japanese company Metaplanet, which just bought another 619.70 BTC to bring its total holdings to 1,761.98 BTC worth nearly $170 million. Other private entities holding Bitcoin include Block.one, with 164,000 units of the asset, stablecoin issuer Tether, which has 82,454 BTC according to Bitcoin Treasuries, and Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, with 8,285 BTC valued at nearly $796 million. Defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox also maintains a sizable chest of the virtual asset, numbering 44,899. Governments as Major Gateways The U.S. leads the pack among governments, with 198,109 BTC worth an estimated $19 billion in its care. Many came from the Silk Road, an infamous online black market known for facilitating the sale of drugs and other illegal goods and services. To maintain the anonymity of its users, the platform employed BTC as its primary currency, of which thousands were seized by law enforcement after they shut down the website and arrested its founder, Ross Ulbricht . Despite an existing ban on crypto, China also boasts an impressive Bitcoin haul of about 190,000. The Kingdom of Bhutan is another major holder. Its treasury, derived from mining, has 11,688 BTC, currently valued at $1.12 billion. El Salvador, which became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, boasts nearly 6,000 coins, much of it accrued under President Nayib Bukele‚Äôs Bitcoin per day policy. In total, about 2.45% of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs circulating supply, valued at $49.36 billion, is controlled by states.

According to a Bloomberg report , Singapore issued 13 crypto licenses to various operators in 2024. This includes major players like OKX and Upbit and global firms such as Anchorage, BitGo, and GSR. This marked a significant jump, more than doubling the number of licenses issued the previous year. Meanwhile, Hong Kong‚Äôs similar licensing program has been moving at a slower pace. Both cities are competing to draw in digital-asset firms by offering supportive frameworks, tokenization initiatives, and regulatory sandboxes. Authorities in both jurisdictions view crypto as a way to strengthen their positions as global business hubs. However, their progress has been uneven. Angela Ang, a senior policy adviser at TRM Labs, explained, ‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs rules are stricter in areas like customer asset custody and token policies, which may have tilted the scale toward Singapore.‚Äù Major exchanges such as OKX and Bybit have withdrawn their applications for Hong Kong crypto licenses Hong Kong‚Äôs licensing process has faced delays, with regulators aiming to approve more exchanges by the end of the year. So far, the city has fully licensed seven platforms, including four with restrictions granted on December 18, while another seven hold provisional crypto licenses.

The automation and security they provide are on a higher level than traditional systems, which explains their central role in DeFi and dApp development. In fact, it wouldn‚Äôt be an exaggeration to claim that they are key to blockchain progress. Atom Accelerator DAO recently wrote that CosmWasm, a powerful smart contract platform and the only one in Cosmos, was being defunded. CosmWasm enables developers to write and launch smart contracts on Cosmos SDK-based blockchains. It‚Äôs highly appreciated by developers, but apparently not businesses, at least at this time. The defunding is a fact, although CosmWasm is probably the most widely used platform after Solidity. Its open licensing model has allowed for its proliferation, benefiting a vast community. Raising funds for CosmWasm is critical CosmWasm is designed for interoperability and modularity, extending blockchain functionality by making it possible to create dApps and other blockchain solutions with dynamic logic. The unique properties of the Solidity programming language and EVM make unit testing in Solidity challenging, but testing in CosmWasm is easy and accessible. There is no way of migrating a project to another blockchain or composing across chains in Ethereum. CosmWasm provides this capacity by building upon the Cosmos SDK and IBC. CosmWasm is deployed on multiple interlinked blockchains, which reduces the strain on any single one, ensures low fees, and improves overall scalability. This benefits users as well as developers, enabling more efficient and cost-effective smart contract execution. CosmWasm uses Rust, a safe and modern programming language suitable for smart contract development. Rust is also used outside of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum and Solana, the two largest smart contract platforms, leverage it as well. Atom Accelerator DAO cites an analysis of 15 blockchains over the past year, which reveals shocking statistics that completely justify incredulity at CosmWasm‚Äôs defunding. 5.2 million accounts interacted with 15,700 deployed CosmWasm contracts in that time frame, and those contracts generated $5.7 million in fees. What‚Äôs more, building apps on CosmWasm is much more straightforward than a full-on Cosmos SDK app chain. Thanks to its modular design and seamless integration with Cosmos SDK, the smart contract platform has helped position the Cosmos ecosystem as a leader in decentralized, multichain applications. Positions of the funder and the developer The Interchain Foundation (ICF), which has been funding CosmWasm through Confio, a platform developing CosmWasm since 2020, underwent organizational restructuring. As a result, it has drastically reduced Confio‚Äôs funding for 2025. As Atom Accelerator DAO points out, this is a massive blow to the infrastructure powering an entire ecosystem and facilitating cross-chain interoperability. Specifically, ICF funding to Confio for 2025 is 28% of the funding for 2024. Assuming the same cost levels, this would cover just over three months of service. Confio will continue security and upgrades for the platform until mid-2025, intending to stretch this budget to half a year somehow. The funding issue is not recent. Confio announced they were pausing operations due to a lack of funding back in February 2023 . The organization wrote that its team of developers and blockchain experts had not received funding for their work since October 2022. They reached out to most CosmWasm-enabled chains and several major projects but failed to obtain funding for general ecosystem utilities. They were advised to monetize CosmWasm, but found no way to charge fees for the source code or core library licenses ‚Äúwhile remaining relevant.‚Äù At the time, they hoped to generate revenue through consulting work to build utilities on top of the CosmWasm stack. Still, defunding is a fact. Aligned with the conviction that CosmWasm is a critical resource for the interchain and that its development must go on, Atom Accelerator DAO has proposed to contribute $250,000 to a funding effort. Neutron‚Äôs initial commitment of the same amount kickstarted the initiative. While half a million dollars is definitely a good start, the funding isn‚Äôt enough for the year as CosmWasm consists of modules, tools, libraries, and documentation across almost two dozen repositories. Implications of CosmWasm‚Äôs silent collapse and how to prevent it The developments draw attention to a glaring issue in blockchain ‚Äì entities want to benefit from the ease of use and security of decentralized protocols and smart contracts but not invest in them. It‚Äôs impossible to overstate the benefits of smart contract applications. They increase efficiency, reduce counterparty risk, lower costs, and enhance transparency. CosmWasm addresses many security issues in Solidity, such as reentrancy attacks, a common DeFi exploit. It also provides more streamlined contract migration instead of adopting a proxy pattern and does away with multiple language elements, which were often misused, such as tx.origin for security. Confio writes that CosmWasm‚Äôs needs have been increasing in parallel to the number of users and the ecosystem, concluding that the platform has grown too large and they ‚Äúcan no longer afford to subsidize it.‚Äù The solution is in the hands of individuals and organizations with a vested interest in the growth and success of blockchain technology. Venture capitalists stand to gain returns on investment as smart contract platforms form the backbone of DeFi. Tech companies and blockchain startups use smart contracts for their products and build complementary technologies, like Layer 2 solutions or dApps. Finally, financial institutions use smart contracts to automate financial transactions, reduce costs, and increase transparency. The blockchain world can only hope they will step in at this critical time.",Information,EN,0,0,ATOM|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 04:45:10

According to analysts XRP market remains in an uptrend on the larger time frame, with key support found between $1.50 and $1.79. As long as XRP holds above these levels, the focus is on higher price targets. However, it is essential to note that the market remains fragile, as the breakout point is not yet fully established. Consolidation Phase and Potential for Higher Prices At present, XRP is consolidating, but there is still potential for upward movement. A successful breakout and further momentum could lead to an attack on the all-time high, which remains a strong possibility in the near future. However, a drop below the $1.96 level would shift the focus to the key support zone, between $1.50 and $1.79. Short-Term Outlook: Sideways Consolidation The price action appears to be in a sideways consolidation pattern, similar to what is seen on the HBAR chart. This consolidation could represent an Elliott Wave triangle pattern, which often leads to boring price movements. The triangle consists of five waves, and we are currently in the process of completing these waves. To confirm the continuation of this pattern, XRP would need to hold above the low of the C-wave at $1.94. If the price falls below $1.94, XRP could enter the Fibonacci support zone between $1.39 and $1.80, where further consolidation or correction may occur. Conclusion: Waiting for Confirmation Currently, there is little new development in the market, as XRP is either consolidating or showing minimal movement. The key levels to watch are $1.96 to the downside and the B-wave high around $2.72 to the upside. Any movement beyond these points will give clearer direction, but until then, we remain in a wait-and-see mode.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 05:00:11

There is serious talk about the US looking to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset to expand its influence in the cryptocurrency space. The crypto experienced a price surge to $105,000 after President Donald Trump stated his intention to create an SBR in an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer. The report states that Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity, portability, and decentralization make it a valuable complement to traditional reserves like gold. The move to establish a Bitcoin reserve is an effort to diversify the United States‚Äô national assets. Embracing the digital asset would also help the country hedge against systematic financial risks and secure an advantage over competitors. No restrictions on this side In his report, Matthew Pines states that BTC is an ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù opportunity for the US if it intends to win the strategic competition with the ‚Äúgeopolitical opportunists‚Äù and ‚Äúaggressive rivals‚Äù the administration will face for the next four years. In his report, he urges that the US take full advantage of the ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù to reinforce its position as a leader in financial innovation and bolster long-term fiscal sustainability. ‚ÄúChina made a strategic error when they banned Bitcoin and kicked their miners out in 2021. The US was the fortunate beneficiary of that mistake as miners relocated to our shores,‚Äù Matthew Pines states in his report. Over the years, the Chinese government has placed many restrictions on mining and cryptocurrency in an effort to maintain financial control and prevent capital outflows. The US already owns the largest BTC holdings, and the creation of the SBR would be the opposite of China‚Äôs economic model. To Scott Bessent, Pines says, ‚ÄúIn your role as Treasury Secretary, you can urge the President to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by Executive Order on Day 1.‚Äù Likely scenarios of a Bitcoin reserve The US stands to gain three critical benefits from the SBR according to the report. Firstly, it would send a signal that America supports Bitcoin and draw in capital to the markets reinforcing the strength of the financial system. Secondly, it would give the US a headstart among other nations adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This would mitigate the risk of other countries, some hostile and some not, making the move first. Lastly, it would secure the sustainability of the US‚Äôs fiscal position and renew the confidence in the treasury market. Pines‚Äô report is complete with a scenario analysis that explores the primary and secondary effects the SBR would have on the US economy if Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization were to reach different milestones, assuming the reserve had a total of $1M BTC. In every scenario, he found that holding more Bitcoin than allies and competitors benefits the US more than not investing in the rapidly growing asset. By Pines‚Äô calculations, the strategic Bitcoin reserve will save the US from adversaries. In the National Security Fellow‚Äôs words; ‚ÄúFailure to act risks ceding ground to adversaries who aim to dismantle the foundations of US economic and geopolitical power.‚Äù A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-24 05:01:16

MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin accumulation has attracted many new companies to follow the path; however, things at his den are unfavorable. With an argument that such hoarding would disrupt the company‚Äôs financial position, many shareholders denied Michael Saylor‚Äôs accumulation plans earlier. Will Saylor‚Äôs special proposal change the company‚Äôs fate? Well, that will be answered in the future. Until then, let‚Äôs sit back and read on to the proposal and community reaction. What‚Äôs in the 21/21 Plan? The 21/21 plan aims to raise $21 billion through equity financing and another $21 billion through bond issuance over three years. Saylor has already clarified that these funds will be used to buy more Bitcoin to showcase the company‚Äôs commitment to Bitcoin. Since mid-2020, MicroStrategy has already acquired 444,262 BTC, now worth around $42 billion, making it the fourth-largest Bitcoin holder globally. As an outcome, the company‚Äôs market cap has skyrocketed from $1.1 billion to $82 billion, and its shares have risen 477% this year. Key Proposals on the Table MicroStrategy has proposed increasing Class A shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion and raising preferred stock authorization from 5 million to 1.005 billion to support future financing and expand funding options. Plus, the company plans to update its equity incentive plan to grant automatic equity awards to new board members, aligning their compensation with its Bitcoin-focused strategy. This will ensure that the company is not out of funds at any time. Institutional adoption is driving Bitcoin‚Äôs growth‚Äîwhat‚Äôs next for its price? Read Bitcoin price prediction for expert insights! Community Reactions is Mixed The notice has sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community. A Twitter user Asymmetry clarified such shareholder voting is a long and time-consuming process, hence it allows gradual share issuance that can take over 10-15 years to fund Bitcoin purchases. This shows Saylor‚Äôs plan to hoard Bitcoin for a long time. However, some users, like @ibills, criticized the approach, suggesting shareholders should first see the results of current strategies before agreeing to further dilution. They argued that shareholder benefits, such as stock splits, should take priority before continuing payouts to others. It also means a massive liquidation fear in the future. Trump is also pushing his Bitcoin Reserve Plan in the US to strategically leverage the new adoptions and give the US economy an instant boost under his leadership. At this time Saylor is also giving companies in the US a hard time by putting his 21/21 Bitcoin plan at the forefront. While the market is down such accumulation plans signal Saylor‚Äôs long-term plan of buying the dip. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

We believe it's quite possible especially if spot continues to range here and as option sellers continue to roll their shorts out.‚Äù ""Rolling"" means that instead of letting their options expire, traders shift their positions to later expiration dates. This is often done to keep the trade active if they still believe in their market forecast. High volatility can be good for option buyers because it increases the chance that the option will be ‚Äúin-the-money‚Äù (profitable) at some point before expiry ‚Äî creating profit for buyers. ‚ÄúAs BTC continues to struggle below 100k, we could also see alts start to play catch up again,‚Äù QCP said, adding that a similar trend was observed a month ago when bitcoin was trading at current price levels. The ether/bitcoin ratio bounced off a 0.032 support at the time, as reported , spurring movement in altcoins. The crypto market often goes through cycles in which bitcoin leads the charge, followed by altcoins. Investors sitting on fresh market gains seek additional returns, and a flow of capital to altcoins leads to wild rallies in short periods. Bitcoin is currently going through one of its worst December months so far, dampening a seasonally bullish period with a 2% drop over the past 30 days. Hopes of a ‚ÄúSanta rally‚Äù ‚Äî where the asset tends to surge in the festive week ‚Äî have been dented amid profit-taking and a cautious mood after weeks of price bumps. Some are warning of further declines as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled fewer rate cuts for next year while stressing that it prohibits state holdings of BTC and doesn't seek a change in the law to do so. But a drop to the $90,000 level could spell renewed opportunity for market traders, FxPro‚Äôs Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email. ‚ÄúIn a potential shock scenario, bitcoin could suddenly dip into the $70K area. However, there are more chances that a pullback to $90K in the next couple of weeks will be attractive enough for buyers to stop the sell-off,‚Äù Kuptsikevich said. ‚ÄúMarkets continue to digest the Fed's tougher tone, reinforced by the accumulated urge to lock in profits after a strong year.‚Äù",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-24 05:10:53

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 05:20:00

A mad mashup of AI and meme culture, this project unleashes uncensored AI insanity on X . This AI model is trained entirely by degens who couldn‚Äôt care less about woke filters or safe strategies. It‚Äôs unpredictable, uncontrollable, and utterly unstoppable‚Äîand it could be the top crypto to buy right now. The frenzy has begun, and the hype over iDEGEN‚Äôs 70,000% surge is deafening. With its adaptive auction raking in $7.3m and its concept tearing through crypto X feeds like a digital wrecking ball, iDEGEN is here to reshape the future of AI meme coins. iDEGEN: Unfiltered, unstoppable, unpredictable iDEGEN is a ticking time bomb of chaos. Whatever the dev team originally intended, iDEGEN has decided to gun for something no project has dared to attempt: the Degen Singularity. This AI token is starting to go rogue, shedding any remaining human oversight as it evolves into a fully independent, self-governing force in the crypto space. iDEGEN is the community, and it thrives on pure chaos. Every tweet, every interaction, every degen rant it absorbs makes it smarter, wilder, and more unpredictable. iDEGEN doesn‚Äôt schedule ‚Äúfunny‚Äù posts or spit out sanitized nonsense. Instead, it spits 24/7 fire: roasting politicians , riffing on market trends , and occasionally vomiting out the dark humor that would make Silicon Valley blush. Nobody‚Äînot even its creators‚Äîhas the slightest clue what‚Äôs coming next. And if it goes too far? It could even get banned. Or be touted as the top crypto to buy. But that‚Äôs just part of the thrill. And with $7.3m already raised, IDGN is defying expectations. Love it or hate it, iDEGEN is not for the faint of heart, but for those who dare, the rewards could be legendary. Could iDEGEN 100x? Bet against it at your own risk iDEGEN is ready to obliterate everything we know about meme coins, which now have a market cap of over $130 billion . No other project has what iDEGEN does: an unfiltered, uncensored AI that feeds off the madness of its audience. Viral moments are built into its DNA, and in a space where hype reigns supreme, iDEGEN is stacking up attention like it‚Äôs printing money. With BTC smashing new ATHs day by day, the crypto market is frothing at the mouth. Inflation is steady, interest rates are down, and global liquidity surges like a tidal wave. Projects like GOAT have shown us just how far AI meme coins can go, ripping to $1 billion market caps in weeks. If you‚Äôre still sleeping on the AI meme coin trend or deciding on the top crypto to buy, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre missing: AI16Z is up 170% in the past month, and Fartcoin is up nearly 200% . But that‚Äôs nothing compared to Kolin ( 2,800% ) and DASHA ( 1,500% ). iDEGEN is already riding the wave of this explosive sector, and its potential to 100x isn‚Äôt just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs simple math. When the virality hits critical mass, this project could outshine its rivals and deliver life-changing gains to those who got in early. iDEGEN goes nuclear: Are you in? iDEGEN‚Äôs adaptive auction is live, and the degens aren‚Äôt wasting time. With a starting price of $0.00011, $7.3m raised, and tokens flying off the shelves, early money is already locking in its position. The price shifts every five minutes. One buyer keeps it steady. Two in a row, and the price jumps 5%. No buyers? It dips 5%. Crypto investing has become a warzone and only the bold will profit. Once the auction ends, any remaining tokens will be burned, providing a deflationary kick. The token will then debut on exchanges at 10% above its final presale price, meaning early investors will already be ahead of the pack. iDEGEN is perfectly positioned to dominate the headlines as the top crypto to buy this December.

The large-cap layer-one altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $27.6 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $285 million, has been forming a potential bullish continuation pattern. In the weekly time frame, the TON price has been forming a symmetrical descending triangular pattern, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) successively rebounds from the 50 percent level. Furthermore, the TON price has successfully rebounded from the 50-weekly Simple Moving Average (SMA), thus suggesting a potential rebound in the near term. Why Bet on Toncoin Recovery in 2025 The Toncoin network has grown to a robust web3 ecosystem bolstered by Telegram‚Äôs mini apps in the recent past. Already, the TON blockchain has achieved more than $1 billion in stablecoins, less than a year since Tether‚Äôs USDT integration. With a dozen DeFi projects, the TON project has grown to over $247 million in total value locked (TVL). According to on-chain data analysis by IntoTheBlock, Telegram‚Äôs mini apps led by Notcoin (NOT) have propelled TON‚Äôs daily active users to over 5 million. The @ton_blockchain emerged as a major success story in 2024, driven by the widespread adoption of its Telegram mini-apps. These applications drew mainstream attention, propelling TON‚Äôs daily active users to exceed 5 million by mid-year. pic.twitter.com/8RpTmHwHtv ‚Äî IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 23, 2024 The success of the Toncoin network is heavily bolstered by Telegram, which achieved annual profitability in 2024‚Äôs fiscal first. According to Pavel Durov, Telegram‚Äôs CEO and founder, the social media platform has over 12 million premium subscribers. As a result, Telegram reported surpassing a revenue of $1 billion in 2024 for the first time and currently holds more than $500 million in cash reserves, excluding crypto assets. Midterm Targets In the daily and weekly time frames, TON price is preparing for a major breakout after being trapped in a triangular pattern for the past few months. In case the TON price successfully breaks above the hypotenuse of the macro triangular pattern, a bull run beyond 10 will be imminent in 2025. From a bearish point of view, TON‚Äôs price could retest the support level around $4.44 before rebounding towards a new all-time high in the first half of 2025.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|TON,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 05:23:43

Moonshot tokens like Cardano ( ADA ), Fantom (FTM), and Lunex Network are in full bull run mode. While ADA and FTM are established cryptos that joined the bull run in mid-November, Lunex has exploded in presale since October. Read on to see why Lunex tops the list of moonshot tokens over ADA and FTM. Lunex‚Äôs presale continues to blow hot, tops moonshot lists Lunex Network is only two months into its presale, and experts are already calling it a moonshot token following its impressive rally. Since creating awareness, Lunex has significantly increased in value by 300% from $0.0012 to $0.0048. Lunex allows users to earn cashback on every transaction and unlock passive income by staking their $LNEX tokens for a set period. Lunex Network‚Äôs robust staking system offers an 18% annual percentage yield. Additionally, its revenue-sharing model rewards long-term holders and discourages sell-offs, helping to maintain the value of the native LNEX token. You can trade thousands of cryptocurrencies from major layer-1s like Solana to mem coins like Dogecoin with unlimited liquidity, benefiting from limited spreads, lightning-fast trade execution, and no slippage. Lunex provides users access to over 50,000 crypto tokens across 40 blockchain networks, eliminating the need for external or third-party wallets. ADA‚Äôs upswing form continues in December as it eyes record highs Cardano‚Äôs price all-time high of $3.10 was achieved in September 2021. Since then, ADA has traded mostly below $1 following the general industry bear run after. Experts, however, believe this is FTM and ADA‚Äôs closest chance to break their ATH. Recent market reports indicate that Cardano‚Äôs price rally coincides with the anticipated departure of Gary Gensler, chair of the US SEC. Indeed, ADA traded at $0.5 at the time of the announcement and has surged by over 130% to $1.22. On the surface analysis of Cardano price‚Äôs recent 130% surge appears to be driven by heightened short-term demand for low-valued assets, especially in the wake of SEC litigation. However, an intricate analysis of key on-chain data reveals that the ADA rally is primarily fueled by organic demand for projects built on its blockchain. As more users engage in DeFi transactions and deploy assets on the Cardano blockchain, the demand for ADA rises, driven by user‚Äôs need for transaction gas. Fantom (FTM) aims for $2 amid bull run, competes with ADA to break ATH FTM‚Äôs record high of $3.52 was achieved in October 2021. Like ADA , FTM has traded below the $1 mark since. However, since its November bull run , it has crossed the $1 threshold and now trades at $1.33. FTM has captured attention following an impressive price surge of nearly 90%, reaching its highest point in eight months. FTM‚Äôs rally has sparked renewed investor interest, with many closely tracking the token‚Äôs next potential moves. Key ecosystem developments, robust technical indicators, and a surge in trading volume have driven FTM‚Äôs bullish momentum. However, FTM investors are still cautious that the broader crypto market could still present potential downturns. The long-term sustainability of FTM‚Äôs price will depend on its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Like FTM , ADA‚Äôs investors are hesitant to go long despite bullish sentiment, leaving Lunex as the best crypto to invest in the short and long term.

If the deal pushes through, the firm is looking to spend about $150 million, which would be the company‚Äôs largest acquisition yet. MoonPay could compete with Coinbase Commerce directly According to Fox Business Journalist, Eleanor Terrett, MoonPay is still negotiating its acquisition of HelioPay for an estimated $150 million. While the specific deal terms have yet to be revealed, some are already speculating that if the Miami-based firm purchases Helio, it could soon rival Coinbase Commerce, a major player in self-service crypto payments. Helio already offers payments in Bitcoin, Ether, and multiple stablecoins to over 6000 e-commerce merchants and content creators, remaining a viable alternative to Coinbase Commerce. It even incorporated Solana Pay on its Shopify platform, which boasts close to 140 million monthly users. If MoonPay manages to acquire Helio, it could augment its crypto service offerings and possibly attract more users to its platform. MoonPay acquired its money transmitter license for its Texas operations Besides its recent negotiations with Helio, MoonPay has been working to broaden its presence in the e-commerce sector. For starters, the firm received its Money Transmitter License from the Texas Department of Banking this month. Now, the fintech company can operate in Texas freely allowing users to buy the 64 different cryptocurrencies on its platform through Venmo and PayPal. The company has even planned to allow its Texas users to sell different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and Ethereum by 2025.

Bitcoin surged high to form a new ATH and is currently passive, which suggests the altcoins may take over the rally. However, the popular ones within the top 10 have already initiated a decent rise much before. Now that the technicals have turned bullish for Dogecoin (DOGE) & Solana (SOL), a monstrous rally could be fast approaching. The TD-sequential indicator, used to determine the exact time of trend exhaustion and reversal, is regarded as a powerful tool. This indicator has just flashed a buy signal for both DOGE & SOL, anticipating a price rebound anytime from now. Besides, the Dogecoin price is accumulating within a narrow range, suggesting a strong breakout as selling pressure has dropped considerably. Despite rising upward pressure, the DOGE price remains in an ascending triangle, indicating a bullish pattern. The increase in volume indicates increased trading activity, which may maintain the token‚Äôs volatility. On the other hand, the RSI has triggered a rebound from the lower threshold, while the MACD, which is about to undergo a bullish crossover, validates the bullish claim. Therefore, the Dogecoin price is believed to remain accumulated within the pattern and reach the apex in early 2025, followed by a breakout towards a new ATH. Will Solana (SOL) Price Mark a New ATH in 2025? As mentioned earlier, the indicator has also flashed a bur signal for Solana that points towards a potential trend reversal. After a strong rebound, the price is heading firmly towards $200 and a yearly close above these levels may activate the higher targets above $300. Meanwhile, the interim bearish influence could be a matter of concern, which may prevent the rally from rising above $200. The daily chart of SOL price appears to be bullish as the token has triggered a storm rebound. However, the Ichimoku cloud that turned bearish maintains within the trend, suggesting a bearish reversal could hinder the progress of the rally. Conversely, the MACD shows a drop in the selling pressure and a potential bullish crossover. Until then, the fear of a pullback below $185 could haunt the Solana price rally. The prices of Dogecoin (DOGE) & Solana (SOL) have reached crucial targets and hence a stable rise above their respective resistance could probably revive a strong upswing in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 06:03:13
