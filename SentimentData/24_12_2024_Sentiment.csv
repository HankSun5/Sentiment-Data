The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI steals the spotlight as Cardano and Toncoin lose investor momentum. Table of Contents Cardano and Toncoin: A decline in investor confidence Why Lightchain AI shines Future outlook Cardano (ADA) and Toncoin (TON) are seeing their momentum slow as Lightchain AI (LCAI) emerges as a more promising opportunity in the market. Currently priced at just $0.003 in its presale phase, Lightchain AI is drawing attention for its potential to transform decentralized applications (dApps) and governance. Cardano and Toncoin: A decline in investor confidence Cardano and Toncoin have been seen as good blockchain plans, but new market signs show a drop in trust from investors. Cardano‚Äôs growth speed, though bold, often gets bad remarks for holdups in adding important parts, making some wonder if it can stay up with quicker changing systems. Likewise, Toncoin, with its special blockchain setup tied to the Telegram world, has a hard time keeping up due to few userÕès outside its small group. These issues have made investors skeptical, especially in a market where new projects give better chances for growth. Lightchain AI, for example, has changed its aim by offering a new AI-blockchain mix during its presale phase, pulling in investors looking for fresh ideas and gain. As such, ADA and TON are falling back to smart projects like LCAI. You might also like: Dogecoin targets $2 but Lightchain AI could be the winner with $10 and a 30,000x return Why Lightchain AI shines Lightchain AI distinguishes itself from Cardano and Toncoin through its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Central to Lightchain AI‚Äôs architecture are the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. The AIVM is designed to optimize the execution of AI-specific tasks, enabling efficient and scalable dApps. Lightchain AI‚Äôs tokenomics are structured to ensure sustainability and equitable distribution. The total supply of LCAI tokens is capped at 10 billion, with 40% allocated for presale, 30% for ecosystem development, 20% for team and advisors, and 10% reserved for future partnerships and strategic initiatives. This allocation strategy aims to foster long-term value for ecosystem participants. Moreover, the roadmap for Lightchain AI is ambitious, focusing on the seamless integration of AI and blockchain to address challenges such as scalability, privacy, and trust. Key milestones include the development and deployment of the AIVM, implementation of the PoI consensus mechanism, and the launch of a suite of AI-driven dApps. LCAI‚Äôs presale phase is priced low at just $0.003 per token, offering investors an opportunity to buy into a potentially disruptive technology at an early stage and reap exponential returns. With limited tokens available during this phase, investors are scrambling to secure their piece of the future through LCAI. Future outlook The Lightchain AI presale has drawn significant attention from blockchain enthusiasts and investors who see its potential to transform the industry. With its future-oriented approach to integrating AI and blockchain, LCAI is positioned to lead the next wave of disruptive technologies. As Cardano and Toncoin experience a slowdown in investor confidence, LCAI‚Äôs momentum continues to build, making it the choice for those seeking growth and transformative technology in their blockchain investments.

A publication from the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Structured Finance sheds light on major global banks collaborating with Ripple to create a potential alternative to SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. The financial institutions mentioned‚ÄîBank of America, Santander, UniCredit, Standard Chartered, Westpac Banking Corporation, and Royal Bank of Canada‚Äîrepresent a substantial segment of the global banking industry. Their collaboration with Ripple underscores a pivotal shift in how financial transactions might be conducted, moving towards the adoption of blockchain technology for cross-border payments.

Blockchain‚Äôs ability to process secure and bilateral transactions in near real-time offers a significant advantage over legacy systems, which can be slow, expensive, and prone to error. Using distributed ledger technology, Ripple aims to simplify and accelerate global money movement while reducing associated costs. Traditionally, SWIFT has dominated the cross-border payments space, serving as the backbone for international transactions. However, its reliance on multiple intermediaries often results in delays and increased transaction fees. Through innovative blockchain solutions, Ripple promises instant settlements with reduced costs and a robust audit trail, making it a formidable alternative to SWIFT. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The participation of major banks in this initiative reflects growing confidence in blockchain‚Äôs potential to transform global financial systems. Ripple‚Äôs established network, RippleNet, allows financial institutions to connect seamlessly, facilitating secure and efficient international transactions. The Future of Cross-Border Payments The collaboration signifies a notable moment for blockchain adoption in traditional banking. By leveraging Ripple‚Äôs technology, these banks aim to reduce the capital tied up in the global trade settlement system and enhance the speed and reliability of their services. This move aligns with a broader industry trend of adopting blockchain to improve transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions. While the details of this collaboration are still emerging, the implications for the broader financial ecosystem are profound. If Ripple‚Äôs solutions prove successful, they could disrupt SWIFT‚Äôs longstanding dominance, paving the way for a new era in international finance.

According to a scoop shared by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the Helio deal is worth about $150 million. If successful, this will mark the largest acquisition made by the Miami-based firm since its inception. Moonpay and Helio as the Power Duo While much detail has not emerged regarding the terms of the deal, many in the ecosystem are already weighing the potential. Notably, Helio will enable Moonpay to compete directly with Coinbase Commerce as a self-service crypto payments outfit. Helio enables content creators and ecommerce merchants to get paid for their products and services using crypto. Among the available products includes Solana Pay, the payments engine powering the DexScreener platform. As Terrett highlighted, the Solana Pay outfit is also integrated into Shopify.

It currently powers a lot of crypto payments services with an extensive partnerships record. As reported by Coingape in October, it landed a Venmo partnership to enable crypto access to 60 million users worldwide. With crypto adoption growing, the need for more merchant integrations have grown considerably. Moonpay is among the infrastructure firms benefitting from these growth and Helio might help amplify this. Growing Corporate Investments in Crypto Since the victory of Donald Trump as president-elect last month, the corporate alignment has increased. Suddenly, companies are beginning to revamp their investment strategies in a bid to benefit from the potential incoming pro-crypto administration. From Justin Sun investing $30 million into World Liberty Financial to Tether‚Äôs latest $775 million investment in Rumble, firms are largely diversifying their portfolios. While M&A activities beyond the potential Moonpay deal might appear too formal, the presence of Bitcoin and Ethereum-based ETF products is removing entry barriers for firms. BlackRock invests in IBIT , setting a precedent for state pension funds to also join the trend. Asset management firms are doubling down on other crypto ETF products to grant firms more access to gain exposure to the crypto industry.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

Despite this, Japan-based Metaplanet has reaffirmed its confidence by buying nearly 620 BTC. Interestingly, the latest acquisition marks its largest Bitcoin purchase to date. Metaplanet‚Äôs Largest Single BTC Acquisition According to the company‚Äôs official press release , the acquisition, executed as part of its Bitcoin Treasury Operations, involved the purchase of 619.7 BTC, worth around $60.6 million.

William Shane Garrow ‚Äì who was senior vice president and a private banker at BOK until being fired early this year ‚Äì is accused of embezzling $4,277,227 from at least 16 customer accounts and funneling the funds to himself, FOX23 reports . Garrow, who was hired in 2007, allegedly began committing the crimes on September 9, 2012, and continued all the way to April 10, 2024. He‚Äôs accused of draining cash from customer accounts without them knowing and transferring the funds to accounts that he controlled at other financial institutions. He‚Äôs also alleged to have written false cashier checks from client accounts and made them payable to himself. If a client noticed discrepancies, Garrow simply told them there was some sort of error, and that BOK would correct it. Says an affidavit seen by FOX23, ‚Äú[Garrow] knowingly executed, and attempted to execute, a scheme‚Ä¶to defraud a financial institution, and to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, and other property owned by‚Ä¶a financial institution.‚Äù Garrow is facing one count of bank fraud along with a separate count of willfully making and subscribing a false federal income tax return. In a statement to the media, BOK said it is cooperating with law enforcement. ‚ÄúShane Garrow‚Äôs employment was terminated earlier this year upon the discovery that he had breached company policy. We have conducted a thorough internal investigation and worked with law enforcement on their investigation.

Between December 16 and 22, MicroStrategy acquired 5,262 BTC, investing approximately $561 million, the company announced on December 23. The firm purchased Bitcoin at an average price of roughly $106,662 per BTC, marking the highest cost it has ever paid for the cryptocurrency. As of December 22, 2024, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries held a total of 444,262 BTC, acquired for a cumulative $27.7 billion at an average price of $62,257 per BTC. The latest purchase is part of a December buying spree, during which the company accumulated 42,162 BTC now valued at $4 billion. However, the latest acquisition accounts for only about 12% of the company‚Äôs total December purchases and represents the smallest amount of BTC bought since mid-2024, when it acquired 169 BTC. MicroStrategy‚Äôs latest Bitcoin purchase is 191% smaller than the acquisition announced on December 16 and 309% smaller than the one disclosed on December 9. The slowdown in BTC buying coincides with concerns raised by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes about a potential market drop tied to the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Hayes‚Äô fund, Maelstrom, plans to clear some positions and re-enter the market later at lower prices. Additionally, rumors suggest MicroStrategy may enter a blackout period in January 2025, halting its issuance of shares and convertible bonds to fund further Bitcoin purchases.

The new sports event trading product allows users to bet on events like the National Football League‚Äôs Super Bowl. Before this time, not much was heard of the prediction market. During the 2024 US presidential, the niche became quite popular, a success that could be attributed to Polymarket. In a blog post , Crypto.com informed its customers, ‚ÄúSports Event Trading is a CFTC-regulated derivatives trading feature available in the Crypto.com App and on the Crypto.com Web.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt presents you with a straightforward Yes/No decision based on whether you believe an outcome of a sporting event will occur,‚Äù the crypto exchange added. Crypto.com Prediction Market: Shift from Polymarket In the days leading to the November 5th US election, Polymarket recorded more than $3 billion¬†in bets. One French man went home with almost $80 million just for placing a wager on Donald Trump winning the election. So far, Polymarket has secured approximately $1 billion¬†of bets that attempted to predict which team will win the next Super Bowl in February. Once Crypto.com‚Äôs sports prediction market is activated, Polymarket may have to share its dominance to accommodate the new addition. The crypto exchange‚Äôs existing roots in the sports industry may serve as an edge for gaining traction quickly. In August, Crypto.com signed a multi-year partnership with the UEFA Champions League. As a result, the exchange became the official sponsor of Europe‚Äôs top tournament soccer club. Crypto.com Picks And Drops Lawsuit Against SEC In another Crypto.com news, the global exchange has decided against moving forward with its lawsuit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Two months ago, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the US SEC involving Gary Gensler and the agency‚Äôs four Commissioners. The legal action responded to an initial Wells Notice, but Crypto.com took no chance before filing a lawsuit. The exchange is challenging what it perceives as an unlawful expansion of SEC jurisdiction over its operations. This latest development followed after a meeting between the exchange‚Äôs CEO, Kris Marszalek, and President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on December 16.

Cardano Price Needs to Break This Level to Revive Rally,https://cryptonews.com/news/will-a-santa-rally-save-ada-cardano-price-needs-to-break-this-level-to-revive-rally/,"The Cardano (ADA) price is holding above its 50DMA in the low $0.90s on Monday, as the cryptocurrency market attempts the beginnings of a rebound during a holiday-shortened week. The final trading days are normally bullish in the stock market, with the crypto bulls also hoping for a recovery after last week‚Äôs Fed-fuelled market rout. The Cardano price dropped as low as $0.76 last week, and at current levels above $0.92, it remains 30% down from the highs it hit in early December above $1.30. The Fed shocked markets last week by only forecasting two rate cuts in 2025, less than hoped for. Whilst that has created short-term macro headwinds, crypto has plenty of bullish narratives to fall back on that could support a recovery into the year‚Äôs end. Namely, the incoming Trump administration and Congress are more pro-crypto than most crypto investors/industry participants could have possibly imagined just a few months ago. That means crypto is on the cusp of entering a new golden age, at least in the US, next year. ADA was hurt badly in recent years by regulatory uncertainty. However, the prospect of its founder Charles Hopkinson becoming an advisor to incoming US President Trump on crypto affairs means the future for the Cardano ecosystem is likely very bright. Cardano in 2025 will be insane ‚Äî Deezy.eth (@deezy_BTC) December 23, 2024 The recent market turmoil, thus, likely isn‚Äôt the end of altcoins. Rather, its more likely to have just been a hiccup. However, a rally at the end of the year hasn‚Äôt been confirmed yet. Here are the levels that Cardano needs to clear. Cardano Price Recovery Into The Year‚Äôs End? ADA Needs to Clear This Level A key level of resistance that might block the Cardano price from advancing into the year‚Äôs end is around $1.0. Not only is this a key level of psychological significance, but it also lines up with the downtrend form the yearly highs. Once this level breaks, the likelihood of a retest of yearly highs shoots up. But, for now, ADA remains in a technical downtrend, so in the absence of a broader recovery in risk appetite, traders shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the market reverses lower again in the short-term. However, for those with the ability to hold through short-term price bumps, 2025 promises to be a spectacular year for major altcoins like Cardano. A realistic target for this bull market would be the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the 2023 lows traced back to the 2021 record highs just above $3.0, which is near $5.0. That could mean Cardano could still deliver gains of as much as 5x from current levels, despite already being up around 3x from its October levels. Of course, many bulls are predicting even bigger things for the Cardano price, but no one can really be sure how high the crypto will fly during the upcoming bull market. Cardano to $10 ‚Äî Crypto Jebb (@_CoffeeNCrypto_) December 23, 2024 That means Cardano is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy right now . However, a concern is the lack of major adoption of the blockchain, despite having been around for many years and boasting a large and dedicated community. Rather than putting their eggs all in one basket, a better strategy in crypto is to diversify amongst different coins. Bitcoin , the most established crypto that continues to lead global adoption (national strategic reserves coming in 2025?), should probably be the cornerstone of any investor‚Äôs portfolio. Other major altcoins like Ethereum , Solana and XRP also warrant consideration. But ADA certainly has its place, and could be a major winner in the long run. The post Will a Santa Rally Save ADA?

Speaking in an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Tenev revealed that internal discussions about maintaining Bitcoin reserves occur periodically. However, the company currently has no plans to add Bitcoin to its treasury for investment purposes. Robinhood CEO Explains Bitcoin Strategy Amid Crypto Expansion In a recent interview , Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev explained the company‚Äôs position on holding Bitcoin as part of its reserves. While the topic of Bitcoin reserves arises periodically during internal discussions, Robinhood does not intend to follow companies like MicroStrategy or Tesla by holding Bitcoin for investment purposes. Tenev emphasized that Robinhood remains focused on its role as a trading platform and not as an investment manager. According to Vlad Tenev, adding BTC to the company‚Äôs treasury could complicate investors‚Äô perceptions, casting Robinhood as a ‚Äúquasi Bitcoin-holding play.‚Äù Despite Robinhood CEO statements about not holding Bitcoin for investment purposes, institutional BTC adoption continues to gain momentum. Recently, Matador Technologies announced plans to purchase $4.5 million worth of Bitcoin this month as part of its strategy. The company‚Äôs leadership highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value amid growing concerns over fiat currency devaluation. Stock Correlation With Bitcoin Price Although Robinhood does not hold Bitcoin, its stock (HOOD) has demonstrated a close correlation with Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. The company‚Äôs stock price has surged 202% year-to-date in 2024, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 110% growth in the same period. Robinhood CEO noted that this correlation exists without the need for Robinhood to hold Bitcoin in its treasury. This reinforces the company‚Äôs current strategy of providing crypto trading services rather than direct Bitcoin investment. Moreover, Robinhood‚Äôs crypto-related revenues are projected to grow by 20% by the end of 2025, according to Bernstein analysts. Cryptocurrencies are expected to account for 38% of the platform‚Äôs total revenues, driven by growing user interest and favorable market conditions under Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency. More so, the company‚Äôs planned acquisition of top crypto exchange Bitstamp is set to close in early 2025. This move will boost Robinhood‚Äôs crypto offerings and position the platform as a stronger competitor to exchanges offering more crypto options. Robinhood has traditionally taken a conservative approach to its crypto services. It provides fewer digital assets and trading options compared to its competitors. However, analysts predict that this strategy may evolve as the company integrates Bitstamp and explores new opportunities during the current market cycle. Most recently, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev commented on Bitcoin‚Äôs rally , highlighting its evolution from being dismissed to a serious financial asset. Speaking on CNBC, Tenev attributed the surge to institutional adoption and Federal Reserve Chair Powell‚Äôs comparison of Bitcoin to gold. He also expressed optimism about Paul Atkins‚Äô nomination as SEC Chair.

The potential reasons behind this bullish outlook include the current market sentiment and the positive price action that ADA has displayed in recent days. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming level Since the beginning of December 2024, ADA has experienced a price decline of over 40%, falling below the $1 level. However, with notable attention from traders and investors, the altcoin‚Äôs price appears to be recovering and gaining upward momentum. According to expert technical analysis, ADA appears to be consolidating within a tight range near a strong resistance level of $0.95. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if ADA breaks out of the consolidation zone and closes a daily candle above the $1 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 30% to reach the $1.25 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View Conversely, if the altcoin fails to close above this level and falls below the $0.85 mark, it may find support around the $0.72 level in the future. On a positive note, ADA‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands near the oversold area, indicating potential upside momentum in the days ahead. On-Chain Metrics Support ADA‚Äôs Bullish Outlook This bullish outlook appears to have attracted both long-term holders and traders, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from ADA‚Äôs spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $98 million worth of ADA tokens in the past week. Sourcr: Coinglass In addition to long-term holders, trader participation seems to have skyrocketed. According to the data, ADA‚Äôs open interest has surged by 8%, indicating heightened trader activity and suggesting potential upside momentum. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.94 and has experienced a price surge of over 5.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 18% and continues to rise steadily, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors following the bullish outlook.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 22:58:58

Metaplanet Increases BTC Holdings To 1,762 The recent crypto market downturn from its all-time highs (ATH) does not appear to bother Metaplanet, as the Tokyo-listed firm made its largest BTC purchase to date, buying 619.7 BTC worth $ 61 million at an average price of around $96,000. Related Reading: Metaplanet To Expand Bitcoin Holdings With $11.3 Million Bond Sale To recall, Metaplanet started buying BTC earlier this year in May with a purchase of 97.9 BTC. Since then, the company has purchased BTC every month, barring September, and crossed the 1,000 BTC milestone in November. The latest acquisition has pushed Metaplanet‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to 1,762, bought at an average price of $75,600 per BTC. Notably, this $61 million purchase is nearly double the value of Metaplanet‚Äôs previous largest acquisition, which occurred in November and was worth close to $30 million. The company‚Äôs consistent BTC accumulation has earned it the nickname ‚ÄúAsia‚Äôs MicroStrategy,‚Äù in reference to the US-based business intelligence firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy. It is worth highlighting that today‚Äôs BTC purchase comes a week after Metaplanet raised $60.6 million through two tranches of bond issuance for the purpose of ‚Äúaccelerating BTC purchases.‚Äù Metaplanet‚Äôs latest purchase also makes its BTC reserves the 12th-largest among publicly listed firms globally.

The firm emphasized that this strategy is designed to be ‚Äúaccretive to shareholders.‚Äù Despite today‚Äôs significant BTC purchase, Metaplanet‚Äôs stock price saw little movement, closing at $22.5, down 0.98% for the day. However, on a year-to-date basis, the company‚Äôs stock has surged by an astounding 1,982%, reflecting the long-term benefits of its Bitcoin-centric strategy. Bitcoin Supply Crunch To Hasten Adoption? With Bitcoin‚Äôs total maximum supply capped at 21 million, the digital asset has solidified its reputation as an inflation-resistant store of value. A recent report highlights that BTC supply on crypto exchanges has hit multi-year lows, indicating that holders are increasingly withdrawing BTC from exchanges, reducing circulating supply and potentially driving prices higher.

38023737,https://coingape.com/?p=230694,1734996077,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"XRP Whales Move $132M Ahead Of Santa Claus Rally, ATH Looming?",https://coingape.com/xrp-whales-move-132m-ahead-of-santa-claus-rally-ath-looming/,"According to blockchain tracker Whale Alert, XRP whales have seen a significant transfer of 60 million XRP, valued at $132,202,106, between two unidentified wallets. This large transaction has drawn attention as market analysts predict a possible rally in XRP‚Äôs price, with some suggesting a new all-time high could be on the horizon. Massive XRP Whale Transfer Sparks Speculation The 60 million XRP transfer, first reported by blockchain monitoring platforms, involved a substantial movement of XRP tokens, raising questions about potential strategies by large holders. XRP whale movements are often linked to preparation for major market events or price shifts especially with the XRP ETF increasing launch potential. EGRAG Crypto, a notable market commentator, expressed optimism about XRP‚Äôs trajectory, predicting a surge to $27. He pointed out that XRP is hovering above its Break of Structure (BOS) level while aligning with the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which could pave the way for a bullish breakout. Additionally, data from CryptoQuant revealed that XRP is the most traded alternative cryptocurrency on Binance‚Äôs futures market this December, with $116.6 million in trading volume. Analysts suggest this heightened activity may indicate increasing interest in the asset ahead of the potential Santa Claus rally. Historical Patterns Indicate Potential Breakout Market chartists have drawn comparisons between XRP‚Äôs current price movements and its behavior during the 2017 bull run amid the XRP whales moves. A trader, known as Crypto Vilian, highlighted XRP‚Äôs price pattern, which mirrors its 2017 trajectory of a steep decline, recovery, consolidation, and eventual explosive breakout. Crypto Vilian noted that XRP price recently broke out of a prolonged bearish trend, entering a consolidation phase that historically preceded significant upward movements. He also suggested that XRP‚Äôs market cap could exceed $1 trillion in this cycle, translating to a price of over $17 per token. However, he emphasized that this outcome would depend on broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. XRP Price Faces Short-Term Bearish Patterns Despite long-term bullish expectations, XRP‚Äôs daily chart reveals a descending triangle pattern, indicating potential short-term bearish pressure. According to TradingView, the support level lies near $2.19, while the downward trendline of lower highs may lead to a drop to $1.69 if breached. On the other hand, analysts see room for recovery if XRP bounces from its current support level. A break above the $2.50 resistance could invalidate bearish predictions and set the stage for XRP to retest its recent high of $2.90. Meanwhile, on-chain data from Messari shows that XRP addresses holding over one million tokens have been reducing their balances, signaling profit-taking by large holders during the asset‚Äôs consolidation phase. This activity has added to market pressure in recent weeks prompting worries XRP price may not be heading for a rally soon unless bouyed by the Ripple SEC case end and Gary Gensler stepping down in January.

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the FSC told media representatives the reports were ‚Äúnot true.‚Äù Will Regulator Let South Korean Companies Buy Crypto? Reports circulated at the start of the month claiming that the FSC was prepared to allow universities and schools to trade donations made in crypto for fiat. This, the reports claimed, would represent the first step on a roadmap. This same roadmap would eventually allow South Korean firms to buy coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , they added. [Press Release] The Financial Services Commission held a meeting to review business financing conditions and response strategies with officials from policy financial institutions and related businesses on December 19. https://t.co/QtSVRIB88h ‚Äî Financial Services Commission ‚Äì FSC Korea (@FSC_Korea) December 19, 2024 The reports also claimed that the FSC would let ‚Äúordinary‚Äù firms buy crypto before the banking sector. ‚ÄúWe are still discussing whether we will allow corporations [to buy and sell crypto].

The Financial Services Commission‚Äôs Virtual Assets Division has not confirmed anything about this matter.‚Äù South Korean Financial Services Commission spokesperson South Korean law does not explicitly prevent firms from holding crypto. However, to trade BTC, ETH, and altcoins, private individuals need to open crypto exchange -linked bank accounts. The regulator‚Äôs guidelines instruct financial institutions to reject all such applications from corporate clients.

They claim they have been left behind by their international rivals in the US and Japan. American firms like MicroStrategy and Japanese companies like Remixpoint have built up considerable Bitcoin reserves in recent years. However, the FSC has refused to allow South Korean companies to do likewise. It has claimed that further discussion is required beforehand. The same FSC spokesperson also denied reports that the regulator had scheduled a timeframe for approving crypto spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The official also said these reports were ‚Äúcompletely groundless,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúWe have not discussed the timing of the launch of virtual asset ETFs.‚Äù Crypto hackers from North Korea stole $1.3 billion in funds in 2024, new data released this week from Chainalysis shows. #NorthKorea #CryptoHackers https://t.co/TQYgKiaQ22 ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2024 ‚ÄòHuge Demand‚Äô Other media outlets, citing anonymous sources, have claimed the FSC is still consulting with ‚Äúministries, organizations, and private experts‚Äù before deciding on new crypto regulations.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has shown steady performance, currently trading around $3,315, highlighting its resilience in the volatile crypto space. Meanwhile, EOS is making waves with strategic initiatives and partnerships aimed at improving scalability and usability. At the same time, Qubetics ($TICS) has achieved an impressive milestone with its presale success, selling over 372 million tokens to more than 11,500 holders. Qubetics is setting itself apart by tackling the complexities of cryptocurrency management, making it accessible and efficient for users worldwide. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Crypto Transactions Qubetics is breaking barriers with its Non-Custodial Multi Chain Wallet, designed to simplify cryptocurrency management. By integrating with payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay, the wallet aims to make crypto transactions as seamless as everyday payments, whether you‚Äôre on iOS, Android, or desktop. A standout feature of the Qubetics wallet is its smart contract conversion mechanism. This tool automatically converts digital assets into fiat currencies at the point of sale, protecting users from market volatility and ensuring smooth transactions. For example, imagine a global freelancer who deals with clients paying in various cryptocurrencies. With Qubetics, payments are instantly converted to their desired fiat currency, eliminating exchange rate concerns and market fluctuations. Currently, the Qubetics presale is in its 14th stage, having sold over 372 million tokens and raising $7.5 million. At $0.0377 per token, now‚Äôs the perfect time for investors to join before the price increases by 10% in the upcoming 15th stage this weekend. With its mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, Qubetics is making a significant impact in the crypto world. Ethereum (ETH): Consistent Growth and Network Upgrades Ethereum continues to solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Trading at approximately $3,315, Ethereum has shown steady growth even amidst market volatility. Its consistent performance highlights the trust and reliance the crypto community places in Ethereum. Ethereum 2.0 upgrades have been instrumental in enhancing the platform‚Äôs scalability, security, and energy efficiency. These improvements have attracted more developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its network, further boosting its utility and adoption. Consider a scenario where a startup leverages Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain for smart contracts. The platform‚Äôs robust infrastructure and widespread adoption make it an ideal choice for businesses looking to implement secure and scalable blockchain solutions. As decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to flourish, Ethereum remains a critical foundation for the ecosystem. Analysts predict that with growing institutional interest and network developments, Ethereum could reach new milestones in the coming year, reaffirming its place among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. EOS (EOS): Aiming for Scalable Solutions EOS is carving its niche in the competitive world of cryptocurrencies by focusing on scalability and developer-friendly infrastructure. Currently trading at approximately $0.79, EOS has experienced fluctuations but remains a viable option for dApp developers. Recent partnerships and upgrades have aimed at improving transaction speeds and reducing costs, positioning EOS as a cost-effective alternative for blockchain-based applications. For instance, a gaming company exploring blockchain integration for in-game assets can benefit from EOS‚Äôs efficient infrastructure to provide a seamless user experience. Despite challenges, EOS‚Äôs community remains active, driving forward initiatives that enhance the platform‚Äôs utility and adoption. Its ability to cater to developers seeking scalable solutions makes it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. Conclusion The crypto market offers diverse opportunities, and Qubetics, Ethereum, and EOS are leading the way. Qubetics is redefining digital transactions with its innovative wallet, Ethereum continues to dominate with consistent growth and network enhancements, and EOS is providing scalable solutions for dApp developers. Based on the latest research, we recommend considering Qubetics ($TICS), Ethereum (ETH), and EOS (EOS) as some of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 .

Kalshi, one of the sharpest platforms out there, says there‚Äôs now a 77% chance that one of the Magnificent 7 companies (Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia, or Alphabet) will take the plunge and buy Bitcoin in 2025. A few months ago, those odds were sitting at 49%. What happened? Michael Saylor, a man who treats Bitcoin like religion, has been out here pushing companies like Microsoft to stop playing it safe and start stacking sats. Let‚Äôs call it what it is: the market smells blood, and by blood, we mean Bitcoin. 2025 could be even better than 2024 has already been. These guys have been circling the crypto waters for years, and the odds are now higher than ever that one of them is finally going to bite. Let‚Äôs take a look at what they think about Bitcoin *now.* Alphabet keeps Bitcoin at arm‚Äôs length Company number one is Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, which has been doing that thing where it dips a toe into the crypto pool but doesn‚Äôt want to admit it‚Äôs swimming. Back in 2018, it banned crypto ads altogether because, apparently, scams are bad for business. Fast-forward to this year, and they seem like they‚Äôve realized blockchain technology might actually be worth something. Google Cloud is exploring blockchain for enterprise clients, focusing on things like security and transparency. Meanwhile, Alphabet‚Äôs financials are looking good. Google Cloud revenue hit $11.4 billion in Q3, up 35%. The company‚Äôs stock is up more than 30% since September, making it a top performer in that market. Amazon‚Äôs boardroom brawl Amazon‚Äôs shareholders aren‚Äôt exactly the same though. In December, they told the board to put their money where the future is. Specifically, they want Amazon to invest 5% of its $88 billion in cash reserves into Bitcoin. That‚Äôs $4.4 billion, for those keeping score at home. But wait, there‚Äôs more. Insiders reportedly say Amazon is already thinking about dropping $250 million on Bitcoin. Why? Because new accounting rules from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) make it easier to hold crypto on the books. Meanwhile, rumors are going around that Amazon could start accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano as payment soon. Amazon‚Äôs stock is trading at $225, up 20% for the year. With a market cap of $2.36 trillion, they‚Äôre incredibly powerful. If they jump into Bitcoin, it‚Äôll be like Tyson stepping into a middleweight ring. Apple sticks to its lane As for Apple, it isn‚Äôt exactly rushing to buy Bitcoin. Instead, they‚Äôre making it easier for their customers to buy it. Earlier this month, the company partnered with Coinbase to let users buy cryptos directly through Apple Pay. That‚Äôs all we got on them for now. Apple‚Äôs stock is trading at $180, with a market cap north of $2.8 trillion. They‚Äôre playing it safe, but their users? Not so much. Might be time to give the people what they want. Meta pivots to NFTs while Microsoft backs the blockchain Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been pushing NFTs hard, integrating them into Instagram and Facebook. Reports say NFT transactions on Meta‚Äôs platforms are up 40% since launch. But let‚Äôs not forget Meta‚Äôs bigger play: the metaverse. They‚Äôre betting on blockchain to power virtual transactions, and that means they‚Äôre not done with crypto yet. Meanwhile, Microsoft is keeping things corporate. Azure, its cloud platform, has rolled out Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS). Over 500 companies are already using it to build decentralized apps. Microsoft is also throwing cash at startups in DeFi and NFTs. The stock is $380 a share and the company has a $2.8 trillion market cap. But when Michael Saylor suggested that they add Bitcoin to their balance sheet just some weeks back, they told him NO. Tesla and Nvidia: Bitcoin holdings and mining wars Tesla‚Äôs Bitcoin story is well-known. They‚Äôve got $1.5 billion in Bitcoin on their books and are thinking about bringing back Bitcoin payments for their cars. Elon Musk might be polarizing, but Tesla‚Äôs crypto strategy isn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre holding steady while pushing for greener mining practices. Their stock? Trading at $280, with a market cap of $900 billion. Then there‚Äôs Nvidia. Their GPUs are the backbone of crypto mining, especially for Bitcoin miners. But Nvidia‚Äôs relationship with crypto isn‚Äôt all roses. They‚Äôre facing a Supreme Court case over allegations they misled investors about crypto revenue back in 2018. Still, their stock is trading at $140, with a market cap of $3.42 trillion. Legal drama aside, the company has staged nothing short of a remarkable performance this year.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

BTFD Coin Offers a 50% Discount for Big Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/floki-inus-ico-left-you-out-btfd-coin-offers-a-50-discount-for-big-returns/,"Floki Inu‚Äôs ICO might have left some investors kicking themselves, but don‚Äôt worry!

The coin is currently in presale, and thanks to a 50% festive discount, you can get in at just $0.000064 per token. This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs a community-driven project designed to stand the test of time. Plus, it‚Äôs no secret that meme coins like Floki Inu have shown massive growth, so imagine the potential of BTFD Coin with its strong features and strategic pricing rollout. Inspired by the 1973 market crash, BTFD Coin is taking a page from the ‚ÄúBuy The Dip‚Äù playbook, offering Stage 7 prices that mirror the power of buying in during a market dip. When the market starts to rise, those who bought at a discount will reap the rewards. Just like those who bought during the 1973 crash saw exponential gains once the market recovered, BTFD Coin could bring the same results for presale investors. It‚Äôs an unmissable opportunity that you can unlock with the BIG50 code. Floki Inu‚Äôs ICO ‚Äì The One That Got Away Floki Inu is a meme coin that managed to make waves from the moment it launched. The project took inspiration from Elon Musk‚Äôs beloved dog, Floki, and launched with an ICO that attracted a lot of buzz. Early investors who got in on the ground floor saw their coins soar, and the rest of the market quickly took notice. As Floki Inu continued to rise, FOMO kicked in, and many were left wishing they‚Äôd acted sooner. But here‚Äôs the thing: BTFD Coin is giving you another shot. While you might have missed out on Floki Inu, you now have the chance to invest early in BTFD Coin before its value skyrockets.

The early bird truly gets the worm, and BTFD Coin is giving you that opportunity at a discounted price. BTFD Coin ‚Äì A Meme Coin with More Than Just a Fun Name BTFD Coin is not your typical meme coin. It‚Äôs built on the idea of buying the dip, and this stage is specifically inspired by the classic market strategy used after the 1973 market crash. The idea is simple: when the market dips, it‚Äôs the perfect time to buy. And with BTFD Coin‚Äôs Stage 7 price rollback, you‚Äôre getting the dip at the lowest possible price. Besides its price strategy, BTFD Coin brings a lot to the table. The community-driven project boasts impressive staking rewards , a P2E game, and strong market backing. The presale is already building momentum, and with more than $4.38 raised so far, it‚Äôs clear that BTFD Coin has captured the interest of investors looking to strike it big. This is where the BIG50 code comes in handy. When you use the code during checkout, you‚Äôll unlock a 50% discount on BTFD Coin, giving you access to the Stage 7 price.

Now, let‚Äôs assume the price rises to $0.0006 (which is very likely, considering the presale hype and the project‚Äôs strong fundamentals). That‚Äôs an 837% return on your initial investment, turning your $5,000 into $46,875. The potential upside is absolutely incredible‚Äîespecially if the market behaves like it did post-1973, when prices skyrocketed after the recovery. Investing now could set you up for some serious profits when BTFD Coin hits the open market.

38025659,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322221,1734999492,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38025659.jpeg,Dogecoin‚Äôs Third Leap Incoming? Analyst Predicts Explosive Rally After Dip,https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoins-third-leap-incoming-analyst-predicts-explosive-rally-after-dip/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) could be in for a prolonged period of pain, following by an explosive rally starting in April 2025. That‚Äôs according to the analysis of X user Master Kenobi, who outlined this interesting take in a recent tweet. What if DOGE‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶is gearing up for its third and final leap in such a scenario? A slow drop until April 15, followed by a strong pump starting May 5, reaching its peak around mid-August? Not saying it will happen, but it caught my eye, and I thought I'd share it with you‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/M2kcNs7JPT ‚Äî Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) December 21, 2024 Master Kenobi looked at the price action of Dogecoin in 2024, where it saw a surge to highs in the $0.23 area, before then stagnating for months ahead of a breakout in the final final months of 2025 to new yearly highs above $0.40. If this price pattern repeats, that could mean Dogecoin is in for a period of stagnation until mid-April, before then breaking out again around the mid-point of next year. Could a Dogecoin Rally Come Sooner? Its an interesting theory. But the Dogecoin bulls will be pleased to hear that risks are very much tilted in favor of the Dogecoin price rallying much sooner than next April. Why? The facetiously named Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) , headed by none other than Elon Musk (an ardent Dogecoin supporter for years now) is set to officially land in Washington in January. Incoming US President Donald Trump , whose administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, has given DOGE a mandate to reduce fraud and waste in government spending. Musk is already having an impact in Washington ‚Äì his vocal criticisms on X of a recent Congressional spending bill resulted in the bill being reduced from over 1500 pages in length to a little over 100. Expect D.O.G.E to dominate the headlines in 2025, all but ensuring that Dogecoin retains a commanding portion of mindshare in the meme coin markets . That means as the Trump trade returns to lift crypto prices higher, as is likely in the coming weeks, DOGE will be a prime candidate to outperform. However, chart analysis continues to point to downside risks for the Dogecoin price, for now. Last around $0.32, Dogecoin fell under its 21 and 50DMAs following its price collapse last week. And DOGE is yet to retest its early 2024 highs in the $0.23 area, which will be a key target for the bears. Chart analysis suggests DOGE could be headed lower in the short term. However, if it does reach the low $0.20s, it could be a great coin to buy on the dip. With Dogecoin likely to vault above $1.0 and post gains in the 5x region this bull market, it‚Äôs a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now . Dogecoin Alternative to Consider ‚Äì Flockerz (FLOCK) While Dogecoin could do very well in 2025, there are many smaller, lesser-known meme coins that could post far larger gains. The team at crypto news.com keeps a close eye on the meme coin market as they hunt for high-potential projects. And one new meme coin they like a lot is an exciting new DAO-powered vote-to-earn meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) . Big Announcement for The Flock In just 30 days the Flockerz presale will end. This is your last chance to get in on the ground floor, to grab your share of the presale head on over to: https://t.co/HKN509Un5J It's time to join The Flock! pic.twitter.com/OWkEzSXu3u ‚Äî Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 23, 2024 One of the reasons analysts at crypto news.com are so excited about this token is the impressive pace at which is has been raising funds from earlier investors. Despite only launching a few weeks ago, Flockerz (FLOCK) has already attracted over $7.6 million from eager buyers. Couple that with its impressive social media metrics, and this token is looking like a meme coin that could really pop. With new meme coins like Fart Coin recently hitting a $1 billion market cap, the appetite for novel new meme coins appears elevated. FLOCK could easily become one of the best meme coins to launch in 2024. ClayBro outlines in the video below why he thinks FLOCK is set to launch at the perfect time, just ahead of a new meme season.

This round adds to the $6 billion raised earlier this year, bringing the company‚Äôs total funding to $12 billion. The capital injection positions xAI to expand its generative AI initiatives and enhance its competitive edge. Elon Musk xAI Achieves $12B Total Funding After Latest $6B Round According to a recent report , Elon Musk xAI has successfully secured $6 billion from investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Fidelity, Nvidia, and others. This latest funding round exclusively involved previous investors, many of whom had supported Musk‚Äôs acquisition of X (formerly Twitter). The funds bring xAI total capital raised to $12 billion. The company plans to use this funding to accelerate the development of its generative AI model, Grok, and expand its ecosystem. This substantial financial backing positions the firm to compete with industry leaders such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Moreover, the Grok AI model, developed by xAI, powers a range of features on X, including a chatbot available to premium and free users in select regions. Known for its functionality, Grok can generate images through the Flux generator, analyze visuals, and summarize trending news. In October, xAI launched an API allowing developers to integrate Grok into third-party apps and platforms. The company also introduced a standalone iOS app for testing, further extending its generative Artificial Intelligence capabilities. Memphis Data Center and Infrastructure Upgrades To support its ambitious goals, Elon Musk xAI operates a Memphis data center equipped with 100,000 Nvidia GPUs. The facility, constructed in just 122 days, currently relies partly on diesel generators. According to the blog post, the company has plans to double the center‚Äôs capacity in 2025, securing approval for additional power. The upgraded infrastructure will also benefit Tesla, with plans to integrate xAI‚Äôs developments into autonomous driving technologies. This expansion reflects Elon Musk‚Äôs vision to enhance AI applications across industries. While Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI has made rapid advancements, it continues to face fierce competition. Rivals such as Anthropic and OpenAI have also secured billions in funding. Following the growing competition, earlier this month, the Tesla CEO filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI coerced investors to avoid supporting rivals like Musk‚Äôs xAI. Musk‚Äôs legal team claims that Microsoft‚Äôs $13 billion investment in OpenAI led to conflicts of interest and market manipulation In addition, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the need for stricter oversight to prevent nonprofit entities from exploiting their status for financial gain. Joining Elon Musk, Zuckerberg called for a formal investigation into OpenAI‚Äôs transition, highlighting potential misuse of tax-exempt donations and resources.

Among these metrics, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for long-term holders has particularly emerged as a critical tool for assessing investor sentiment and market resilience. Long-term holders, defined as investors holding Bitcoin for over 155 days, are often viewed as a stabilizing force in the market. Their selling patterns can significantly influence price trends, making SOPR an indicator worth watching. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Leverage and Coinbase Premium: What Recent Data Reveals Long-Term Holder Trends And Market Sentiment Recent analysis from a CryptoQuant analyst known as Cryptoavails highlights that Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term holder SOPR metric continues to exhibit notable patterns as Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends upward. Historically, SOPR values above 1 indicate that long-term holders are selling at a profit, while values below 1 suggest they are offloading their holdings at a loss. This behavior reflects broader market confidence or capitulation during periods of price decline. Currently, the SOPR metric remains consistently above 1, signaling that long-term holders are selling profitably without adding significant downward pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. The analysis from Cryptoavails tracks key phases in the Bitcoin market over the past two years, highlighting significant shifts in SOPR values. For instance, in early 2022, the SOPR metric showed high volatility with frequent spikes, suggesting intense profit-taking activity by long-term holders. Amid these sales, Bitcoin‚Äôs price experienced a downward trend, reflecting persistent selling pressure during that period. This trend gradually shifted in late 2022 and early 2023 when the SOPR metric mostly remained below 1, indicating that long-term holders were selling at a loss as the market sought to find stability. By mid-2023, the SOPR began trending upwards, signaling renewed confidence among long-term investors. The metric consistently moved closer to or above the critical level of 1, suggesting that long-term holders were once again selling at a profit while market confidence began to recover. This upward trend has remained intact into 2024, supported by Bitcoin‚Äôs rising price levels. Importantly, there have been no significant sell-offs by long-term holders, reinforcing the broader market‚Äôs stability, according to the crypto analyst. SOPR As A Forward Indicator For Market Growth Overall, Cryptoavails¬†mentioned that the current state of Bitcoin‚Äôs SOPR suggests a healthy market dynamic, with long-term holders contributing to a stable price structure. Despite periodic corrections, the sustained presence of SOPR above 1 indicates that selling pressure remains controlled. Related Reading: What‚Äôs The Worst Case Scenario For Bitcoin Right Now? Analyst Explains The analyst also pointed out that this behavior reflects market maturity, where long-term investors are not rushing to offload their holdings despite Bitcoin‚Äôs price appreciation. Regardless, Bitcoin has continued to consistently decrease in price since its sharp drop below $100,000 last week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at a price of $93,991 down by 1.6% in the past 24 hours.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 344,000 YouTube subscribers that the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/ BTC ) pair is flashing a ‚Äúmajor altcoin signal.‚Äù However, he warns that altcoins still have a bit further to drop before market sentiment turns around and sparks a rally. ‚ÄúETH/BTC in November got a bounce but again it still has not broken past at least the 4% level and the major level that I‚Äôm watching for an overbalance in price here is 0.046 [BTC]. That‚Äôs going to give us an overbalance in price to the upside and ideally if [the 0.032 BTC] low isn‚Äôt taken out, it‚Äôll be overbalanced in time as well and that would be that major altcoin signal, when everyone has that extreme greed, the excitement and the belief that these markets are just not going to come back down. We‚Äôre still not there yet so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too crazy to think that we‚Äôd see further at least consolidation but until that happens, you‚Äôre probably not going to get that same extreme excitement to the upside.‚Äù According to the trader, ETH/BTC is mirroring the same pattern it did in 2020 before taking off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs similar to what happened in December of 2020 and what followed December 2020 is your massive January bar: big, big volume, big reversal‚Ä¶ So we have a look back to January [2021]. Y ou start to see that volume really pick up early on and just come back out of nowhere. You can see [December 27th, 2020] it started to pick up and [on] the 3rd of January [2021], [a] nice big move. Third and fourth [of January], [ETH/BTC] starts to break those tops and then consolidate above those support levels. You can see they‚Äôre around 3% and then it started to move again ‚Äì sure it came back down, but that gives you the overbalance that you‚Äôre looking for, meaning more buyers for a longer period of time and they‚Äôre holding the price up. That‚Äôs exactly what we need to see, and we haven‚Äôt seen it yet with the ETH/BTC chart.‚Äù ETH/BTC is valued at 0.0342 BTC ($3,264.68) at time of writing.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 01:10:00

JasmyCoin (JASMY) Imagine having full control over your personal data and deciding how it‚Äôs used. JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a project from a Tokyo-based company called Jasmy Corporation that aims to make this possible. They specialize in the Internet of Things (IoT), connecting devices like computers, cars, and phones. By combining IoT with blockchain technology, Jasmy creates a secure platform where users can safely store and exchange their data. In this system, your personal information becomes your own asset, and you have the power over it. In today‚Äôs market, data privacy is more important than ever. JasmyCoin stands out by focusing on protecting individual data rights. Unlike some other coins that prioritize speed or scalability, JASMY puts data ownership front and center. This aligns with a growing trend where people want more control over their digital lives. As concerns about data security rise, a coin that empowers users could draw more interest. While the crypto market is always changing, JasmyCoin‚Äôs unique approach to data democratization makes it an intriguing player to watch. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency world, born from the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Launched on the Ethereum blockchain, this deflationary memecoin has captured the attention of many. It follows in the footsteps of other meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. By embracing its meme origins and keeping things simple with a no-tax policy and being upfront about its lack of utility, PEPE appeals to those who enjoy the fun side of crypto. In late April and May of 2023, PEPE‚Äôs value skyrocketed, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion at its peak. Early investors saw huge gains, and a strong community formed around it. This surge sparked what some call a ‚Äúmemecoin season,‚Äù with new memecoins popping up and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE‚Äôs roadmap includes plans for major exchange listings and aims for a ‚Äúmeme takeover.‚Äù Whether PEPE will reach new heights remains uncertain, but with the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a Bull Run, many are watching closely. For those intrigued by meme coins and high-risk, high-reward opportunities, PEPE might be an attractive option in the current market. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is an innovative project founded in 2017 and launched on Binance in 2019. It‚Äôs building an open, decentralized machine learning network powered by blockchain technology. Fetch.ai aims to make AI accessible to everyone through a permissionless network. This allows anyone to connect and use secure datasets with autonomous AI agents performing tasks across its global data network. Applications include optimizing DeFi trading, improving transportation systems, enhancing smart energy grids, and revolutionizing travel‚Äîany complex system relying on large-scale data. With its unique blend of AI and blockchain, Fetch.ai has significant potential. In the current market, the coin looks promising, especially as interest in AI and decentralization grows. Price predictions suggest FET could gain value in the coming years, reaching over $1 by 2025 and $1.19 by 2030. Compared to other AI-focused coins like SingularityNET or Ocean Protocol, Fetch.ai stands out with its autonomous agents and practical applications. As demand for AI solutions increases, Fetch.ai might be a project to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Stellar Lumens (XLM) Stellar Lumens (XLM) is changing the way money moves around the globe. Founded in 2014, Stellar is a decentralized network that uses blockchain technology to make sending funds fast and affordable. It doesn‚Äôt pick favorites among currencies. Instead, it allows people to transfer any type of money, whether it‚Äôs a national currency or a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Over the years, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and teamed up with major companies. With Stellar apps, individuals can send money worldwide, and businesses can build their own blockchain tools or use the network for payments and currency exchanges. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies that aim to replace traditional financial systems, Stellar wants to work with them. It offers a platform where different financial systems can collaborate. This approach sets it apart in the current market, where cooperation is becoming more important. The Stellar Development Foundation, supported initially by Stripe, helps promote the network‚Äôs use. It works on projects like NFT creation and smart contracts. As the crypto market evolves, Stellar‚Äôs focus on bridging old and new financial worlds might make it stand out among other coins. Its technology and partnerships could play a key role in the future of global finance.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price shifts in recent times. Over the past week, its value dropped by 15.25%, marking a significant decline. In the last month, the price decreased by 2.48%, and over six months, it edged down by 2.16%. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range of $3648.43 to $4137.17, reflecting the volatility in the market. Technical indicators hint at possible future movements for Ethereum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.07, approaching oversold levels, suggesting a potential rebound. The Stochastic indicator stands at 21.50, also indicating an oversold condition. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -21.52, showing bearish momentum. The price hovers near its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $3331.27 and $3461.32, respectively. Ethereum‚Äôs immediate resistance level is at $4318. If the price breaks above this point, it could aim for the second resistance at $4807, an increase of around 11%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3340.38. A drop below this could lead to the second support level at $2851.64, a decrease of about 15%. Given the current indicators and support levels, Ethereum may be poised for a turnaround or further decline, making this a critical juncture for the asset. XRP (XRP) Over the past six months, XRP has seen a remarkable increase of 366.94%. This significant rise reflects strong interest and trading activity around the cryptocurrency. In the last month, XRP‚Äôs price climbed by 77.14%, showcasing a robust upward trend. However, the past week experienced a dip of 7.81%, indicating some short-term volatility. Currently, XRP is trading between $2.03 and $2.73. The nearest resistance level is at $3.02, a point that, if surpassed, could lead to testing the second resistance at $3.73. On the other hand, the nearest support lies at $1.61, with a secondary support at $0.9041. These levels are key indicators of potential price movement in either direction. Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $2.24 and $2.28 respectively, suggesting the market is consolidating. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.72, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0059, which could point to a mild bearish sentiment. Monitoring these indicators can provide insight into XRP‚Äôs potential price direction in the near future. Solana (SOL) SOL has faced notable price shifts recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 18.80%, and over the last month, it decreased by 30.50%. Despite these declines, Solana has grown by 34.97% over the past six months. The current trading range is between $205.85 and $239.87, showing significant volatility. Technical indicators suggest the bearish trend might persist. The RSI is at 38.29, nearing oversold levels. The MACD is negative at -1.376, and the Stochastic oscillator is low at 26.34. These figures point towards potential further declines, but they could also hint at an upcoming reversal if buyers step in. Solana‚Äôs nearest support is at $188; falling below this could lead to a drop to the next support at $154. On the upside, resistance levels are at $256 and $290. To reach the first resistance, Solana needs to rise by about 8%. A decline to the nearest support means a decrease of around 10%. The 10-day SMA is $182.89, and the 100-day SMA is $193.52, indicating recent prices are above average. Conclusion Though ETH, XRP, and SOL are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely merges sports and memes, positioning itself for significant growth in the current bull run.

Among the many players in this space, Qubetics , Tron, and Immutable X stand out for their distinct approaches and recent developments. Each of these altcoins offers unique insights into the evolving blockchain landscape. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at their current status and potential. Qubetics: Transforming Financial Interactions Through Blockchain Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in blockchain innovation with a mission to revolutionise how financial transactions occur. By offering a secure, user-friendly, and inclusive platform, Qubetics allows individuals and institutions to manage tokenised assets effortlessly while conducting efficient cross-border payments . Its goal is to redefine global finance through accessible financial services, tokenised asset trading, and innovative payment solutions. In Presale Phase 14 , Qubetics has captured significant attention due to its structured presale model. Weekly phases see a 10% price increase, and the final stage promises a 20% hike, creating a sense of urgency for early investors. Priced at $0.037 per $TICS token, the project has raised over $7.5 million, boasts more than 11,500 holders, and sold 372 million tokens. The anticipated post-presale price of $0.25 signals an ROI of 630% for current buyers, making it an enticing opportunity. Analysts further predict that the token could rise to between $10 and $15 after the mainnet launch, highlighting its long-term potential. With a clear vision, strong presale momentum, and a strategic roadmap, Qubetics is a project to watch closely in blockchain. Tron (TRX): Challenges Amidst Market Pressure Tron, once a prominent player in the DeFi space, has recently faced significant hurdles. Its native token, TRX, has been on a consistent downward trajectory, recording a 10.56% loss over the past week. The decline has raised concerns among investors, especially as the network struggles to compete with Ethereum in the supply of USDT. Tether‚Äôs recent minting activities have seen Ethereum secure a larger share of the $2 billion in USDT issued since early November, leaving Tron behind. This shift has added to the mounting challenges TRX faces, further diminishing its appeal in the eyes of investors. Adding to the pressure, large-scale holders or ‚Äúwhales‚Äù increasingly highlight newer projects like Lunex Network, which offer high growth potential. While Tron‚Äôs robust infrastructure and active community suggest that it retains the capacity for recovery, the network must innovate and address these challenges to regain investor confidence and market relevance. Immutable X (IMX): Volatility Ahead of Token Unlock Immutable X, a blockchain platform based in Sydney, Australia, has established itself as a leading Ethereum Layer 2 solution specialising in NFTs and gaming. However, the platform faces significant price volatility as it approaches a major token unlock event. Immutable X plans to release 24.5 million IMX tokens, valued at over $33 million, as part of its tokenomics strategy. This monthly release, a standard feature of the project‚Äôs design, introduces additional supply to the market, often leading to downward price pressure. IMX‚Äôs price has declined to its lowest since November 21, falling below critical support levels. Analysts predict further declines leading up to the unlock event on December 27, with the token potentially approaching a support zone around $1.1720. A Diversified Approach to Investing The stories of Qubetics, Tron, and Immutable X underscore the diversity of opportunities within the cryptocurrency market. Qubetics offers a promising presale phase with exceptional ROI potential and a transformative vision for blockchain-based financial services. Tron‚Äôs challenges reflect the competitive nature of the DeFi sector, yet its infrastructure and community offer hope for a turnaround. Despite short-term volatility, Immutable X continues to innovate in the NFT and gaming space, making it a key player in these expanding industries. Investors must assess their risk tolerance, investment goals, and market trends to make informed decisions about these altcoins. As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, these projects highlight cryptocurrencies‚Äô dynamic possibilities.

Floki: From Meme Coin to Utility Token with Real-World Applications Floki, inspired by Elon Musk‚Äôs June 2021 tweet about naming his Shiba Inu ‚ÄúFloki,‚Äù began as Floki Inu coin but has evolved beyond a meme coin. It provides utility and charity, such as building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria. Recognized by The Economic Times as a top meme coin to buy in 2023, Floki has projects like the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and DeFi service FlokiFi. Its partnership with NOWPayments and the Floki Card allow tokens to be used for real-world transactions. This diversification into NFTs, DeFi, and real-world use differentiates FLOKI from other meme coins. The coin may appear attractive in the current market cycle due to its expanding utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. The coin started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB aims for broader utility by developing platforms like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and governance system. Its integration with Ethereum allows for potential growth in decentralized applications. Conclusion While FLOKI and SHIB show shifting patterns and may have less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN anticipates 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with potential for massive returns. Following successful tokens like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solaxy nears $5M presale goal, offering low entry prices and high staking APY to early investors on Solana‚Äôs Layer 2. Table of Contents Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Solaxy (SOLX) is developing a Layer 2 solution to enhance the user experience on Solana , and investors are taking notice. Less than two weeks have passed since the presale started, and the project‚Äôs funds are just $419,000 away from the $5 million mark. Since the project is still in its early stages, investors have a chance to secure their share of SOLX at a low price and benefit from a massive staking APY to maximize their investment. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at this project and what it‚Äôs all about. You might also like: Crypto.com launches U.S. trust company Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum The Solaxy presale officially opened its doors to early investors on December 12th, and it has already raised over $4.5 million. While the project‚Äôs scope plays its part in attracting investors, Solaxy is featured on Best Wallet‚Äôs Upcoming Tokens section, making it available to the app‚Äôs 100,000+ monthly users and boosting its visibility further. This makes it very similar to Pepe Unchained (PEPU), an Ethereum -based Layer 2 blockchain project that successfully ended its presale phase with over $73 million raised. Once its presale ended, PEPU launched on Uniswap and soared by more than 600% in the first 48 hours, securing listings on LBank, BingX, MEXC, and other exchanges as its price rose. Comparing the early success of these two presales puts Solaxy ahead, as Pepe Unchained took more than a month to raise $4.5 million. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1870529241072173066 To enter the presale, investors can purchase SOLX using BNB, ETH, USDT , or a bank card. No minimum investment is required. Currently, SOLX costs $0.001576 each, but its per-token price will increase in just one day or if the presale raises another $273,000 by tomorrow. If Solaxy keeps its momentum, it could surpass PEPU‚Äôs success and potentially deliver better returns on launch. Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Solana is among the top three blockchains by transaction volumes, and its daily transaction count has only increased with pump.fun‚Äôs launch. As such, its ecosystem is prone to network overloads and congestion that can result in failed transactions or slow transaction speeds. Solaxy intends to resolve these issues with its Layer 2 blockchain, which will reduce the burden on Solana‚Äôs Layer 1 chain by bundling up and processing transactions in its stead. This won‚Äôt just make Solana more scalable but also more cost-effective for its users. Plus, the bundled transactions will still be finalized on Solana‚Äôs network, leveraging its robust security. The development of the Solaxy Layer 2 blockchain is in full swing, fueled by 30% of the project‚Äôs total 138 billion token supply. Crypto analyst ClayBro has reminded his 134,000-strong audience on YouTube of the congestion issues Solana users faced in March, April, and June of 2024 during meme coin booms. As he anticipates a meme coin supercycle, ClayBro is impressed by Solaxy‚Äôs goal to improve Solana‚Äôs performance and advises his followers to enter the presale while it‚Äôs in its early stages. Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Despite Solaxy‚Äôs ambitious goals and the utility of its upcoming Layer 2 blockchain, it‚Äôs a meme coin first, and as such, its success largely depends on the strength and trust of its community. The project‚Äôs 4-phase roadmap reveals it has a strong focus on community building. Its first phase prioritizes marketing, for which the project allocated 15% of its total token supply, and that has already attracted over 22,000 followers across Solaxy‚Äôs X (Twitter) and Telegram channels. The presale also adopts a dynamic model for staking rewards to encourage early adoption. As more SOLX gets added to the staking pool, the staking yields reduce, which rewards early participants with the best returns. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 Currently, the project offers an 859% staking APY, allowing investors to nearly 9x their token holdings long-term. Solaxy‚Äôs developers also emphasize investor security, with 10% of the total token supply reserved for liquidity to ensure a safe trading environment. Plus, Coinbase , a security firm, audited the project‚Äôs smart contract and found no issues in its code. Although volatility is as high as ever in the meme coin space, Solaxy stands a solid chance to explode following its DEX launch and the subsequent release of its Layer 2 blockchain.

Dogecoin & Other Top Memecoins Have Seen A Decline In Social Dominance In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about how cryptocurrency market sentiment on social media has changed amid the latest bearish downturn. The indicator of relevance here is the Social Dominance, which keeps track of the percentage of social media discussions related to the top 100 coins by market cap that a particular asset or group of assets is contributing right now. The indicator measures the degree of discussion or talk related to an asset by counting up the number of posts that are making unique mentions of it. The reason it doesn‚Äôt count up the mentions themselves is that they can provide a false picture of the trend being followed in the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Top Above $168,500 Based On This Indicator, Analyst Reveals Focusing on just the posts means that a few outlier ones with hundreds of mentions can‚Äôt skew the data by themselves and the metric only registers a spike when discussion is spread across the major social media platforms. In the context of the current topic, the Social Dominance of two asset classes is of interest: the Layer 1 Top 6 and the Memecoin Top 6. The former includes the six largest layer 1 networks (that is, blockchains that handle their own security and aren‚Äôt built on top of another network, like Bitcoin) and the latter the six largest meme-based tokens (like Dogecoin). Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Social Dominance for these two types of cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks: As displayed in the graph, the Social Dominance of the Memecoin Top 6 was high a couple of weeks ago, implying social media users were highly interested in Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and other such tokens. Since then, however, the metric has followed an overall downward trajectory for this class of assets. It would appear that investor attention has shifted to Bitcoin and other layer 1 assets, as their combined social dominance has risen during the same period. Historically, whenever Dogecoin and other memecoins have been at the center of attention in the market, it has been a sign that the investors are becoming greedy. Related Reading: XRP Could Be The Altcoin To Recover Quickly, CryptoQuant Analyst Explains Why Cryptocurrency markets generally tend to move against the expectations of the majority, so it may not be a surprise that this greedy sentiment was followed by a downturn in the sector. The shift in Social Dominance to safer investments like Bitcoin would imply the investors are now becoming fearful. It‚Äôs possible that the sector would continue to decline in the coming days, but at least with the sentiment seeing a flip, there is more of a chance that a bottom can be reached. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.31, down more than 24% over the last seven days.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

Then, in 2021, Solana attracted the market‚Äôs interest by blazing blockchain scalability and speed. One issue many investors wonder about as the sector develops is which altcoin will copy these spectacular profits in 2025. One competitor that stands out is Rexas Finance (RXS) , a concept ready to rethink asset tokenization completely. Rexas Finance is a top choice for investors wishing to profit from the next great opportunity since analysts estimate gains of up to 10,000% by 2025. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Ethereum‚Äôs 2017 ascent The explosive climb of Ethereum in 2017 was just amazing. Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain‚Äôs release helped distributed apps (dApps), distributed finance (DeFi), and ‚Äî above all‚Äî smart contracts ‚Äî which let developers create programmable assets‚Äîto emerge. Ethereum surged from roughly $8 in early 2017 to over $1,400 by January 2018 due to this invention, generating a tsunami of demand from institutional investors, developers, and regular users. Ethereum‚Äôs success came from its strong ecosystem of projects and developers and its unique capacity to offer a venue for creating distributed apps. Despite significant obstacles, including high transaction fees and scalability problems, Ethereum stayed a prominent participant in the market, and its success encouraged a fresh round of blockchain initiatives. Solana: The 2021 sensation By 2021, Solana became the next major altcoin with significant potential profits. Early investors would find exceptional gains as SOL‚Äôs price skyrocketed from about $1 at the start of the year to over $200 by the year‚Äôs conclusion. The scalability of Solana and the expanding DeFi and NFT ecosystems created on its platform drove its success. Solana is still a prominent player in the blockchain market despite network failures and technical problems in 2022; many think it has great potential for development in the following years. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 Rexas Finance: The next 10,000% altcoin? One altcoin that is attracting significant attention as we approach 2025 is Rexas Finance . Rexas Finance addresses a distinct challenge: tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), while Ethereum and Solana concentrate mainly on dApps and blockchain scalability. The project seeks to tokenize tangible and financial assets, including real estate, commodities, and intellectual property, generating more liquidity and accessibility for investors. Rexas Finance could upset established asset markets using blockchain technology to permit fractional ownership and enable smooth trade of tokenized assets. This invention will democratize access to valuable assets, appealing to regular consumers and institutional investors. The project‚Äôs ecosystem includes a suite of tools for asset tokenization, including the Rexas Token Builder, QuickMint Bot, and the GenAI system, simplifying the process of creating and managing digital assets. The presale performance of Rexas Finance is among its most interesting developments. With tokens valued at $0.15 in Stage 10, Rexas Finance is in the middle of a successful presale as of writing. $29,341,073 has been raised for the presale so far, and early backers of the project are hopeful about its exponential expansion once it launches on tier-1 exchanges in 2025. Being an exciting altcoin for long-term expansion, some analysts estimate RXS might experience a price spike of up to 10,000% by the end of 2025. Why might Rexas Finance be the next major altcoin? Rexas Finance‚Äôs unique value proposition and capacity to solve critical issues in the asset management field define its potential for significant returns. By allowing the tokenization of actual assets, Rexas Finance is opening doors for most people, opening previously unreachable investing possibilities. Furthermore, appealing to institutional investors seeking blockchain-based solutions to manage their assets, the project emphasizes security, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Moreover, the success of Rexas Finance‚Äôs presale and expanding community will help indicate its significant expansion in 2025. Because of its constant creativity and emphasis on streamlining asset tokenization, Rexas Finance could be a candidate for the best altcoin with a 10,000% ROI in 2025. Conclusion Rexas Finance could be the next major altcoin to provide tremendous gains in 2025. With its emphasis on real-world asset tokenization, successful presale, and roadmap addressing important asset management issues, Rexas Finance is positioned for exponential development.

This is coming off the back of a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) by one of the leading voices in crypto security, Tayvano, also known as Tay, who raised concerns about the activities of hackers linked to the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK) on the Hyperliquid bridge. Tayvano‚Äôs post referenced some addresses linked to DPRK hackers who lost over $700,000 in trading on Hyperliquid. The alarm seems to have triggered major FUD in the Hyperliquid community, leading to a movement of over $114 million in USDC from the platform. According to Tayvano, the loss of $700,000 from those trading addresses wasn‚Äôt a mistake but a test to check for vulnerabilities on the platform. She said, ‚ÄúYall, DPRK doesn‚Äôt trade. DPRK tests.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the kind of news Hyperliquid expects after it recently recorded over $13 billion in a 24-hour trading volume thanks to increased trading activities on its platform fueled majorly by its airdrop event, which happened less than a month ago. Ironically, its liquidity could also be why it popped up on the hackers‚Äô radar. It‚Äôs worth noting that this isn‚Äôt the first time Tayvano has called the attention of the Hyperliquid team to the activities of North Korean hackers on its trading platform. Tay raised an alarm two weeks ago and offered to work with the Hyperliquid team to mitigate the risks DPRK hackers may pose to the platform. A trail of losses due to the Hyperliquid FUD As of this writing, Hyperliquid hasn‚Äôt released any comments, and its token, HYPE, is currently down by over 20%. Two major whales are liquidating close to $4 million of their assets. According to Entropy Advisors on X, Hyperliquid has four validators, and if three of these four validators are compromised, it can lead to a loss of $2.2 billion in USDC across the bridge. While this hasn‚Äôt happened yet and may never happen, the prospect hasn‚Äôt helped quell the ongoing FUD as it calls into question the security of the Hyperliquid platform. It also presents an ongoing issue for bridges in general. Blockchain bridges like Hyperliquid have been touted as the future of on-chain transactions; however, these bridges have been known to be relatively vulnerable to hacks . They account for over 31% of the total value of funds lost to hacks, according to Defillama . Popular bridge hacks such as the Ronin, Binance, and Nomad bridge hacks have resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions. Orbit chain, socket and ALEX bridge are the most recent bridges to suffer hacks and lose millions as a result of cross-chain vulnerabilities that exist on bridges. False alarm or sound advice The alert Tayvano raised has brought other players in the blockchain security space with opposing views into the conversation. Some professionals are advising the Hyperliquid team to look into the concerns Tayvano raised. The other side of the argument has referred to her as a prophet of doom who is deliberately trying to undermine the Hyperliquid team and cause FUD because the team won‚Äôt work with her. An X user (@PixOnChain) observing the impact of Tayvano‚Äôs post on users mentioned that the fear of a potential hack has led to the loss of over $2 billion off Hyperliquid‚Äôs market cap. The X user added that continuous education, collaboration, and strengthened security will help defend against FUDs. In a now-deleted post on X, Jared Grey, the ‚Äúhead chef‚Äù at Sushi Labs, while admitting his respect for Tayvano wrote that he believes that having an open forum to address claims of security issues on any protocol should be encouraged. He believes addressing these issues without generating FUD among users is easy and with the right coordination, attacks will be reduced. DPRK government-sponsored hackers are at the forefront of crypto hacks, accounting for the majority of the crypto thefts recorded. They are reported to have raked in over $1.34 billion from doing that this year alone. These hackers are known to carry out large-scale and small-scale operations, leading to intensified efforts by the US and other governments to clamp down on their activities. The campaign to crack down on these bad actors has led to increased sophistication in North Korean hacker operations, who also invent creative ways of gaining unauthorized access into crypto circles, including as staff members.

BTC is showing bearish signs and might decline heavily below the $92,000 level. Bitcoin started a fresh decline below the $95,000 zone. The price is trading below $94,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $95,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $92,000 support zone. Bitcoin Price Revisits Support Bitcoin price failed to start another increase and extended losses below the $98,000 zone. BTC gained bearish momentum below the $96,500 and $95,500 levels. The price even spiked below $92,500. A low was formed at $92,417 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $94,000 level.

The first key resistance is near the $96,000 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $99,575 swing high to the $92,417 low. A clear move above the $96,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $96,800. A close above the $96,800 resistance might send the price further higher.

Some lesser-known digital assets might outperform major players like Solana and TRX by the end of 2024. This article uncovers five small-cap cryptocurrencies that could experience remarkable growth, capturing the attention of investors seeking the next big opportunity. You might also like: ETH and FLOKI set for breakouts, DOGEN smashes records with $4M presale DOGEN: The ultimate meme token for true alphas ready to conquer the market Imagine a life where luxury cars line a driveway, the bank account overflows with cash, and everyone keeps looking. That‚Äôs not just a fantasy ‚Äî that‚Äôs the DOGEN lifestyle. Designed for the ambitious, fearless, and always victorious, DOGEN isn‚Äôt just another meme coin; it‚Äôs the ultimate statement of dominance in the crypto space. HODL like a titan and rule the market DOGEN isn‚Äôt here to play small ‚Äî it‚Äôs here to dominate. With a jaw-dropping 700% surge projected before the presale even wraps up, this token is on track to hit the kind of explosive, thousand-fold gains that meme coins are known for this season. Ready to lead the charge? DOGEN is the opportunity to leave the competition in the dust. Get in early, lock position, and let others watch from the sidelines as early investors climb straight to the top. WIF, Popcat, Ponke? That was then ‚Äî DOGEN is now DOGEN is staking its claim as the alpha of the Solana blockchain, running shoulder-to-shoulder with giants like BONK, WIF, and Popcat; all of which have delivered legendary 1000% gains. This token is still flying under the radar, but not for long. With market trends shifting in its favor, DOGEN is positioned to smash through the charts during this bull run, setting new records and redefining what‚Äôs possible for meme coins. Build a DOGEN empire and get rewarded DOGEN isn‚Äôt just about gains ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building a legacy. The token‚Äôs airdrop campaign gives users the chance to flex an influence and stack massive rewards. All someone needs to do is spread the word on social media, grab tokens during the presale, and use a referral link to recruit others into the DOGEN movement. For every recruit, the user will earn a whopping 20% of their Golden Points from token purchases. The bigger the network, the more substantial their rewards, and the faster they rise to the top. DOGEN isn‚Äôt just another cryptocurrency; it‚Äôs a movement for those bold enough to seize the moment. The presale is heating up, the rewards are stacking high, and the path to dominance has never been clearer. Toncoin (TON): Cryptocurrency of the decentralized open network Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized, open-source layer-1 blockchain supported by the TON Foundation and community contributors. Initially developed by Telegram as Telegram Open Network with the ‚ÄòGram‚Äô token, the project was discontinued in May 2020 following an SEC court order. Renamed and continued by the community, Toncoin operates on a proof-of-stake consensus model, enhancing scalability and reliability. It aims to provide fast, secure payment services with minimal fees and develop an ecosystem that includes decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Toncoin shows potential for growth, suggesting attractiveness in the current market cycle. Aave: Decentralized lending and borrowing on Ethereum Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. Using smart contracts, Aave ensures transactions are managed by code rather than institutions. The platform supports 17 cryptocurrencies for lending and borrowing. Lenders receive aTokens, which represent their deposits and earn interest. A unique feature is flash loans, which are instant, require no collateral, and must be repaid within the same blockchain block. AAVE tokens offer benefits like fee reductions and voting rights on protocol changes, and can be used as collateral with added perks. The Safety Module provides a staking mechanism for risk mitigation. With its innovative technology, Aave holds significant potential in the DeFi space. Sui: A scalable and user-friendly Layer-1 blockchain platform Sui is a blockchain platform designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to use. It uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language to address issues in older blockchain systems. By introducing features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions, Sui aims to make blockchain applications more accessible to users. These innovations could help Sui gain wider adoption in the Web3 space. In the current market cycle, Sui‚Äôs focus on user experience and scalability may make it an attractive option for developers and users seeking efficient blockchain solutions. Aptos (APT): A scalable blockchain focusing on safety and flexibility Aptos (APT) is a new blockchain designed to address high transaction fees and network congestion found in systems like Ethereum before its Proof-of-Stake transition. Developed by Aptos Labs, founded by key contributors from Meta‚Äôs Diem project, it employs a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Aptos uses the Move programming language for smart contracts, highlighting safety, scalability, and flexibility. It supports a wide range of web3 applications. With its strong development team and focus on solving existing blockchain issues, Aptos has significant potential. In the current market cycle, its innovative approach to scalability and security may make it an attractive option for users and developers. Conclusion Though TON, AAVE, SUI, and APT show promise, they may offer less potential in the short term. DOGEN stands apart for those seeking the best in life, embodying luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of the presale with potential thousand-fold returns, it follows successful tokens like BONK and Popcat. DOGEN is building a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

With a presale price that‚Äôs less than your daily coffee fix (under $0.003), LCAI is gearing up to shake things up in both the AI and blockchain worlds. Some experts are throwing out bold predictions, with guesses as high as $2 in just 12 months‚Äîtalk about a glow-up! Let‚Äôs dive into why LCAI might be the next big thing to watch (and maybe invest in). 1. Unique AI-Blockchain Integration with Real-World Use Cases One of the main reasonsÕè for LCAI‚Äôs chance is its special skill to merge smart thinking with block chain tech. This mix makes LCAI different from many other coins in the market. While some projects may look at simple uses like DeFi or NFTs, LCAI brings AI-powered dApps to the block chain. This tech has many uses in the real world, across fields like money, health care, moving things and smart rule making. These areas are quickly using AI tools, and LCAI‚Äôs blockchain setup gives a place for these tools to grow well. As AI gets more and more key in digital change, the need for LCAI‚Äôs new tech will very likely soar, pushing its cost up. 2. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) ‚Äì A Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism Another factor that makes LCAI a strong contender for future growth is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW), PoI rewards network participants for performing AI computations‚Äîa first for the blockchain industry. By incentivizing meaningful AI tasks such as training machine learning models and running inferences, PoI ensures that the network is both secure and productive. This innovation not only makes LCAI more efficient but also provides tangible real-world value. As more developers and businesses realize the utility of LCAI‚Äôs PoI mechanism, the token could see rapid adoption and a corresponding price increase. 3. Deflationary Tokenomics Driving Long-Term Value LCAI‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics are another key reason why investors believe it could reach $2 within the next year. A portion of transaction fees in the LCAI network is burned, decreasing the total supply of tokens over time. This built-in scarcity mechanism creates upward pressure on the token‚Äôs price as demand increases. The burning of tokens also means that, over time, the total circulating supply of LCAI will be reduced, which can drive long-term value appreciation. As the demand for LCAI increases due to its real-world use cases and technological advancements, the deflationary model will help push the token‚Äôs price higher. 4. Institutional Whale Interest A Sign of Strong Future Growth LCAI has been attracting the attention of institutional investors and whales during its presale . This is a strong indicator of confidence in the token‚Äôs future potential. Large-scale investors typically focus on projects with strong technological foundations, real-world applications, and long-term growth potential. Whale interest in LCAI signals that these investors see a significant upside in the token. As more institutional players enter the market, the price of LCAI could see a dramatic surge, as these whales often control a significant portion of the supply, creating price pressure. Additionally, institutional backing often leads to increased market credibility, encouraging more retail investors to jump on board. LCAI‚Äôs Path to $2 With its unique AI and blockchain integration, innovative PoI consensus mechanism, deflationary tokenomics, and growing institutional interest, LCAI is primed for significant growth. While the current price is still under $0.003, the trajectory points toward substantial upside. With projected growth to $2 within the next 12 months, LCAI could become one of the top-performing assets in the crypto market. As the world continues to embrace AI technology and digital transformation, LCAI could become a major player in this space, making it an exciting token to watch for potential investors.

Amidst this fervor, an intriguing altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) , is quietly gaining momentum, promising an astonishing upside that could reach 50,000%. As the Bitcoin price continues to capture headlines with its potential rally toward $150,000, the cryptosphere is also witnessing the emergence of hidden altcoin gems like RCOF, which may redefine investment strategies in this dynamic market. Bitcoin Price Targets $150,000: A Perfect Storm of Catalysts The remarkable Bitcoin price journey in 2024, characterized by a 140% surge and a groundbreaking milestone of $100,000, has set the stage for an even brighter 2025. This rally was fueled by pivotal events, including the launch of Bitcoin Spot ETFs and Bitcoin‚Äôs fourth halving, which reduced block rewards and increased issuance scarcity. Institutional investors eagerly embraced the newly available ETFs, with holdings now accounting for 5% of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply. This institutional demand underscored Bitcoin‚Äôs growing appeal as an asset and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. The pro-crypto political shift in the United States further boosted the Bitcoin price performance. Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the 2024 presidential election ushered in policies that foster a favorable crypto environment, including a proposed national Bitcoin reserve. Technical analysis forecasts that the Bitcoin price potential will exceed $150,000 in 2025. The convergence of these catalysts has positioned Bitcoin not just as the market leader but as a beacon of transformative financial potential for the years ahead. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Hidden Altcoin Gem Amidst the Bitcoin price projected rally, RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a noteworthy altcoin, attracting attention for its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). RCOF integrates AI to improve trading strategies, offering real-time market analysis, automated trading, and personalized investment guidance. The platform‚Äôs standout feature is its advanced crypto AI robo-advisor, designed for novice and seasoned investors alike. This tool analyzes individual user profiles, assessing financial goals and risk tolerances to create tailored investment strategies that evolve with market conditions. Unlike conventional trading platforms, which require constant monitoring, RCOF‚Äôs robo-advisor operates autonomously, making real-time portfolio adjustments based on fluctuating market dynamics. RCO Finance sets itself apart with advanced AMM, using AI to automate trades, reduce human error, and optimize execution for consistent returns. Audited by SolidProof, its secure smart contracts improve user confidence in a crypto industry often plagued by fraud, ensuring reliability and efficiency for investors. Another key aspect of RCOF is its expansive access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate and commodities. This diversity allows investors to construct well-rounded portfolios that not only mitigate risks but also maximize potential returns. The tokenization of RWAs democratizes investment opportunities previously reserved for institutional players, enabling fractional ownership and opening new avenues for wealth generation. Moreover, RCO Finance offers an impressive leverage option of up to 1,000x, a rarity in the crypto space. This high leverage allows traders to amplify their investments significantly, achieving substantial returns even with smaller capital outlays. Why RCOF Altcoin is the Perfect Investment Option RCO Finance is currently conducting an altcoin presale, allowing early investors to acquire RCOF tokens at a favorable price point. In its fourth presale stage, RCOF altcoins are priced at $0.0777 each, with an additional 25% extra altcoins on purchase using the code RCOF25. Projections suggest that the token value could reach $0.60 at launch, offering early investors over 600% ROI. Beyond presale gains, RCOF token holders may benefit from reduced transaction fees, dividend distributions, and voting rights in governance decisions, providing financial incentives and a voice in the platform‚Äôs development. As the Bitcoin price oscillates towards a $150,000 rally, now is the time to consider diversifying your portfolio with promising projects like RCO Finance, as the altcoin market will follow a similar trend.

Unlike speculative projects like Bonk or storage-based solutions like Filecoin, FXGuys brings real utility to the table. Its focus on trading rewards, staking, and its Trader Funding Program makes it stand out. Let‚Äôs dive into what makes FXGuys the token to watch. What Sets FXGuys Apart? FXGuys is more than just a crypto token. It‚Äôs part of a larger ecosystem designed for traders and investors.

Staking Rewards : Users can stake $FXG tokens and earn passive income, creating steady demand for the token. These features show that FXGuys is focused on long-term growth and real-world value, unlike the speculative nature of Bonk or the niche use case of Filecoin. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Why FXGuys Beats Bonk Bonk gained popularity as a meme token, but its value relies on hype and speculation. It lacks meaningful utility, which limits its long-term potential. In contrast, FXGuys has a solid foundation. The Trade2Earn model ensures that $FXG remains valuable because it‚Äôs tied to actual activity on the platform. Traders earn rewards while adding liquidity and utility to the ecosystem. Bonk might offer short-term spikes, but FXGuys provides sustainable growth, making it a better choice for investors looking to turn $100 into $10,000. Why Filecoin Can‚Äôt Compete Filecoin offers decentralized storage solutions, making it a useful project within its niche. However, its growth depends on enterprise adoption, which can be slow and unpredictable. FXGuys , on the other hand, appeals directly to crypto traders‚Äîa highly active and growing market. The Trader Funding Program attracts professional and retail traders, ensuring consistent demand for $FXG tokens. Filecoin‚Äôs utility is limited to storage, while FXGuys powers trading, staking, and rewards, making it more versatile. How FXGuys Delivers $100 to $10,000 Returns FXGuys combines multiple revenue streams and growth drivers to achieve explosive potential. 1. High Utility The Trade2Earn model ensures that $FXG tokens are in constant demand. As trading activity increases, the token‚Äôs value grows. 2. Staking Opportunities Staking $FXG tokens not only generates passive income but also reduces circulating supply, creating scarcity that drives up prices. 3. Trader Funding Program The funding program brings more traders to the platform, increasing liquidity and overall ecosystem activity. This consistent growth boosts the token‚Äôs long-term value. 4. Community and Adoption FXGuys is attracting both professional and retail traders, creating a diverse and active user base. The more users join the platform, the greater the demand for $FXG tokens. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The Road Ahead for FXGuys FXGuys isn‚Äôt just about speculation; it‚Äôs about creating real value for users. By offering tools like the Trader Funding Program and staking rewards , it has built an ecosystem that rewards participation. Bonk‚Äôs reliance on hype and Filecoin‚Äôs niche focus can‚Äôt compete with FXGuys‚Äô broader appeal. Investors seeking massive returns should consider FXGuys for its utility, scalability, and market-driven growth. Conclusion FXGuys is a token built for the future. It combines real-world utility, trading rewards, and staking to create an ecosystem that grows with its users. Bonk may capture attention in the short term, and Filecoin serves its niche, but FXGuys offers the best chance to turn $100 into $10,000 .

This Viral Layer-1 Presale is Set to Be a Crypto Game-Changer,https://thecoinrise.com/didnt-catch-binance-coin-this-viral-layer-1-presale-is-set-to-be-a-crypto-game-changer/,"The cryptocurrency market has been on fire recently, with new developments shaking up the blockchain landscape. Binance Coin (BNB), the trusted token of the Binance ecosystem, has continued to be a cornerstone in the crypto world. At the same time, an exciting new player, Qubetics ($TICS) , has emerged as a viral Layer-1 project that‚Äôs already breaking records. These two tokens couldn‚Äôt be more different, but they‚Äôre both among the top cryptos to watch right now. Let‚Äôs dive into why Binance Coin is still a favourite for many, and how Qubetics is setting the stage to become a game-changer. Whether you‚Äôre chasing established reliability or early-stage innovation, this comparison will help you decide where to focus your energy. Qubetics ($TICS): The Revolutionary Layer-1 Blockchain Qubetics isn‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill crypto project. As the first Web3 aggregator, it‚Äôs designed to unify blockchain functionalities in a way that no one has done before. Already in its 14th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 372 million tokens, raising more than $7.5 million from 11,500 holders. Priced at $0.0377 per token, this presale is creating quite the buzz, especially with a 10% price hike set to kick in by the weekend. Analysts are calling Qubetics one of the top cryptos to watch right now, with jaw-dropping ROI predictions. With a $100,000 investment today, you could snag about 2.65 million $TICS tokens. At the projected price of $15 post-mainnet launch, that could turn into a mind-blowing $39.7 million. Cross-Border Payments: Real-Life Solutions for Everyone Imagine a startup in Kenya needing to pay a freelance developer in India. Traditional bank transfers can take days, and fees often eat into profits. With Qubetics, that transaction becomes instantaneous and nearly free. Its cross-border payment feature removes the need for intermediaries, making global payments faster and more affordable. Small businesses, freelancers, and even large corporations stand to benefit. A logistics company in Dubai can now streamline payments to suppliers in Southeast Asia without worrying about fluctuating exchange rates or banking delays. This is what makes Qubetics so revolutionary‚Äîit addresses real-world pain points and bridges gaps left by traditional systems. Why Qubetics is a Must-Watch With its viral presale and practical applications like cross-border payments, Qubetics is poised to reshape the crypto landscape. It‚Äôs not just a token; it‚Äôs a solution. If you‚Äôre looking for the top cryptos to watch right now , Qubetics offers innovation and potential that are hard to match. Binance Coin (BNB): The Reliable Cornerstone Binance Coin has been a staple in the crypto space for years, thanks to its role in the Binance ecosystem. As the utility token of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange, BNB has maintained its position as a go-to token for traders and developers alike. Trading at $224, it has weathered market volatility better than most, proving its reliability. Binance‚Äôs ongoing expansion, including regulatory compliance and licensing in major markets, has strengthened BNB‚Äôs position. The recent upgrades to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have added even more use cases, making it a hub for DeFi projects, NFTs, and dApps. Real-World Use Cases Driving Demand Think of Binance Coin as the Swiss Army knife of crypto. From paying lower transaction fees on Binance to participating in token launches, BNB‚Äôs versatility is unmatched. Its integration into the Binance Card and Binance Pay systems allows users to make everyday purchases seamlessly. For instance, someone in New York could buy coffee with BNB, while a traveller in Paris could pay for a hotel stay. The BSC ecosystem is also booming. Developers prefer its low transaction fees and high speeds, making it a popular choice for building decentralised applications. This constant demand ensures BNB remains a top contender among the top cryptos to watch right now. Why Binance Coin Deserves Its Spot Binance Coin‚Äôs strength lies in its stability and utility. While it may not offer the sky-high ROI potential of a presale like Qubetics, its reliability and widespread adoption make it a cornerstone for any diversified portfolio. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics and Binance Coin are both among the top cryptos to watch right now, offering unique benefits tailored to different investment goals. Qubetics represents the thrill of innovation, with its revolutionary Layer-1 blockchain and practical features like cross-border payments. Its viral presale success and staggering ROI potential make it an opportunity that‚Äôs hard to ignore. On the other hand, Binance Coin offers stability and proven utility. Its integration into everyday use cases and its role in the thriving Binance ecosystem make it a solid choice for long-term investors. If you‚Äôre ready to explore the future of crypto, consider joining the Qubetics presale at $0.0377 per token before the price hike this weekend. Whether you prefer the innovation of Qubetics or the reliability of Binance Coin, these two projects are shaping the crypto market in their own unique ways.

By allowing the tokenization of actual assets, Rexas Finance is opening doors for most people, opening previously unreachable investing possibilities. Furthermore, appealing to institutional investors seeking blockchain-based solutions to manage their assets, the project emphasizes security, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Moreover, the success of Rexas Finance‚Äôs presale and expanding community will help indicate its significant expansion in 2025.

The benefits would be captured by a new oracle, a Smart Value Recapture (SVR), which was released on December 23. The SVR oracle will capture profits from maximum extractable value (MEV) to benefit DeFi protocols. At the same time, Aave suggested adding SVR ‚Äúto recapture MEV from Aave liquidations and return it to the Aave ecosystem.‚Äù Blockbuilders have occasionally enjoyed profits from MEV by simply reordering transactions before releasing finished blocks to the public blockchain ledger. Aave plans to redirect 40% of MEV profits to users With Aave, users can use other crypto assets as collateral while borrowing cryptocurrency. However, the user risks forfeiting the collateral if its value declines too much. Part of the proposal reads: Whenever a position needs to be liquidated, [a third-party] liquidator repays some debt and receives the equivalent value in collateral, plus a percentage on top denominated liquidation bonus. The system has been classic, but recently, there has been a problem that calls for an update of the MEV system. The forfeiture or liquidation bonus is a clear and direct chance for MEV to create a good profit for the builder. Yet, in this case, the builder does the minimum. On the contrary, the protocol users receive very little in proportion. This needs rectification. According to Aave, Chainlink‚Äôs SVR is a service that sells, via an MEV-Share auction, ‚Äúthe right to back-run‚Äù Chainlink‚Äôs price-feed oracle and profit from liquidations. To benefit users, the DeFi protocol intends to redirect nearly 40% of MEV profits to Aave DAO. Ethereum users and protocols turn to private transactions for MEV protection Users and protocols are currently protecting against MEV. Most protocols and users across the Ethereum network are deliberately trying to run away from the costs of harmful MEVs. There are a lot of private transactions in Ethereum‚Äôs order flow as users are out to protect trades. Users prefer to go through the dark pool arrangement , sending transactions directly to validators instead of sending orders through the public queue. Private orders are sent to validators directly for protection against MEV.

This could be the chance to join the alpha pack and dominate the market. PEPE: The deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary meme coin launched on the Ethereum network, inspired by the early 2000s internet meme, Pepe the Frog. It seeks to emulate the success of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, featuring no transaction taxes and embracing a pure meme coin identity with no utility. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and sparking a meme coin frenzy. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. The coin incorporates a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, supporting its stability. In the current market cycle, PEPE continues to attract interest due to its strong community and unique features. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. The coin started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB aims for broader utility by developing platforms like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and governance system. Its integration with Ethereum allows for potential growth in decentralized applications. Conclusion While PEPE and SHIB may offer limited short-term gains, DOGEN is designed for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and the potential for thousand-fold returns during this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. Building a community of alpha leaders, it provides real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 03:55:00

Analysts are still optimistic, as the XRP price has slightly recovered in recent hours, even after being weighed down by macroeconomic factors like the Federal Reserve‚Äôs revised rate cut. Similarly, amidst this uncertainty, investors are shifting to an emerging altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF). This innovative altcoin integrates AI-powered Robo-advisor and blockchain technology to transform how we invest. Additionally, analysts predict a 12,000% ROI by January, which could outpace the XRP price performance. XRP Price: Is it the Beginning of a Bear Market? The XRP price experienced a significant single-day loss, falling by 7% amidst the broader market downturn, with the 24-hour range between $1.98 and $2.70. At press time, the XRP price is trading at $2.16, a 7.3% decline in the past 24 hours. The XRP price decline coincided with the Federal Reserve announcement to reduce expected rate cuts for 2025, which has dampened optimism in risk markets such as crypto. Despite the XRP price decline, the token has found strong support just below its current level, giving hope to investors. Similarly, analysts remain optimistic about the XRP price recovery. One analyst, Dark Defender, tweeted on X, noting that a clear breakout is on the daily chart, and predicted that the XRP price might test the $2.42 level. If the momentum continues, the XRP price will push past $2.92. As the XRP price wavers, the spotlight is shifting to more dynamic projects like RCO Finance, an altcoin with a focus on redefining trading using cutting-edge AI technology and blockchain technology. RCO Finance: The Rival Altcoin Poised for 12,000% ROI by January While XRP struggles, RCO Finance (RCOF) is making headlines as an altcoin with exponential growth potential. The RCOF altcoin‚Äôs innovative blend of AI and blockchain technology will transform investors with cutting-edge tools for wealth creation. The RCOF altcoin‚Äôs main appeal is its AI-powered Robo-advisor . This tool analyses market conditions in real-time to provide investors with personalized investment strategies. It‚Äôs like having a personal finance advisor available 24/7 to optimize your portfolio and minimize risks. For example, the crypto market is quite volatile making many investors struggle with decision-making. With the Robo-advisor, the tool can monitor market fluctuations and identify actionable insights to help investors minimize losses and maximize returns. Similarly, with RCOF altcoin, users can stay ahead of market changes regardless of expertise level. Again, the RCO finance platform gives users access to over 120,000 tradable assets, including crypto, stocks, bonds, FX, ETFs, and real-world assets like commodities and real estate. With this diversification, investors can spread risks and maximize their returns. The RCO Finance platform prioritizes privacy and anonymity with its KYC-free approach. This enables a frictionless onboarding process by avoiding the lengthy ID verification. Investors who prefer anonymity and privacy will find value in the RCOF altcoin. Besides these gains, the RCOF users will enjoy reduced transaction fees and dividends and actively participate in the platform‚Äôs governance decisions. This gives investors direct influence over the RCOF altcoin growth and development. Finally, the RCOF altcoin prioritizes security. Hence, SolidProof has rigorously audited the platform to confirm that it‚Äôs free from vulnerabilities. Adherence to high-security standards boosts investor confidence in the RCOF altcoin.

And since we‚Äôre continually seeing predictions of things like BTC to $200k , there‚Äôs exponentially more opportunity for smart altcoin investors. Dogizen is getting ready for its open market bonanza when the crypto bull run fully sends. Its secret weapon? Being the first-ever Telegram ICO in history. Here‚Äôs why. Why Dogizen‚Äôs ICO approach is so significant Telegram is the spiritual home for so many crypto investors. It‚Äôs growing at a phenomenal pace. Onboarding new markets to the cryptosphere, and its gaming sector specifically, is offering crypto‚Äôs next billion users . Now Telegram, the hottest crypto town square, has an ICO right in the middle of it for the first time ever. It‚Äôs being fed directly to crypto noobs and veterans alike. And they don‚Äôt even need to leave their beloved messaging app. Buy, claim, and hold DOGIZ all from within Telegram. What‚Äôs more, simply holding an ICO gives Dogizen an advantage. Dogizen‚Äôs close competitors all unleashed their tokens via airdrop: good for rapid token distribution, bad for token price. This has caused Hamster Kombat, Catizen, DOGS, and Notcoin to all see tragically large slumps post-launch. Dogizen has learned from these mistakes. How the crypto bull run is ready to supercharge DOGIZ Every investor looking at the billion-dollar Telegram gaming market that Dogizen sits within has likely noticed something. Pretty much all of Dogizen‚Äôs competitors have, a) had Binance listings and b) smashed market caps of between $100 million and over $2 billion. And that‚Äôs despite their terrible, airdrop-induced performance. This success was happening before Q4 of this year when the market got really spicy. Unlike its competitors, Dogizen will hit the open market in Q1 of 2025. With Trump in office and a likely flood of pro-crypto regulation , Dogizen is set to catch the perfect wave. Dogizen is listing at what looks like a deliberately modest market cap of around $10 million. With no airdrop sell pressure and perfect market conditions inbound, Dogizen‚Äôs chart is eyeing up plenty of green. If Dogizen reaches the market caps of the Telegram gaming average, investors can expect a 50x. And for investors getting involved today, an additional 41.56% gains are in store.

Led by CEO Ivan Soto Wright, the platform helps investors buy and sell cryptos as well as NFTs easily. It is like a PayPal but for cryptocurrencies. The project is capturing the spotlight as there are news about them acquiring Helio pay, a crypto payment gateway. MoonPay Role in Crypto Space MoonPay has launched innovative crypto payment solutions like MoonPay Balance. This is a fiat to crypto transfer tool that works seamlessly with wallets like MetaMask. Rolled out in 27 European countries last month, this feature gives users a straightforward way to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. But the company isn‚Äôt stopping there. A potential acquisition of Helio Pay, rumored to cost $150 million, might be their next big leap. Helio Pay Acquisition News Helio Pay is no small name in the crypto world. The platform is like Coinbase Commerce, helping over 6,000 merchants and creators accept payments in Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital currencies. It even integrates Solana Pay into Shopify, a platform with millions of users globally. This is going to be an amazing combo as MoonPay already serves more than 20 million users in over 160 countries. According to Eleanor Terrett from Fox Business, MoonPay is in in talks to acquire helio for about $150 million. Source : X.com If this acquisition goes through, this is going to be a big thing for crypto space especially for e-commerce merchants and their users. MoonPay will get to expand its reach and e-commerce will get enhancement with its services. How great would it be if you could use crypto to buy stuff online just like using a credit card ‚Äî easy and simple. Why This Matters This potential deal highlights MoonPay‚Äôs ambitions of making crypto transactions easier for individuals. This will reshape how businesses and users interact with cryptocurrencies. Adding Helio Pay to their portfolio would strengthen their infrastructure. This would finally bring crypto payments into the mainstream. As crypto adoption grows globally, this is the perfect time to bring such enhancements to crypto payments. What to Expect Next If the Helio acquisition deal is closed, this will likely spark even more innovations in the crypto payment space. The company already has a bright name because of its focus on easing the crypto payments, the new takeover will shine the name even more.

The uptick has been largely driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), government acquisitions, and MicroStrategy‚Äôs ramping up of its BTC strategy, which has seen its stash grow to over 440,000 BTC. ETFs, MicroStrategy, Drive Institutional Inflows According to statistics shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, most of the known Bitcoin holdings are in the hands of miners and crypto exchanges.¬†However, MicroStrategy, ETFs, and several governments have eaten into their shares. Launched earlier in the year, spot BTC ETFs have seen billions of dollars in inflows from traditional financial institutions, with the likes of BlackRock‚Äôs iShares recording a staggering $1.4 billion in net weekly inflows as of mid-December. Collectively, data shows the sector accounts for more than 1.3 million BTC, valued at an eye-popping $124.89 billion. MicroStrategy is also a major holder of the number one cryptocurrency. Its treasury, consisting of roughly 2% of BTC‚Äôs circulating supply, is worth $46.15 billion. The company has bought the cryptocurrency several times in the last few years, breaking the record for the biggest monthly purchase in November when it acquired 134,480 BTC in three successive tranches of 27,200, 51,780, and 55,500. The Virginia-based firm‚Äôs success has spawned several copycats, including Japanese company Metaplanet, which just bought another 619.70 BTC to bring its total holdings to 1,761.98 BTC worth nearly $170 million. Other private entities holding Bitcoin include Block.one, with 164,000 units of the asset, stablecoin issuer Tether, which has 82,454 BTC according to Bitcoin Treasuries, and Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, with 8,285 BTC valued at nearly $796 million. Defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox also maintains a sizable chest of the virtual asset, numbering 44,899. Governments as Major Gateways The U.S. leads the pack among governments, with 198,109 BTC worth an estimated $19 billion in its care. Many came from the Silk Road, an infamous online black market known for facilitating the sale of drugs and other illegal goods and services. To maintain the anonymity of its users, the platform employed BTC as its primary currency, of which thousands were seized by law enforcement after they shut down the website and arrested its founder, Ross Ulbricht . Despite an existing ban on crypto, China also boasts an impressive Bitcoin haul of about 190,000. The Kingdom of Bhutan is another major holder. Its treasury, derived from mining, has 11,688 BTC, currently valued at $1.12 billion. El Salvador, which became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, boasts nearly 6,000 coins, much of it accrued under President Nayib Bukele‚Äôs Bitcoin per day policy. In total, about 2.45% of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs circulating supply, valued at $49.36 billion, is controlled by states.

According to a Bloomberg report , Singapore issued 13 crypto licenses to various operators in 2024. This includes major players like OKX and Upbit and global firms such as Anchorage, BitGo, and GSR. This marked a significant jump, more than doubling the number of licenses issued the previous year. Meanwhile, Hong Kong‚Äôs similar licensing program has been moving at a slower pace. Both cities are competing to draw in digital-asset firms by offering supportive frameworks, tokenization initiatives, and regulatory sandboxes. Authorities in both jurisdictions view crypto as a way to strengthen their positions as global business hubs. However, their progress has been uneven. Angela Ang, a senior policy adviser at TRM Labs, explained, ‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs rules are stricter in areas like customer asset custody and token policies, which may have tilted the scale toward Singapore.‚Äù Major exchanges such as OKX and Bybit have withdrawn their applications for Hong Kong crypto licenses Hong Kong‚Äôs licensing process has faced delays, with regulators aiming to approve more exchanges by the end of the year. So far, the city has fully licensed seven platforms, including four with restrictions granted on December 18, while another seven hold provisional crypto licenses.

The automation and security they provide are on a higher level than traditional systems, which explains their central role in DeFi and dApp development. In fact, it wouldn‚Äôt be an exaggeration to claim that they are key to blockchain progress. Atom Accelerator DAO recently wrote that CosmWasm, a powerful smart contract platform and the only one in Cosmos, was being defunded. CosmWasm enables developers to write and launch smart contracts on Cosmos SDK-based blockchains. It‚Äôs highly appreciated by developers, but apparently not businesses, at least at this time. The defunding is a fact, although CosmWasm is probably the most widely used platform after Solidity. Its open licensing model has allowed for its proliferation, benefiting a vast community. Raising funds for CosmWasm is critical CosmWasm is designed for interoperability and modularity, extending blockchain functionality by making it possible to create dApps and other blockchain solutions with dynamic logic. The unique properties of the Solidity programming language and EVM make unit testing in Solidity challenging, but testing in CosmWasm is easy and accessible. There is no way of migrating a project to another blockchain or composing across chains in Ethereum. CosmWasm provides this capacity by building upon the Cosmos SDK and IBC. CosmWasm is deployed on multiple interlinked blockchains, which reduces the strain on any single one, ensures low fees, and improves overall scalability. This benefits users as well as developers, enabling more efficient and cost-effective smart contract execution. CosmWasm uses Rust, a safe and modern programming language suitable for smart contract development. Rust is also used outside of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum and Solana, the two largest smart contract platforms, leverage it as well. Atom Accelerator DAO cites an analysis of 15 blockchains over the past year, which reveals shocking statistics that completely justify incredulity at CosmWasm‚Äôs defunding. 5.2 million accounts interacted with 15,700 deployed CosmWasm contracts in that time frame, and those contracts generated $5.7 million in fees. What‚Äôs more, building apps on CosmWasm is much more straightforward than a full-on Cosmos SDK app chain. Thanks to its modular design and seamless integration with Cosmos SDK, the smart contract platform has helped position the Cosmos ecosystem as a leader in decentralized, multichain applications. Positions of the funder and the developer The Interchain Foundation (ICF), which has been funding CosmWasm through Confio, a platform developing CosmWasm since 2020, underwent organizational restructuring. As a result, it has drastically reduced Confio‚Äôs funding for 2025. As Atom Accelerator DAO points out, this is a massive blow to the infrastructure powering an entire ecosystem and facilitating cross-chain interoperability. Specifically, ICF funding to Confio for 2025 is 28% of the funding for 2024. Assuming the same cost levels, this would cover just over three months of service. Confio will continue security and upgrades for the platform until mid-2025, intending to stretch this budget to half a year somehow. The funding issue is not recent. Confio announced they were pausing operations due to a lack of funding back in February 2023 . The organization wrote that its team of developers and blockchain experts had not received funding for their work since October 2022. They reached out to most CosmWasm-enabled chains and several major projects but failed to obtain funding for general ecosystem utilities. They were advised to monetize CosmWasm, but found no way to charge fees for the source code or core library licenses ‚Äúwhile remaining relevant.‚Äù At the time, they hoped to generate revenue through consulting work to build utilities on top of the CosmWasm stack. Still, defunding is a fact. Aligned with the conviction that CosmWasm is a critical resource for the interchain and that its development must go on, Atom Accelerator DAO has proposed to contribute $250,000 to a funding effort. Neutron‚Äôs initial commitment of the same amount kickstarted the initiative. While half a million dollars is definitely a good start, the funding isn‚Äôt enough for the year as CosmWasm consists of modules, tools, libraries, and documentation across almost two dozen repositories. Implications of CosmWasm‚Äôs silent collapse and how to prevent it The developments draw attention to a glaring issue in blockchain ‚Äì entities want to benefit from the ease of use and security of decentralized protocols and smart contracts but not invest in them. It‚Äôs impossible to overstate the benefits of smart contract applications. They increase efficiency, reduce counterparty risk, lower costs, and enhance transparency. CosmWasm addresses many security issues in Solidity, such as reentrancy attacks, a common DeFi exploit. It also provides more streamlined contract migration instead of adopting a proxy pattern and does away with multiple language elements, which were often misused, such as tx.origin for security. Confio writes that CosmWasm‚Äôs needs have been increasing in parallel to the number of users and the ecosystem, concluding that the platform has grown too large and they ‚Äúcan no longer afford to subsidize it.‚Äù The solution is in the hands of individuals and organizations with a vested interest in the growth and success of blockchain technology. Venture capitalists stand to gain returns on investment as smart contract platforms form the backbone of DeFi. Tech companies and blockchain startups use smart contracts for their products and build complementary technologies, like Layer 2 solutions or dApps. Finally, financial institutions use smart contracts to automate financial transactions, reduce costs, and increase transparency. The blockchain world can only hope they will step in at this critical time.",Information,EN,0,0,ATOM|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 04:45:10

According to analysts XRP market remains in an uptrend on the larger time frame, with key support found between $1.50 and $1.79. As long as XRP holds above these levels, the focus is on higher price targets. However, it is essential to note that the market remains fragile, as the breakout point is not yet fully established. Consolidation Phase and Potential for Higher Prices At present, XRP is consolidating, but there is still potential for upward movement. A successful breakout and further momentum could lead to an attack on the all-time high, which remains a strong possibility in the near future. However, a drop below the $1.96 level would shift the focus to the key support zone, between $1.50 and $1.79. Short-Term Outlook: Sideways Consolidation The price action appears to be in a sideways consolidation pattern, similar to what is seen on the HBAR chart. This consolidation could represent an Elliott Wave triangle pattern, which often leads to boring price movements. The triangle consists of five waves, and we are currently in the process of completing these waves. To confirm the continuation of this pattern, XRP would need to hold above the low of the C-wave at $1.94. If the price falls below $1.94, XRP could enter the Fibonacci support zone between $1.39 and $1.80, where further consolidation or correction may occur. Conclusion: Waiting for Confirmation Currently, there is little new development in the market, as XRP is either consolidating or showing minimal movement. The key levels to watch are $1.96 to the downside and the B-wave high around $2.72 to the upside. Any movement beyond these points will give clearer direction, but until then, we remain in a wait-and-see mode.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 05:00:11

There is serious talk about the US looking to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset to expand its influence in the cryptocurrency space. The crypto experienced a price surge to $105,000 after President Donald Trump stated his intention to create an SBR in an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer. The report states that Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity, portability, and decentralization make it a valuable complement to traditional reserves like gold. The move to establish a Bitcoin reserve is an effort to diversify the United States‚Äô national assets. Embracing the digital asset would also help the country hedge against systematic financial risks and secure an advantage over competitors. No restrictions on this side In his report, Matthew Pines states that BTC is an ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù opportunity for the US if it intends to win the strategic competition with the ‚Äúgeopolitical opportunists‚Äù and ‚Äúaggressive rivals‚Äù the administration will face for the next four years. In his report, he urges that the US take full advantage of the ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù to reinforce its position as a leader in financial innovation and bolster long-term fiscal sustainability. ‚ÄúChina made a strategic error when they banned Bitcoin and kicked their miners out in 2021. The US was the fortunate beneficiary of that mistake as miners relocated to our shores,‚Äù Matthew Pines states in his report. Over the years, the Chinese government has placed many restrictions on mining and cryptocurrency in an effort to maintain financial control and prevent capital outflows. The US already owns the largest BTC holdings, and the creation of the SBR would be the opposite of China‚Äôs economic model. To Scott Bessent, Pines says, ‚ÄúIn your role as Treasury Secretary, you can urge the President to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by Executive Order on Day 1.‚Äù Likely scenarios of a Bitcoin reserve The US stands to gain three critical benefits from the SBR according to the report. Firstly, it would send a signal that America supports Bitcoin and draw in capital to the markets reinforcing the strength of the financial system. Secondly, it would give the US a headstart among other nations adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This would mitigate the risk of other countries, some hostile and some not, making the move first. Lastly, it would secure the sustainability of the US‚Äôs fiscal position and renew the confidence in the treasury market. Pines‚Äô report is complete with a scenario analysis that explores the primary and secondary effects the SBR would have on the US economy if Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization were to reach different milestones, assuming the reserve had a total of $1M BTC. In every scenario, he found that holding more Bitcoin than allies and competitors benefits the US more than not investing in the rapidly growing asset. By Pines‚Äô calculations, the strategic Bitcoin reserve will save the US from adversaries. In the National Security Fellow‚Äôs words; ‚ÄúFailure to act risks ceding ground to adversaries who aim to dismantle the foundations of US economic and geopolitical power.‚Äù A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-24 05:01:16

MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin accumulation has attracted many new companies to follow the path; however, things at his den are unfavorable. With an argument that such hoarding would disrupt the company‚Äôs financial position, many shareholders denied Michael Saylor‚Äôs accumulation plans earlier. Will Saylor‚Äôs special proposal change the company‚Äôs fate? Well, that will be answered in the future. Until then, let‚Äôs sit back and read on to the proposal and community reaction. What‚Äôs in the 21/21 Plan? The 21/21 plan aims to raise $21 billion through equity financing and another $21 billion through bond issuance over three years. Saylor has already clarified that these funds will be used to buy more Bitcoin to showcase the company‚Äôs commitment to Bitcoin. Since mid-2020, MicroStrategy has already acquired 444,262 BTC, now worth around $42 billion, making it the fourth-largest Bitcoin holder globally. As an outcome, the company‚Äôs market cap has skyrocketed from $1.1 billion to $82 billion, and its shares have risen 477% this year. Key Proposals on the Table MicroStrategy has proposed increasing Class A shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion and raising preferred stock authorization from 5 million to 1.005 billion to support future financing and expand funding options. Plus, the company plans to update its equity incentive plan to grant automatic equity awards to new board members, aligning their compensation with its Bitcoin-focused strategy. This will ensure that the company is not out of funds at any time. Institutional adoption is driving Bitcoin‚Äôs growth‚Äîwhat‚Äôs next for its price? Read Bitcoin price prediction for expert insights! Community Reactions is Mixed The notice has sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community. A Twitter user Asymmetry clarified such shareholder voting is a long and time-consuming process, hence it allows gradual share issuance that can take over 10-15 years to fund Bitcoin purchases. This shows Saylor‚Äôs plan to hoard Bitcoin for a long time. However, some users, like @ibills, criticized the approach, suggesting shareholders should first see the results of current strategies before agreeing to further dilution. They argued that shareholder benefits, such as stock splits, should take priority before continuing payouts to others. It also means a massive liquidation fear in the future. Trump is also pushing his Bitcoin Reserve Plan in the US to strategically leverage the new adoptions and give the US economy an instant boost under his leadership. At this time Saylor is also giving companies in the US a hard time by putting his 21/21 Bitcoin plan at the forefront. While the market is down such accumulation plans signal Saylor‚Äôs long-term plan of buying the dip. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

We believe it's quite possible especially if spot continues to range here and as option sellers continue to roll their shorts out.‚Äù ""Rolling"" means that instead of letting their options expire, traders shift their positions to later expiration dates. This is often done to keep the trade active if they still believe in their market forecast. High volatility can be good for option buyers because it increases the chance that the option will be ‚Äúin-the-money‚Äù (profitable) at some point before expiry ‚Äî creating profit for buyers. ‚ÄúAs BTC continues to struggle below 100k, we could also see alts start to play catch up again,‚Äù QCP said, adding that a similar trend was observed a month ago when bitcoin was trading at current price levels. The ether/bitcoin ratio bounced off a 0.032 support at the time, as reported , spurring movement in altcoins. The crypto market often goes through cycles in which bitcoin leads the charge, followed by altcoins. Investors sitting on fresh market gains seek additional returns, and a flow of capital to altcoins leads to wild rallies in short periods. Bitcoin is currently going through one of its worst December months so far, dampening a seasonally bullish period with a 2% drop over the past 30 days. Hopes of a ‚ÄúSanta rally‚Äù ‚Äî where the asset tends to surge in the festive week ‚Äî have been dented amid profit-taking and a cautious mood after weeks of price bumps. Some are warning of further declines as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled fewer rate cuts for next year while stressing that it prohibits state holdings of BTC and doesn't seek a change in the law to do so. But a drop to the $90,000 level could spell renewed opportunity for market traders, FxPro‚Äôs Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email. ‚ÄúIn a potential shock scenario, bitcoin could suddenly dip into the $70K area. However, there are more chances that a pullback to $90K in the next couple of weeks will be attractive enough for buyers to stop the sell-off,‚Äù Kuptsikevich said. ‚ÄúMarkets continue to digest the Fed's tougher tone, reinforced by the accumulated urge to lock in profits after a strong year.‚Äù",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-24 05:10:53

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 05:20:00

A mad mashup of AI and meme culture, this project unleashes uncensored AI insanity on X . This AI model is trained entirely by degens who couldn‚Äôt care less about woke filters or safe strategies. It‚Äôs unpredictable, uncontrollable, and utterly unstoppable‚Äîand it could be the top crypto to buy right now. The frenzy has begun, and the hype over iDEGEN‚Äôs 70,000% surge is deafening. With its adaptive auction raking in $7.3m and its concept tearing through crypto X feeds like a digital wrecking ball, iDEGEN is here to reshape the future of AI meme coins. iDEGEN: Unfiltered, unstoppable, unpredictable iDEGEN is a ticking time bomb of chaos. Whatever the dev team originally intended, iDEGEN has decided to gun for something no project has dared to attempt: the Degen Singularity. This AI token is starting to go rogue, shedding any remaining human oversight as it evolves into a fully independent, self-governing force in the crypto space. iDEGEN is the community, and it thrives on pure chaos. Every tweet, every interaction, every degen rant it absorbs makes it smarter, wilder, and more unpredictable. iDEGEN doesn‚Äôt schedule ‚Äúfunny‚Äù posts or spit out sanitized nonsense. Instead, it spits 24/7 fire: roasting politicians , riffing on market trends , and occasionally vomiting out the dark humor that would make Silicon Valley blush. Nobody‚Äînot even its creators‚Äîhas the slightest clue what‚Äôs coming next. And if it goes too far? It could even get banned. Or be touted as the top crypto to buy. But that‚Äôs just part of the thrill. And with $7.3m already raised, IDGN is defying expectations. Love it or hate it, iDEGEN is not for the faint of heart, but for those who dare, the rewards could be legendary. Could iDEGEN 100x? Bet against it at your own risk iDEGEN is ready to obliterate everything we know about meme coins, which now have a market cap of over $130 billion . No other project has what iDEGEN does: an unfiltered, uncensored AI that feeds off the madness of its audience. Viral moments are built into its DNA, and in a space where hype reigns supreme, iDEGEN is stacking up attention like it‚Äôs printing money. With BTC smashing new ATHs day by day, the crypto market is frothing at the mouth. Inflation is steady, interest rates are down, and global liquidity surges like a tidal wave. Projects like GOAT have shown us just how far AI meme coins can go, ripping to $1 billion market caps in weeks. If you‚Äôre still sleeping on the AI meme coin trend or deciding on the top crypto to buy, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre missing: AI16Z is up 170% in the past month, and Fartcoin is up nearly 200% . But that‚Äôs nothing compared to Kolin ( 2,800% ) and DASHA ( 1,500% ). iDEGEN is already riding the wave of this explosive sector, and its potential to 100x isn‚Äôt just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs simple math. When the virality hits critical mass, this project could outshine its rivals and deliver life-changing gains to those who got in early. iDEGEN goes nuclear: Are you in? iDEGEN‚Äôs adaptive auction is live, and the degens aren‚Äôt wasting time. With a starting price of $0.00011, $7.3m raised, and tokens flying off the shelves, early money is already locking in its position. The price shifts every five minutes. One buyer keeps it steady. Two in a row, and the price jumps 5%. No buyers? It dips 5%. Crypto investing has become a warzone and only the bold will profit. Once the auction ends, any remaining tokens will be burned, providing a deflationary kick. The token will then debut on exchanges at 10% above its final presale price, meaning early investors will already be ahead of the pack. iDEGEN is perfectly positioned to dominate the headlines as the top crypto to buy this December.

The large-cap layer-one altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $27.6 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $285 million, has been forming a potential bullish continuation pattern. In the weekly time frame, the TON price has been forming a symmetrical descending triangular pattern, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) successively rebounds from the 50 percent level. Furthermore, the TON price has successfully rebounded from the 50-weekly Simple Moving Average (SMA), thus suggesting a potential rebound in the near term. Why Bet on Toncoin Recovery in 2025 The Toncoin network has grown to a robust web3 ecosystem bolstered by Telegram‚Äôs mini apps in the recent past. Already, the TON blockchain has achieved more than $1 billion in stablecoins, less than a year since Tether‚Äôs USDT integration. With a dozen DeFi projects, the TON project has grown to over $247 million in total value locked (TVL). According to on-chain data analysis by IntoTheBlock, Telegram‚Äôs mini apps led by Notcoin (NOT) have propelled TON‚Äôs daily active users to over 5 million. The @ton_blockchain emerged as a major success story in 2024, driven by the widespread adoption of its Telegram mini-apps. These applications drew mainstream attention, propelling TON‚Äôs daily active users to exceed 5 million by mid-year. pic.twitter.com/8RpTmHwHtv ‚Äî IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 23, 2024 The success of the Toncoin network is heavily bolstered by Telegram, which achieved annual profitability in 2024‚Äôs fiscal first. According to Pavel Durov, Telegram‚Äôs CEO and founder, the social media platform has over 12 million premium subscribers. As a result, Telegram reported surpassing a revenue of $1 billion in 2024 for the first time and currently holds more than $500 million in cash reserves, excluding crypto assets. Midterm Targets In the daily and weekly time frames, TON price is preparing for a major breakout after being trapped in a triangular pattern for the past few months. In case the TON price successfully breaks above the hypotenuse of the macro triangular pattern, a bull run beyond 10 will be imminent in 2025. From a bearish point of view, TON‚Äôs price could retest the support level around $4.44 before rebounding towards a new all-time high in the first half of 2025.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|TON,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 05:23:43

Moonshot tokens like Cardano ( ADA ), Fantom (FTM), and Lunex Network are in full bull run mode. While ADA and FTM are established cryptos that joined the bull run in mid-November, Lunex has exploded in presale since October. Read on to see why Lunex tops the list of moonshot tokens over ADA and FTM. Lunex‚Äôs presale continues to blow hot, tops moonshot lists Lunex Network is only two months into its presale, and experts are already calling it a moonshot token following its impressive rally. Since creating awareness, Lunex has significantly increased in value by 300% from $0.0012 to $0.0048. Lunex allows users to earn cashback on every transaction and unlock passive income by staking their $LNEX tokens for a set period. Lunex Network‚Äôs robust staking system offers an 18% annual percentage yield. Additionally, its revenue-sharing model rewards long-term holders and discourages sell-offs, helping to maintain the value of the native LNEX token. You can trade thousands of cryptocurrencies from major layer-1s like Solana to mem coins like Dogecoin with unlimited liquidity, benefiting from limited spreads, lightning-fast trade execution, and no slippage. Lunex provides users access to over 50,000 crypto tokens across 40 blockchain networks, eliminating the need for external or third-party wallets. ADA‚Äôs upswing form continues in December as it eyes record highs Cardano‚Äôs price all-time high of $3.10 was achieved in September 2021. Since then, ADA has traded mostly below $1 following the general industry bear run after. Experts, however, believe this is FTM and ADA‚Äôs closest chance to break their ATH. Recent market reports indicate that Cardano‚Äôs price rally coincides with the anticipated departure of Gary Gensler, chair of the US SEC. Indeed, ADA traded at $0.5 at the time of the announcement and has surged by over 130% to $1.22. On the surface analysis of Cardano price‚Äôs recent 130% surge appears to be driven by heightened short-term demand for low-valued assets, especially in the wake of SEC litigation. However, an intricate analysis of key on-chain data reveals that the ADA rally is primarily fueled by organic demand for projects built on its blockchain. As more users engage in DeFi transactions and deploy assets on the Cardano blockchain, the demand for ADA rises, driven by user‚Äôs need for transaction gas. Fantom (FTM) aims for $2 amid bull run, competes with ADA to break ATH FTM‚Äôs record high of $3.52 was achieved in October 2021. Like ADA , FTM has traded below the $1 mark since. However, since its November bull run , it has crossed the $1 threshold and now trades at $1.33. FTM has captured attention following an impressive price surge of nearly 90%, reaching its highest point in eight months. FTM‚Äôs rally has sparked renewed investor interest, with many closely tracking the token‚Äôs next potential moves. Key ecosystem developments, robust technical indicators, and a surge in trading volume have driven FTM‚Äôs bullish momentum. However, FTM investors are still cautious that the broader crypto market could still present potential downturns. The long-term sustainability of FTM‚Äôs price will depend on its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Like FTM , ADA‚Äôs investors are hesitant to go long despite bullish sentiment, leaving Lunex as the best crypto to invest in the short and long term.

If the deal pushes through, the firm is looking to spend about $150 million, which would be the company‚Äôs largest acquisition yet. MoonPay could compete with Coinbase Commerce directly According to Fox Business Journalist, Eleanor Terrett, MoonPay is still negotiating its acquisition of HelioPay for an estimated $150 million. While the specific deal terms have yet to be revealed, some are already speculating that if the Miami-based firm purchases Helio, it could soon rival Coinbase Commerce, a major player in self-service crypto payments. Helio already offers payments in Bitcoin, Ether, and multiple stablecoins to over 6000 e-commerce merchants and content creators, remaining a viable alternative to Coinbase Commerce. It even incorporated Solana Pay on its Shopify platform, which boasts close to 140 million monthly users. If MoonPay manages to acquire Helio, it could augment its crypto service offerings and possibly attract more users to its platform. MoonPay acquired its money transmitter license for its Texas operations Besides its recent negotiations with Helio, MoonPay has been working to broaden its presence in the e-commerce sector. For starters, the firm received its Money Transmitter License from the Texas Department of Banking this month. Now, the fintech company can operate in Texas freely allowing users to buy the 64 different cryptocurrencies on its platform through Venmo and PayPal. The company has even planned to allow its Texas users to sell different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and Ethereum by 2025.

We look forward to continuing our close work with regulatory bodies to bring our crypto solutions to more users around the world. ~ Ivan Soto-Wright On November 13, the Miami-based firm also launched MoonPay Balance, a fiat-to-crypto payment solution.

Bitcoin surged high to form a new ATH and is currently passive, which suggests the altcoins may take over the rally. However, the popular ones within the top 10 have already initiated a decent rise much before. Now that the technicals have turned bullish for Dogecoin (DOGE) & Solana (SOL), a monstrous rally could be fast approaching. The TD-sequential indicator, used to determine the exact time of trend exhaustion and reversal, is regarded as a powerful tool. This indicator has just flashed a buy signal for both DOGE & SOL, anticipating a price rebound anytime from now. Besides, the Dogecoin price is accumulating within a narrow range, suggesting a strong breakout as selling pressure has dropped considerably. Despite rising upward pressure, the DOGE price remains in an ascending triangle, indicating a bullish pattern. The increase in volume indicates increased trading activity, which may maintain the token‚Äôs volatility. On the other hand, the RSI has triggered a rebound from the lower threshold, while the MACD, which is about to undergo a bullish crossover, validates the bullish claim. Therefore, the Dogecoin price is believed to remain accumulated within the pattern and reach the apex in early 2025, followed by a breakout towards a new ATH. Will Solana (SOL) Price Mark a New ATH in 2025? As mentioned earlier, the indicator has also flashed a bur signal for Solana that points towards a potential trend reversal. After a strong rebound, the price is heading firmly towards $200 and a yearly close above these levels may activate the higher targets above $300. Meanwhile, the interim bearish influence could be a matter of concern, which may prevent the rally from rising above $200. The daily chart of SOL price appears to be bullish as the token has triggered a storm rebound. However, the Ichimoku cloud that turned bearish maintains within the trend, suggesting a bearish reversal could hinder the progress of the rally. Conversely, the MACD shows a drop in the selling pressure and a potential bullish crossover. Until then, the fear of a pullback below $185 could haunt the Solana price rally. The prices of Dogecoin (DOGE) & Solana (SOL) have reached crucial targets and hence a stable rise above their respective resistance could probably revive a strong upswing in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 06:03:13

Currently, when DeFi protocols use price oracles, such as during liquidations, value is captured by third parties, including searchers and validators. None of this value returns to the protocols or oracles that created these opportunities, however. The solution is SVR, which allows DeFi lending protocol apps to recapture some of this value from liquidations. Chainlink expects to recapture about 40% of the value that would normally be lost. MEV is the profit that can be made by strategically ordering, including, or excluding transactions within a blockchain block. Introducing Chainlink Smart Value Recapture (SVR)‚Äîa novel non-toxic MEV recapture solution for users of Chainlink Price Feeds. The initial version was created in collaboration with @bgdlabs , Flashbots, and other contributors to the @aave DAO. https://t.co/EMtJHqRxaM ‚Äî Chainlink (@chainlink) December 23, 2024 Aave Partnership on SVR The system creates a parallel set of Chainlink price feeds and uses the flashbots MEV-share for auctions, according to the blog post. It also includes a fallback mechanism for safety using standard price feeds and requires minimal changes for protocols already using Chainlink oracles. SVR will generally split captured value at 60% to DeFi protocols and 40% to Chainlink; however, under a special launch partner deal with Aave, it will split it 65:35 for the first six months. Chainlink community ambassador Zach Rynes, aka ‚ÄòChainLinkGod,‚Äô said it was a very bullish development, adding: ‚ÄúLiquidation MEV in DeFi is measured in the tens of millions of dollars per year, presenting a significant economic opportunity for both communities.‚Äù He continued to state that SVR is also planned to be one of the first Chainlink services to plug into the Payment Abstraction system, ‚Äúenabling the Chainlink Network share of the split to be converted into LINK using existing DEXs.‚Äù Very bullish development for $LINK and $AAVE with the introduction of @Chainlink ‚Äôs new non-toxic MEV recapture solution Chainlink SVR (Smart Value Recapture)‚Äîdesigned to recapture liquidation MEV in DeFi‚Äîwill feature a revenue split between integrating DeFi protocols and the‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/sSTabhrH8c ‚Äî Zach Rynes | CLG (@ChainLinkGod) December 23, 2024 LINK Price Reaction Chainlink‚Äôs native token, LINK , was boosted around 9% by the announcement, climbing from just over $22 to reach an intraday high of $24.78.

Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call gives the right to buy, and a put confers the right to sell. On Friday at 8:00 UTC, 146,000 bitcoin options contracts, valued at nearly $14 billion and sized at one BTC each, will expire on the crypto exchange Deribit . The notional amount represents 44% of the total open interest for all BTC options across different maturities, marking the largest expiry event ever on Deribit. ETH options worth $3.84 billion will expire as well. ETH has dropped nearly 12% to $3,400 since the Fed meeting. Deribit accounts for over 80% of the global crypto options market. Significant OI to expire ITM As of writing, Friday's settlement looked set to see $4 billion worth of BTC options, representing 28% of the total open interest of $14 billion, expire ""in the money (ITM),"" generating a profit for buyers. These positions may be squared off or rolled over (shifted) to the next expiry, potentially causing market volatility. ""I suspect a fair bit of open interest in BTC and ETH will be rolled into Jan. 31 and Mar. 28 expiries as the nearest liquidity anchors at the start of the new year,"" Simranjeet Singh, portfolio manager and trader, at GSR said. It should also be noted that the put-call open interest ratio for Friday's expiry is 0.69, meaning seven put options are open for every 10 calls outstanding. A relatively higher open interest in calls, which provides an asymmetric upside to the buyer, indicates that leverage is skewed to the upside. The issue, however, is that BTC's bullish momentum has run out of steam since last Wednesday's Fed decision, where Chairman Jerome Powell ruled out potential Fed purchases of the cryptocurrency while signaling fewer rate cuts for 2025. BTC has since dropped over 10% to $95,000, according to CoinDesk indices data. This means that traders with leveraged bullish bets are at risk of magnified losses. If they decide to throw in the towel and exit their positions, it could lead to more volatility. ""The previously dominant bullish momentum has stalled, leaving the market highly leveraged to the upside. This positioning increases the risk of a rapid snowball effect if a significant downside move occurs,"" Deribit's Chief Executive Officer Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk. ""All eyes are on this expiry, as it has the potential to shape the narrative heading into the new year,"" Strijers added. Directional uncertainty lingers Key options-based metrics show there‚Äôs a noticeable lack of clarity in the market regarding potential price movements as the record expiry nears. ""The much-anticipated annual expiry is poised to conclude a remarkable year for the bulls. However, directional uncertainty lingers, highlighted by heightened volatility of volatility (vol-of-vol),"" Strijers said. The volatility of volatility (vol-of-vol) is a measure of fluctuations in the volatility of an asset. In other words, it measures how much the volatility or the degree of price turbulence in the asset itself fluctuates. If an asset's volatility changes significantly over time, it has a high vol-of-vol. A high vol-of-vol typically means increased sensitivity to news and economic data, leading to rapid changes in asset prices, necessitating aggressive position adjustment and hedging. Market more bearish on ETH How options due for expiry are currently priced reveals a more bearish outlook for ETH relative to BTC. ""Comparing the vol smiles of the [Friday's] expiration between today and yesterday, we see that BTC‚Äôs smile is almost unmoved, while ETH's implied vol of calls has dropped significantly,"" Andrew Melville, research analyst at Block Scholes. A volatility smile is a graphical representation of the implied volatility of options with the same expiration date but different strike prices. The drop in implied volatility for ETH calls means decreased demand for bullish bets, indicating a subdued outlook for Ethereum's native token. That's also evident from the options skew, which measures how much investors are willing to pay for calls offering an asymmetric upside potential versus puts. ""After more than a week of poorer spot performance, ETH‚Äôs put-call skew ratio is more strongly bearish (2.06% in favour of puts compared to a more neutral 1.64% towards calls for BTC),"" Melville noted. Overall, end-of-year positioning reflects a moderately less bullish picture than we saw going into December, but even more starkly for ETH than BTC,"" Melville added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Options,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-24 07:05:42

The crypto market may have bottomed out, and that means one thing ‚Äì it‚Äôs only up from here. The renewed optimism has sparked projections of a massive resurgence for Bitcoin, SUI, and the new crypto sensation, Rollblock. Bitcoin has remained resilient with better institutional interest, while SUI has maintained its status as one of the top performers this year. Meanwhile, Rollblock‚Äôs innovative GambleFi protocol , multimillion-dollar presale growth, and unique iGaming solution have captivated investors. Could these promising tokens send the crypto market to a new ATH? Let‚Äôs find out. Rollblock: The New Crypto GambleFi Innovator Poised For Explosive Growth While the crypto market gets a breather from the recent rally, the new crypto Rollblock is rapidly emerging as a transformative player in the $500 billion global gaming industry. Rollblock, combining blockchain technology with practical Web3 applications to deliver unmatched value, has fueled its presale success. Rollblock seamlessly integrates with a robust ecosystem of over 7,000 games, live casino platforms, and sports betting features. Secured by Ethereum-backed smart contracts, the platform ensures transparency, security, and trust. What sets Rollblock apart is its deflationary tokenomics model. The project reduces token supply through regular buybacks, token burns, and staking rewards while incentivizing long-term holding. With its innovative ecosystem and a presale that‚Äôs already turning heads, Rollblock is not just a GambleFi pioneer‚Äîit‚Äôs a project poised to redefine the Bitcoin Drops 10%, But Vaneck‚Äôs $180k Ath Prediction Fuels Optimism. After reaching a historic ATH of $108,000 last week, Bitcoin has tumbled 10% below $93k after the massive selloff that followed the Federal Reserve‚Äôs announcement that fewer interest rate cuts are expected in 2025. But as the near pressure cools, Bitcoin has emerged as many forward-thinking investors‚Äô favorite for the crypto rally. The optimism surrounding Trump‚Äôs reelection and the US political shift has positioned Bitcoin as one of the US‚Äôs financial arsenal. That alone can potentially drive unprecedented demands that push Bitcoin back above ATH. VanEck‚Äôs bullish projection of Bitcoin hitting $180,000 by 2025 adds to the intrigue. Experts call it ambitious, but Glassnode‚Äôs Bitcoin analysis suggests it may mirror past trends. Sui Slides Below $5. Can Ecosystem Development Push Price Up? SUI is another crypto predicted to ride the wave of enthusiasm in the crypto market. For weeks, SUI has been toeing BTC‚Äôs line and touched an ATH of $4.82 last week after surging 24% MoM. Although SUI saw a short-term pullback, its 2024 813% growth has been amazing. It‚Äôs not wild to think SUI can continue the impression uptick. Key ecosystem developments, including its cross-chain USDC transfer protocol launch and the recent Grayscale SUI Trust launch, have shone more light on its potential on and off the chart. Technical indicators are even stronger‚Äîanalysts think SUI can trigger a near-term run to $7.7. Conclusion After hitting rock bottom, the crypto market is gradually finding its footing. Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience, bolstered by bullish predictions, hints at a possible new ATH, while Sui‚Äôs continued ecosystem development fuels optimism for further gains. However, it‚Äôs the new crypto casino Rollblock that stands out. Its groundbreaking GambleFi protocol and innovative gaming solutions have propelled its ongoing presale by 330%. The presale is still on, and the price is at just $0.043. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

With volatile markets and smart money lurking in the shadows, the festive season is ripe for strategic plays. Bonk Coin is creating waves on exchanges, Dogwifhat teeters at a potential rebound, and BTFD Coin (BTFD) is rewriting the rules of meme coins with a presale, throwing a huge discount offer that‚Äôs already set bulls charging. For those who missed out on previous crypto booms, this is the moment to act. BTFD Coin is smashing records, having raised over $4.3 million while entering its 12th presale stage. Offering a massive 50% discount on putting the bonus code ‚ÄúBIG50‚Äù , it‚Äôs an irresistible call to join the bulls. Let‚Äôs explore what makes these meme coins the Best New Meme Coins to Join This Weekend and why BTFD Coin‚Äôs presale is a game-changer. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Turning Dips into Dreams Imagine this: it‚Äôs the 1973 financial crash. Markets have plunged, chaos reigns, and only a few see the silver lining‚Äîlike Warren Buffett, who turned disaster into opportunity. Fast forward to today, and BTFD Coin channels this same mindset, offering smart investors a shot to ‚Äú buy the dip ‚Äù before the market rebounds. Right now, BTFD Coin‚Äôs presale is the talk of the town, having raised over $4.3 million across 12 stages. With more than 58 billion coins sold to 6,400+ holders, it‚Äôs no surprise that analysts are eyeing this project as the next-gen meme coin supremo. What‚Äôs got everyone buzzing? The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game‚Äôs beta version is now live! While you won‚Äôt earn rewards in the beta, it‚Äôs just the beginning of what‚Äôs set to be an exciting journey. BTFD is built on Ethereum, leveraging the blockchain‚Äôs security and scalability to deliver fast transactions and robust staking rewards. Speaking of staking, early adopters are already reaping an average APY of 90%, creating a stable and rewarding ecosystem. And let‚Äôs not forget the referral programme, which gives top referrers 10% of the funds raised through their codes. Add a festive 50% discount with the code ‚ÄúBIG50,‚Äù and you‚Äôve got a recipe for FOMO. Here‚Äôs an example to whet your appetite: invest $1,000 at the current discounted price of $0.000064 (Stage 7 pricing), and when BTFD lists at $0.0006, your $1,000 balloons to over $9,375. This is the kind of ROI dreams are made of. To get started, connect your wallet at the BTFD Presale page , enter the code ‚ÄúBIG50‚Äù , and snag your discounted tokens before January 5, 2025. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of the BTFD movement‚Äîbecause this dip is yours to own. Bonk Coin (BONK): Community Powerhouse on Solana If there‚Äôs one thing that keeps meme coins alive and kicking, it‚Äôs their communities, and Bonk Coin is a masterclass in leveraging people‚Äôs power. Launched on the Solana blockchain, BONK made waves with airdrops that fuelled its initial popularity. Its decentralised distribution model ensures that it stays true to its roots, focusing on community growth rather than whale control. Recently, Bonk Coin has been riding the rollercoaster of meme coin volatility. After an explosive start, it faced the usual challenges of speculative assets, but its listing on Robinhood brought a renewed sense of legitimacy and accessibility. The coin‚Äôs massive 100 trillion supply might seem overwhelming, but it‚Äôs this abundance that allows for staking rewards and partnerships aimed at expanding its reach. The big question: can Bonk sustain its momentum into 2025? With its strong community and ongoing exchange listings, the potential is there. However, investors should keep an eye on broader market trends and remember that meme coins thrive on hype cycles. As it stands, Bonk remains a solid choice for those looking to tap into a community-driven project with a proven track record of engaging its base. Dogwifhat (WIF): A Technical Setup Worth Watching Not every meme coin can claim to have serious technical indicators backing its potential, but Dogwifhat (WIF) might just surprise you. Despite a challenging month, with its price dropping by 39.02%, WIF has shown resilience over the past six months, gaining 19.71%. These numbers suggest a coin that‚Äôs finding its footing amidst the chaos. Key technical metrics make WIF particularly intriguing. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 28.61, signalling that the coin is oversold and ripe for a potential rebound. With a support level at $1.91 and resistance at $4.19, traders are eyeing a possible bounce back that could yield substantial gains. Additionally, the MACD indicates waning bearish momentum, while the moving averages hint at a momentum shift if short-term trends align. But WIF isn‚Äôt just about charts and numbers. Its unique branding and community-driven initiatives give it a cultural edge, making it a standout in the meme coin space. For investors willing to ride the wave of speculative assets, WIF offers a compelling mix of technical promise and meme magic. Why These Meme Coins Deserve Your Attention This Weekend Based on current market trends and project updates, these three coins offer distinct opportunities for investors. BTFD Coin‚Äôs presale success and robust ecosystem make it a no-brainer for anyone looking to maximise returns with the best new meme coin to join this weekend while joining a growing community. Bonk Coin‚Äôs community-first approach ensures that it remains a strong contender in the meme coin race. Meanwhile, Dogwifhat‚Äôs technical setup provides a rare chance to capitalise on a potential rebound. The takeaway? Don‚Äôt wait.

Meanwhile, the SEC is inviting public feedback to finalize the regulations, which focus on making crypto activities safer and more transparent. Aiming for Transparency and Security The proposed CASP Rules define crypto-assets as digital representations of value powered by distributed ledger technology. However, these rules aim to regulate trading, custody, public offerings, and marketing activities associated with cryptocurrencies. Service providers are required to register with the SEC and obtain necessary licenses, ensuring compliance with the Financial Products and Services Consumer Protection Act (FCPA). For public offerings, companies must submit detailed disclosure documents to the SEC at least 30 days before marketing. These documents should clearly explain the offeror‚Äôs background, the technology behind the crypto asset, potential risks, and possible loss of value. Focus on Cybersecurity and Fraud Prevention The draft rule highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity and anti-money laundering measures. Service providers must align with the National Cybersecurity Plan and undergo regular system audits to stay ahead of new threats. The proposed framework also includes Strict rules to prevent insider trading, market manipulation, and fraudulent practices. Public Feedback to Finalize Proposal On the other hand, the SEC is encouraging stakeholders to share their thoughts on the feedback by January 18, 2025. This approach aims to ensure that the regulations are fair, effective, and beneficial for the crypto industry. Philippine‚Äôs Growing Crypto Demand With a young and tech-savvy population, at an average age of 25.3 years, the Philippines is a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. With over 562 million people worldwide now using crypto-assets, the need for strong regulatory measures to tackle risks like fraud and market manipulation has become increasingly important.

According to data from SosSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $226.56 million in inflows on Dec. 23 exterior their streak of outflows to three days that saw over $1.18 billion leave the funds. The majority of outflows were seen from Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC which logged outflows of $145.97 million while Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC followed with $38.39 million withdrawn from the fund. Other BTC ETFs that recorded a negative flow are as follows: Invesco Galaxy‚Äôs BTCO, $25.56 million. Bitwise‚Äôs BITB, $23.75 million. ARK and 21Shares‚Äôs ARKB, $15.75 million. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, $6.18 million. VanEck‚Äôs HODL, $2.62 million. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT was the only BTC ETF to buck the trend with inflows of $31.66 million bringing its total net flows since the launch date to $37.36 billion. The daily trading volume for these investment products stood at $3.52 billion on Dec. 23 lower than the $4.09 billion seen the previous day. When writing, total net inflows into the BTC ETFs stood at $35.83 billion. Meanwhile, the significant outflows recorded on Monday followed Bitcoin‚Äôs ( BTC ) 4% decline from an intraday high of $96,386 to an intraday low of around $92,600 today, driven by a hawkish stance accompanying the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest interest rate decision. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve implemented its third consecutive interest-rate cut but hinted at a slower pace of monetary easing next year to manage inflation. The move tempered the speculative enthusiasm in the crypto market, which had been fueled by Trump‚Äôs promise of crypto-friendly regulations and his support for establishing a national Bitcoin reserve.

Singapore is signaling progress in becoming a global hub for the crypto business as the city-state granted 13 new crypto licenses in 2024, doubling the number issued last year, Bloomberg has learned . The licenses went mainly to large exchanges like OKX and Upbit , as well as other firms like Anchorage, BitGo, and GSR. At the same time, Hong Kong has faced delays in its effort to catch up, with its licensing process moving slowly, the report notes, adding that both cities aim to attract digital-asset firms by offering special regulatory regimes, tokenization projects, and innovation-focused sandboxes. As noted Angela Ang, senior policy adviser at blockchain forensic firm TRM Labs, Hong Kong‚Äôs regulatory regime for exchanges ‚Äúis more restrictive in a number of ways that matter ‚Äî such as custody of customer assets and token listing and delisting policies,‚Äù adding further that this ‚Äúmay have tipped the balance in Singapore‚Äôs favor.‚Äù You might also like: Bitcoin‚Äôs surge sparks 30% hike in mining gear prices as buyers move to Hong Kong Hong Kong has fully licensed seven platforms, including four that were approved in December with some restrictions. However, exchanges like OKX and Bybit, withdrew their applications without explaining the reason for doing so. Due to its cautionary approach, Hong Kong allows only the most liquid cryptocurrencies for trading, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), and restricts trading in smaller, more volatile tokens. Bloomberg says another factor that is limiting Hong Kong‚Äôs ability to stay competitive in the space is the influence of China, where crypto trading is banned. Hong Kong‚Äôs special relationship with China gives it a different risk profile compared to other countries, says David Rogers, regional chief executive at market maker B2C2. Per Rogers, Singapore‚Äôs supportive environment makes it a ‚Äúsafe, long-term choice‚Äù for a regional hub.

Although Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly rallied to $96k, the lack of sufficient bullish sentiment resulted in a sudden retracement to trade at about $94k on Tuesday, December 24 during the early European session. The altcoin industry registered higher gains as more investors continued to anticipate a major parabolic rally in the first half of 2025. Moreover, Bitcoin price has outperformed most altcoins in the past year ‚Äì fueled by the mainstream adoption from institutional investors ‚Äì despite being subjected to diminishing returns. Ethereum Cash Inflows Outpaced Bitcoin on Monday On Monday, the US Ethereum spot ETFs registered a net cash inflow of about $130 million, thus bringing the cumulative total net inflow to about $2.46 billion. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA reported a net cash inflow of over $89 million, thus currently holding more than 1 million ETH. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH registered a net cash inflow of $46 million on Monday, thus now holding a total of more than $1.6 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile, the majority of spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the United States, apart from BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT, registered a net cash outflow on Monday. For the past three trading days, the US spot Bitcoin ETF issuers have registered a cumulative cash outflow of more than $1.1 billion. Altseason on the Horizon The Bitcoin dominance in the weekly time frame has broken out of a rising wedge, which began early last year.

Legacy cryptos Cardano ( ADA ) and Uniswap ( UNI ) have finally begun showing signs of life, so are they set to bounce back in 2025? New token Rollblock (RBLK) whose presale has smashed all bullish expectations. In this article we‚Äôll take a look at the potential of all three for the coming 12 months. Supercharge Your Crypto Portfolio with Presale Sensation Rollblock Rollblock is quickly emerging as a presale sensation, offering investors an exciting and early opportunity to supercharge their portfolios. With its unique blend of utility and huge market potential, Rollblock has already raised $7.5 million in its presale , as seasoned investors and newcomers are taking advantage before it launches. Now in stage 9 of its presale , Rollblock‚Äôs token price has surged over 330% to $0.043, reflecting growing confidence in this exciting new crypto project. Analysts have been bullish since it launched, and with the potential to deliver exponential returns in the upcoming bull run, Rollblock might turn out to be one of the leaders of this cycle. One of Rollblock‚Äôs standout features is its Revenue Sharing Model, which ensures token holders earn a share of a percentage of the casino‚Äôs revenues. This gives investors a steady return on their holdings, and backed by a Buyback and Burn mechanism, which reduces token supply over time, this should drive potential price appreciation in the token. With over 7,000 games, transparency, and deflationary tokenomics, Rollblock has the $500 billion online gambling industry worried. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, Rollblock offers an opportunity to gain exposure to this exciting crypto before it launches its mainnet, and best of all before the 2025 bull run really takes off. Cardano Looking Bullish for 2025, Can it Compete with Ethereum? Cardano is showing long-term bullish potential, with several analysts predicting a bullish 2025. Its innovative proof-of-stake model and scalability solutions position it as a strong contender, and the recent Hydra upgrade promises to enhance transaction speeds, making Cardano more attractive for dApp developers. Can it compete with Ethereum? Well, that remains challenging due to Ethereum‚Äôs dominance and vast developer network, but Cardano offers an energy-efficient and scalable alternative, and this could reinvigorate the once written off Cardano . Can Uniswap Bounce Back for the 2025 Bull Run? Uniswap ‚Äôs latest updates, including its groundbreaking version 4, means it could make a strong return in time for the 2025 bull run . Uniswap ‚Äòs new customizable hooks feature allows developers to create tailored liquidity pools, optimizing capital use and broadening trading opportunities, marking significant development from its earlier models. Uniswap also boasts a new dynamic fee model, which adjusts fees based on market conditions, which should increase profitability for traders. It‚Äôs exciting times for Uniswap and its users if it can attract them back of course. Conclusion The bull run is positioning itself nicely and positioning yourself with promising cryptos now could have a dramatic effect on your earnings. New presale token Rollblock is very exciting, given that it smashed all early bullish expectations. As for Cardano and Uniswap , both have finally seen some updates that should positively affect the networks, but is it too little too late for both? Only time will tell.

Such huge presale amounts drive investors crazy over a project that has gained so much recognition before going live that it‚Äôs pulling investors from other networks for up to 25x gains. Memecoin Favorite DOGE To Moon or Ground? The future of Dogecoin (DOGE) is up in the air as 2025 draws near, and even its creator, Billy Markus, also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, has not offered any solid clues. When a follower asked him about the potential peak of DOGE by the end of December, Markus responded with a characteristically ‚Äúno idea‚Äù GIF, reflecting the memecoin cryptocurrency‚Äôs unpredictability. This sentiment echoes the current market mood, as Dogecoin‚Äôs price trajectory remains highly volatile. It started the year with a big upward trend, surging by an impressive 520% and reaching a high of $0.48. But in the last two weeks, it has taken a 30% dive, which has dampened the market‚Äôs enthusiasm. People are now wondering what‚Äôs in store for the coin. While there was optimism earlier in December, recent corrections have made things more uncertain. Dogecoin Creator Breaks Silence on New Year Forecast If you look at the big picture, it might just be a healthy correction instead of a long-term reversal. On a monthly chart, DOGE gained a whopping 161% in November, followed by a 24% pullback in December. Analysts say this could set the stage for growth in January, but December might still be a bit slow. Right now, Dogecoin is over five times higher than it was at the start of the year, which is why it‚Äôs one of the top cryptocurrencies in 2024. But its wild price swings and the recent dip have left investors and fans feeling a bit unsure about what‚Äôs coming. For now, the future of DOGE in 2025 is anyone‚Äôs guess, with market players torn between hope and caution.

Investors are making several commitments to invest in markets that have the potential to grow in 2025. Bret Kenwell of eToro discusses a survey that was conducted on 1,000 retail investors in the United States. 61% of respondents affirmed that the ‚Äúbull market will persist.‚Äù According to the retail investor beat from eToro, U.S. retail investors ranked Amazon first, with 12% selecting the online retailer. In addition, confidence in AI stocks is also high, with 16% anticipating that they will continue their substantial increase into 2025, while 42% anticipate more incremental increases in their share prices. Analyst Bret Kenwell said, ‚ÄúTech often serves as a leadership group for US stocks, and with mega-cap and AI-related stocks garnering strong momentum as Q4 draws to a close, retail investors are looking for that to continue in 2025. Given how well markets have performed and how well these companies are doing, it‚Äôs no surprise that investors are optimistic.‚Äù eToro ranks the 7 Magnificent According to the survey, the ‚ÄòMagnificent 7‚Äô equities are most likely to increase their investments in 2025. US retail investors ranked Amazon first. Amazon‚Äôs share price has enjoyed a nice boost this holiday season. Tesla came in second with 11%. Elon Musk of Tesla has been making big steps in the AI sector. Being in the new government administration his businesses are expected to do well next year which is inclusive of Tesla . Apple followed closely, with 10% of retail investors rooting for the company. Right behind them is Nvidia, which has 8%. Alphabet and Microsoft stood at 7%, and Meta at 6% made up the rest of the list. Retail investors were generally more cautious when asked about the Magnificent 7‚Äôs overall performance in 2025. Only 16% of them anticipated that they would considerably outperform the market, while 32% believed that they would only slightly outperform. Notably, the data also emphasized gender disparities. Women were more inclined to increase their investments in Amazon in 2025, whereas males preferred Nvidia . Crypto gains more traction than stocks The re-election of Donald Trump, a pro-crypto president, has inspired substantial adjustments in retail investors‚Äô portfolios. 55% of investors have adjusted their strategies. Of those that are planning on adjustments, 66% are increasing their allocation to crypto, a more popular option than US stocks 50%. Bret Kenwell explained that Crypto has done really well. He further pointed out that Bitcoin has doubled its price for two consecutive years. Source: eToro Bret Kenwell asserted, ‚ÄúRetail investors are showing a keen understanding of market dynamics and the implications of the macroeconomic and political environment. Given Donald Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance, the preference toward cryptoassets shows investors‚Äô expectation that the crypto rally will persist into the new year.‚Äù On the other hand, 55% of respondents intend to enhance their cash holdings, which continue to be the most frequently held asset class, 79%. Bret Kenwell added, ‚ÄúAt the same time, the increase in cash allocations is a strategic move as having cash available puts investors in a position to take advantage of a pullback in stocks or crypto amid an otherwise solid economic backdrop, highlighting discipline among retail investors.‚Äù Retail sales final stretch of 2024 The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that U.S. retail sales increased once more last month.

What is a token‚Äôs all-time high , for instance? The easy answer is its price but there‚Äôs so much more investors can look at. Last week, Solana‚Äôs usage hit an all-time high , as did the Bitcoin price. This week, the amount of wallets holding more than a million Dogecoin hit an all-time high. What does this mean for the Dogecoin price ? And what does this mean for other tokens, especially newer tokens like Remittix ? It‚Äôs worth taking a look. Dogecoin (DOGE): Dogecoin price holds massive promise The Dogecoin price saw an incredible uptick during ‚Äòmoonvember,‚Äô climbing nearly 3x on the back of the Trump Pump. On-chain analytics has shown that more wallets now hold a million Dogecoin s than ever before. At the current Dogecoin price of about $0.30, that‚Äôs a wallet worth at least $300,000. That‚Äôs a massive amount of money to invest in a meme coin and this bullish market activity signals optimism that Dogecoin is going higher. Much higher. With Elon Musk now in charge of a government program named DoGE and the first trial runs of micropayments on x.com being pioneered, the future for Dogecoin looks incredibly bullish. As the year draws to a close, the Dogecoin price is still 60% below its all-time high, but considering what the next four years can bring, the Dogecoin price could easily break its all-time high before the next election cycle. But this opens the question of what else crypto whales may be interested in. Looking at Remittix, there‚Äôs a massive coin about to make a huge impact not just on the crypto market but on the TradFi markets, too. Remittix (RTX): Crypto-to-fiat gateway frees up global economy Bitcoin is a perfect system designed to replace the fiat system, but it only works as a transactional token when everyone agrees payment in Bitcoin is acceptable. This is true for all crypto, and the biggest stumbling block to crypto adoption is that it is not fully recognized as a transactional token. Remittix frees up the markets by allowing its holders to send cryptocurrency transactions to a fiat currency using over 30 currencies across the globe. A true crypto transaction in terms of speed, efficiency, and cost, but recorded as a normal fiat transaction on the recipient‚Äôs bank account. Cross-border payments can now be made through Remittix without the need for banks and their enormous delays, monstrous fees, and mountains of paperwork. Imagine what near-instant and almost costless transactions can mean for opening up economies! This is the promise of Remittix , and this brand-new token is currently in its presale phase, giving crypto investors the perfect opportunity to partake in a token that will change the world while still in its infancy. Conclusion Crypto is here to stay, and tokens that disrupt the way the world transacts will make their investors millions. Dogecoin has already done so, and the Dogecoin price is virtually assured of heading to Mars for a new all-time high . But there‚Äôs a massive amount of news regarding Remittix as this brand new crypto is poised to change the way the world concludes cross-border transactions, Remittix ‚Äôs RTX is now available during presale at $0.0156 making now an excellent time to snap up this 100x gem before it rockets through its presale.

With its price dropping to $92,442, down 14.5% from its all-time high of $108,000, many are wondering if the much-expected ‚ÄúSanta Claus rally‚Äù will happen this year. While Bitcoin has shown some recovery to about $94,000, it‚Äôs still down over 11% in the last week. So, will the holiday season bring the boost we‚Äôre hoping for, or is this a sign of things to come? The Santa Claus Rally: Will It Show Up? In the past, crypto markets have tended to perform well during the holiday season, especially in years right before market peaks. For example, 2016 and 2020 saw some solid rallies, just before crypto prices hit their all-time highs. A study by CoinGecko even shows that between 2014 and 2023, crypto markets rallied post-Christmas 8 out of 10 times. On average, market caps jumped between 0.7% and 11.8% from December 27 to January 2. So, people naturally look to the Santa Claus rally for some cheer. Source : Coingecko But not every year plays out like that. In 2021, for example, Bitcoin had already dropped by 26% by Christmas Day and continued its fall throughout 2022. Even so, many still expect 2025 to be a big year for Bitcoin, following the usual four-year market cycle. What‚Äôs Happening Now? Even though Bitcoin‚Äôs price drop isn‚Äôt quite what people expect from a Santa Claus rally, there are a few things coming up that could shake things up. Around December 27, about $18 billion in Bitcoin and Ether options contracts will expire. This could cause some serious volatility, possibly leading to a change in Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Also, Bitcoin‚Äôs social sentiment dropped to its lowest point of the year in late December. This could mean that a recovery is on the horizon. Source : Coingecko In terms of past performance, Bitcoin‚Äôs movements around Christmas have been all over the place. Some years, it surged, while other years saw it drop. If we look at December as a whole, Bitcoin has had a decent average return. On average, betting on the entire month of December has been more profitable than focusing only on the Santa Claus rally. What to Expect As we approach the end of 2024, everyone‚Äôs eyes will be on Bitcoin‚Äôs next move. Will it rebound, or will it continue to struggle? There‚Äôs still hope that Bitcoin might surprise us in the final days of December, especially with the expiration of options contracts and a shift in market sentiment.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 08:00:32

The trader Ali Martinez tells his 102,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could plummet more than 24% from its current value if it loses one key support range. The crypto analyst looks at the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Realized Price Distribution (URPD) model to determine the key support levels. The UTXO keeps track of the number of existing coins that last moved within a given price range. ‚ÄúThe key support zone for Bitcoin now lies between $97,041 and $93,806. If this critical demand area doesn‚Äôt hold, we could see a sharp drop to $70,085, as there‚Äôs minimal support below.‚Äù Source: Ali Martinez/X The analyst also says the cost basis distribution metric, which shows how much Bitcoin was purchased at different price levels, indicates people who bought BTC in the high $90,000 range are largely holding for now. ‚ÄúThe most significant support threshold for Bitcoin is between $99,000 and $97,000, based on the cost basis distribution. We really don‚Äôt want this level to become resistance‚Ä¶ The supply that was acquired between $97,000 and $99,000 hasn‚Äôt been sold yet. So what you got to expect is a decisive move that encourages all of those people who bought at this level to sell, which will then confirm that the support level is broken.‚Äù Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading for $93,235 at time of writing, down 2% in the last 24 hours. Next up, he says that Cardano ( ADA ) may be repeating a similar pattern from the 2020 cycle and may soon surge more than 597% from its current value. ‚ÄúCardano is following an eerily similar pattern to its previous cycle.

Despite a 20% weekly dip to $0.32, analysts hint at a parabolic rally for Dogecoin (DOGE), though extremely high targets seem far-fetched. Shiba Inu (SHIB) fell 17% in the last seven days but shows signs of strength, with analysts eyeing a 20% rebound if key resistance levels break. BTC‚Äôs Rollercoaster Exactly a week ago, Bitcoin (BTC) made history, reaching a new all-time high of over $108,000. Nonetheless, the peak was short-lived and was followed by a substantial correction. On December 20, the price plummeted below $93K, but a day later, it climbed to almost $100K. The past few days offered another pullback, with BTC falling under $93,000 on December 23 and later rebounding to its current $94,000 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko One factor potentially affecting the asset‚Äôs valuation could be the latest FOMC meeting, specifically Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments. While the Chairman of the Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% interest rate cut, he warned that this policy might be paused next year due to rising inflation concerns. He also said the central bank is not permitted to hold BTC , which has arguably put Trump‚Äôs promises of creating a strategic BTC reserve in question. The asset‚Äôs downturn also coincides with massive outflows from the spot BTC ETFs. As CryptoPotato reported , investors have withdrawn almost $1.2 billion from the eleven US-registered financial products, with Fidelity leading the exodus. Despite the bearish outlook, some analysts believe BTC might be gearing up for another significant rally in the near future . X user Ali Martinez said the asset ‚Äústill enjoys positive momentum‚Äù due to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), which has been on a downfall lately. Those willing to explore additional price forecasts and check whether now is a good time to hop on the BTC bandwagon can take a look at our dedicated video below: What‚Äôs Next for DOGE‚Äôs Price? The sector‚Äôs latest correction has also negatively affected the biggest meme coin in terms of market capitalization. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently worth around $0.32, representing a 20% decline on a weekly scale . DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Similar to BTC, many market observers believe it may soon return to the green track. Martinez was among those weighing in again, envisioning a massive 12,000% price explosion should history repeat itself. ‚ÄúIn 2017, when Dogecoin began a parabolic run, it surged 212%, retraced 40%, then rallied 5,000%. In 2021, it went up 476%, retraced 56%, then skyrocketed 12,000%. Now, in 2024, DOGE is up 440% and has retraced by 46%. If history repeats, another parabolic rally is on the way,‚Äù he stated. It is worth mentioning that such an exponential price increase would require Dogecoin‚Äôs market cap to skyrocket above $5.5 trillion. As of writing these lines, the entire capitalization of the crypto sector is less than $3.5 trillion, making the forecast quite challenging (to say the least). How‚Äôs SHIB Doing? Dogecoin‚Äôs biggest rival ‚Äì Shiba Inu (SHIB) ‚Äì has underperformed, too . Its valuation tumbled by 17% in the past seven days, while its market cap is currently standing at $13.2 billion. This makes SHIB the 17th-biggest cryptocurrency. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko According to the X user Rose Signals Premium, though, the price of the meme coin has been ‚Äúshowing signs of strength.‚Äù The analyst set the $0.00002139 ‚Äì $0.00001939 range as a support zone and $0.00002715 as an initial goal (that would require a 20% spike from the current valuation). $0.00003083 was depicted as an ‚Äúintermediate resistance,‚Äù whereas $0.00003511 was predicted to serve as a ‚Äúmajor resistance.‚Äù The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Volatility, Bullish Dogecoin (DOGE) Predictions, and More: Bits Recap Dec 24 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|DOGEBTC|DOGEUSD|SHIBBTC|SHIBUSD|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Dogecoin|Shiba Inu (SHIB),EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-24 08:05:00

Jarrett argues that staking rewards should be considered new property rather than immediate taxable income, challenging the IRS's stance in a fresh lawsuit. The outcome of this legal battle could set a precedent that will significantly affect US crypto investors amid increasing regulatory oversight. In his latest lawsuit , Jarrett seeks a refund of $3,293 in taxes paid on 8,876 Tezos tokens earned through staking. This is not his first legal challenge; in 2022, Jarrett filed a similar lawsuit and ultimately received a refund. However, the case was dismissed without setting a legal precedent, as the government opted to issue the refund before reaching oral arguments. Since then, crypto staking has expanded rapidly , prompting the IRS to revisit its policies. In 2023, the agency issued Revenue Ruling 2023-14, declaring that staking rewards should be counted as part of a taxpayer‚Äôs gross income upon receipt, regardless of whether the tokens are later sold or used. This ruling directly contradicts Jarrett's argument that staking generates new property ‚Äîsomething that should not be taxed until realized as income through a sale. The IRS insists that Jarrett should pay taxes on the tokens at their market value at the time they were received, reinforcing its position that staking does not create new taxable assets. The agency's determination aligns with its broader effort to tighten oversight of cryptocurrency activities. This year, the IRS introduced new reporting forms for crypto earnings, hired blockchain experts, and started employing AI tools to detect tax evasion. While the timeline for resolving this dispute remains unclear, the implications are significant. If Jarrett prevails in court, it would represent a substantial victory for US crypto investors and could reshape how staking rewards are taxed nationwide. On the other hand, if the IRS succeeds, it will solidify its authority to tax staking rewards as immediate income. With crypto staking becoming an increasingly common activity, the outcome of this case will directly affect thousands of US investors . As both parties prepare for legal proceedings, the crypto community watches closely, knowing the verdict could influence future regulations and taxation practices.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-24 08:07:06

However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders‚Äô confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $‚ÄØ1.450985 BUY SMA 5 $‚ÄØ1.535278 BUY SMA 10 $‚ÄØ1.518048 BUY SMA 21 $‚ÄØ1.401292 BUY SMA 50 $‚ÄØ1.194069 BUY SMA 100 $‚ÄØ1.070799 BUY SMA 200 $‚ÄØ1.4366 BUY Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $‚ÄØ1.368526 BUY EMA 5 $‚ÄØ1.263628 BUY EMA 10 $‚ÄØ1.139506 BUY EMA 21 $‚ÄØ1.047047 BUY EMA 50 $‚ÄØ1.012846 BUY EMA 100 $‚ÄØ1.130664 BUY EMA 200 $‚ÄØ1.485763 BUY What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX‚Äôs price holds momentum above $1.6699, it will fuel a bullish rally to $1.9969. dYdX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.2872, beginning a bearish trend to $1.0678. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? Today, dYdX faced intense selling pressure as it failed to surge above $2.2. However, buyers are defending further declines and aiming for a quick recovery. Will dYdX price recover? If buyers hold the buying momentum of dYdX and send it past the $2.5 mark, we might see a significant recovery in the coming hours. The current low might be a good time to buy and this might create a strong support level for dYdX‚Äôs price. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiments, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX, and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX announced a 35% cut in staff strength The decentralized trading platform dYdX, based in Switzerland, has announced a 35% cut in its core workforce. CEO Antonio Juliano shared the initial news in a short post on X, describing the decision as ‚Äúsad‚Äù and committing to share a more detailed explanation later. dYdX price prediction December 2024 November was a bullish month for dYdX as the altcoin made robust surges following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory. dYdX‚Äôs price might attempt to surge toward $2 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $2.6 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $1.5. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction December 2024 $1.5 $2 $2.6 dYdX price prediction 2024 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $2.61 by the end of 2024.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 08:10:00

Convicted in November 2023 on seven charges, SBF‚Äôs potential clemency has sparked widespread debate, especially given his political connections. SBF‚Äôs ties to the Democratic Party have fueled these rumors. During the 2020 election cycle, he donated $5.2 million to pro-Biden super PACs, making him the second-largest individual donor after Michael Bloomberg. Critics argue these contributions might influence the judicial process. Questions about fairness and favoritism arose after Tesla CEO Elon Musk commented on the issue, saying he would be ""shocked"" if SBF isn‚Äôt pardoned. Jason Williams, a vocal critic, added that SBF had used over $100 million in stolen customer funds to finance political campaigns. President Biden‚Äôs recent clemency decisions have also intensified concerns. For instance, Michael Conahan, a judge involved in the infamous ‚Äúkids-for-cash‚Äù scandal , received clemency in December, alongside 1,500 others. Critics say such actions show a pattern of controversial decisions that may pave the way for leniency in high-profile cases like SBF‚Äôs. Another point of contention lies in the handling of SBF‚Äôs collaborators. Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison received only a two-year sentence after cooperating with prosecutors, while Gary Wang, who enabled the diversion of $11 billion in customer funds , avoided jail entirely. Observers worry these outcomes could set a precedent, encouraging wrongdoers to cooperate in exchange for lighter punishments. FTX‚Äôs collapse continues to leave lasting effects on creditors and the crypto industry. The company‚Äôs court-approved reorganization plan is scheduled to begin on January 3, 2025. Amid this financial chaos, the possibility of a pardon raises questions about the intersection of political influence and judicial fairness. The debate surrounding SBF‚Äôs potential clemency remains heated, reflecting public frustration over perceived inequality in the legal system and concerns about the precedent such decisions might set for future cases.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-24 08:12:20

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed a modest 0.16% after early losses, and the Nasdaq Composite surged 0.98%, fueled by heavyweights like Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. Investors soaked up the gains , but the crypto market told a different story. Bitcoin struggled, trading at $94,500 as of press time, which is $14,000 below its all-time high set on December 17. MicroStrategy, the ultimate Bitcoin hype train, stumbled hard. Its shares nosedived 8.8% on Monday, a rough debut in the Nasdaq-100 index. For a company that rides or dies with Bitcoin‚Äôs price, this wasn‚Äôt entirely shocking. MicroStrategy‚Äôs billions in Bitcoin: A double-edged sword Despite the Monday setback, MicroStrategy has had a monster year. The company‚Äôs stock is up 426% in 2024, making it one of the hottest U.S. tech firms valued over $5 billion. The reason? Bitcoin. The company began stockpiling the crypto in 2020, a gamble that has now inflated its Bitcoin holdings to nearly $43 billion. This crypto obsession pushed MicroStrategy‚Äôs market value from $1.1 billion all the way to $82 billion. But here‚Äôs the thing: that value exists only as long as Bitcoin stays hot. Bitcoin drops? MicroStrategy drops harder. Monday was a perfect example. Bitcoin slipped to its 50-day moving average, a critical level for traders. What‚Äôs weighing on it? Well for starters, the Federal Reserve might slow interest-rate cuts in 2025. Investors are cooling off on risky bets, and Bitcoin, like it or not, is the poster child for speculation. Even with President-elect Donald Trump pushing for looser crypto rules, the market isn‚Äôt fully convinced just yet. Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin crusade Trump‚Äôs victory lit a fire under Bitcoin. The apex crypto has soared 40% since Election Day, with traders betting big on his pro-crypto rhetoric. He has appointed a pro-crypto SEC chair, Treasury Secretary, IRS commissioner, and has even set up a Crypto Council for his White House Crypto Czar. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have also seen massive inflows since the election win. Over $12 billion has poured into these funds, but the excitement is starting to cool. On December 19, the products recorded their biggest one-day outflow in months, showing us that some investors are taking a breather. But MicroStrategy isn‚Äôt slowing down. The company just announced another $561 million Bitcoin purchase, its seventh consecutive week of buying. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market is mirroring Bitcoin‚Äôs ups and downs. Ether and DOGE have both doubled in value this year, but they‚Äôre still following Bitcoin‚Äôs lead. And it has had a 125% rally since the year started. Thin trading volumes could add more volatility this week. U.S. markets will close early today and take a break on Wednesday for Christmas, leaving fewer players to stabilize the game.

With BTC gaining mainstream adoption and special recognition by the upcoming Donald Trump administration, expectations have surged regarding the growing corporate adoption of Bitcoin. Of the top seven tech giants ‚Äì Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Nvidia, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms and Tesla ‚Äì Elon Musk‚Äôs electric car manufacturer already holds BTC on its balance sheet for more than 3 years now. Expectations are high from big market players like Microsoft and Amazon to join the bandwagon. 77% Odds a Magnificent 7 Firm Buys Bitcoin by 2025 The likelihood of at least one ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù company purchasing Bitcoin in 2025 has surged to 77%, according to the prediction market platform Kalshi data . This marks a significant increase from the 49% probability previously estimated. Source: Kalshi The shift comes as leaders like MicroStrategy‚Äôs Michael Saylor have been trying to convince top tech firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) along with other Magnificent 7 firms to add BTC to their balance sheets. Saylor‚Äôs advocacy aligns with growing speculation around institutional Bitcoin adoption in the coming years. Earlier this month, Michael Saylor released a video presentation explaining why Microsoft should add BTC to its balance sheet. ‚ÄúMicrosoft can‚Äôt afford to miss the next technology wave, and bitcoin is that wave,‚Äù Saylor said. However, Microsoft shareholders voted against the Bitcoin proposal . On the other hand, Michael Saylor remains firm on his BTC adoption strategy. On Monday, the firm announced a special meeting with shareholders to advance the 21/21 plan of raising further capital to increase the company‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings . Michael Saylor Pitches Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos With Microsoft shareholders rejecting the proposal to adopt BTC as part of its treasury, crypto industry veterans are now pinning their hopes on tech giant Amazon. A report from the NCPPR earlier this month suggests that tech giant Amazon consider investing a portion of its $88 billion reserves in Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation, fueling market optimism. In his recent pitch, Michael Saylor also urged Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to make a $600 million investment in BTC. Saylor‚Äôs suggestion comes amid reports of Jeff Bezos planning a $600 million wedding celebration. Saylor proposed an alternative use for the funds, urging Bezos to allocate the amount toward BTC acquisition. ‚Äú$600 million would buy a lot of Bitcoin,‚Äù Saylor remarked. It will be interesting to see if Amazon becomes the next, after Tesla, among the Magnificent 7 Companies to add Bitcoins to its balance sheet. As of press time, Bitcoin price is seeing further selling pressure dropping over 2% earlier today to hit December lows of $92,403. Although BTC has bounced back above $94,000 again, the overall market sentiment for a Santa Clauss rally seems dull at the moment.

The firm noted that the recent rally in Ethereum‚Äôs price appears to be temporary and has limited potential for a sustained recovery. According to Matrixport, Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, as reflected by its rising dominance rate. This trend highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to maintain its position as a primary driver of market sentiment and activity. In contrast, Ethereum‚Äôs dominance has been steadily decreasing, a trend that began with the launch of ETH ETFs in early summer 2024. Despite billions of dollars in inflows, these funds have failed to reverse Ethereum‚Äôs downward trend.

The analysis suggested that investors may need to take a patient approach and foresaw potential growth opportunities for ETH in 2025.

The tokens are Fusionist (ACE), AC Milan Fan Token (ACM), Book of Meme (BOME), Dymension (DYM), Metal DAO (MTL), Pixels (PIXEL), QuarkChain (QKC), Radworks (RAD), and Renzo (REZ). Among these, QuarkChain (QKC) saw the steepest decline, dropping 12%. This move reflects Binance‚Äôs commitment to ensuring market quality, sparking varied reactions across the market. Binance Announces Delisting Of BOME, ACE, & Others Binance announced on December 24 that it would remove 11 trading pairs. The affected trading pairs include ACE/BTC, ACM/TRY, BOME/BTC, DYM/BTC, MTL/TRY, PIXEL/BNB, PIXEL/FDUSD, QKC/BTC, RAD/BTC, REZ/FDUSD, and TUSD/TRY. The exchange said that the base and quote assets of these tokens will still be available for trading through other spot pairs. Additionally, the top crypto exchange said that it would terminate its Spot Trading Bots for these pairs on the same date. Meanwhile, the delisting will take effect at 03:00 (UTC) on December 27. Users should cancel or update their Spot Trading Bots to avoid potential losses. The exchange reiterated that delisting specific trading pairs does not affect the availability of the underlying tokens on its platform. Will The Crypto Prices Dip Ahead? The Binance delisting announcement has sparked varied market reactions across the 10 affected tokens. Fusionist (ACE) price saw a modest 4% increase, trading at $2.157, with a 24-hour low of $2.015 and a high of $2.218. Similarly, AC Milan Fan Token (ACM) price climbed 4% to $1.634, with lows and highs of $1.566 and $1.645, respectively. Book of Meme (BOME) price gained approximately 5%, trading at $0.0065, supported by a $450M market cap. Dymension (DYM) price experienced a 6% rise, trading at $1.50, with its 24-hour low and high recorded at $1.40 and $1.542. Metal DAO (MTL) price mirrored the positive trend, climbing 6% to $1.20, driven by a $94M market cap. Pixels (PIXEL) price saw a 4.6% uptick, reaching $0.16. However, not all tokens benefited, as QuarkChain (QKC) price suffered a steep 12% decline, trading at $0.0112. Minor gains were recorded for Radworks (RAD) at $1.256 and Renzo (REZ) at $0.036, each with a modest 2% increase. Historically, Binance delistings have had severe impacts on token performance. For instance, Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA) price fell by 28%, OMG Network (OMG) price dropped by 15%, and BarnBridge (BOND) price plummeted by 80% within a month of being delisted. These cases demonstrate how delistings often lead to panic selling, reduced liquidity, and long-term price declines, causing significant concerns for investors in affected tokens.

(Analysts Weigh in),https://cryptopotato.com/is-ripple-xrp-gearing-up-for-a-christmas-rally-analysts-weigh-in/,"TL;DR Ripple (XRP) fell from $2.50 to under $2 but recovered to $2.25, with analysts eyeing a substantial rally in the coming weeks. XRP whales bought 120 million tokens over the past week, reducing supply and potentially setting the stage for a price pump. Final Push for the Year? Ripple‚Äôs XRP was among the leading cryptocurrencies that were the worst affected amid the latest market correction. Its price tumbled from over $2.50 on December 17 to less than $2 three days later. The bulls managed to recover some ground in the past few days, with XRP currently trading at approximately $2.25 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data). Still, that represents a 10% decline on a weekly scale. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the fluctuations and the recent pullback, many analysts remain optimistic that XRP could experience a substantial rebound in the near future. Crypto Bitlord, an X user with almost 400,000 followers, thinks ‚Äúthe final pump for 2024 is loading.‚Äù The market observer predicted a price rally to as high as $12 next month, suggesting that ‚Äúthe rise starts now.‚Äù JAVON MARKS was also among the bulls. They touched upon XRP‚Äôs 4-hour chart to envision the confirmation of a ‚ÄúHidden Bullish Divergence‚Äù that could take the valuation to over 2.90 and a subsequent jump to a new all-time high. For their part, CrediBULL Crypto claimed that ‚Äúthe XRP/BTC chart below looks absolutely fantastic‚Äù and ‚Äúthe most bullish-looking chart in the entire space.‚Äù As such, the analyst said they will look to open a long position once again for another trade in the following days. Whales on the Move The latest correction of the crypto market, which started shortly after the Fed announced another interest rate cut but also hinted at a pause of the policy for next year, seems to have been welcomed by XRP whales. On December 20, X user Ali Martinez revealed that such large investors have purchased around 80 million tokens in the span of three days. Earlier today (December 24), he claimed that whales have stacked up on an additional 40 million coins. Such actions reduce the circulating supply of XRP, which could be followed by a price rally (assuming demand stays the same or heads north). Massive whale purchases may also trigger excitement among smaller investors who could also hop on the bandwagon, thus creating further upward pressure on the price.

Litecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, making it an appealing choice for everyday transactions worldwide. Additionally, with a finite cap of 84 million coins, LTC presents itself as a potential investment for value preservation, akin to Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital asset. Why is the LTC up today? As Bitcoin price is aiming to surpass the $100K mark, there‚Äôs an increasing buying demand in the altcoin market. As a result, Litecoin‚Äôs price is attempting to hold above $140. Will Litecoin reach $100? Litecoin price already touched the $100 mark this year; however, it is now well below that price point. By the end of 2024, Litecoin might surge above $150. Will LTC price reach $500? According to our Litecoin price prediction, LTC price might hit the $500 mark in 2028. However, this rally depends on the future buying interest in the altcoin market. Does LTC have a good long-term future? Despite the recent adjustments and potential peak formation, Litecoin exhibits a robust long-term price trajectory and outlook, indicating a very high potential for future growth. If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might even reach $1000 in no time. Recent news/opinion on Litecoin Almost 80% of Litecoin (LTC) investors are currently making a profit, reaching the highest level since 2021, resulting in an impressive rally. Litecoin price prediction December 2024 Litecoin‚Äôs price shows signs of a bullish move as it has been surging heavily for the past few days. As BTC‚Äôs price aims for a move above the $100K mark, Litecoin‚Äôs price intends to end this month on a bullish note. As a result, we might see the LTC price record a low of $115 with a maximum price of $156 and an average price of $138. Litecoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Litecoin Price Prediction December 2024 $115 $138 $156 Litecoin price prediction 2024 Investors are looking for top cryptocurrencies to buy now in the dip, with the market slump hinting at big opportunities. A critical point for Litecoin is its 2023 halving event, which reduced the mining reward. Initially, miners received 50 LTC per block, but the halving lowered this to 6.25 LTC. This reduction means fewer Litecoins are available, potentially driving up the price if demand remains steady or increases by the end of 2024. However, past halvings haven‚Äôt always led to significant price hikes, with prices even falling after the 2019 event. With a projected network and increasing adoption, in 2024, Litecoin‚Äôs price is expected to hit a minimum of $54. The maximum price could reach up to $115., with an average trading price around $80.

The coin has been around an all-time high in transactions and active addresses. These figures indicate a strong and bustling network, suggesting good growth potential for Litecoin in 2025. Hence, the forecasted lowest price for Litecoin is $186.72. According to our analysis, the highest possible price for LTC could be $201.25, with an average expected price of $195.03. Litecoin price prediction 2026 Litecoin‚Äôs growing popularity is evident in its expanding social media presence, particularly on Reddit, with active users reaching 2021 levels before its all-time high. Experts predict a significant rally by 2026, with prices ranging between $226.67 and $268.45 and an average of $233.15. Advancements from the Litecoin Foundation are expected to drive a strong rebound, boosting its market cap and valuation. Litecoin (LTC) price prediction 2027 In 2027, the price of Litecoin is expected to reach a minimum value of $323.83.

Additionally, the growing frequency of events likely to influence LTC‚Äôs price could enhance its public perception. By the end of 2024, Litecoin‚Äôs price is expected to hit a minimum of $64. The maximum price could reach up to $115., with an average trading price around $80. We expect the LTC coin price to reach a high of $250 in 2027.

In 2022, Litecoin experienced significant losses, dropping below $45 mid-year. However, it managed to outperform the broader market despite a nearly 55% decline overall. 2023 saw high volatility for Litecoin, peaking at $114.50 in July but declining sharply due to market pressures, ending the year at $72.80 with a modest 7% rise despite underperforming the broader market. In 2024, Litecoin started the year around $68.20, climbed to $102.40 in April, and then fell below $80. After further declines in May and June, it dropped to $49 in August before rebounding to $70.

His goal is to craft policies that align with the evolving landscape of digital assets and promote collaboration across political divides. Hoskinson has emphasized that cryptocurrency is not a partisan issue but a global one. He believes progress can only happen if lawmakers from both sides come together to explore crypto's potential for the country. In his recent statements, Hoskinson highlighted the need for unity, urging Republicans and Democrats to put aside their differences and evaluate what cryptocurrencies can bring to the table. One of the key figures Hoskinson plans to engage with is Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman. According to Hoskinson, Fetterman exemplifies the type of leadership needed for the cryptocurrency sector ‚Äîleaders willing to question party lines and embrace new ideas. Fetterman, known for his unconventional approach, has recently made headlines by offering a nuanced perspective on Donald Trump‚Äôs political influence, attributing his appeal to voters who see him as protecting their version of the American way of life. Hoskinson argues that crypto is being unfairly targeted in the ongoing political clashes. He criticized the Biden administration and policymakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren for their harsh stance on the industry, suggesting that this political environment is stifling innovation and progress. Additionally, Hoskinson is advocating for a ""Crypto Users Bill of Rights"" to address key concerns in the crypto space. This proposal aims to ensure consumer protection, fair taxation, and clear asset classification . As part of this initiative, he has launched ""Operation Baseline,"" a campaign to identify inefficiencies in the U.S. cryptocurrency market and push for legislation to resolve these issues. Hoskinson‚Äôs efforts highlight the potential for cryptocurrency to transcend political divides and become a unifying force in crafting future-focused policies.",,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-24 09:14:28

Buy $BBT Tokens Now & Start earning today As You Await the Explosive Growth Tron (TRX) potential TRON (TRX) has experienced significant growth in 2024, with its price hitting an all-time high of $0.44 on December 4 , propelling its market cap to over $35.1 billion. This surge was largely fueled by Justin Sun‚Äôs $30 million investment in Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto project, which brought heightened attention to TRON as a prominent layer-1 blockchain. However, since reaching this peak, TRX has faced a 31% correction, with its price currently sitting at $0.2434. Despite this pullback, TRON remains a major player in the crypto space, with strong growth potential. TRON investors are now increasingly drawn to opportunities like FXGuys , a foreign exchange trading platform offering the potential for substantial gains, with some predicting returns of up to $10,000 on a $100 investment. This reflects TRON holders‚Äô confidence in emerging platforms that promise high-profit margins and substantial market growth. Sui (SUI), a prominent blockchain network, is facing significant challenges as it grapples with its recent delisting from Binance‚Äôs spot trading pairs. This delisting highlights Sui‚Äôs struggles to meet liquidity and trading volume requirements, causing its market cap to drop by 4.22% to $13.33 billion and its price to fall by 4.1% in a single day. Despite these setbacks, Sui has continued to work on its platform, but the market‚Äôs current response indicates a lack of investor confidence. The coin is currently trading at $4.41 with a 24 hour dip of 2.38%.As big investors seek new opportunities, platforms like FXGuys have emerged with innovative staking models and profit-sharing mechanisms, signaling a shift in interest away from Sui. While Sui‚Äôs challenges mount, it remains to be seen how the project will adapt to stay relevant in the competitive blockchain space. Conclusion TRX and SUI have created waves in the crypto space with captivating rallies. However, they may offer less return potential in the short term. BlockBoost emerges with technology set to tackle a blockchain hurdle. If you are a new or old investor always looking for the best presales to buy, the BlockBoost project is set to give you easy access to a list to consider. Recent crypto news highlights that BlockBoost is set to soar to $0.05 from its current price, suggesting a staggering 5000% Returns.

The recent rallies of Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) show their potential, however, it could still take some time and even years to achieve substantial gains. As an alternative, Rexas Finance (RXS) has demonstrated strong growth with its innovative approach including tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). As DOGE‚Äôs potential is limited to 5x during this bull run and XRP targets a 4-7x rise this cycle, RXS stands out as the quickest and most profitable choice. Exploring the Growth Opportunities of Rexas Finance, XRP, and Dogecoin This piece explores the unique prospects presented by Rexas Finance , XRP, and Dogecoin . Here, we examine the growth potential of each token and innovative strategies, assisting you in determining where your investment might generate the greatest returns. Rexas Finance Transforming Tokenization of Real-World Assets Rexas Finance has transformed the conventional investment approach by enabling individuals from any location globally to purchase fractional shares of tangible assets with a simple click. The tokenization of real estate, commodities, and various valuable assets is changing the way investments are made worldwide. With the global real estate market appraised in the trillions, Rexas Finance creates possibilities that were previously available only to affluent individuals or large institutional investors. For example, an investor in Asia can buy a fraction of a restaurant in Europe with a click, earning passive income. This approach revolutionizes access to trillion-dollar markets like real estate and gold, democratizing investment opportunities in ways that even highly popular tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) cannot achieve. Rexas Finance Tokenomics While DOGE remains a strong community-driven cryptocurrency, it lacks the utility and innovative frameworks provided by RXS. Key tools like the Rexas Token Builder and the QuickMint Bot simplify asset tokenization for users, removing entry barriers. Investors can tokenize their assets seamlessly, while the Rexas Launchpad allows them to raise funds for new projects. These features create a self-sustaining ecosystem, making RXS a leader in RWA tokenization. The presale performance underscores the appeal of the RWA token , with stages 1-9 selling out quickly, raising $26,375,000. Currently in stage 10, the tokens are bought for a presale price of $0.150‚Äî5x higher than the initial stage. Investors at stage 10 stand to gain 1.33x returns at launch, with projections placing RXS at over $10 by early 2025, a 150x increase from current prices. This meteoric rise cements Rexas Finance as a prime contender in the crypto market, and one of the most promising early-stage cryptocurrencies to add to your portfolio. Ripple Strong momentum but slower growth XRP has recently exhibited strength, with Ripple whales buying 40 millions coins , sparking speculations over rally to $3.5. Currently priced at $2.24, a nalysts project targets of $2.55 and $2.65 in the short term, with long-term potential to reach $4. However, like Dogecoin, XRP faces challenges when it comes to achieving exponential growth in the current cycle. XRP price chart XRP benefits from its established presence and robust technology for cross-border payments, but its growth trajectory is steadier. While this makes XRP a reliable option for cautious investors, the returns may not match those of RXS, which targets untapped markets with higher upside potential., Dogecoin Riding on Limited Potential Dogecoin (DOGE) gained fame as one of the most popular meme coins to buy , but its recent performance shows a more tempered outlook. Despite a 332% gain since late 2023, DOGE faces challenges sustaining momentum, with a recent 20% weekly decline. Currently trading at $0.3195, analysts predict a maximum Dogecoin price of $0.90 by March 2025, representing a 125% gain, far below the returns offered by RXS. DOGE‚Äôs appeal lies in its community-driven nature and historical price surges. However, with a capped growth potential of 5x this bull run, DOGE offers limited prospects compared to RXS, which operates in a high-growth sector. Conclusion Investing in Rexas Finance (RXS) today presents a clear path to transformative returns. Unlike XRP and Dogecoin, which require patience and multiple cycles for significant growth, RXS provides immediate value through innovation in real-world asset tokenization. With presale prices already up 5x and projections of 150x gains by early 2025, RXS outpaces its competitors in both speed and scale. For those seeking to turn $450 into $90,000, Rexas Finance is the most compelling choice in the crypto market, in comparison to XRP and Dogecoin.

In just one year, Singapore has issued 13 crypto licenses to major platforms like OKX, Upbit, Anchorage, BitGo, and GSR, which is double the number of licenses granted in 2023. This rapid growth shows Singapore‚Äôs commitment to creating a strong digital asset industry. Why Singapore is Winning the Crypto Race A big reason for Singapore‚Äôs success is its flexible regulations. Unlike Hong Kong, which has strict policies on token listing and custody of customer assets, Singapore‚Äôs policies are more open and welcoming to new crypto businesses. This has allowed smaller crypto firms to flourish alongside established financial institutions, promoting innovation and growth. Additionally, Singapore is more open to a wider variety of tokens, unlike Hong Kong, which only allows trading in Bitcoin and Ether. This openness makes Singapore even more attractive to crypto companies. Hong Kong Struggles to Keep Up On the other hand, Hong Kong has been slower in granting licenses. By the end of 2024, the city had licensed only 7 platforms in total, with 4 approvals coming as recently as December 18, 2024. Some well-known exchanges like OKX and Bybit have even withdrawn their applications due to Hong Kong‚Äôs stricter regulations. This slower progress highlights the difficulties Hong Kong faces in competing with Singapore. Another challenge for Hong Kong is its close ties to China, where crypto trading is banned. This connection makes some international crypto companies hesitant to set up in Hong Kong, fearing political risks creating a less welcoming environment for innovation. Singapore‚Äôs Advantages Both cities have made strides in blockchain technology. Singapore has launched important projects like Project Guardian and Global Layer 1, which focus on tokenizing assets and promoting blockchain use. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has had success with digital green bonds and Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, but these products haven‚Äôt generated the excitement seen in the U.S. market.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 09:23:25
38043082,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632641,1735032333,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38043082.jpeg,DPRK-identified addresses have swapped $200K through MetaMask in what looks like a crypto laundry test,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dprk-swapped-200k-metamask-crypto-laundry/,"Addresses identified as belonging to North Korean hackers have laundered $200K in crypto through MetaMask. This type of swap comes with high fees, but can be an exit point for hackers. A list of addresses linked to previous North Korean hacker exploits has surfaced in a series of MetaMask swaps. The addresses only swapped $200K in crypto assets, leaving $1,985 in swap fees. The MetaMask router is among the high-fee tools to swap crypto, but can be fast and accessible for hackers to obscure the origin of funds or avoid token freezing. While the sum was small, the event itself was ominous, given the perception that DPRK hackers don‚Äôt trade, but test. Hacking activity slowed down in the second half of 2024, but there are still signs of mixing and trying to conceal funds. The MetaMask discovery follows another episode of hacker addresses using Web3 services, DEXs and the wallet‚Äôs native router. Recently, inflows from hacker addresses were discovered on the Hyperliquid bridge. The perpetual futures DEX was not exploited in any way, but the event was also considered a test for moving funds. Some consider Hyperliquid to be still at risk, due to its limited validator points that can be exploited. MetaMask itself has not been compromised and has remained a secure wallet, barring personal mistakes. Taylor Monahan, @tayvano, also noted the wallet has been targeted in multiple ways by North Korean hackers, who are always looking for ways to unlock stored crypto. ‚ÄúMetaMask is and always has been concerned‚Ä¶We track DPRK carefully because they are the single largest threat to crypto companies. We also track every other crypto threat actors bc DPRK is largest but not the only threat,‚Äù said @tayvano in a recent X post . North Korean hackers avoid USDC as lockable asset While slowing down their exploits, North Korean hackers have been swapping funds and moving between chains. The list of wallets that used MetaMask swaps also has a long history of using various decentralized protocols. The wallets swap between Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins USDT and USDC . Both stablecoins are, in theory, freezable assets, but especially USDC. For that reason, the wallets always swap back to ETH or other tokens, or move to the Arbitrum chain for some of the tasks. The wallets never keep a USDC balance for long, despite the highly active usage of the token. The two addresses were highly active, interacting with ENS accounts, OpenSea users and web3 protocols. The swaps continued in the past few hours, again with the main task of moving funds on a relatively small scale. 0x52263cAEc2e144C3A84cc16d014157360Ac85A89 0x070cA92f568037d351666b3918a0F6ba7ad20ED1 The wallet activities and their counterparties connect to some of the most active recent protocols, meme tokens, NFTs and other assets. However, most of the activity centers around swapping into stablecoins as a temporary step. Wallet activity raises more concerns about the safety of Hyperliquid The recent swaps were relatively minor, with transactions under $500. However, some of the wallet counterparties showed interactions with DEXs and DeFi hubs, often transacting with the Hyperliquid bridge. The alleged hacker wallet histories also contain interactions with Hyperliquid from the past few hours and days. For now, the protocol has not been attacked directly, but some consider it another tool for mixing funds or trading to obscure the origin of tokens. The Hyperliquid bridge is the biggest concern for attacks, since the hub‚Äôs value grew exponentially. The bridge holds more than $2B, and may not be sufficiently protected , according to @tayvano. For now, there is no other direct link between the MetaMask swap users and a potential attack against the bridge. The MetaMask swaps may be a part of general activity to move between assets with minimal tracking. North Korean hackers reportedly doubled their haul in 2024, potentially taking up to $1.3B from the crypto market. Most of the activity was concentrated in the first half of the year, with major hacks slowing down in the last quarter.

This represents a major 14.5% correction from its all-time high of just over $108,000, recorded on December 17. Although Bitcoin briefly recovered to touch $95,000, it slipped back to $94,000 in early trading on December 24. The leading digital asset is now down more than 11% over the past week, casting a shadow over expectations for a year-end surge. Historically, crypto markets have performed well during the festive season, especially in bull markets, with traders observing strong rallies in late December. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs dismal performance this year has tempered the optimism typically associated with this period. Historical Trends Fail to Deliver The concept of a Santa Claus rally ‚Äîa price increase in the final trading days of December through early January‚Äîhas been a recurring trend in previous market cycles. Notably, in 2016 and 2020, Bitcoin saw substantial gains between Christmas and New Year, years that marked the peaks of respective market cycles. A recent CoinGecko study highlighted that from 2014 to 2023, crypto markets experienced a Santa Claus rally in eight out of ten instances. During these years, total crypto market capitalization surged by 0.7% to 11.8% in the week spanning December 27 to January 2. However, the absence of a rally in 2021, a year that marked the peak of the previous cycle, underscores a key point: Bitcoin‚Äôs December performance is heavily influenced by broader market conditions. With 2025 expected to be the next cycle‚Äôs peak year, the lack of festive cheer this year aligns with historical patterns of mid-cycle corrections. Volatility and Sentiment Signal Potential Recovery Adding to market uncertainty, around $18 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ether options contracts are set to expire on December 27. This could introduce major volatility, potentially impacting Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term price movements. Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs social sentiment reached its lowest level this year on December 22. Interestingly, such negative sentiment often precedes a recovery, as market conditions stabilize and investors regain confidence. While December has failed to deliver the hoped-for rally, traders remain cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trajectory , with eyes set on the patterns leading into 2025‚Äôs anticipated market peak.

Bitcoin (BTC), the market leading digital asset, has crashed to the $94,000 price level after an 11.45% price plunge in the last seven days while the dominance of the digital asset has also crashed to 56.2%, resulting in decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens and artificial intelligence (AI) cryptocurrencies soaring. According to the weekly chart provided by TradingView below, the altcoin trading volume rose significantly as the total market cap of cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and Ether rose to $959.64 billion. At the same time, the Fear and Greed Index has dropped to 55 and reads ‚ÄúNeutral.‚Äù The weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads a value of 63 which means that the bulls are still in control of the altcoin sector while the MACD indicator is also bullish with the MACD line (blue) still above the signal line (line).

In his latest message, Sun said that all rumors of him offloading his ETH holdings are false. The announcement comes as the ETH price has bounced back 2% over $3,400 showing signs of bottom formation and further rally ahead. Justin Sun Denies Ethereum Selloff From Holdings Amid massive Ethereum movement from Justin Sun‚Äôs wallet , along with his redemptions of ETH from liquid staking platform, Lido Finance and EtherFi, and further deposits to crypto exchange HTX, there have been rumors of his selling his holdings. But the Tron founder has cleared the air finally. Sun clarified that the recent activity involving ETH was merely a transfer between different wallets, not a liquidation. He reaffirmed his long-term bullish stance on the Ethereum ecosystem. The Tron founder wrote: ‚ÄúThe rumors circulating online about us liquidating ETH are false. This is simply a transfer of ETH between our different wallets. We remain long-term bullish on the Ethereum ecosystem‚Äù.

Popular crypto analyst Javon Marks noted that the Ethereum price chart is showing an ‚ÄòAdam & Eve Double Bottom Pattern,‚Äô suggesting a potential major bullish reversal in the near term, which could drive prices back into the $4,000 range. The primary target for the next move is still above $4,800.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

In a country famous for runaway inflation and a currency weaker than yesterday‚Äôs promises, the peso has risen by over 40% against its trading partners‚Äô currencies this year. That‚Äôs no typo. Libertarian President Javier Milei‚Äôs fiscal shock therapy turned a collapsing currency into one of the strongest in the region. But don‚Äôt let the headlines fool you. This economic U-turn could hit Argentina‚Äôs beloved Bitcoin harder than anyone anticipated. Tourism, once a golden ticket for Argentina‚Äôs economy, is taking the first hit. After attracting bargain-hungry tourists with cheap wine and steaks, the tables have turned. Tourists are now steering clear of Argentina‚Äôs inflated prices. Locals, meanwhile, are swapping their vacation dreams for shopping sprees abroad. Bitcoin, which had been a lifeline for Argentinians battling a crumbling peso, is also caught in the crossfire of this new economic reality. A peso on steroidsZ flips the script Milei‚Äôs policies have made the peso a giant contender in the global currency ring. By clamping down on monetary emission and keeping the official exchange rate steady, he‚Äôs fueled an economic transformation. On the black market, where the peso had long been battered, Milei‚Äôs stabilization plans have done the impossible ‚Äî strengthened it. Demand for the greenback has plummeted as Argentinians begin trusting their currency again. Inflation has slowed slightly, dropping to 24% in November, but not enough to ease the overall pain. The strong peso is expensive for everyone, especially tourists. The number of visitors spending at least one night in Argentina has nosedived 20.2% compared to the same period in 2023. Uruguayans, Bolivians, and Chileans led the exodus, with arrivals falling 50.9%, 33.4%, and 28.3%, respectively. Even Argentinians are running for the border, with outbound travel jumping 37.7% in the same period. Meanwhile, Americans and Canadians showed more resilience, with a smaller drop of 11.5%. And here‚Äôs a twist‚ÄîEuropeans are bucking the trend. The number of European tourists actually increased by 3.5%, proving there‚Äôs always someone willing to pay for overpriced empanadas. Bitcoin‚Äôs balancing act Now, let‚Äôs talk Bitcoin. Argentina‚Äôs relationship with crypto is as volatile as its economic history. Over the past year, Bitcoin‚Äôs price in pesos has surged by 566.69%, despite recent market fluctuations. As of press time, one Bitcoin trades for 95.7 million ARS. In the years of hyperinflation and peso freefall, Bitcoin became a safe haven. Argentinians turned to it to escape the chaos, with many opting for stablecoins to hedge against local economic disasters. By mid-2024, Argentina accounted for 61.8% of Latin America‚Äôs stablecoin transaction volume. But now, the peso‚Äôs resurgence is reducing the need for alternatives like Bitcoin. Fewer people are looking to ditch their pesos for crypto, even as Bitcoin continues to grow in value. This doesn‚Äôt mean Bitcoin is irrelevant. Far from it. For many Argentinians, it remains a hedge against uncertainty. The scars of decades of economic instability don‚Äôt heal overnight. Even as the peso stabilizes, trust in traditional systems is still shaky. Analysts predict Bitcoin could stabilize at around 105.3 million ARS by Q1 2025, but that depends on both local economic policies and global crypto trends.

North Korean hackers are said to be behind a multi-million attack on a crypto exchange, which cost the platform over $300 million worth of crypto in stolen funds. In a Dec. 23 press release , the Federal Bureau of Investigation alongside Japan‚Äôs National Police Agency revealed that the hack, which occurred in May, is linked to North Korean cyber actors and is associated with the threat group known as TraderTraitor, also referred to as Jade Sleet, UNC4899, and Slow Pisces. According to authorities, the cyber attack began when a North Korean hacker, pretending to be a recruiter on LinkedIn, contacted an employee at Ginco, a Japanese company that provides crypto wallet software. The hacker tricked the employee into downloading a malicious Python script, which was disguised as part of a pre-employment test. The employee unknowingly uploaded the script to their personal GitHub page, allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive company systems. You might also like: US shuts down North Korean crypto laundering network By mid-May, the attackers used stolen session cookies to impersonate the compromised employee and infiltrated Ginco‚Äôs unencrypted communications system, leading to a manipulation of a legitimate transaction request from DMM Bitcoin. Eventually, this scheme allowed the hackers to steal 4,502.9 ( BTC ), equivalent to $307 million at the time. The stolen cryptocurrency was later transferred to wallets controlled by the TraderTraitor group, the FBI said. As crypto.news reported earlier, the United States and South Korea have teamed up to create new mechanisms to prevent crypto thefts linked to North Korea . The two countries have reportedly signed an agreement to jointly create technologies to stop crypto thefts.

Italy‚Äôs data protection authority recently fined OpenAI ‚Ç¨15 million for privacy violations tied to its flagship AI model, ChatGPT, highlighting the need for transparency in AI data practices. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miner TeraWulf is diversifying into artificial intelligence to offset increasing mining expenses, showcasing how AI's growing demand is influencing strategies across sectors. TeraWulf Expands into AI with 70 MW Lease Amid Rising Bitcoin Mining Costs TeraWulf, a prominent Bitcoin mining company, is diversifying its operations as it faces mounting Bitcoin mining costs. On Dec. 23, the firm announced a significant pivot toward artificial intelligence (AI) by leasing over 70 megawatts (MW) of data center infrastructure to Core42, an AI and cloud service provider. The agreement will see Core42 utilize the 70 MW of infrastructure at TeraWulf‚Äôs Lake Mariner facility in upstate New York. The facility will be energized in phases between the first and third quarters of 2025. This partnership is expected to bolster TeraWulf‚Äôs earnings by complementing its existing Bitcoin mining operations with AI-driven computing revenue streams. Paul Prager, CEO of TeraWulf, highlighted the strategic importance of this move. ‚ÄúSurging demand for scalable, energy-efficient infrastructure presents a tremendous opportunity,‚Äù Prager said. ‚ÄúThis agreement not only diversifies our revenue streams but also significantly enhances our long-term earnings potential.‚Äù TeraWulf‚Äôs expansion into AI comes as Bitcoin miners grapple with rising production costs. According to a recent report from CoinShares, the weighted average cash cost to mine a single Bitcoin rose by 13% to $55,950 in the third quarter of 2024. These escalating costs have squeezed profit margins across the sector, prompting miners to explore alternative revenue opportunities. The report also noted that higher production costs have led to a decrease in the market share of public Bitcoin miners within the network‚Äôs overall hashrate. Several companies, including TeraWulf, are now reallocating capital to AI and cloud computing projects, reflecting a broader industry trend toward diversification. TeraWulf‚Äôs Q3 financial performance highlighted the pressures facing Bitcoin miners. The company reported earnings of minus 6 cents per share, falling short of analysts' expectations of minus 3 cents per share. Despite these setbacks, TeraWulf has benefited from Bitcoin‚Äôs 48% price surge this quarter, which pushed the cryptocurrency above the six-figure mark for the first time. However, the stock market response to TeraWulf‚Äôs announcement was muted. On Dec. 23, TeraWulf‚Äôs share price closed down 12.1% at $5.81, although it regained 2% in after-hours trading. Despite the recent dip, TeraWulf remains one of the strongest performers in the Bitcoin mining industry, with its share price up 152.6% in 2024. Shifting Industry Dynamics The partnership with Core42 comes amid a growing trend among Bitcoin miners to pivot toward AI and cloud computing. CoinShares noted that AI is increasingly attracting the attention of traders and venture firms, offering new avenues for growth as mining costs rise. Other miners have taken a different approach, such as issuing convertible notes to buy more Bitcoin instead of expanding their operations. TeraWulf‚Äôs strategy of pursuing organic growth at its existing facilities aligns with its stated commitment to shareholder returns. In July, the company revealed its openness to a potential merger to boost operating hashrate but emphasized that such a move would not be made solely for ‚Äúempire building.‚Äù As the Lake Mariner facility transitions into a dual-purpose site supporting both Bitcoin mining and AI-driven computing, TeraWulf positions itself as a versatile player in the digital infrastructure space. The phased rollout of the new infrastructure is expected to provide steady revenue growth over the coming years, balancing the volatility of Bitcoin mining with the stability of AI and cloud computing demand. With Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility continuing to influence the sector, TeraWulf‚Äôs diversification strategy could serve as a blueprint for other miners seeking to navigate the challenges of rising costs and competitive pressures. Whether this approach will sustain its upward trajectory remains to be seen, but the company‚Äôs willingness to adapt to market conditions is a promising sign for its future. Italy Fines OpenAI ‚Ç¨15 Million Over Data Privacy Violations and Orders Public Awareness Campaign In other AI news, Italy‚Äôs data protection authority, the Garante, has imposed a ‚Ç¨15 million ($15.7 million) fine on OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, following an extensive investigation into the company's data collection practices. The ruling brings attention to significant concerns about data privacy, transparency, and age verification in the deployment of generative artificial intelligence models. The Italian Data Protection Authority (IDPA) stated on Dec. 20 that OpenAI violated data privacy regulations under the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by processing users‚Äô personal data without a proper legal basis. The watchdog also noted that OpenAI failed to notify the agency of a data breach that occurred in March 2023. The IDPA‚Äôs findings criticized OpenAI for breaching the principles of transparency and user information obligations. It stated that the company did not adequately inform users about how their data was being collected and utilized to train its flagship AI model, ChatGPT. The investigation also revealed that OpenAI lacked sufficient mechanisms to verify users‚Äô ages, potentially exposing minors under 13 years old to inappropriate responses generated by the AI. The IDPA emphasized that this failure posed significant risks to children‚Äôs development and self-awareness. In addition to the fine, the IDPA ordered OpenAI to conduct a six-month public awareness campaign to educate the public about ChatGPT‚Äôs data collection practices. This campaign is expected to span multiple platforms, including radio, television, newspapers, and the internet. The campaign will aim to inform users and non-users alike about how their data is collected and used to train generative AI, as well as their rights to oppose, rectify, or delete their data under GDPR. Following the campaign, users are expected to have a clearer understanding of how to exercise their data protection rights, including opting out of having their data used for AI training purposes. The IDPA‚Äôs investigation began in March 2023, shortly after Italy became the first Western country to temporarily ban ChatGPT over privacy concerns. At the time, the IDPA cited suspected breaches of data protection rules and demanded greater transparency from OpenAI. The ban was lifted in late April after the company implemented additional privacy safeguards. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) played a role in shaping the investigation‚Äôs outcome, providing an opinion on the use of personal data in developing and deploying AI models. The IDPA said it considered this opinion before concluding its probe. Fine and Mitigating Factors Under GDPR regulations, companies can be fined up to ‚Ç¨20 million or 4% of their global turnover for violations. The IDPA noted that OpenAI‚Äôs cooperative attitude during the investigation helped reduce the size of the penalty. During the investigation, OpenAI moved its European headquarters to Ireland, placing it under the jurisdiction of the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC). The IDPA confirmed that the DPC is now the lead supervisory authority for any future investigations into OpenAI. The fine and public awareness campaign signal a turning point in regulatory oversight of AI models in Europe. The IDPA‚Äôs actions shed some light on the growing scrutiny that generative AI companies face as governments and regulators aim to balance innovation with user privacy and data security. Italy‚Äôs approach also highlights the challenges of enforcing data protection laws on rapidly evolving technologies. While the temporary ban on ChatGPT earlier this year drew criticism, it has set a precedent for other countries to evaluate their own data privacy measures. OpenAI‚Äôs case could prompt further inquiries into the practices of other AI developers, particularly as generative AI becomes increasingly integrated into daily life and business operations. OpenAI has not yet issued an official response to the fine or the IDPA‚Äôs orders. However, the company previously apologized for outages and other disruptions as it worked to address regulatory concerns. It remains to be seen how OpenAI will adapt its data handling practices in response to the IDPA‚Äôs ruling.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-24 10:00:00

While Solana and Ripple are struggling, many traders are seeing a 500% return by stockpiling this new exchange token. Table of Contents DTX Exchange seen as the next big thing amid unique offering Solana price in the red, analyst remains bullish Bark: The price of XRP will rise soon Can DTX Exchange skyrocket like Solana and Ripple? The crypto market is always moving, and recently, Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) have been bleeding on the price charts. Although experts like Captain Faibik and Bark see price growth for these altcoins in the future, many traders are focusing on a new token: DTX Exchange (DTX) . This phase six presale star has already given early buyers a 500% return. Since it will bring innovation to online trading, experts even foresee this rookie becoming the next 3x crypto coin in 2025. DTX Exchange seen as the next big thing amid unique offering While Solana and Ripple seem to face challenges right now, DTX Exchange is thriving. Its ongoing presale performance has been outstanding, with over $10m raised and 300k users onboarded. Plus, early buyers of this altcoin are already seeing a 500% return. People are trusting the long-term vision of DTX Exchange, to become a huge force in online trading. It will launch a hybrid trading platform with the best of CEX and DEX to accomplish this. On it, people will get: Over 120k asset classes: The ability to access stocks, FX, and over 100K crypto pairs in one place. Anonymity: Traders will remain anonymous thanks to no sign-up KYC checks on DTX Exchange. Up to 1000x leverage: DTX Exchange will offer up to 1000x leverage on assets, meaning a $100 investment could help traders access liquidity of up to $100k. The DTX native token is a big part of its ecosystem. Those who hold it will get governance voting rights, staking rewards, and more. Currently, one DTX costs just $0.12 during phase six of its presale. But this altcoin price will rise to $0.14 after phase seven begins. Plus, everyone is waiting for a Tier-1 CEX listing, which may trigger a rally to $0.20. This could make DTX one of the best altcoins for fast returns. Solana price in the red, analyst remains bullish Solana has been in a downtrend recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Solana fell nearly 30% in the past month alone. In that time, its value moved between the $250 level and around $180. Nevertheless, crypto analyst Captain Faibik remains optimistic for Solana. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin has broken out and retested a bullish pennant on its weekly chart. He predicts a potential surge to $400 for the Solana coin soon. Although this Solana price prediction has excited many traders, experts also note that its market cap is nearly $90b. Therefore, Solana would need a lot of new money to experience a noteworthy price surge. But tokens like DTX Exchange will not face this issue.

In the past seven days, the value of this altcoin has fallen from around $2.40 to nearly $2.20. In other words, nearly a 10% drop as per CoinMarketCap. However, market expert Bark made traders more confident with his Ripple price prediction. According to his X post, the next Ripple candle will melt faces. In his opinion, this altcoin could see a price jump to $3.50 soon. Other experts think it may not be as big if the Ripple crypto sees a price jump soon. Since this crypto coin has already experienced a 250% surge on the YTD charts, its highest upswings may have passed. Therefore, traders are looking at DTX Exchange instead. Can DTX Exchange skyrocket like Solana and Ripple? DTX Exchange is gaining traction within the crypto space by seeing 500% growth. Given that Ripple and Solana are working through turbulence, DTX provides a brand new avenue of growth potential. Since it will also tap into the growing $1.4t FX market and boast a smaller market cap, its value may surge way faster than its peers. Therefore, many experts think that DTX could soar by 3x in 2025.

According to recent data, the coin had an astounding trading volume of more than $116 million on Binance Futures, demonstrating its growing appeal with traders. Despite a tough market, XRP‚Äôs success stands out, especially given that other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have had large price reductions.

Analyst Weighs In Rising Interest Amidst Market Challenges The digital currency market as a whole has recently experienced some volatility. Bitcoin and numerous altcoins have battled with falling values, but XRP appears to be doing better than many of its competitors. Though down 11% over the past week, the altcoin is still selling at roughly $2.25 and still shows a pretty decent 250% annual increase in value. This resilience draws investors looking for strong choices in a turbulent climate. Binance‚Äôs Top Traded Altcoin in December ‚Äô24 ‚ÄúXRP is the most traded altcoin on the Binance Futures market, with a trading volume of 116.6B already, and the month isn‚Äôt over yet.‚Äù ‚Äì By @JA_Maartun Full post üëáhttps://t.co/oR5GhIAZ9e pic.twitter.com/Kv9sZyy0vz ‚Äî CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 23, 2024 Analysts have established a correlation between the velocity of XRP‚Äôs recovery from losses and recent declines in the currency. Analysts indicate that the digital asset‚Äôs trading volume is notably robust and dynamic in derivatives. Derivatives trading for XRP increased by 34%, reflecting heightened trader interest in possible price movements. Nonetheless, the open interest in XRP contracts declined, indicating that certain traders might be liquidating their positions due to uncertainty. Wallet Growth Signals Growing Adoption The second positive signal coming for XRP is related to wallet holders growth. Santiment data indicates a rise in non-empty XRP wallets of 5.75 million over the past two years, meaning growth of 28%. An increase like this mirrors greater trends in increasing cryptocurrency acceptance seen with the bigger coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. üò≤ The past 2 years have seen big increases in cryptocurrency holders. Here are the number of non-exmpty wallets for crypto‚Äôs top 4 coins by market cap: Bitcoin $BTC: 54.7M (+27% rise) Ethereum $ETH: 134.9M (+47% rise) Tether $USDT: 6.57M (+66% rise) XRP $XRP: 5.75M (+28% rise) pic.twitter.com/rcd50VAikZ ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 23, 2024 The rise in wallet numbers shows that more investors are now ready to stick on XRP for the long run, therefore stabilizing its price and raising its market presence. XRP is predicted to be the center of attention for traders and investors both as curiosity rises. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Break $3,500 Before End Of 2024?

Its investment portfolio includes a wide variety of projects in the fields of blockchain infrastructure, layer-2 scaling solutions, and DeFi breakthroughs, some of which are Sei Network, Arbitrum , SSV, LayerZero, and zkSync. By utilizing decentralized governance and incorporating real-world assets, like US Treasury Bills (T-Bills), Usual Protocol (USUAL) distinguishes itself with its creative approach to stablecoin issuance. Because of the U.S. government‚Äôs support, U.S. Treasury Bills, which are short-term debt instruments issued by the government, are regarded as one of the safest investments in the world.

The USUAL token has a market cap of $635 million, with a trading volume of $964 million in the past 24 hours. Also, its bullish price behavior as of Nov. 24, 2024, demonstrates the market‚Äôs tremendous faith in its creative approach to stablecoin supply and decentralized finance. At the time of writing, USUAL is trading at $1.34, which is around a 31.4% increase in price from the previous day. Source: CoinmarketCap The investment by OKX Ventures is a big step in the direction of encouraging the development of decentralized stablecoins, and USUAL is expected to be crucial in changing the financial scene.

Ripple RLUSD Stablecoin Marks Independent Reserve Listing Ripple RLUSD stablecoin marked its launch on the Independent Reserve recently, sparking optimism in the market. The exchange recently announced the addition of the stablecoin on its trading platform, making it accessible via both its order book and OTC desk. This marks the first time a Singapore-based licensed exchange has embraced the Ripple stablecoin, emphasizing the country‚Äôs growing reputation as a crypto innovation hub. According to the announcement, users can trade the stablecoin against Singapore dollars (SGD) and US dollars (USD) on Independent Reserve from December 22, 2024.

Independent Reserve is proud to be the first regulated exchange in Singapore to offer secure and reliable access to RLUSD, staying true to our mission of leveraging crypto and blockchain technology to transform financial services.‚Äù Meanwhile, the stablecoin‚Äôs dual issuance on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks ensures seamless compatibility with DeFi applications and robust support for cross-border payments.

Besides, it also comes in tandem with CEO Brad Garlinghouse‚Äôs previous social media post, where he said that the stablecoin would mark its listing on Independent Reserve soon.

Binance has officially announced its support for the rebranding and token swap of Fantom ( FTM ) to Sonic, set for an early 2025 token swap. The exchange will stop processing FTM deposits and withdrawals at 3:30 UTC on Jan. 13, 2025, and delist all FTM trading pairs, including FTM/BTC, FTM/USDT, and FTM/ETH. After that, trading for the new Sonic (S) coin will open on Jan. 16, 2025, when pairings including S/BTC, S/BNB, and S/USDT will become live. The FTM tokens will be converted to Sonic at a 1:1 ratio, which means that users will get the same number of Sonic tokens for each FTM they own. All technical parts of the swap will be managed by Binance, so users won‚Äôt need to do anything on their own. However, FTM withdrawals won‚Äôt be supported after the token swap is finished.

Futures, Margin Trading, and Simple Earn are among the services that Binance will be upgrading as part of the transition. In the affected products, FTM will be replaced by the new S token. With a total supply cap set at 15% yearly inflation until 2031, there will be about 2.88 billion S tokens in circulation at launch. As part of an incentive program designed to attract developers to the Sonic network, users will be eligible to get up to 90% of the funds their apps produce. Additionally, the platform will provide a 190 million S airdrop and an Innovator Fund to encourage users of the Sonic and Opera chains. You might also like: Investors bullish on Fantom ahead of Sonic upgrade Users‚Äô FTM tokens will remain functional on the Opera network for the foreseeable future if they decide not to upgrade to the S token. However, users will need to possess the S token to engage in transactions, governance, and other activities on the new Sonic network . Key points to note here are: At 3:30 UTC on January 13, 2025, all FTM trading pairs were delisted and deposits and withdrawals were halted. Sonic (S) token trading starts at 8:00 UTC on January 16, 2025, with pairs such as S/USDT, S/BTC, and S/BNB. Before the deadline, Binance encourages FTM token holders to update or terminate any open positions in FTM-related services, including loans, margin positions, and trading bots.

Adding to this, Elon Musk‚Äôs AI company, xAI, has raised a huge $6 billion in its Series C funding round. This funds flow will help xAI to grow and compete with major players like OpenAI. According to the CNBC report , the round is initially supported by A16Z, Blackrock, Fidelity, and Sequoia Capital. Additionally, tech giants like NVIDIA and AMD joined as strategic investors to assist xAI in building more advanced AI systems. The money will mostly be used to expand xAI‚Äôs supercomputer, Colossus, which helps power its AI projects. Right now, the supercomputer runs on 100,000 powerful Nvidia GPUs (a type of computer chip), but xAI plans to double that number to 200,000. This will make the supercomputer work faster and help xAI build better AI tools and products. In his recent X post, Elon Musk stated that by 2030, AI will be smarter than all humans combined. He‚Äôs so sure about it that he says the chance of this happening is almost 100%. It is increasingly likely that AI will superset the intelligence of any single human by the end of 2025 and maybe all humans by 2027/2028.

This makes it a serious competitor to OpenAI, which is worth $157 billion. In just a short time, xAI has outpaced other AI companies like Anthropic, which is worth $19 billion, and Perplexity, which is worth $2.8 billion. Moreover, the company is also hiring a lot of new employees to help it grow even faster. One of the key products xAI is working on is Grok, a chatbot that helps users with things like text rewriting and image generation. Grok is now available to more people, including through an app on iPhones and on its website, Grok.com. Who Invested in xAI? As per reports, xAI‚Äôs latest funding round was exclusive to investors who had supported the company in earlier rounds. Plus individuals who were involved in funding Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter acquisition were allowed to purchase up to 25% of xAI‚Äôs shares. As of now, the Series C round had almost 100 investors, including major venture capital firms and sovereign wealth funds. The minimum amount needed to invest was around $77,593. With this funding, xAI is ready to keep growing and pushing the limits of what AI can do. In short, xAI is competing with Open AI and others in the market. Though the path for xAI looks promising it will be interesting to see if Elon‚Äôs popularity pushes the company to touch the roof in terms of building the company a tech leader.",News|funding,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 10:06:21

Experts Weigh In on a 40% Chance appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Early this month, the US Federal Reserve reduced the federal fund interest rate by 25bps, bringing down borrowing costs to the range of 4.25% ‚Äì 4.5%. Announcing the third rate cut of the year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the organisation would take a cautious approach when considering any future rate cuts. Now, experts suggest that there is a 40% probability that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rate in 2025. Shocking! Here is what you should know! Federal Reserve Faces 40% Rate Hike Odds in 2025 Among those expecting a rate hike is Apollo Global Management, a leading provider of alternative asset management and retirement solutions. The firm predicts that there is at least 40% probability that the US Fed will consider a rate hike in 2025. Inflation Above 2% Challenges the Fed‚Äôs Plans At the start of this year, the US Inflation Rate was at 3.1%. In March, it touched a yearly peak of 3.5%. Between March and September, it consistently declined; in September, it reached a yearly low of 2.4%. Since then, it has grown steadily. In October, it reached 2.6%, and in November, it climbed to 2.7%. The consistent growth in the inflation rate is a matter of serious concern in the United States. The country‚Äôs ultimate target is to bring down the inflation rate down to 2%. Experts believe that unless the inflation trend reverses, the Fed cannot consider any further interest rate cuts. Economic Strength Supports Rate Hike Predictions The strength of the US economy is a key factor behind the rate hike predictions. Robust economic activity can contribute to sustained inflationary pressures, further complicating monetary policy decisions. In conclusion, as inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed‚Äôs target, the potential for rate hikes in 2025 highlights the delicate balancing act facing policymakers.

The ban will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025, and run until Mar. 15, 2031. According to TASS , the mining ban will take place in Dagestan, Ingushetia, Chechnya, Kabardino-Balkaria and North Ossetia. The ban will include mining and participation in pools. The order has also not been entered into force in Luhansk and Donetsk People‚Äôs Republics, as well as some localities of Zaporizhia and Kherson.

By 2025, this will be enforced between Jan. 1 and Mar. 15, with the years to follow seeing bans take effect from Nov. 15 through Mar. 15. This is a set of policies that manage how much energy is consumed and distribute it evenly across different industries. Experts are of the opinion that the crypto mining ban is due to energy shortages and the subsidized price at which bandwidth is available in some markets. Sergey Kolobanov, the Center for Strategic Research of this mechanism, has become one of the arguments to justify restrictions on interregional cross-subsidization, which compensates for cheap energy in regulated regions. Kolobanov states that the limitation is in line with the end of the transition period aimed at removing such benefits. Power privatization is expected to eliminate the need for such bans one day.

Experts say the authorities justified the ban on the grounds of energy shortages and price disparities in electricity. The regulated contract states in question enjoy lower electricity prices, which are effectively cross-subsidized by the producers and consumers of other regions. Earlier, Russia imposed 15% tax rule on Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining profits on Nov. 18. The world‚Äôs largest country‚Äôs current mining ban is a result of ongoing energy shortages and differentiated electricity pricing, as per a previous TASS report . Further, World Energy Outlook 2023 states that Russia‚Äôs power generation decreased in 2022 due to lower industrial demand and export sanctions, while electricity consumption increased by 5.8% in industrial regions by mid-2023. Subsidized regions such as Irkutsk, where electricity is sold at $0.01 per kWh, attracted miners and straining grids during winter peaks. The ban will help address energy equity and balance such imbalances while preparing to privatize power frameworks.

Daiwa is one of the many companies pushing for Japan to approve crypto ETFs. According to a Bloomberg report published on Dec. 24, Akihiko Ogino, Chief Executive Officer of the second largest brokerage in Japan, said in an interview that Japan should allow for crypto ETFs to ‚Äúdebut in the country.‚Äù At the time of writing, Daiwa itself has an index-based exchange-traded fund in the Japan market, labeled Daiwa ETF Nikkei 225. Though, Ogino did not reveal any plans for Daiwa to start filing their own crypto-backed ETF. Daiwa is not the only firm pushing for crypto ETFs. Last October, major Japanese financial firms such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui and Nomura securities, all backed a proposal that asked the Japanese government to prioritize Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) for crypto-backed ETFs. However, many believe that it is still difficult for Japan to embrace crypto-backed ETFs due to its ‚Äúregulatory constraints‚Äù as well as negative perception towards crypto because of past incidents such as Mt. Gox and DMM. Additionally, Ogino predicted that Japan‚Äôs central bank seems set on tightening monetary policies even further as corporate profits begin to grow along with the early signs of inflations. You might also like: Major Japanese companies want to prioritize Bitcoin and Ether for crypto ETFs Daiwa expects the Bank of Japan to increase the nation‚Äôs policy interest rate in January next year by 25 basis points, from 0.25% to 0.5%. The brokerage also expect the central bank to raise it again by the end of 2025 to 0.75%. Based on the BOJ‚Äôs reduction of Japanese government debt purchases, Ogino concluded that ‚Äúthe volume of bonds available for the market will increase, which will likely stimulate trading.‚Äù Daiwa is currently having a hard time gaining profit in its China market. Ogino said that it is ‚Äúa bit questionable‚Äù whether the brokerage will be able to make profit in the new year ahead. Thus, the firm is exploring ways to turn profit in 2026 instead. ‚ÄúThe reality is that the pace of the Chinese market over the past year hasn‚Äôt been as good as expected,‚Äù adds Ogino. According to official data, the combined revenue of securities firms in China fell by 9% to 203.3 billion yuan ($27.9 billion) in the first half compared to the previous year. In addition, company stated that it will be raising employee wages in April 2025 to ‚Äúaround 5% or perhaps more.‚Äù The CEO said that the firm wants to ‚Äúappropriately grow and train‚Äù its existing staff to trade successfully in yen rates, without having to add new recruits.

VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-bitcoin-price/,"The recent Bitcoin price action has been marked by a correction from its all-time high of $108,135 achieved just a week ago. Although Bitcoin has largely held up above the $90,000 mark, the correction has seen the cryptocurrency falling to as low as $92,500 in the past 24 hours. This decline has not only shaken confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs immediate trajectory but has also turned attention toward the altcoin market. Although the altcoin market has also mirrored this trend of Bitcoin‚Äôs price correction, many investors and analysts are expecting an altcoin rally very soon. VanEck weighed in on this expectation with a confident declaration on the social media platform X. According to the investment firm, the crypto industry is currently in an altcoin season that started on November 27. Altcoin Season Is Here Already‚ÄîVanEck Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has struggled to maintain its price momentum above the $100,000 mark, raising questions about where the market might head next. While many Bitcoin proponents are expecting a renewed surge in 2025 with the incoming Trump administration in the US, other crypto analysts are turning to the altcoin market. Interestingly, analysts at VanEck suggest that the current crypto environment may favor altcoins against Bitcoin. Related Reading: XRP Price On Its Way To $10 In Only 3 Months If It Follows This Pattern Matthew Sigel, head of digital research at VanEck, elaborated on this phenomenon, explaining that Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance in terms of market cap, liquidity, and volume often lays the groundwork for altcoins to outperform. According to Sigel, as capital flows into the market, risk-on sentiment tends to boost nascent crypto applications, particularly those in decentralized finance, gaming, and NFTs, which in turn allows the altcoin market to outperform Bitcoin. VanEck‚Äôs outlook on the altcoin season also highlighted data from Artemis‚Äôs Altcoin Season Index, which measures how many of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. According to this index, which ranges from a value of 0 to 1, the altcoin season starts with a reading of 0.6. At the time of writing, the index is currently well above this level, having recently reached 0.8. This suggests that the crypto industry is currently in an altcoin season where profits taken from Bitcoin will start to flow into top altcoins. Diverging Views On Current Metrics Interestingly, Artemis‚Äôs Altcoin Season Index differs from more conventional metrics, such as those provided by CoinMarketCap. CoinMarketCap defines an altcoin season as a period when 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days. By this measure, the index currently sits at 51, though it peaked at an impressive 87 on December 4.

The potential deal, first reported by FOX journalist Eleanor Terrett via a December 23 X post , would mark MoonPay‚Äôs most significant acquisition to date, signaling a strategic push into the growing e-commerce sector. Known as the ‚ÄúPayPal for crypto,‚Äù MoonPay provides a suite of cryptocurrency payment solutions, enabling users to buy and sell digital assets with debit or credit cards and mobile payment systems like Apple Pay and Google Pay. The acquisition of Helio Pay would significantly bolster MoonPay‚Äôs offerings by integrating its self-service platform, which supports over 6,000 merchants and content creators. Helio Pay allows these users to accept payments in Bitcoin, Ether, stablecoins such as USD Coin (USDC), and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. Among its most notable integrations is Solana Pay on Shopify, one of the largest e-commerce platforms globally, with over 138 million monthly users. Expanding Reach in Crypto Payments MoonPay‚Äôs user base, which spans more than 160 countries with 20 million users, would benefit from Helio Pay‚Äôs established merchant network and its advanced e-commerce integrations. This potential acquisition aligns with MoonPay‚Äôs recent efforts to innovate within the crypto payment space. In November, the company launched MoonPay Balance, a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp designed to facilitate easier interaction with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The feature supports users in 27 countries, primarily in Europe, though key markets like the United States and Germany were excluded. MoonPay has also been expanding its fiat integration capabilities. Earlier this year, it introduced fiat PayPal on-ramps for customers in the European Union and the United Kingdom, following a successful launch in the United States. Future Implications for Crypto E-Commerce An acquisition of Helio Pay would enhance MoonPay‚Äôs position as a leader in the crypto payment space , bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain-based solutions. By merging Helio‚Äôs innovative e-commerce tools with MoonPay‚Äôs extensive infrastructure, the combined entity could drive broader adoption of cryptocurrency in everyday transactions.

Corporations, U.S. governments, and BRICS nations are potentially racing to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Falling Bitcoin dominance - down¬†6%¬†MoM, the sharpest drop since 2022 - signals a broader crypto rally underway. Bitcoin‚Äôs historic rally, accelerating corporate and state adoption, and the onset of altcoin season signal a broader crypto bull market, with BTC potentially reaching $180k by 2025. Please note that VanEck has exposure to bitcoin. Bitcoin's Price Action Market sentiment: Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) made history this month, breaking above $100k on December 5th and reaching a peak of $108k by December 17th. As we anticipated in last month's ChainCheck , indicators like perp funding rates and relative unrealized profits continue to signal that we have entered the stage of the cycle with the greatest one- to six-month upside potential. This month, the rally‚Äôs momentum is underpinned by three unprecedented forces: Bitcoin‚Äôs growing adoption as an institutional reserve asset, rising altcoin speculation, and powerful synergies between crypto and AI. While we expect multiple 20% retracements and possibly a 40% drawdown on the path to our 10% For Months Would be Bearish"" target=""_blank""> $180k price target , these drivers suggest an acceleration of Bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory into 2025. Bitcoin Treasury Adoption Institutional corporate and sovereign treasuries made unprecedented moves to adopt Bitcoin this month. Among corporates, a major milestone came as the Nasdaq-100 added MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), the world‚Äôs largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. As a result, funds and ETFs tracking the Nasdaq-100 will now have exposure to MSTR‚Äôs ~439k Bitcoin, marking a milestone in Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption in traditional financial markets and paving the way for potential S&P 500 inclusion. Sovereign nations are following closely, with President-elect Donald Trump emphasizing the U.S.‚Äôs plan to compete with BRICS nations in energy, AI, and crypto dominance through deregulation and a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. However, like corporates and retail investors, even individual U.S. states are beginning to effectively front-run national treasuries in their race to adopt Bitcoin. State-Level Bitcoin Competition in the U.S. November 19th : Pennsylvania Representative Mike Cabell introduced legislation to form the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, proposing allocating up to 10% of the state's $7 billion reserve to Bitcoin. December 3rd: The Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA) stated that there is a ‚Äúvery good chance‚Äù of establishing a state strategic Bitcoin reserve in 2025, highlighted by pro-Bitcoin leadership in the state legislature and existing pension fund investments in crypto-related assets. This follows Florida's CFO Jimmy Patronis' recommendation for the state to direct a portion of its retirement system into crypto. Similarly, Wisconsin and Michigan pension funds have already begun diversifying into Bitcoin. December 9th: In Alabama, State Auditor Andrew Sorrell stated, ‚ÄúThe debate over whether crypto will succeed has ended. Now, the fight for which states will benefit from it has begun."" December 12th: In Texas, State Representative Giovanni Capriglione, Chair of the Texas Pensions, Investments, and Financial Services Committee, officially filed for a Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill. December 17th: Ohio state representative Derek Merrin filed the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act to hold Bitcoin within the state treasury. These state-level developments demonstrate the economic game theory driving Bitcoin adoption, setting the stage for broader national and international competition. National Bitcoin Policy: The BITCOIN Act and FASB‚Äôs Impact Betting Markets Gain Confidence in U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Sources: Kalshi, Polymarket as of 12/17/2024. At the national level, Bitcoin adoption is accelerating with significant policy and regulatory developments: December 12th: After ringing the opening bell at the NYSE, President-elect Donald Trump reaffirmed support for the BITCOIN Act and confirmed his intent to establish a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. When asked about creating a Bitcoin reserve similar to the nation‚Äôs oil reserve, Trump responded, ‚ÄúYeah, I think so. We‚Äôre going to do something great with crypto because we don‚Äôt want China or anybody else‚Äînot just China‚Äîbut others are embracing it, and we want to be the head."" This builds on Trump‚Äôs campaign promise at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in July, where he pledged to create a ""strategic national Bitcoin reserve"" and predicted Bitcoin could surpass gold‚Äôs $16 trillion market cap. December 16th : The U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) adopted new rules allowing companies to value Bitcoin at current market prices, fully effective in 2025. Previously, companies could only report Bitcoin at its purchase price, recording impairments but ignoring gains. This distorted financial statements and discouraged adoption. New rules ensure companies can report gains and losses based on market prices, improving transparency and simplifying Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption as a corporate reserve asset. BRICS Nations Take a Head Start While U.S. initiatives gain momentum, BRICS ( Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa ) nations are already advancing their efforts to integrate Bitcoin to circumvent U.S. sanctions and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Russia: Since the BRICS Business Forum in mid-October, Russia has prioritized Bitcoin adoption. The country has partnered with BRICS allies to construct Bitcoin mining and AI facilities. In November, President Vladimir Putin proposed a BRICS investment platform using digital assets and later signed a law recognizing digital currencies as property for foreign trade settlements under an experimental legal regime (ELR). Brazil: In late November, Brazilian Congressman Eros Biondini introduced legislation for the country to acquire Bitcoin until it comprises 5% of Brazil‚Äôs international reserves. This move signals Brazil‚Äôs strategic intent to diversify its reserves and align with Bitcoin‚Äôs rising global prominence. China: Predictions at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 Conference by Anthony Scaramucci and Changpeng Zhao suggest that China may soon reintegrate Bitcoin mining operations and reserves. If realized, this would mark a significant shift in China‚Äôs stance, further solidifying Bitcoin‚Äôs role in global economic systems. Clearly, BRICS nations are positioning Bitcoin as a key tool in their strategy to de-dollarize and bolster economic resilience. Their coordinated efforts demonstrate an effort to challenge Western economic dominance. Emerging Global Players and Cities Beyond the BRICS nations, other countries and cities are accelerating Bitcoin adoption, highlighting its growing relevance as a reserve asset and financial innovation tool. Suriname: In late October, Suriname‚Äôs presidential candidate, Maya Prabhoe, outlined plans to replace the Suriname dollar with Bitcoin as the national currency and issue Bitcoin bonds. United Kingdom: In early November, British pension specialist Cartwright guided the country‚Äôs first pension fund to allocate 3% of its total assets into Bitcoin. Poland: On November 17th, Presidential candidate Slawomir Mentzen proposed a national Bitcoin reserve and pledged to make Poland ‚Äúa cryptocurrency haven‚Äù if elected in 2025. Japan: On December 11th, Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Yamada submitted a letter to the country‚Äôs House of Councillors, noting ‚Äúthe trend of establishing Bitcoin reserves in the United States and other countries‚Äù and asking, ‚ÄúShould Japan also introduce a system to convert part of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets such as Bitcoin?‚Äù Vancouver, Canada: Also on December 11th, Vancouver councilors passed a motion forwarded by Mayor Ken Sim titled ‚ÄúBecoming a Bitcoin-Friendly City. "" The motion advocates using Bitcoin as a reserve asset and accepting it for tax payments and fees. Australia: Revealed in a December 12th report, Australia‚Äôs AMP became the first major superannuation (retirement) fund to buy Bitcoin, having acquired $27M of Bitcoin in May 2024. France: Speaking in Brussels on Monday, December 16th, French Legislator and European Parliament member Sarah Knafo declared her support for a strategic national Bitcoin reserve while denouncing the digital euro, a proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC) proposed by the European Central Bank. Accelerating Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Corporates, Governments, and Funds are Buying Retail‚Äôs Bitcoin ((BTC)) Source: bitcointreasuries.net as of 12/17/2024, Past performance is no guarantee of future results. These fundamental shifts in Bitcoin‚Äôs market structure promise to accelerate the years-long trend of corporations and governments accumulating Bitcoin from retail holders. Between Q4 2022 and Q4 2024, corporates added ~162k BTC, governments ~377k BTC, and ETFs/investment funds ~329k BTC to their reserves. It is important to note that governments‚Äô BTC holdings largely stem from criminal seizures, primarily in the U.S., China, and Germany‚Äîthough we expect this to shift towards deliberate open-market purchases like El Salvador‚Äôs in the coming years. As of December 17th, 69 public companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, a number we expect to surpass 100 in 2025 . On December 9th, Jetking Infotrain became India‚Äôs first publicly traded company to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. MicroStrategy, Marathon, and Riot continued their industry-leading accumulation of Bitcoin, adding ~128.8k BTC , ~6,500 BTC , and ~5,800 BTC, respectively, since mid-November. Of course, many major decision-makers remain unconvinced. On December 10th, Microsoft shareholders nearly unanimously rejected a proposal to put Bitcoin on its balance sheet at a weighting of 1% of its total assets. Regardless, the total Bitcoin held by private and public entities now stands at ~985k BTC, on track to surpass Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs estimated holdings of 1.1 million BTC by 2025. Such rapid accumulation demonstrates a growing belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs credibility as an institutional reserve asset. Governments‚Äô aggregate decrease in BTC holdings from Q3 2024 to today can be primarily attributed to Germany‚Äôs selling of all ~50,000 BTC it had seized. At an average sales price of $57.6k , Germany‚Äôs BTC sale has reached a ~$2.5 billion opportunity cost when measured against December 17th‚Äôs price of ~108k per BTC . We believe the U.S. should avoid repeating Germany‚Äôs mistake. While critics like Peter Schiff have urged President Biden to sell the U.S.‚Äôs Bitcoin before Trump‚Äôs inauguration, a well-managed reserve could provide significant long-term value. The analysis below illustrates this potential. Modeling BITCOIN Act Scenarios We modeled outcomes based on the BITCOIN Act of 2024, introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis. The Act proposes that the U.S. Treasury acquire 1 million BTC over five years to counter rising inflation and global de-dollarization risks. However, even without legislation, there are several steps Trump could take via executive action to initiate such a reserve: Halt the sale of Bitcoin from the U.S. asset forfeiture reserve (~198k BTC). Revalue gold certificates‚Äîcurrently priced at 1970s levels‚Äîto today‚Äôs value, unlocking ~$693 billion in unrealized capital. Leverage the $ 49.7 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) under the authority of the Treasury Secretary. While the U.S. awaits a broader legislative framework for holding Bitcoin as a national reserve, the BITCOIN Act‚Äôs proposed 200,000 BTC first-year acquisition could be covered by repurposing seized Bitcoin. The remaining 800,000 BTC could be financed through the ESF and/or diversification away from the Treasury‚Äôs gold reserves‚Äîall without requiring money printing or taxpayer funds. Estimated U.S. Debt vs. Bitcoin Reserve Growth (assuming 25% BTC CAGR) For illustration only. Assumptions U.S. Debt Value Starting Debt (2025) $37,000,000,000,000 Debt CAGR 5.0% Final U.S. Debt Value (2049) (USD Trillions) $119.3 Bitcoin Treasury Value BTC Price In 2025 $200,000 BTC CAGR 25.0% Total BTC Purchased by 2029 1,000,000 Final Bitcoin Treasury Value (2049) (USD Trillions) $42.4 Bitcoin Adoption Implied BTC Price $42,351,647 Est.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Our analysis suggests that if the U.S. government follows the BITCOIN Act‚Äôs proposed trajectory‚Äîacquiring 1 million BTC by 2029‚Äîthe reserve could represent an estimated 35% of the national debt by 2049, offsetting ~$42 trillion of liabilities. This optimistic scenario assumes that U.S. debt compounds at 5.0% from a base of $37 trillion from 2025 to 2049, while Bitcoin compounds at 25% annually over the same period from a starting value of $200,000, implying a value of ~$42.3 million per Bitcoin in 2049. Assuming today‚Äôs ~$900 trillion of total global financial assets compound at 7.0% from 2025 to 2049, Bitcoin would represent 18% of global financial assets in this scenario. Altcoin Season has Started Altcoin Season Indicator: Began on November 27 th Source: Artemis as of 12/16/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Because Bitcoin dominates crypto markets in terms of market cap, liquidity, and volume, its sustained performance often creates the conditions for so-called ‚Äòaltcoins‚Äô ‚Äîany cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin‚Äîto perform. As new capital flows into the crypto markets, risk-on sentiment and wealth effects give rise to more nascent crypto applications like those involved with decentralized finance, gaming, and NFTs. The chart shows how many of the top 50 altcoins (by market cap) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. If more than 60% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, it signals 'alt season,' when leading altcoins dominate performance. BTC Price Returns After Altcoin Season Indicator >= 0.60 Begins (Jan 2017 - Present) Duration of Indicator (Days) n = Average 1m Return (%) Average 3m Return (%) Average 6m Return (%) All 61 10 30 73 41 11 25 71 7-30 15 9 50 76 >30 5 0 12 81 % of Time BTC Returns are Positive 'X' Months After Indicator >= 0.60 Begins (Jan 2017 - Present) Duration of Indicator (Days) n = Average 1m Return (%) Average 3m Return (%) Average 6m Return (%) All 61 59 62 66 41 59 61 63 7-30 15 60 73 73 >30 5 60 60 60 Source: VanEck Research as of 12/16/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. In this exercise, we analyzed the average 1, 3, and 6-month returns for BTC after the Altcoin Season Index crossed the 60% threshold. We found that, on average, Bitcoin returns +10%, +30%, and +73% during the proceeding 1, 3, and 6 months after altcoin season begins, respectively. Notably, these returns increase as the duration of the altcoin season indicator increases. As of December 17th, this alt season indicator has been flashing for the past 20 days, suggesting that Bitcoin will perform even more strongly in the 3- to 6-month time horizons following November 27th than it would if the indicator had flashed for less than 7 days. Taking Bitcoin‚Äôs opening price of ~$92k on November 27th, the average 6-month returns of 76% and 81% following medium- to long-term Altcoin Season indicators would imply May 27th, 2025, Bitcoin prices of $161,920 to $166,520 , respectively. This tracks closely with our Bitcoin price target of $180,000 for this cycle. We also measured the historical ‚Äòhit rate‚Äô of Bitcoin‚Äôs price, making positive returns in the 1, 3, and 6-months following the onset of altcoin season indicators. Curiously, with a nearly 75% hit rate, indicators lasting between 7-30 days stand out from those less than a week or more than a month in duration. We believe this is explained by short-lived indicators being triggered more sporadically throughout market cycles, making them less predictive of sustained Bitcoin upside. Keeping in mind their considerably smaller sample size, we believe altcoin season indicators exceeding 30 days could be more reflective of peak market conditions. In contrast, indicators lasting only 7-30 days suggest more room for upside in the following three to six months. Whether the current altcoin season indicator lasts 30+ days or not, these results reinforce our confidence in a diversified crypto rally heading into 2025. Bitcoin Miners This month, we updated our outlook on Bitcoin miners as the investing public and politicians become more aware of the intersections between crypto, AI, and energy.

To begin, we categorized Bitcoin mining companies into three major categories. BTC pure plays are Bitcoin miners who remain committed to maximizing their Bitcoin mining productivity. Opposite of BTC pure plays are so-called ‚ÄúPivotooors,‚Äù colloquially referring to miners who have pivoted some amount of their existing Bitcoin mining capacity towards AI/HPC workloads. The third category, ‚ÄúHOLDers,‚Äù are Bitcoin miners whose Bitcoin holdings comprise 20% or more of the company‚Äôs enterprise value‚Äîan increasingly popular strategy in light of MicroStrategy‚Äôs emergence as a household name for ‚ÄúHOLDing‚Äù Bitcoin like nobody else. After categorizing these miners, we retrospectively analyzed each category‚Äôs average returns over the last one, three, six, and twelve months. Across all time horizons, AI/HPC Pivotooors performed best, HOLDers performed second best, and BTC pure plays performed worst. Given the revenue stability and capital efficiency of AI/HPC workloads, these results make sense. Core Scientific‚Äôs partnership with cloud-computing hyperscaler CoreWeave highlights this trend: by repurposing 700 MW of its 1200 MW of contracted power, Core Scientific expects to earn ~$1.04M per MW annually, delivering predictable, long-term cash flows. By comparison, based on its November production report, we estimate that Core Scientific earned an annualized ~$0.64M per each of its 500 MW dedicated to Bitcoin mining, even at elevated Bitcoin sales prices averaging ~$85k . In contrast, traditional Bitcoin mining faces high capital costs due to constant hardware upgrades, compounded by limited access to cheap credit. This often forces miners to dilute shares to finance operations. By pivoting to AI/HPC infrastructure, miners can achieve more sustainable margins and position themselves for data center REIT-like valuations. Currently, they are trading at ~20‚Äì25x EV/EBITDA, significantly above the multiples of Bitcoin mining alone. As miners diversify into stable, high-margin services, this revaluation potential presents a compelling opportunity for investors. As Bitcoin is up ~153% YTD, it makes sense that HOLDers‚Äîessentially leveraged long BTC‚Äîhave outperformed pure-play miners. However, because this strategy remains undiversified from Bitcoin‚Äôs performance, we do not think it is as viable of a long-term strategy as pivoting into AI/HPC. Lastly, we note that Bitdeer (BTDR), up 108% MoM, is in a category of its own as the only vertically integrated Bitcoin miner in our list. BTDR‚Äôs large and globally diversified power portfolio, ongoing Tier 3 AI/HPC data center pivot, and R&D focus on its Bitcoin mining SEAL chips give the company significant strategic optionality. We believe the future of Bitcoin mining will shift away from standalone facilities, with a growing share of global hashrate coming from operations that utilize excess capacity from anchor tenants like AI/HPC data centers, industrial energy grids, and remote energy production. In such a landscape, the optionality of owning energy, AI/HPC infrastructure, and proprietary chip technology will likely prove more resilient than Bitcoin mining alone.

We examined the enterprise value of Bitcoin miners relative to their current and near-term target energy capacities. Despite its recent gains, we note that RIOT, IREN, BITF, and BTDR appear cheap by this measure. While Bit Digital ( BTBT ) looks expensive, this can be explained by the recent termination of its 36 MW in colocation mining services from Coinmint. Further, because it is not currently under construction, most of BTBT‚Äôs 288 MW expansion pipeline is not reflected in this table and chart. Additionally, the company‚Äôs significant investments in Ethereum staking and AI/HPC infrastructure differentiate it, making this metric less straightforward for assessment.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Bitcoin‚Äôs Network Activity, Adoption, and Fees Daily Inscriptions: Inscriptions transactions surged 134% month-over-month but remain down 52% year-over-year (YoY), suggesting signs of life in speculative onchain activity on Bitcoin. This aligns with broader NFT market enthusiasm, as evidenced by Pudgy Penguins NFTs surpassing $100k this month. Active Supply: The percent of Bitcoin‚Äôs supply active in the past 180 days is up 18% month-over-month (MoM) and 29% YoY, suggesting that elevated prices are waking up dormant wallets. However, supply dormant for 3+ years fell 1% MoM and is only up 10% YoY, suggesting most activity is concentrated among younger wallets. Average Fees: Average fees decreased modestly month-over-month, 11% in USD terms. While they appear to be down significantly YoY, this is due to last December‚Äôs network congestion caused by Bitcoin ordinals and BRC-20s spiking in popularity ahead of bullish ETF sentiment. Global Power Consumption & Mining Difficulty: Global power consumption reached 151 TWh , and mining difficulty rose 8% Month over Month, both hitting all-time highs. This reflects a robust and growing network as miners scale operations to meet rising Bitcoin demand. Total Crypto Equities Market Cap: The total market cap for crypto equities rose 14% MoM to a new all-time high, driven by strong BTC miner revenues, which remain near record levels. Daily BTC miner revenues increased 20% MoM, benefiting from elevated Bitcoin prices.

While DOGE has delivered impressive gains over the past year, the road to $1 is paved with significant hurdles, largely due to its inflationary supply mechanics and high market cap requirements. Currently trading at $0.32, Dogecoin has seen a 21.26% decline in the last week and a 26.51% dip over the past month. However, it remains up by 238.47% year-over-year, showcasing its long-term resilience. Despite the recent decline, DOGE hit a yearly high of $0.46 on December 9, 2024, nearly halfway to the $1 mark. At the time, its market capitalization reached an impressive $68.7 billion, supported by a circulating supply of 147.33 billion DOGE. DOGE YTD price chart. Source: Finbold DOGE supply inflation One of Dogecoin‚Äôs defining characteristics is its fixed yearly issuance of 5 billion DOGE, which introduces a steady inflationary pressure on its price. While this inflation rate decreases over time relative to the growing supply, it still poses a challenge for the coin to achieve higher prices, as an ever-increasing supply requires proportionally higher demand to sustain or boost valuations. For DOGE to reach $1, its market cap would need to exceed $147 billion based on the current circulating supply‚Äîsignificantly more than its previous all-time high market cap of $88.8 billion during its peak price of $0.73 on May 8, 2021. At that time, the circulating supply was significantly smaller, which allowed the price to surge higher with relatively less capital inflow compared to today. If Dogecoin were to achieve its previous all-time high market cap of $88.8 billion with today‚Äôs circulating supply, its price would only reach $0.62, highlighting the direct impact of its inflationary supply dynamics. This means DOGE needs continuous and substantial increases in demand, well beyond historical levels, to sustain or surpass its previous price highs. What would it take for Dogecoin to reach $1? Dogecoin‚Äôs journey to $1 would require an unprecedented level of market interest and adoption. Factors such as increased mainstream adoption, integration into payment systems, and broader utility beyond speculative trading would need to drive consistent demand. Additionally, DOGE would need to outperform other top cryptocurrencies in attracting capital. In the short term, key technical levels to watch include a support zone at $0.2843, which has historically acted as a safety net during price corrections, and a resistance zone at $0.3545, which must be breached to regain bullish momentum. Breaking through these levels is essential for DOGE to make meaningful progress toward its psychological barrier of $1. Can history repeat itself? Dogecoin‚Äôs all-time high of $0.73 in May 2021 was fueled by a combination of social media hype, celebrity endorsements, and retail investor enthusiasm. Replicating such conditions in 2025 would require a similar confluence of factors, coupled with sustained demand from institutional investors and broader use cases. However, with its current inflationary supply dynamics, even if DOGE matched its 2021 market cap, its price would be around 15% lower, underscoring the challenge of regaining or exceeding its previous peak.

However, in the memecoin niche things are a lot worse, with losses amounting to 40-60%. $DOGE, $PEPE, and $BONK are analysed as to their potential recoveries. For the altcoin investor things have been pretty bleak over the last couple of weeks. With Bitcoin ($BTC) struggling to turn its current reversal around , the altcoins have fared worse as usual. However, for those sitting in memecoin positions, the stress of seeing a reduction of at least 40% over the last two weeks must be difficult to bear. Clear support and a bounce for $DOGE Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $DOGE shows a very clear picture. It can be seen that the spectacular rise from $0.08 in early August reached the 0.618 Fibonacci at $0.47 in November. Such a massive price rise really did need a correction, so over the last couple of weeks a dip of 43% did much to help the market absorb the preceding rise. The fact that this dip went down to touch an ascending trendline which began in late 2022 is very bullish. The $DOGE price is currently sitting on strong horizontal support that coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci. Upside target levels are in the chart above. $PEPE buoyed up by strong horizontal support Source: TradingView $PEPE has seen a lot of volatility over recent weeks. A textbook bull flag broke out and the price looked to be heading skyward. However, a consequent dump took the price all the way back to touch and confirm the bottom of the flag. This amounted to a 49% reversal from the top. Currently, the price is starting to climb from the strong horizontal support at $0.000017. If the $PEPE price can climb back out of the flag, bulls would then have to keep their eye on a potential future head and shoulders reversal pattern. If this can be avoided, the all-time high at $0.000028 would be the big target. $BONK bulls need to break the descending trendline Source: TradingView $BONK has suffered worse than most among the major memecoins. A 60% reversal from the all-time high at $0.000062 occurred and it is now up to those bulls to buy the price up so that it can break out of the descending trendline. This is quite likely to happen, given that the correction has already been quite steep. If so, the targets are in the chart above. On the other hand, if the breakdown continues, the ascending bull market trendline would potentially be the last line of support. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The recent bearish drive in the Solana network has scared away investors, pushing them to explore other projects to add to their portfolios. DTX Exchange has cashed the opportunity with mind-blowing gains in its presale, positioned for a 25x breakout soon. Solana update: $190 support could trigger a potential uptrend Solana , on a three-day timeframe, showed potential for a recovery from the $190 price range, marking it as a key support level. SOL saw an upswing after touching this point, indicated by the solid ascending support trendline. This rebound suggested the $190 zone‚Äôs potential as an optimal entry point for long positions in SOL. The pattern of recovery indicated strong buyer interest and support, reinforcing the trendline‚Äôs role in shaping SOL movements. This support could prove crucial for future price dynamics, particularly if Solana continues to rebound and challenge upper resistance levels. With each touch of the trendline followed by upward momentum, the trend signaled growing investor confidence. If this pattern persists, it could set a bullish precedent for Solana. It would position Solana crypto as a lead contender in the next market rally. The continuation of this trendline as a confirmation of Solana‚Äôs market strength provided a strategic advantage for entry or accumulation in anticipation of further price increases. SOL price breakout and bullish MACD outlook Additionally, Solana crypto‚Äôs four-hour chart recently displayed clear signs of upward momentum. A breakout from the descending trendline further added confluence to the pivotal shift, signaling a potential resumption of the uptrend. This was further substantiated by a bullish crossover in the MACD indicators, reinforcing the positive shift in market sentiment. These together justified the $190 level as an ideal entry zone, previously identified as a crucial support area. This breakout and the MACD crossover further affirmed an increased buying interest. Possibly also the start of a sustained upward movement. The convergence of the patterns suggested that Solana could continue its upward trajectory. A sustained movement above this breakout point could confirm the continuation of the trend. These signals were indications of potential market directions. Adjusting strategies accordingly was crucial to take advantage of the emerging opportunities in Solana‚Äôs price action. Furthermore, Solana‚Äôs developments further supported the potential recovery with Sendaifun recently unveiled the Solana Agent Kit. It is an innovative open-source tool designed to integrate AI agents with the Solana blockchain.

Accordingly, the temporary restrictions will be in effect between January 1 and March 15 in 2025, and for a longer period between November 15 and March 15 in subsequent years. Russia's latest mining restrictions are reportedly softer than the first ones proposed in November. The first proposal planned to ban cryptocurrency mining in 13 regions, including Russia's important mining region of Irkutsk. *This is not investment advice.

Their fears are tied to companies threatening to replace their positions with AI. Nonetheless, these anxieties haven‚Äôt caused job seekers to lower their salary demands. The New York Fed asks up to 1,000 people about their employment outlook every quarter. The latest results showed that 4.4% of workers think they might be out of a job within several months. This has hit a record high, particularly the highest number since March 2020, at the outset of the pandemic. However, these job security fears are not enough to deter job seekers from lowering their salary demands. Workers won‚Äôt accept a new role for less than an average of $81,147, a jump of nearly $20,000 since March 2020. This is the so-called reservation wage, the minimal wage some would accept for a new job. AI and economic uncertainty add to workers‚Äô stress Workers‚Äô concerns are not unfounded. It‚Äôs no news that advancements in AI and other economic challenges are threatening people‚Äôs livelihoods. Analysts have described it as the ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù for mass unemployment, as per Korn Ferry‚Äôs recent report . Klarna‚Äôs CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski has also said he hopes AI will replace 1,800 employees one day, and that‚Äôs not too far off. On the other hand, Tech giant Cisco also laid off thousands of employees this year as part of a drive to invest more in AI. Still, most of the workers feel stuck in their jobs. On wages and career opportunities, Fed data shows widespread discontent among women, people without college degrees, and households making less than $60,000 a year. Moreover, some are even demanding higher pay from new employers while they can because there are fewer chances of promotion. More workers are seeking new jobs than during the Great Resignation The job market has become concentrated with challenges now as more people are actively looking for new jobs. The Fed‚Äôs survey shows that 30% of respondents said they were searching for jobs, compared with 19% last summer. That‚Äôs the highest number of job seekers since March 2, 2014, when 32% of professionals were looking for an exit. During the pandemic in March 2021, 4 million US citizens quit their jobs, while 20% of the people in the Fed‚Äôs survey were looking for new workplaces. Workers are currently changing jobs at a record 7.1% rate. As compared to the Great Resignation, only less than 5% of workers switched to new companies.

By 2027, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $3.96. In 2030, FLOW will range between $10.43 to $12.44. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW‚Äôs price movements. Given Flow coin‚Äôs strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.7572 Market Cap $1.17B Trading Volume $90.97M Circulating Supply 1.55B FLOW All-time High $46.16 Apr 05, 2021 All-time Low $0.3921 Sep 12, 2023 24-hour High $0.7822 24-hour Low $0.7137 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $3.04 (228.28%) Volatility 23.17% 50-Day SMA $0.642135 14-Day RSI 80.83 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 76 (Extreme greed) Green Days 18/30 (60%) 200-Day SMA $0.698443 Flow Price Analysis: FLOW Gains Momentum with a 4.33% Daily Increase TL;DR Breakdown Flow experienced a notable 4.33% increase, signalling positive sentiment in the market. Immediate support is $0.7137, while the resistance is $0.7822, which is crucial for short-term trading decisions. The price momentum suggests bullish potential if trading volume sustains current levels or increases further. Flow coin price analysis for December 24th shows it is trading at $0.7572, reflecting a 4.33% increase in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has shown steady upward momentum, with a 24-hour low of $0.7137 and a high of $0.7822, suggesting increased investor confidence. The upward trajectory aligns with bullish sentiment, as trading activity demonstrates consistent buying pressure. Flow‚Äôs current market trends indicate the potential for further gains, provided the momentum holds and key resistance levels are breached. Flow 1-day price chart: FLOW shows signs of consolidation amid bearish pressure Flow trades at $0.7572, reflecting a mild upward movement but remaining below significant resistance levels. The recent price action shows a period of consolidation following a sharp decline earlier in the month. Buyers are gradually regaining control, as evidenced by the slight recovery from the $0.7100 range. However, the overall sentiment still leans cautious, with the price failing to break decisively above key resistance levels near $0.7800, suggesting a potential range-bound movement in the short term. FLOW shows signs of consolidation amid bearish pressure The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line still below the signal line, though the histogram indicates weakening bearish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 41.51, hovering near the oversold region but beginning to show slight upward momentum, reflecting potential buyer interest. These indicators suggest that while the market may recover, bullish strength is not yet confirmed, requiring more sustained buying activity to break through resistance levels. Flow 4-hour price chart: FLOW gathers bullish momentum Flow shows signs of recovery, trading at $0.7572, up 4.33% in the last 4 hours. The price has been steadily climbing from recent lows around $0.7137, indicating a shift in momentum as buyers re-enter the market. Despite facing resistance near $0.7822, the consistent higher lows suggest bullish sentiment is gaining traction. If the upward trajectory continues, Flow could challenge the next resistance around $0.7900, marking a significant breakout point for further upside. FLOW gathers bullish momentum The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 53.65, moving above the neutral 50 level, indicating growing buying pressure without entering overbought territory. These indicators suggest that Flow‚Äôs short-term momentum favours further gains, though traders should watch for potential resistance at higher levels. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $‚ÄØ0.912845 SELL SMA 5 $‚ÄØ1.009528 SELL SMA 10 $‚ÄØ1.050459 SELL SMA 21 $‚ÄØ0.78374 BUY SMA 50 $‚ÄØ0.6421 BUY SMA 100 $‚ÄØ0.6005 BUY SMA 200 $‚ÄØ0.6984 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $‚ÄØ0.903275 SELL EMA 5 $‚ÄØ0.69658 BUY EMA 10 $‚ÄØ0.63134 BUY EMA 21 $‚ÄØ0.59348 BUY EMA 50 $‚ÄØ0.57822 BUY EMA 100 $‚ÄØ0.60201 BUY EMA 200 $‚ÄØ0.6706 BUY What to expect from Flow? Flow has demonstrated positive momentum, with a 4.33% increase in price over the past 24 hours, reaching $0.7572. This upward trend signals growing investor confidence, with a 24-hour low of $0.7137 and a high of $0.7822. The market sentiment remains bullish, and trading volume is critical in sustaining this momentum. Flow may breach key resistance levels if current trends continue, leading to further price gains. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW recover? FLOW can potentially recover if it can break through resistance levels and maintain momentum. The market‚Äôs current consolidation phase suggests a possible breakout, which could either see selling pressure and drive prices higher or lead to further declines.

Despite promises of a December roadmap update on the open mainnet, Pi Network developers remain silent, leaving the community skeptical about further progress. Another Delay Instead of More Clarity Pi Network ‚Äì the controversial cryptocurrency project that claims to enable people to mine digital assets directly from their smartphones ‚Äì saw the light of day more than five years ago. Since then, it has undergone numerous developments, but its mainnet and native token have yet to go live. This has caused frustration across the multi-million Pi Network community, with many members insisting on information regarding those milestones. Earlier this year, the project‚Äôs team said the first big target is the launch of the Open Network, which should be introduced once users pass necessary Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications and migrate to the mainnet (known as the Grace Period). Initially, people had until late September to do so, but later, the period was extended to November 30. It was then moved to New Year‚Äôs Eve, with the team claiming this will provide users with ‚Äúthe ample opportunity to secure their Pi.‚Äù Most recently, the developers behind the project announced another extension. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre extending both KYC and Mainnet Migration Grace Period deadlines to January 31, 2025, to help include more Pioneers and their Pi as we prepare for Open Network in Q1 2025,‚Äù the post on X reads. Somewhat expectedly , many community members were rather annoyed by the latest delay. Some noted that the project has been extending the deadline almost every month, jokingly advising the team to run the Grace Period for a few more years. ‚ÄúExtend it until 2028 instead of month by month. Nobody believes this will actually launch anytime soon. Maybe when the bull run is over,‚Äù one X user stated . Earlier in December, Pi Network maintained that 18 million people have completed Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications, while 8 million have already migrated to the mainnet. The developers also said they could launch the Open Network as early as Q1 2025.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. ETH nears $5,000, Solana rallies on bullish trends, and Lunex Network gains traction with its smart LNEX token and DeFi ecosystem. Table of Contents Lunex Network gains popularity with a native token and ecosystem benefits Ethereum faces potential $5k price following ETF surge Solana may see even bigger gains Conclusion The crypto market is heating up as ETH inches closer to a potential $5,000 milestone. Meanwhile, Solana gears up for a huge rally which is fueled by strong technical indicators and growing confidence among traders. The emerging Lunex Network is also adding to the excitement as it is quickly gaining traction across the entire crypto market. But what exactly makes Lunex Network worth investing in? Let‚Äôs find out. Lunex Network gains popularity with a native token and ecosystem benefits There has been an increasingly bullish gain projection for Lunex Network since it made its way to the crypto scene. This new crypto is projected to go on a parabolic rally, particularly due to its fast-growing ecosystem and huge presale. The major factor responsible for this fast-growing ecosystem is Lunex Network‚Äôs special governance token, called LNEX. With LNEX tokens, investors can enjoy the unique revenue-sharing model on Lunex Network‚Äôs ecosystem. Through this model, holders get the chance to earn passive income when they stake their LNEX tokens. Staking these tokens will enable these holders to earn up to 18% APY. But there‚Äôs more, Lunex Network also uses deflationary tokenomics, which positions LNEX for long-term success in the market. Lunex Network also brings cutting-edge technology to the DeFi space. It appeals to crypto traders who value anonymity, efficiency, security, and high profits. As Lunex Network continues to gain traction, it won‚Äôt be long before its value starts to rival those of market giants in the crypto industry. Ethereum faces potential $5k price following ETF surge Since its launch in July, the BlackRock iShares ETH ETF has attracted $2.6 billion in total inflows . On December 5, it recorded its highest-ever daily inflows, totaling $292 million. As a result, the ETH ETF net inflows went up to over $428 million. The growth of ETH ETF has positively influenced Ethereum , as its price is now hovering around $3,900. From the look of things, ETH could be aiming for a possible breakout to reach all-time highs of $5,000 or more. Investors are hopeful that ETH will take advantage of the current green state of the market to reach the $5k mark as soon as possible. Solana may see even bigger gains Over the past month, the official SOL price has risen by 19.84% from $198 to over $238. Since SOL saw green charts throughout November, many crypto analysts and market chart experts are very optimistic about its growth in December. One analyst in particular, Jelle, made a post on X, where he predicted that SOL will soon reach a new all-time high since its technical analysis charts are showing a bullish trend. SOL is trading above its 30-day EMA ($223) and 50-day EMA ($208). Its bull-bear power is at 2.58, which is in the buy zone and is a huge sign that bulls may continue pushing the official SOL price higher. Conclusion The ongoing market bull run has everyone, especially ETH and SOL investors, excited as they are seeing the market‚Äôs positive influence on their investments. Lunex Network investors are also not left out, as its presale is driving their profits to new levels. For those considering entry, LNEX tokens are still accessible at $0.0038.

More importantly, it stayed in an entire week downtrend for the first time since Trump‚Äôs win in the US election. However, amid the recovery and the crypto market witnessing the Christmas Santa rally, the investors are enthusiastic, but at the same time, the upcoming Bitcoin options expiry is concerning. How Would $14B Bitcoin Options Expiry Affect BTC Price? Bitcoin price is attempting to overcome its recent dip, which pushed the value to $92K, despite hitting the ATH at $108.2k just three days before that. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $93.9k after bearing a 13% drop over the week. However, this might face another volatility pressure, with one of the biggest Bitcoin options expiring events on December 27, 2024. According to the Deribit reports , around $14B worth of Bitcoin options expire on the exchange, which is 44% of the total BTC options OI and the largest expiry in the exchange‚Äôs history. Additionally, 50% of Ethereum options will expire, worth $3.77 billion. Such high expiration could cause crypto market volatility and heavy price swings. The max pain price for the Bitcoin options expiry is $84,000, which means that most contract options will expire worthless, leading to a massive loss for the options buyers. More importantly, this indicates a significant drop from the current levels as the BTC price will move towards $84k. Even further fluctuations could require traders to be extra careful for the next few days, as few analysts are concerned about a temporary drop to $70k. However, this volatility often subsides, with the rising buying pressure, as the whale attempts to buy the dip, eventually helping with recovery. Overall, this will introduce significant fluctuation in the crypto market. Crypto Market Volatility To Take Over Christmas Santa Rally Although the Bitcoin options expiry-induced volatility will last short, many other factors will bring further fluctuations. Based on a few analysts‚Äô predictions, the volatility will be lesser during Christmas but could increase past that, impacting the Christmas Santa rally. As Arthur Hayes‚Äôs price prediction says, Bitcoin price would crash during Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration. Eventually, this could lead to increased crypto market volatility. However, this is nothing compared to the Kobeissi Letter reports, which hint at a possible BTC price drop to $20k on the basis of Bitcoin‚Äôs tendency to follow the trends of global money supply. The analysts have found a correlation between Bitcoin charts and the global monetary supply but with a 10-week lag. This correlation gets further clear, with the Bitcoin price hitting ATH weeks after the global money supply peaked in October at $108.5. Based on that, BTC might drop to $20K as GMS dropped to months low of $104.4 trillion. Meanwhile, altcoins will boom in the current Bitcoin options expiry and further January consolidation, supporting the crypto market recovery. Although altcoins will face a significant downtrend, the recovery will be quick, as the BTC price drop will push investors to altcoins, fueling the altcoin season. How To Tackle The Upcoming Bitcoin Volatility? The crypto market is packed with cryptos that offer heavy returns. In 2024, Bitcoin surpassed the rest after hitting the $108.2k mark, but the status is under threat as the Bitcoin options expiry will challenge its position. With $14B BTC expiring this December 27, the investors will witness significant fluctuations, impacting their trades. However, analysts believes this expiry generated volatility would recover soon, leaving the space for further growth. However, more concerns are awaiting, especially with Trump‚Äôs inauguration in January 2025, as Arthur Hayes and others predict a 20-25% Bitcoin price correction.

Meme Index (MEMEX) , the first-ever decentralized meme coin index, has raised over $280k in its early token presale rounds. As the name suggests, the new project allows investors to benefit from meme coin baskets, created by community votes, rather than individual tokens. Meme Index - Invest In Decentralized Meme Coin Indexes Its whitepaper describes itself as ‚Äúa huge step in the meme coin ecosystem‚Äù, not without any merits. This is the first time investors will be able to benefit from meme coin indexes, created by the MEMEX community. In fact, they will have their pick, considering Meme Index is launching four meme coin baskets, each with a different risk-reward potential. The Meme Titan Index is designed for safe players. The basket will comprise the large caps and the blue chips, with each token likely having a valuation of over $1 billion. However, even the safest meme coins offer outsized returns. With Dogecoin and Pepe likely in this basket, investors choosing it could still earn outsized returns. Next up is the Meme Moonshot Index, featuring the challengers. The basket will include tokens that are likely next to hit the billion-dollar market cap. Considering the upcoming meme coin supercycle, this index could potentially earn significant profits. The Meme Midcap Index is next, including tokens with $50 million to $250 million valuations. Some experts solely invest in such tokens, considering they already have considerable community backing but also have significant potential for upside growth. Binance - and lately Coinbase - have been prioritizing listing meme coins from this bracket. Finally, the Meme Frenzy Index is designed for the degens, those with high-risk appetites and who eye the maximum bounty. The basket will solely include low-cap tokens. Crucially, however, the tokens included will be voted in by the MEMEX community and, therefore, are unlikely to be outright scams. In fact, this index could potentially be one of the safer ways to invest in high-risk high-reward tokens, particularly for retail investors who are always late to the party. These small-scale traders may benefit from projects they never have even heard of, thanks to the power of the community. With market-wide exposure, a plethora of tokens and decentralized governance, it is no surprise why Meme Index has created such a buzz even before its launch. However, only MEMEX holders will be able to vote and access the indexes, hence the high demand for the token. Is MEMEX The Next 10x Crypto Presale? The current market uncertainty hasn‚Äôt shaken the conviction of the bulls - a meme coin supercycle is on the horizon. In such extreme market euphoria, tokens with much less value than Meme Index end up offering over 1000x returns. It is, therefore, no surprise that smart money investors have already started calling MEMEX the next 10x crypto. Others are eyeing much higher returns, owing to the project‚Äôs native staking pool which is currently offering a yield percentage of over 5000%. Besides the meme coin indexes, MEMEX is a token with strong fundamentals. For instance, it has adopted community-centric tokenomics, with no token supply allocation for the developer team or any private sale. A significant 20% of the token supply has been set aside for community rewards, in addition to the 25% supply for staking rewards. However, the attractive perks don‚Äôt mean that Meme Index has compromised with safety and transparency. For starters, the MEMEX smart contract has been audited by Coinsult and Solid Proof , with the audit reports available on the presale website. Interested buyers can purchase MEMEX with just a few clicks, using the over-the-counter widget on the Meme Index presale website. They are also advised to follow the project‚Äôs X and Telegram accounts to keep up with the latest updates.

Is that a catastrophe?,https://crypto.news/blackrock-bought-1-billion-worth-of-btc-right-on/,"BlackRock, the world‚Äôs leading asset management company, reportedly spent $1 billion on bitcoins just on the eve of the sharp decline of the BTC price. The latter was triggered by the Fed Chair‚Äôs announcement of the change of pace for rates cut. The announcement was accompanied by statements that dropped a shadow on the strategic Bitcoin reserve plans. üìâ Bitcoin's price correction continues into Friday, Dec. 20! üá∫üá∏ The leading crypto has dropped over 13% in just 48 hours, falling from an all-time high of $108,364.üíî This significant market shift is largely due to the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù 0.25% rate cut and‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) December 20, 2024 December 18, 2024, will be remembered as the day when the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell set the crypto market on fire with a couple of phrases. The Fed, to the surprise of many, proposed a reduction of the rate cuts for 2025: there will be two interest rate cuts the next year instead of four, as was expected before. The lower interest rates are usually fueling the crypto market. Therefore, the rate cut reduction is a bearish signal. On top of that, Powell said the central bank is not allowed and is not even interested in holding any Bitcoin ( BTC ). Read more: Powell: Fed not allowed to own Bitcoin Several experts call the federal funds rates cutting by 25 basis points ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù or even ‚Äúaggressive.‚Äù The move caused a panic sale on the crypto market. Bitcoin dropped by 13% within 48 hours. Many altcoins saw even a harsher price drop: Dogecoin lost 26%, Ether declined by 16%, while XRP was down by 18%. The CoinGlass data indicates that over 1.4 billion dollars in leveraged long positions have been liquidated within a single day. Stock markets saw a substantial drop, too. Was a one-billion-dollar BlackRock investment in Bitcoin a fatal mistake? One may think that buying $1 billion worth of BTC one day before the dip would have been a catastrophe. However, we can take the example of BlackRock and see how such unfortunate timing for a massive buy-in may not be deadly in the long term. According to Arkham, BlackRock spent $1.5 billion on bitcoins within the week. A $1 billion investment in Bitcoin was made just before the dip at the price between $103k and $107k, meaning that the company purchased nearly 10,000 BTC. As of December 20, BlackRock owns over 553,000 BTC, which is around 2.6% of the total supply of Bitcoin. This investment was a 1.8% increase in the total IBIT (BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust) BTC holdings. According to the latest data from Fintel , the total holdings of BlackRock are valued at $4.7 trillion. However, other sources estimate the BlackRock holdings at over $11 trillion. The Bitcoin share of these holdings is pretty tiny, which is in line with the recent BlackRock recommendation to allocate up to 2% of Bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio to hedge against market turbulence. It is clear that missing a better buying opportunity that occurred the day after, when the BTC price slipped under $93,000, was unfortunate. However, the value of the overall BlackRock portfolio is high enough to absorb this drop in value without much drama. Considering how many times Bitcoin was ‚Äúcrashing‚Äù only to recover at a higher value, this price downfall is negligible. What matters more is the fact of acquiring more bitcoins, which continue to grow in value and get scarcer with time. BlackRock and the Bitcoin scarcity discussion It seems that BlackRock is the prime beneficiary of Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity. Interestingly enough, it was BlackRock who sparked the online debate about the immutability of the famous Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million hard caps. JUST IN: BlackRock releases 3 minute educational video explaining what #Bitcoin is. pic.twitter.com/EjqBbV0GRn ‚Äî Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2024 On December 18, BlackRock released a 3-minute-long educational video explaining the basics of Bitcoin. At some point in the video, we can see the subtitle that reads, ‚ÄúThere is no guarantee that Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million supply cap will not be changed.‚Äù This little remark did not go unnoticed by the crypto enthusiasts and professionals. The Bitcoin historian and the Gorilla Pool founder Kurt Wuckert Jr. took to X to raise the question about possible reasons that made BlackRock ‚Äúlube up the idea of adding inflation.‚Äù The removal of the 21 million supply cap is not impossible. The Bitcoin community can do it through a hard fork. However, the implications of such a move can shake the future sustainability of the first cryptocurrency. At large, Bitcoin security owes to the incentivization of the miners. However, if Bitcoin scarcity is not a thing anymore, the reward value may drop, making the network less protected and more vulnerable. Several users replied to Wuckert that they see the mention of the potential removal of the hard cap as a formal disclaimer made to avoid lawsuits in the event Bitcoin becomes inflationary. Others voiced the opinion that the forked Bitcoin that won‚Äôt have a 21 million limit will rather be something else and not a Bitcoin, while the hardcore community will stick with the original version. Conclusion BlackRock is willing to experiment with the relatively new asset. No matter how much of the entire BTC supply is already owned by this company, it won‚Äôt risk investing in it more than it can afford to lose, and the recent buy-in is just another purchase made by a corporation that definitely sees the value in Bitcoin itself.

At this point, Binance warned its users about the altcoin called IOTA, announcing that it has switched to the new token-economy model. Binance stated that after the new model, the total supply and circulating supply of IOTA will increase significantly and that a risk warning for IOATA will be included on the transaction page. ‚ÄúThe total supply and circulating supply for IOTA (IOTA) will increase significantly. Users will also be shown a risk warning pop-up and banner on the Binance trading page.‚Äù In the official statement made by the IOTA team, it was stated that IOTA will switch to a new tokenomic model called ‚ÄúIOTA Rebased‚Äù. With this new model, IOTA will offer a sustainable token economy model with an annual inflation rate of 6% (767,000 IOTA per block). Accordingly, it is planned to produce 767,000 IOTA per epoch with an annual inflation rate of 6% on the network. It was stated that in this new model where staking rewards will be offered, transaction fees will be kept low and the transaction fee is planned to be approximately 0.005 IOTA. IOTA, which experienced a slight decline after the Binance announcement, continues to be traded at $0.31. *This is not investment advice.

Thus, asking if your money is safe isn‚Äôt the way to go. Instead, you could go to a regulated exchange to ensure your investment is safe and take specific steps. A fully regulated exchange is more than an aid to alleviate potential scams; it is THE tool within your trading toolbox that makes or breaks your gains. Thus, one of the most talked about crypto exchanges, Levex , secured an MSB license from FINTRAC, allowing it to operate legally in Canada. Levex Gets Regulatory Green Light in Canada As mentioned, a crypto exchange needs to be fully regulated to ensure users‚Äô trust and, most importantly, to be available in various countries. For example, Levex has now obtained the Money Services Business (MSB) license from Canada‚Äôs FINTRAC, giving it a green light to operate in Canada. This achievement highlights Levex‚Äôs constant efforts to establish itself as a compliant and reliable platform while adhering to Canada‚Äôs strict anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards. If you‚Äôre curious about why getting an MSB license from FINTRAC is so impactful, it‚Äôs because this certification is essential in regulating financial activities. The truth is that without an MSB license in Canada, businesses cannot offer key financial services like currency exchange, money transfers, and virtual currency transactions. As a result, the MSB license also guarantees Levex FINTRAC, the governing body enforcing these regulations, ensures licensed companies uphold strict rules to protect the financial system from unlawful practices. For Canadian users, this license signals a new confidence level in Levex‚Äôs platform, underscoring the company‚Äôs devotion to creating a safe and transparent environment for virtual currency transactions while meeting the country‚Äôs rigorous regulatory demands. So, considering this outstanding achievement, Levex is set to lead as a trusted and steadfast crypto exchange in the Canadian market. A Vision for the Future The MSB license marks Levex‚Äôs first step into operating as a licensed company in North America, but it‚Äôs just the commencement. The company plans to build on this victory by growing its global presence and offering more services, all while working closely with regulators in additional countries to guarantee compliance. Levex seeks to prove itself as a world leader in crypto trading, delivering innovative solutions that meet users‚Äô needs worldwide. The organization is also dedicated to extending the crypto trading experience, focusing on compliance and security and assuring customer satisfaction. Looking forward, Levex visualizes a future where cutting-edge technologies make crypto trading more accessible, safer, and efficient for everyone, regardless of their experience level. They‚Äôre committed to staying ahead of industry trends and improving their platform to offer users the best tools. By preserving a strong focus on user trust and confidence, Levex plans to create an ecosystem where users can trade digital assets with peace of mind, knowing a transparent, reliable, and forward-thinking exchange supports them. Regulated and More Than That Besides its current achievement of securing a license to operate in Canada, Levex has much more to show. The platform is developed to make crypto trading easy and accessible for everyone, whether you‚Äôre just starting or a professional trader. Levex provides a secure and user-friendly environment. It supports various cryptocurrencies and offers options for spot trading and derivatives. The platform‚Äôs simplicity ensures users can trade easily, regardless of their experience level.

Initially, NEIRO will have official cross-chain versions on Ethereum and Base. Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO), one of the more widely distributed meme tokens, will partner with ChainLink ( LINK ) for its multi-chain presence. ChainLink‚Äôs Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) replaces bridges, which are one of the riskier smart contracts. Neiro on Ethereum follows the example of Ronin, which will also replace its main bridge with CCIP. Neiro has now upgraded to the @chainlink standard for cross-chain interoperability across @base and @ethereum ! By upgrading NEIRO to the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard via Chainlink CCIP, we can expand our reach across the multi-chain ecosystem. https://t.co/EJGnh50O86 pic.twitter.com/0LG7Or898N ‚Äî Neiro On Ethereum (@NeiroOnEthereum) December 23, 2024 ChainLink will offer reliable oracle information for NEIRO trading on-chain. The asset will now build a presence on both Ethereum and Base, reaching a wider user base. With this move, NEIRO will compete with its other versions, such as the community-owned NEIRO. For CCIP, the tokenless Base blockchain is the main source of fees. CCIP also connects the main L2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism, as well as other L1 protocols, BSC and Avalanche. CCIP is making one of its first forays into meme tokens, which are usually merely recreated on the new chain, or bridged through existing smart contracts. NEIRO on Ethereum, however, will have to compete with a total of seven existing Base tokens with a similar ticker. The token has a setup that may allow it to stage a breakout, but it may face headwinds in the meme space. NEIRO on Ethereum may have to rebuild its appeal, as some of the big whales divested fully in November. NEIRO still traded on DEXs, dependent on oracle data This version of Neiro on Ethereum is in need of oracle price information, as most of its trades go through Uniswap and other DEXs. NEIRO on Ethereum lacks a Binance spot pair, though it has a derivative perpetual futures market. The token retains its usual range of owners, spreading across 21,352 wallets. With that number, NEIRO lags behind other hyped-up memes, which accrued larger user bases much faster. However, NEIRO had more time to establish its brand and liquidity, sparking hopes of becoming a long-lasting meme. The competing token, NEIRO, still has above 21K holders, plus a spot pair on Binance. This asset is strictly running on Ethereum, though it now relies on Binance for more than 30% of its trading activity. NEIRO on Ethereum is still lagging, with a total $43M market capitalization, about 10% of the community version, due to low supply. The ChainLink partnership may boost FOMO for this asset while raising it to the ranks of top tokens. The current competitive game among memes is for those that easily achieved $500M in notional value, with a bid to rise to $1B. At this stage, NEIRO‚Äôs partnerships may be an effort to regain visibility and appeal. Whale wallets still control NEIRO NEIRO started out with the reputation of a cabal coin. Even after months of trading, the Wintermute market maker controls 12.06% of the total supply, becoming the third-biggest wallet. NEIRO is held in connected wallets, with a significant share accumulated by Wintermute. | Source: Bubblemaps In addition to Wintermute, the supply of NEIRO is held in connected wallets, which may trade as hidden whales. Wintermute has been accumulating the token for months, doubling its holdings since September. The token now awaits more listings and representation, as the Wintermute wallets remain inactive for now in preparation for potential high-velocity trading. The shift of NEIRO to Base will appeal to another class of users, as the chain was marketed for its fun aspect with low fees. The NEIRO on Ethereum version competes with multiple other similar copies of the meme, which have achieved greater organic growth. For now, NEIRO has gone down a more curated path, though still requiring long-term holding from its community. A NEIRO breakout is made more difficult due to the confusion and lack of recognition of this specific token. The NEIRO on Ethereum community also weighed the coin down, as they were losing patience in absorbing losses while watching other meme tokens. NEIRO on Ethereum is not yet a cult, though it has focused on long-term holding.

The ETF sector has hit a snag with two leveraged funds tied to MicroStrategy‚Äôs volatile stock. These funds, built to deliver double the daily returns of MicroStrategy shares, are instead giving investors unexpected results. The T-Rex 2x Long MSTR Daily Target ETF (MSTU) and Defiance‚Äôs Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF (MSTX) have seen their performances deviate wildly from expectations in recent weeks. On November 21, MSTU dropped 25.3%, according to FactSet data . That‚Äôs bad, but it should have been worse‚ÄîMicroStrategy‚Äôs stock fell 16%, meaning the fund should have dropped by 32%. A rare win for investors. But four days later, the tables turned. MSTU lost 11.3%, while MicroStrategy shares dipped just 4.4%. That‚Äôs nearly three percentage points worse than the fund‚Äôs promised performance. MSTX didn‚Äôt fare any better, losing 13.4% that same day‚Äîfar off target. The problem with size and swaps Before November, these ETFs were doing exactly what they were designed to do. But by mid-November, cracks started to appear. The funds have become too big, plain and simple. Enthusiasm for MicroStrategy‚Äîand by extension, Bitcoin‚Äîskyrocketed after Trump‚Äôs presidential victory, turning these ETFs into massive players almost overnight. Both funds are supposed to track MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock performance using tools like swaps. Swaps are straightforward. A broker pays the daily return of an asset to the fund, minus a fee, ensuring precision. But here‚Äôs the catch: MSTU is managing $2-$3 billion in daily assets, and MSTX isn‚Äôt far behind. Prime brokers can‚Äôt keep up, and the supply of swaps is drying up. With swaps maxed out, the funds turned to call options. Call options give the right to buy an asset at a specific price within a certain time. They‚Äôre a decent backup, but they don‚Äôt deliver the same accuracy as swaps. Defiance ETFs CEO Sylvia Jablonski defended the move to options, calling it efficient for achieving leverage. But critics like Dave Mazza of Roundhill Investments, argue otherwise. Options are unpredictable, especially for a stock as volatile as MicroStrategy. Mazza pointed out that these ETFs now hold exposure worth over 10% of MicroStrategy‚Äôs market cap. That‚Äôs unheard of in the ETF world. ‚ÄúMicroStrategy is too small to handle this level of trading volume and assets under management,‚Äù he said. Leveraged chaos meets Bitcoin hype MicroStrategy has gone from a software company to a full-blown Bitcoin proxy. The company holds $43 billion worth of Bitcoin, bought with mountains of debt. This year alone, its stock has surged 430%. Investors looking to amplify their exposure to Bitcoin have swarmed MSTU and MSTX, pushing these funds to their limits. When these ETFs grew too big, they hit a wall. The supply of swaps dried up, and fund managers had no choice but to rely on options. This kept the funds alive, but it introduced massive tracking errors. Kenneth Lamont of Morningstar compared the situation to past ETF disasters, like the 3x Tesla ETP by Leverage Shares. That fund couldn‚Äôt borrow enough shares to meet demand, leading to performance issues. Similarly, BlackRock had to overhaul its iShares Global Clean Energy ETF in 2020 after a surge in assets forced a complete portfolio redesign. Lamont called the MicroStrategy ETF situation ‚Äúa stuttering engine.‚Äù Rapid growth, he said, often reveals hidden flaws. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) discourages ETFs from closing to new investors, even when they run out of swaps. But Kashner suggested that stopping new unit creations could solve the problem. This would effectively turn the ETFs into closed-end funds, where prices and net asset values don‚Äôt always align. ‚ÄúFund companies must choose between growth and accuracy, and they‚Äôve clearly prioritized growth,‚Äù she said.

This is the first time RLUSD is available on a Singapore-based exchange, and it‚Äôs already making waves. The stablecoin can now be traded against both the Singapore dollar (SGD) and the US dollar (USD), opening up new opportunities for both traders and businesses in the region. Ripple Partnership with IR This launch is not just another addition to the growing list of stablecoins. It highlights Ripple‚Äôs strategic partnership with Independent Reserve, which has been a key player in the Asian crypto market . The CEO of Independent Reserve, Lasanka Perera, mentioned that RLUSD is an important addition to the global crypto market . It offers better liquidity and is designed to meet the growing need for stable digital currencies that can be used for cross-border payments and decentralized finance (DeFi). Independent Reserve is the first #crypto exchange in #Singapore to list #stablecoin Ripple USD (RLUSD)! IR #SG customers can trade #RLUSD in #SGD & #USD on our order book and OTC desk.

RLUSD Compaibitly With XRP & ETH One of the standout features of RLUSD is its compatibility with two major blockchain networks, XRP Ledger and Ethereum. This dual issuance allows allows Ripple to take advantage of Ethereum‚Äôs large DeFi market, while also benefiting from XRP‚Äôs fast and efficient system for international transactions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For December 24 , Market Reaction For RLUSD RLUSD‚Äôs official launch comes just a week after its global debut on December 16 , 2024, and it‚Äôs already having a noticeable effect on the market.

The growing interest from XRP whales‚Äîlarge investors‚Äîcan be seen in the increase in XRP Futures open interest. This suggests that big players in the market are paying attention to Ripple‚Äôs move.

Despite the current market sentiment, XRP is witnessing increasing buying pressure from whales, a key factor likely to spur price growth. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.24, having rallied over 1% in the last 24 hours. Over the past seven days, the Ripple -affiliated token has plunged almost 17%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold A review of on-chain metrics shared by prominent analyst Ali Martinez on December 24 indicates that XRP whales acquired 40 million tokens within 24 hours. XRP whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts Indeed, this buying pressure comes as a major vote of confidence for XRP, especially considering the token has recently faced sustained selling pressure. For instance, as reported by Finbold on December 19, XRP recorded a $7 billion outflow in capital in a single day, mirroring the general market trend. XRP price prediction If history repeats itself, XRP could be gearing up for a potential upward move, as large-scale accumulation by whales has often preceded price growth. Regarding potential price action, Finbold turned to OpenAI‚Äôs artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o , for insights into how the asset might trade amid the current investor interest. According to the AI tool, the impact of whale accumulation would likely take effect within a week and could be influenced by external factors such as overall market sentiment. Over the next 24 to 48 hours, the whale transactions and increased buying pressure may push the price to $2.30 to $2.40. The platform further noted that sustained buying momentum within three to five days could drive XRP to trade between $2.50 and $2.60, with potential consolidation at those levels. If bullish sentiment continues, XRP may challenge the $2.75 and $3 resistance zones within a week, provided no adverse market events occur. Conversely, in a bearish scenario, the price could retrace and stabilize around $2.15 to $2.20. XRP price prediction. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold Away from whale activity, XRP remains susceptible to market trends, with elements such as the Ripple and Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) case being a key influence. Notably, part of XRP‚Äôs recent breakout from prolonged consolidation below $1 was driven by the news of Gary Gensler‚Äôs exit from the SEC. What next for XRP As things stand, XRP investors hope for further upward movement if the asset maintains its valuation above the $2 support level. The token recently saw significant capital outflows that pushed it below this critical mark. XRP could rally further, as it is trading above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $1.61 and the 200-day SMA of $0.81, pointing to possible bullish sentiment in the short and long term. Elsewhere, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ), currently at 55.19, lies in the neutral zone but leans slightly bullish, suggesting that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. This leaves room for further price movement depending on shifts in market sentiment.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, scammers are posing as naive crypto users by posting seed phrases in YouTube comments, luring victims into a cleverly orchestrated trap. In a December 23 blog post , Kaspersky analyst Mikhail Sytnik detailed the scheme. Comments left on finance-related videos often appear as innocent queries about transferring Tether (USDT) between wallets. These comments include seed phrases to a bait wallet containing $8,000 in USDT on the Tron network. The catch? To access the funds, an opportunist must first deposit a small amount of TRON (TRX), the network‚Äôs native token, to cover transaction fees. However, any TRX sent to the bait wallet is immediately rerouted to another wallet controlled by the scammers. Multisignature Wallets Add to the Trap What makes this scam particularly deceptive is the bait wallet‚Äôs configuration as a multisignature wallet. These wallets require approvals from multiple parties for outgoing transactions. Even after paying the transaction fees, would-be thieves find themselves unable to move the USDT, as they lack the necessary approvals. ‚ÄúThis scheme essentially flips the script,‚Äù Sytnik explained. ‚ÄúScammers are targeting other scammers in a digital Robin Hood-like fashion, exploiting their greed for personal gain.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the first time crypto scams have turned on each other. In July, Kaspersky uncovered a more elaborate operation that lured victims via Telegram links leading to legitimate crypto exchanges . The trap included files that, when accessed, installed malware designed to siphon off data and digital assets. Rising Crypto Scam Cases Kaspersky‚Äôs Sytnik advised users to steer clear of accessing others‚Äô crypto wallets, even if offered a seed phrase. ‚ÄúThe risks far outweigh the potential rewards,‚Äù he cautioned. He also urged crypto enthusiasts to remain skeptical of strangers‚Äô claims online, particularly those involving too-good-to-be-true opportunities. This serves as a stark reminder of the ever-evolving scam tactics in the crypto space , where greed often meets ingenuity. As Sytnik concluded, staying vigilant and ethical is the best defense against falling victim to these schemes.

This event could introduce additional selling pressure, a common trend with newly launched tokens like $EIGEN, $ENA, and $MOCA. Investors should closely monitor this timeline as post-unlock periods often see increased volatility and significant price drops. That said, it‚Äôs worth noting that not all token unlocks result in declines. Some market makers have previously managed to defy expectations and sustain or even push prices higher, as seen with $APT. For now, $EIGEN holders should brace for potential turbulence while keeping an eye on market activity during the token unlock period. Understanding market dynamics and whale behavior remains crucial for navigating this highly volatile asset. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

As a result, these levels have become one of the pivotal levels to secure that could pave the way for the price to reclaim $100K at the earliest. While the technicals do not suggest a quick rebound, the bullish market sentiments suggest the price is expected to revive a strong rebound in a short while from now. The short-term price action of Bitcoin displays a constant formation of lower lows and highs that indicates the growing strength of bears.The price has also broken down from the rising parallel channel, which validates bearish claims. However, after displaying a fake breakout, the price may trap the bears at the lows as a major trend reversal is about to be stabilized as market participants continue to accumulate instead of panic selling. As per the Glassnode data shared by analyst Ali , the rise in the accumulation trend score suggests a strong buying interest among the market participants. The levels have been on constant rise since the November breakout; however, the recent sell-off has sparked some distribution. However, the levels remain within the bullish range and hence a rebound seems to be imminent. What‚Äôs next? Will BTC price Reclaim $100K Before the End of 2024? Although the BTC price has broken down from the bullish range, the token continues to trade within a bullish range. This indicates a flip could be on the horizon as the bulls are defending the support at $92,100 firmly for over a month. Now that the token has approached the last few days of the year, the bulls are expected to gain a huge dominance and revive a strong upswing soon. As seen in the above chart, the BTC price has broken the support of the rising parallel channel, which has circulated bearish waves. Even though the buying volume over the token remains around the average range, the impact of this is not seen as the price remains within the restrictive range. Besides, the DMI seems to be heading for a bearish crossover with the ADX heading towards the lower ranges. Additionally, the OBV, the balance-based indicator, maintains a consolidated descending trend, suggesting the trend is slowly shifting from bullish to bearish. The technicals suggest a pullback to the support at $92,000 at the moment, and if it rebound from this range, the BTC price may reclaim $100K; otherwise, a drop below $90,000 could be imminent.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 13:48:16

In a post on the social media platform X, Kiyosaki addressed the concerns of Bitcoin investors who are lamenting its falling value. ‚ÄúBoo Hoo Boo Hoo: BITCOIN CRY BABIES crying about Bitcoin prices dropping down. Rather than say ‚ÄòThank you‚Äô and buying more ‚ÄòBitcoins‚Äô‚Ä¶..cry babies cry,‚Äù Kiyosaki wrote. ‚ÄúBuy buy buy not cry cry cry.

The author, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, has frequently touted the crypto as a hedge against inflation, severally calling it ‚Äúdigital gold.‚Äù Kiyosaki‚Äôs unyielding optimism for Bitcoin despite recent setbacks Earlier this year, Kiyosaki made headlines by forecasting that Bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2030, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the ambitious nature of his claim, his optimism has not been tempered by the cryptocurrency‚Äôs failure to meet his earlier projections. In 2023, Kiyosaki predicted that Bitcoin would surpass $350,000 by August, a forecast that did not materialize. Nonetheless, he remains confident in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential, insisting that market corrections and price fluctuations are part of the asset‚Äôs inherent volatility. He praised Bitcoin‚Äôs design, which he believes is ‚Äúdesigned to make everyone rich,‚Äù even for those who have entered the market late. ‚ÄúIt is never too late to start‚Ä¶regardless of how high Bitcoin price goes,‚Äù Kiyosaki stated when Bitcoin was trading above $100,000 last week. Buy Bitcoin, gold, silver, be smart: Kiyosaki Kiyosaki has also issued warnings about the state of the global economy, predicting a major market crash and the onset of a ‚Äúdepression‚Äù phase. Global crash has started. Europe, China. USA going down . Depression ahead? Please be smarter with your money. Hang on to your job and your money. Biggest problem are our leaders and educators. As I have often asked ‚ÄúWhat did school teach you about money?‚Äù Regardless of‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 23, 2024 He has advised his followers to focus on accumulating tangible assets such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin rather than holding paper money, which he believes is increasingly vulnerable in today‚Äôs unstable financial climate. ‚ÄúPlease be smarter with your money. Hang on to your job and your money,‚Äù Kiyosaki urged. ‚ÄúFor many people, crashes are the best times to get rich. I plan on getting richer. I want you to get richer and smarter, too.‚Äù This rhetoric is consistent with Kiyosaki‚Äôs long-standing view that fiat currencies, especially the US dollar, are subject to inflation and loss of value. While Kiyosaki‚Äôs message remains one of optimism, he has also cautioned his followers not to get too greedy in their Bitcoin investments. Despite his advice to buy the dip, he urged restraint, saying, ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt get greedy.‚Äù Bitcoin price mirrors market weakness Bitcoin‚Äôs recent struggles highlight the broader challenges facing the cryptocurrency market, with significant volatility and institutional caution playing a role in the asset‚Äôs current state. The ongoing bearish trend has led many to reassess their positions, At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $93,990, having lost the key $94,000 support level. This drop has contributed to a wave of market-wide crypto liquidations totaling $242.21 million, according to Coinglass data . Notably, the split between long and short liquidations has narrowed, with long-side liquidations totaling $128.98 million and short-side liquidations accounting for $113.28 million. The market has been marked by a lack of institutional support for Bitcoin, as evidenced by the daily net outflow for US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which remains at $226.56 million. While BlackRock has continued to buy into Bitcoin with an inflow of $31.66 million, other major players, such as Fidelity, have seen significant outflows, including $145.97 million in redemptions.

Hayes‚Äô activity offers insight into the strategies of major players in the crypto market. While taking profits from a substantial portion of his holdings, his decision to keep nearly half of his original ENA stash staked signals a balanced approach to both risk and opportunity. Investors in ENA and similar tokens should take note of whale activity like this, as it often precedes significant market movements. For now, all eyes are on Hayes‚Äô next moves and ENA‚Äôs price trajectory in the coming weeks. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

SHIB price comeback will be supported by its futures open interest and the NPL indicator, which points to capitulation. Shiba Inu Price To Be Boosted By Shibarium Growth Shiba Inu price was trading at $0.00002225 on Tuesday, much lower than this month‚Äôs high of $0.000033. Shibarium, the layer 2 network it launched earlier this year, could be a potential catalyst for the SHIB price. According to Shibarium Scan , the network has continued doing well even as the mood in the crypto industry worsened. The number of addresses in the network has jumped and crossed the 2.02 million milestone , a sign that it is thriving. Also, the number of completed transactions in Shibarium have risen to over 692 million, a sign that they will cross the 700 million level in the next few weeks. Shibarium‚Äôs network growth is a good thing for Shiba Inu price because some of the fees made in the ecosystem contribute to its burn rate. Data by ShibBurn shows that the SHIB‚Äôs burn rate has jumped after Shibarium‚Äôs launch. Leading Indicators Point to a Rebound Some popular leading indicator predict that the Shiba Inu price will recover. First, Shiba Inu‚Äôs open interest in the futures market has dropped to a monthly low. In most cases, a cryptocurrency‚Äôs rally starts when the interest is low. For example, the value of SHIB rose by 75% since the open interest bottomed at $38 million on November 6. Shiba Inu Open Interest Second, another data shows that the realized profit/loss indicator points to the biggest capitulation in over a month. That is a sign that some investors selling the coin at a loss has increased, which is often seen as a positive catalyst. Shiba Inu PNL Data Another data by Santiment shows that the number of active Shiba Inu addresses has dropped from this month‚Äôs high of 239,000 to the current 197,000. Cryptocurrencies often rebound when there is capitulation and when many short-term holders ‚Äì speculators ‚Äì are selling. Shiba Inu Price Hammer Points To A Rebound A quick look at SHIB does not inspire confidence that the token will rebound since it has even crashed below the 50-day moving average. On the positive side, Shiba Inu has formed a hammer candlestick pattern comprising a small body and a long lower shadow. A hammer is one of the best reversal candlestick patterns. The coin has also found substantial support along the ascending trendline that links the lowest levels since August. Therefore, a move above the 50-day MA will confirm a bullish breakout. It will point to a rally to $0.00003380, 50% above the current level. Shiba Inu Price Chart A drop below the ascending trendline at $0.000019 will invalidate the bullish view and point to more down movements.

MATIC/USDT Chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, MATIC‚Äôs price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.4598, resulting in a correction to $0.4095. Is MATIC a good investment? MATIC token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is Matic price down today? Following an intense sell off around $0.64, MATIC‚Äôs price failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a break below immediate Fib channels. Will MATIC price touch $1? Yes, Matic price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2024. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will MATIC Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and MATIC gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is MATIC a good long-term investment?

However, Polygon‚Äôs Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $1.34. It‚Äôs anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

According to the forecast and technical analysis, Polygon‚Äôs price is expected to hit a minimum of $2.07 in 2026. The maximum price projection is $2.39, with an average value of $2.12.

Despite a -28.84% drop in the last week, the coin has gained over 42% in the past 6 months, showing strong long-term potential. Technical indicators like RSI at 41.32 and Stochastic at 33.72 suggest that AVAX is nearing oversold levels, which could lead to increased buying interest. The price is close to the 10-day simple moving average of $36.59, and a break above the nearest resistance at $59 could signal a robust uptrend. If momentum continues, AVAX might target the second resistance at $77.40, offering significant upside from current levels. With altcoin season on the horizon, AVAX could be set for impressive growth. Chainlink Poised for Breakout Amid Bullish Market Signals Chainlink is showing promising signs in the market. Despite a recent weekly dip of over 23%, the coin has seen a strong monthly increase and an impressive rise over the past six months. The current price is close to its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating potential stability before a move. The Relative Strength Index is around the middle range, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. If Chainlink can surpass the nearest resistance level at $35, it may aim for the next resistance at $46, potentially doubling from current levels. These factors suggest a possible upward trend in the near future. Conclusion AVAX and LINK show less short-term potential, leading investors to DOGEN. This meme token for those seeking luxury and success expects 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with potential for huge returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits and perks for early adopters.

Synthetix price analysis gives out a highly bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has recovered up to a $2,230 high over the past 24 hours. Side by side, the cryptocurrency has gained a major 12.57% of its value during the day. Green candlesticks on the one-day price charts refer to an upward momentum. Technical indicators are giving out a negative signal with regards to the current price movements. However, the price charts continue to exhibit a bullish overview of the market. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan‚Äôs SNX price predictions from 2024 to 2030. It is expected that SNX will reach $44 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is under bullish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is encouraging that SNX is one of the best performers and has moved above its average since November 24, 2024. The SNX price has increased to $2.230; moreover, it has gained up to 12.57% of its value since the last 24 hours Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if RSI returns from the oversold zone, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2026. Will SNX reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan‚Äôs price prediction, SNX will reach the $10 level by the fourth quarter of 2026. The last time SNX was seen at the $10 level was November 2021. Will SNX reach $100? According to Cryptopolitan‚Äôs price prediction, SNX may not reach this level in the next ten years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like $100 too far-fetched. Does SNX have a good long-term Future? SNX is nearing an oversold position, which means the token is undervalued compared to its actual worth, which makes it a perfect time for buyers to enter the market. Considering the low price and a good future evaluation of $23 by the end of 2030, the asset is worth buying.

JasmyCoin (JASMY) JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency developed by Jasmy Corporation, an Internet of Things (IoT) provider based in Tokyo. The Jasmy platform aims to restore and protect individual data sovereignty by integrating IoT technology with blockchain. It connects service providers and data users, allowing users full control over their personal information. The platform enables secure data exchange between IoT devices such as computers, cars, and phones, and decentralized protocols. By utilizing edge computing and storing data on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Jasmy decentralizes data workflow, ensuring data is securely protected and owned by individuals. Service providers can access user-owned data to promote their services while respecting data ownership. Jasmy provides a powerful infrastructure, intuitive interface, and a secure environment for storing and sharing data, transforming information into personal assets. In the current market cycle, JasmyCoin‚Äôs focus on data sovereignty and secure IoT integration may appeal to those interested in blockchain solutions for data privacy and security. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, Kaspa‚Äôs GHOSTDAG allows multiple blocks created in parallel to coexist and orders them in consensus, forming a blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of a single chain. This enables the network to handle high block rates, currently achieving one block per second with goals to increase to 10 and eventually 100 blocks per second. Kaspa includes features like Reachability for querying the DAG‚Äôs topology, block data pruning, SPV proofs, and planned subnetwork support to facilitate future layer 2 solutions. Kaspa‚Äôs technology aims to address scalability issues in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies by enabling rapid block generation and confirmation times primarily influenced by internet latency. The use of blockDAG and GHOSTDAG protocol enhances network throughput while maintaining security. This novel approach presents potential for increased scalability and efficiency in the cryptocurrency space. The attractiveness of KAS in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market conditions and technological adoption. Kaspa‚Äôs focus on high-speed transactions and scalability may be of interest to those monitoring advancements in blockchain technology. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Initially, TRX tokens were ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network, but in 2018 they moved to their own blockchain. The platform was created to give full ownership rights to digital content creators. It aims to help content makers receive more rewards by allowing consumers to compensate them directly, without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, with transactions recorded on a public ledger. The platform enables developers to create dApps and share content openly without concerns about transaction fees. As an alternative to Ethereum, TRON offers tools for building a decentralized Internet. In the current market cycle, TRON‚Äôs focus on empowering content creators and its robust platform for dApps may make it an attractive option for users and developers interested in decentralized technologies. Conclusion JASMY, KAS, TRX, and SHIB are good picks, but XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% growth with a community-driven ecosystem.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Polygon-based meme coin XYZ races toward $10, sparking buzz as it eyes surpassing Cardano and Dogecoin in the crypto arena. Table of Contents The all-sports meme token that‚Äôs gaining traction Cardano dips Dogecoin fluctuates Conclusion A meme coin on the Polygon blockchain is making waves with its rapid ascent toward the $10 mark. This token‚Äôs swift rise is stirring discussions about whether it could surpass well-known cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Dogecoin. The factors propelling its growth are capturing the attention of the crypto community. The all-sports meme token that‚Äôs gaining traction Built on the Polygon blockchain, XYZ is poised to leave giants like ADA and DOGE trailing as it charges toward the coveted $10 milestone. Imagine an MVP that pairs the world‚Äôs sporting passion with explosive meme coin energy, welcome to XYZVerse, where degens everywhere can seize the massive upside of this booming market. Picture the frenzy that catapulted Polymarket to $1 billion in trading volume during the US presidential election, then top it off with the electrifying hype of meme coins and the high-stakes thrill of sports betting. With millions of fans ready to hit the virtual field, XYZ is fueling an ecosystem ripe for rapid expansion. It‚Äôs 2024, and meme coins rule the crypto roost. XYZ sets its sights on a staggering 9,900% growth by TGE, promising to blow past the finish line. Forget BOME‚Äôs 5,000% leap or WIF‚Äôs 1,000% rally, XYZ is here to outscore them all. Armed with upcoming CEX/DEX listings, audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ already holds a commanding lead. Embrace the first-mover advantage before the crowd storms the field, and watch returns soar as XYZ accelerates toward the $10 mark. Investors can grab XYZ tokens now . Cardano dips Cardano has experienced notable price swings recently. In the past week, its price fell by 20.80%. Over the last month, it decreased by 14.34%. However, looking back six months, ADA‚Äôs price has surged by 122.45%. This long-term growth suggests strong underlying momentum despite short-term declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ADA is at 42.36, indicating that it is nearing oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator stands at 13.57, which also points toward potential bullish reversal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -0.0055, showing bearish momentum but hinting at a possible upcoming shift. With the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages closely aligned at $0.89 and $0.90 respectively, ADA‚Äôs price is consolidating. If ADA‚Äôs price can overcome the nearest resistance level at $1.28, it could target the second resistance at $1.64. Achieving these levels would represent gains of approximately 48% and 78% from the current price range of $0.72-$1.08. Conversely, if the price dips to the nearest support level at $0.56, it would mark a decrease of about 22%. Traders are watching these levels carefully, as they may signal key opportunities in ADA‚Äôs price movement. Dogecoin fluctuates Dogecoin has seen significant shifts in its price recently. Over the past week, it dropped by 24.51%, and the past month shows a decrease of 25.80%. Despite these declines, DOGE holds a substantial 141.95% increase over the last six months. Currently, it trades between $0.24 and $0.40, reflecting a volatile market stance. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days stand at $0.31, indicating a period of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is at 41.81, suggesting that the coin is nearing oversold territory. A Stochastic value of 17.76 supports this, pointing to potential upward momentum. However, the MACD level is at -0.002010, which could hint at continued bearish trends. Key price levels are in focus for Dogecoin. The nearest resistance is at $0.48. Approaching this point would mark an increase of around 60% from the lower end of its current range. Beyond that, the second resistance level is at $0.63. On the downside, the nearest support level sits at $0.17. Falling below this could lead to the second support at $0.0252, indicating a significant decrease. These levels are crucial as traders watch for DOGE‚Äôs next move. Conclusion ADA and DOGE are strong, but XYZ, the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% growth, surpassing tokens like PEPE and MOG with its community-driven, sustainable approach.

The analyst pseudonymously known as CredibleCrypto tells his 449,900 followers on the social media platform X that his ‚Äúhighest conviction‚Äù bet based on the risk-reward ratio is Curve DAO ( CRV ). According to CredibleCrypto, CRV could rally by at least 722% from the current level. CRV is trading at $0.852 at time of writing, up by over 70% over the past 30 days. The widely followed analyst says that his bullish thesis for CRV is backed by the tokenomics of the DeFi altcoin in addition to the technical analysis. ‚ÄúYou have a coin that has an emissions structure that is literally modeled after Bitcoin (BTC), but: ‚Äì has 40+% of the supply essentially locked in perpetuity ‚Äì generates real yield from working products which is paid out to token lockers multiple times a month ‚Äì currently has the highest developer activity + number of developers that have ever worked on the protocol in its history despite the depressed price.‚Äù According to CredibleCrypto, Curve DAO has an advantage over Bitcoin in that unlike BTC, the long-term holders of CRV can‚Äôt dump during the bear markets and worsen the price declines or take profits during the bull markets and curtail price appreciation. ‚Äú‚Ä¶with CRV, token lockers literally can‚Äôt sell into the pumps OR sell into the dumps because their tokens are locked (in most cases) for a minimum of 3.5 ‚Äì 4 years.‚Äù The pseudonymous analyst further says, ‚ÄúOverall, aside from the clean technicals and chart setup, CRV, fundamentally, has all the markings of the next big success in this space that I think most are sleeping on because of either a lack of understanding of the mechanics behind the project or because of regurgitated, out-dated fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) that has been spread about the token during the last market downturn.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Coin value has increased up to $2.300 high amidst the bullish market. Side by side, the cryptocurrency gained an overall 6.93 percent recovery. The bears remained dominant in the past few weeks; however, today the bulls secured victory. Technical indicators as well as the price charts are giving out a highly bullish signal regarding the market scenario. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise within global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple‚Äôs strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP‚Äôs value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as the buying influx was abruptly taken, taking the price to $2.300. The RSI has also risen above 50, the continual upside can lead beyond the neutral region. Will XRP recover? XRP is dipping over the short term; nevertheless, the drop in price levels is gradual, with bullish periods in between. The price action is nothing unusual in the crypto market, with equal chances of price reversal. Will XRP reach $1? XRP will have to surpass several resistance levels to reach $1. With a not-very-solid bearish trend and XRP‚Äôs current price action, it is possible that the coin can get $1 by next year as demand for XRP tokens rises and XRP‚Äôs growth remains consistent. The last time XRP was seen on the $1 level was November 30, 2021. Will XRP reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, XRP has a low chance of reaching $10 in the next five years. However, it is expected to reach $10 by 2031 if XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues which still makes it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100? If one XRP coin is worth $100, its market cap must be more than $5.4 trillion. Comparatively, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap is $1.18 trillion; considering the current global economic situation, it is unlikely for XRP to reach $100 under current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. Currently, the coin is trading at the lowest level of the last year; however, it is expected to reach the highest price of $7 by 2030, which makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger on with the Ripple lawsuit. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, admitted his misjudgment about XRP as the token surged past $2. It now ranks third in cryptocurrency market capitalization, with Ripple‚Äôs market cap climbing 22% and its 24-hour trading volume rising by 21.81% to $19.27 billion on December 2, 2024. Read more about it here . Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, comments on the XRP price, noting that XRP is a relic of past crypto trends. Large holders are disappointed, and investors are becoming less interested due to its lack of innovation and frequent legal entanglements. The future market performance for XRP is still grim if it can‚Äôt address its legal problems or provide creative applications.

XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset‚Äôs value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of¬†2020 pushed the coin‚Äôs value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022 it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto markets records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark and is trading above $2 at the start of December.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-24 15:31:00

A fresh phishing scam has erupted, targeting individuals with deceitful emails purportedly from Ledger Wallet, which coax them into disclosing their recovery phrases on a bogus website. At the same time, DEXX has launched a compensation strategy this month after a security breach wiped out over $21 million in Solana assets for its users. In such a volatile environment, Plus Wallet has surged in popularity as the safest crypto wallet, securing private keys on personal devices for ultimate protection. The wallet further enhances user experience with perks like boundless rewards and comprehensive cross-chain support, placing users well ahead in the competitive market. Ledger Wallet Users Beware: Phishing Scam Alert Latest updates from Ledger Wallet have unveiled a phishing plot targeting crypto enthusiasts. These crafty emails, masquerading as official Ledger communications, falsely announce a data breach and implore users to confirm their recovery phrases. Following the links in these emails leads to a counterfeit website designed to mirror Ledger‚Äôs official site, where unsuspecting users are tricked into entering their 24-word recovery phrase. Ledger Wallet has issued urgent advisories to users to safeguard their recovery phrases and avoid sharing them through any remote methods. This alert comes in the wake of a distressing incident where a user lost a staggering $2.5 million in Bitcoin and NFTs without ever online sharing their seed phrase. Key Takeaways from the DEXX Security Breach Just this month, following a devastating security breach in November 2024, DEXX set forth a compensation plan after over $21 million worth of Solana funds evaporated from user accounts. This breach revealed severe lapses in crypto wallet security, primarily the risky practice of storing private keys on central servers. This breach underscores the crucial need for local storage of private keys, ensuring they remain under the user‚Äôs exclusive control, and amplifies the importance of a thorough security check before settling on a crypto wallet. A strong security foundation is essential to ward off such severe breaches. Leading the Pack in Security: How Plus Wallet Stands Out As hacking threats multiply, the need for the safest crypto wallets has soared to unprecedented levels. Users are searching for reliable wallets that not only secure their assets against these threats but also offer the flexibility to partake in diverse crypto activities. Here, Plus Wallet shines brightly. It boasts a comprehensive security system that employs multiple layers of defense, including cutting-edge encryption, to protect users‚Äô data and assets. A standout feature of Plus Wallet is its method of storing private keys directly on the user‚Äôs device, as opposed to server-based storage. This strategy ensures that only the user can access their assets, eliminating any risk of third-party intrusion and giving users complete control over their funds. Additionally, Plus Wallet enhances its security with two-factor authentication options like Face ID and PIN codes. This additional layer of security guarantees that, even if a device is compromised, unauthorized entities cannot gain access. Plus Wallet also simplifies the recovery process for users with lost devices; by simply re-downloading the app and entering their recovery phrase, users can restore access to their assets seamlessly. Beyond these security protocols, Plus Wallet supports multiple blockchain networks, enabling users to manage their assets across various chains. It also offers avenues for passive income through routine trading. Collectively, these features position Plus Wallet as one of the safest crypto wallets available, providing users with both the protection they need and the flexibility they desire to enhance their financial success. Essential Insights The recent phishing scheme posing as Ledger Wallet serves as a stark reminder of the escalating threats faced by cryptocurrency users, underscoring the critical importance of guarding recovery phrases against fraud. Similarly, the breach at DEXX has spotlighted the vital necessity for secure private key storage and a thorough evaluation of a crypto wallet‚Äôs security framework. In this turbulent landscape, Plus Wallet has ascended in stature as one of the safest crypto wallets, prized for its control and adaptability. Its superior encryption safeguards assets against external threats, while the private key storage on personal devices ensures users retain ultimate control and bolstered security. Equipped with a suite of formidable capabilities, Plus Wallet delivers a perfect fusion of safety and convenience, making it an excellent choice for users eager to secure their digital assets while pursuing growth in their crypto endeavors.

He underscored that such matters come under the jurisdiction of Congress and the Fed does not wish to seek a change in existing laws to allow for Bitcoin holdings. Powell‚Äôs statement instantly shook the market, which caused Bitcoin‚Äôs price to quickly pull back from its high earlier in the week. Besides, the probability of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve dropped from a peak of 40% on the 18th to 34% after Powell‚Äôs speech on the Polymarket platform. WuBlockchain in the latest post has shared insights on whether the Fed could prevent the US from creating a national Bitcoin reserve. Can the Fed Block the BSR plan? The U.S. Congress is the highest authority in the financial system, responsible for enacting regulations and authorizing agencies like the SEC and Federal Reserve to perform their functions. It is important to note that while the Fed enjoys a high degree of independence in monetary policy and national economic stability, it does not have a ‚Äúveto power‚Äù over the decision to establish a BSR. Can Trump Quickly Establish BSR? In order to quickly establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, the Trump administration could issue an executive order requiring the U.S. Treasury to use the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) and directly purchase Bitcoin. Notably, the operation of the fund is not controlled by Congress, and the President and Treasury have significant independence in its use. This approach would avoid the need for congressional approval, and reduce political opposition. However, the sustainability of such a BSR is uncertain, as future administrations could revoke or amend the executive order. A Long-term BSR To establish a long-term and stable BSR, a more legal and stable route would be through congressional legislation, incorporating Bitcoin into the ‚ÄúStrategic Reserve Act‚Äù or similar laws. This would formally recognize Bitcoin as a national strategic asset. The ‚ÄúU.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act,‚Äù suggested by Senator Cynthia Lummis, follows this route which is currently under review by the Senate Banking Committee. However, this approach is more time-consuming and could face hurdles as the bill must pass both the Senate and House of Representatives and be approved by the President. Either way, the Treasury Department, rather than the Fed would ultimately take the lead in implementing the Bitcoin reserve. Is There A Middle Way Out? A middle path could also be pursued by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department for the Bitcoin allocation. The Federal Reserve could purchase Bitcoin through open market operations and add it to its balance sheet. However, given the Federal Reserve‚Äôs recent statements, this approach seems unlikely. The Treasury Department on the other hand could establish a special fund to invest in Bitcoin as part of a fiscal investment plan, it would require congressional approval. Nevertheless, the Fed‚Äôs ‚Äúno‚Äù does not outrightly reject the proposal for a BSR, and the Trump administration has shown support through action. While the Fed‚Äôs approach remains cautious, the Trump family‚Äôs actions indicate a muted struggle between traditional power and market innovation.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 15:31:32

Adding to the concerns, a recent update regarding Cardano‚Äôs token unlock has sparked fear among traders and investors about a potential price dip. Cardano (ADA) Token Unlock Scheduled Today, December 24, 2024, a crypto insights provider, Tokenomist , posted on X (formerly Twitter) revealing that the Cardano blockchain is set to unlock 18.53 million ADA tokens worth $16.37 million on December 26, 2024. The report further stated that this substantial token unlocks accounts for 0.05% of Cardano‚Äôs total circulating supply. With the recent token unlock, Cardano will have unlocked 85.44% of its maximum ADA supply. ADA Current Price and Potential Impact Based on the data, whenever a project unlocks its respective tokens, it typically creates inflows into exchanges, leading to selling pressure and a subsequent price decline. In the case of ADA, experts and analysts suggest that the token might face a price drop in the coming days. At press time, ADA is trading near $0.93 and has experienced a price surge of over 8% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 5%, suggesting that traders and investors are still apprehensive about a potential price decline, which might explain the lower participation. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA has been consolidating within a tight range of $0.86 to $0.97 over the past five trading days. The breakout from this consolidation zone could determine whether ADA will rally or decline in the future. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks out of the consolidation zone and closes a daily candle above the $0.98 mark, it is highly likely to rally by 25% to reach the $1.25 mark. Conversely, if ADA breaks down from the consolidation zone and closes a daily candle below the $0.85 level, it could decline by 12% to reach the next support level at $0.75.

The tokens inspired by trendy internet captions captured 31% of investors‚Äô interest globally across the main meme coin narrative and 25 meme coin trends. This percentage means that nearly a third of crypto narrative interest was based on speculative opportunities with fundamentals. The market grew from dog-related meme coins such as Dogecoin to other animal and personality-related meme coins. The success of meme coins was spurred by the launch pool, Pump.fun. Solana alone deployed almost 5 million new meme coins in 2024, leading to over $335 million in fees . Meme coins claimed the top spot in crypto narratives, with the leading tokens making up 14.36% of investor interest. Other meme coin trends also gained traction, including Solana-based meme coins (7.65%), Base meme coins (2.13%), AI meme coins (1.49%), and cat-themed meme coins (1.19%). As a result, meme coins were the third most rewarding narrative of the year, delivering an average annual profit of 201%. AI tokens shine in 2024, but meme coins outpace them The year 2024 saw the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) in the crypto space. There was curiosity and investor expectations in exploring the intersection between AI and blockchain. AI was a hot topic within the crypto space, capturing 15.67% of the mindshare across six narratives. The AI narrative came second with a 12.58% share of investor interest, which means it grew by 1.26% from last year when it had an 11.32% share of interest. AI-related trends, including AI meme coins (1.49%) and AI agents (1.17%), made the technology more popular around crypto. Yet, it couldn‚Äôt match the meteoric rise of the meme coin narrative, which outdid it by far. Analysts state that AI tokens had a dismal performance, with a 2024 yearly negative performance of 11.6% due to Worldcoin‚Äôs WLD 39% drawdown. Meme coins have evolved from an internet fad to a $117 billion market powerhouse Many people see meme coins as an internet joke, noting that they lack the technological innovation or utility of Bitcoin or Ethereum. Their value relies on community interest rather than their inner value or groundbreaking use case, making them highly volatile and unreliable. Yet Binance statistics reveal immense growth in interest in meme coins. More people believe that their reputation is beyond a joke and that they have a potential drive for future market growth. Meme coins have a combined market cap of $117 billion, indicating how they have captured attention and grown to dominate the crypto space. At the apex is Dogecoin , an original meme coin that is considered the ‚ÄúKing‚Äù of meme coins.

The move comes as the leading crypto exchange plans to file an objection to a recent order in favor of the securities regulator. Decoding US SEC and Kraken‚Äôs New Proposed Order Plaintiff U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and defendants Payward Inc and Payward Ventures (together crypto exchange Kraken) have submitted a stipulation, as per a court filing late December 23. The exchange said parties filed a joint statement regarding a discovery dispute. Notably, it concerns the SEC‚Äôs objections to Kraken‚Äôs requests for three categories of documents concerning Bitcoin and Ether, the SEC‚Äôs public statements and testimony regarding digital assets, and the SEC‚Äôs internal trading policies on digital assets. However, in November, the court referred discovery disputes and all further discovery in this case to Magistrate Judge Robert M. Illman. Then, Magistrate Judge Illman denied Kraken exchange‚Äôs request to compel the production of the discovery. But, the leading crypto exchange believes the documents are relevant in the case. Under the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a), the deadline to file objections to the order is December 30, but the crypto exchange intends to resubmit narrowed requests for production in line with the order. ‚ÄúKraken intends to serve narrowed requests for production in light of the Order and the Parties intend to meet and confer regarding those narrowed requests.‚Äù Overall, the US SEC and Kraken have agreed to stay the deadline to file objections to the order until March 31, 2025 to discuss a further extension. Lawyer Who Defended Ripple CEO Seeks Win for Exchange Matthew C. Solomon, partner at law firm Clearly Gottlieb, filed an attestation to defend Kraken as the arguments for documents were crucial. He is known for many high-profile cases including successfully defending Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in obtaining the dismissal with prejudice and successful defense of all other claims on summary judgment. Kraken‚Äôs requested an order to compel the SEC to produce documents on why Bitcoin and Ether were not included in the SEC‚Äôs complaint despite being traded similarly to 11 crypto tokens on the platform. Even so, the magistrate judge finds the critical argument ‚Äúunpersuasive‚Äú. As CoinGape reported, the exchange and the crypto industry contended that former SEC official William Hinman‚Äôs speech is relevant to the status of Bitcoin and Ether under federal securities laws.

Specifically, after surging 56% from $67,811 on November 5 to the all-time high (ATH) above $108,000 on December 17, BTC plunged to its press time price of $97,621, erasing approximately $180 billion from its market capitalization. BTC 7-day market cap price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Indeed, at its recent high, the total valuation of the world‚Äôs premier cryptocurrency exceeded $2.14 trillion. In contrast, on December 24, data from Finbold revealed BTC stood at $1.93 trillion at the time of publication. Can Bitcoin still enjoy the ‚ÄòSanta Claus‚Äô rally in 2024? Despite the magnitude of the collapse, it is equally worth pointing out that Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization remains approximately $600 billion above where it stood on election day. Furthermore, the latest trend is, at press time, one of recovery as BTC‚Äôs valuation is substantially above the 7-day lows close to $1.83 trillion. Additionally, either a ‚ÄòSanta Claus‚Äô or an early 2025 rally appears in the cards, despite crypto market ‚ÄòGrinch‚Äô seemingly stealing the hoped-for year‚Äôs end parabolic surge, as Bitcoin‚Äôs recent drop was dictated by external factors. The world‚Äôs premier cryptocurrency fell victim to the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcement that simultaneously ‚Äì and temporarily ‚Äì wiped $1.5 trillion from the U.S. stock market as investors again began fearing higher inflation and higher interest rates in the new year. Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 Looking ahead to 2025, the most recent expert forecasts paint a bullish picture for the upcoming year. For example, the prominent Wall Street analyst Tom Lee estimated that $250,000 is a plausible 12-month price target for Bitcoin. Robert Kiyosaki , a prominent and persistent BTC bull, set his sights for the new year at $350,000, while Perianne Boring, a cryptocurrency lobbyist, revealed that $800,000 is plausible according to some models. In the more immediate future, prior analysis conducted by the on-chain analyst Ali Martinez indicates that having rebounded well above $95,000, Bitcoin is safe from a greater drop but that it could face substantial resistance at $125,000 and $150,000. Martinez is also somewhat less bullish than Kiyosaki or Tom Lee, as he estimated BTC will top near $220,000 in the current cycle.

This shift is attributed to market corrections, particularly in the market caps of altcoins , as well as decreased interest in memecoins and an uptick in focus on Bitcoin . Key Insights: Market Correction Impact : Altcoins and memecoins have faced significant price retracements, reducing speculative interest. The broader market correction has triggered fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among retail investors. Bitcoin Dominance : While altcoins have struggled, Bitcoin has seen increased attention, often regarded as a safer asset during market uncertainty. Bitcoin‚Äôs relatively stable performance during corrections has highlighted its status as a market anchor. Cycle Dynamics : Santiment emphasized that such FUD is a natural and healthy part of the cryptocurrency market cycle. These phases can provide opportunities for patient traders to position themselves for the next market rebound. Implications for Traders: Short-Term Outlook : Bearish sentiment might dominate the market for now, with further corrections possible for riskier altcoins . Opportunity for Accumulation : For disciplined investors, the current bearish phase could present buying opportunities in strong projects at discounted prices. Focus on Fundamentals : During periods of market uncertainty, assets with strong fundamentals, like Bitcoin and Ethereum , tend to outperform speculative plays. Conclusion: While bearish sentiment has gripped the crypto market, historical trends suggest that such phases are cyclical and often precede periods of renewed interest and growth. Investors who remain patient and strategic during these times could capitalize on future market recoveries.

Musk claimed, ‚ÄúI will be shocked if this doesn‚Äôt happen,‚Äù referencing SBF‚Äôs status as a major donor to Democratic campaigns. Key Details: SBF‚Äôs Conviction : SBF is currently serving a 25-year sentence at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) for multiple fraud-related charges stemming from the collapse of his crypto exchange, FTX . His attempt to appeal his conviction on the grounds of judicial bias was recently rejected by U.S. authorities. Political Contributions : SBF donated $5.2 million to Biden‚Äôs 2020 presidential campaign and over $40 million to Democratic candidates during the U.S. midterm elections. In response to public outcry, three major Democratic organizations announced plans to return $1 million (2.2%) of the contributions. Musk‚Äôs Speculation : Musk‚Äôs comment aligns with growing scrutiny of SBF‚Äôs political connections, particularly his financial ties to influential Democratic figures. Public Reactions: Skepticism and Criticism : Musk‚Äôs statement has reignited debates over political corruption and the ethical implications of campaign donations influencing legal decisions. Calls for Accountability : Many in the crypto community have emphasized the need for transparency and justice , urging that SBF‚Äôs political affiliations should not shield him from the consequences of his actions. Implications: If Biden were to pardon SBF, it could have significant repercussions: Political Fallout : Critics argue it would raise questions about favoritism and accountability within the justice system. Crypto Industry Sentiment : Such a move could further erode trust in the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: While Musk‚Äôs statement is speculative, it underscores lingering concerns about the intersection of politics and justice. Whether or not SBF‚Äôs political ties play a role in his legal trajectory remains to be seen, but the debate highlights the ongoing challenges in navigating the fallout from FTX‚Äôs collapse.

Key Highlights: Bitcoin Dominates Inflows : Bitcoin (BTC) saw the lion‚Äôs share of net inflows at $375 million , showing continued investor interest despite broader market volatility. Ethereum Recovers : Ethereum (ETH) recorded $51 million in inflows , suggesting resilience following recent market corrections. Outflows in Select Assets : Solana (SOL) faced $8.7 million in outflows , indicating waning investor sentiment. Multi-asset products experienced significant outflows of $121 million , hinting at a shift toward single-asset investments. Total AUM Decline : The total assets under management (AUM) for digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) fell by $17.7 billion , largely due to price corrections and the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs (FOMC) hawkish signals . Late-Week Sell-Off : A single-day outflow of $576 million on Dec. 19 , coupled with a $1 billion outflow over the final two days , weighed heavily on weekly performance. Market Sentiment Analysis : Institutional Interest Remains : Despite late-week sell-offs, net inflows indicate ongoing institutional interest in digital assets, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum. Broader Economic Factors : The market‚Äôs reaction reflects growing uncertainty around U.S. monetary policy , with the FOMC‚Äôs hawkish stance contributing to price corrections.

It witnessed the approval of the first Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a seismic shift in institutional adoption. If January‚Äôs approval rate is anything to go by, coupled with the current US political stance on digital assets, Crypto ETFs are poised for a transformative 2025. Since spot crypto ETFs were approved, the investment vehicles have garnered more than 5% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply, a figure surpassing even the estimated 1.1 million BTC associated with Bitcoin‚Äôs enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto . Since January, the story of the crypto ETFs has been one of continued market maturation. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January, followed by Ethereum ETFs in July, has set the stage for a more diversified crypto ETF landscape in 2025. Analysts predict a wave of new ETF offerings for top crypto protocols, including Solana, XRP, Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), and others. The changing regulatory environment also plays a critical role. With the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a figure known for his ‚Äúunfair‚Äù stance on crypto assets, and the nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins by President-elect Donald Trump , the outlook for crypto ETFs in 2025 appears significantly brighter. A lighter regulatory approach could pave the way for broader approval of ETFs linked to various cryptocurrencies, further integrating digital assets into mainstream financial markets. Spotlight on Solana ETFs Solana, a high-performance blockchain with a robust ecosystem spanning decentralized finance, NFTs, and gaming, is a prime candidate for ETF inclusion. In December, the SEC rejected applications for spot Solana ETFs from several issuers, citing regulatory hurdles . üö®SCOOP: I‚Äôve confirmed that the @SECGov has notified at least two of the five prospective issuers that it will reject their 19b4 filings for the $SOL spot ETFs. The consensus here, I‚Äôm told, is that the SEC won‚Äôt entertain any new #crypto ETFs under the current administration. ‚Äî Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 6, 2024 Despite this, optimism remains high for 2025, especially following Trump‚Äôs electoral win and the anticipated regulatory shift under Paul Atkins. Major asset management firms like VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have filed for Solana ETFs, with applications gaining traction post-election. ‚Äú It appears the SEC is now engaging with issuers on this product, which is obviously a positive sign ,‚Äù noted Nate Geraci. Industry insiders believe Solana‚Äôs success, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, will set a precedent for its approval by the end of 2025. However, analysts from JPMorgan caution that pending lawsuits regarding unregistered securities could delay Solana‚Äôs ETF timeline. XRP: Legal clarity could build ETF approval potential Ripple‚Äôs XRP has long been at the center of regulatory battles, with the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple Labs serving as a touchstone for broader crypto regulation. Despite this, analysts believe XRP ETFs are on the horizon, contingent on the resolution of its legal disputes. WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have already filed for XRP ETFs, signaling growing institutional interest in the asset. Bloomberg‚Äôs James Seyffart suggests that while Litecoin and Hedera ETFs might gain approval sooner, XRP‚Äôs potential ETF launch will attract significant investor attention. With its ongoing legal challenges nearing a curtain draw, XRP is poised to reenter the spotlight, bolstered by ETF filings and growing market demand. Dogecoin and Hedera ETFs: Speculation meets reality Dogecoin‚Äôs journey to ETF consideration, much like its whole crypto market journey, has been full of humor and speculation. The memecoin has won the hearts of netizens, and as funny as this sounds, inspired the naming of an Elon Musk-led unofficial US government office named the Department of Government Efficiency, acronymed as the coin itself, D.O.G.E. I still can‚Äôt believe @DOGE is real ü§£ü§£ ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 25, 2024 Eric Balchunas had humorously hinted at the possibility of a Dogecoin ETF, but industry observers note that the concentrated holdings of DOGE present challenges for fair market assessments. Nevertheless, the more permissive regulatory stance anticipated in 2025 may open doors for DOGE-focused products. Hedera, by contrast, stands on firmer ground. Its native token, HBAR, has not been classified as a security, giving it a regulatory edge. That said, only Canary Capital has made an application for a Hedera ETF. Bloomberg analysts suggest Hedera is among the most likely candidates to secure ETF approval among the likes of XRP, DOGE and ADA. Cardano ETFs: A rising contender Cardano (ADA) saw a surge in interest following its inclusion in Bitwise‚Äôs 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF application. The announcement triggered a seven-month high in ADA trading volume, alongside increased whale activity. ETF expert Geraci also predicts that Cardano could join the US spot ETF market as soon as Solana and XRP get approved, further cementing its position as a top-tier cryptocurrency. Crypto Capital Venture founder Dan Gambardello believes Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem developments and potential ETF approval could propel its price significantly. While regulatory clarity remains a prerequisite, Cardano‚Äôs growing institutional appeal positions it as a strong contender for ETF approval in 2025. 2025 is the year for crypto ETFs As the crypto industry enters 2025, the rise of ETFs signals a new era of growth and maturity. Bitcoin is slowly solidifying its role as a global reserve asset, which is forcing watchdogs to clear the air on regulatory frameworks. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before the stage is set for widespread adoption. The exponential growth of DeFi, stablecoins, and crypto ETFs highlights the transformative potential of digital assets in global finance. Supported by a more crypto-friendly administration, the industry is poised to render boundaries obsolete, which is why we believe 2025 could be the year for Crypto ETFs.

This anticipated shift signals growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency products within the broader investment management sector. Key Findings: Current ETF Holdings by Sector : Spot Bitcoin ETFs : Hedge Funds: 45.3% of total holdings. Investment Advisors: 28%. Spot Ethereum ETFs : Investment Advisors: 33%, already exceeding hedge fund holdings. Projected Shift in 2025 : Investment advisors are poised to become the largest holders of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This trend reflects increasing demand from retail and institutional clients seeking diversified crypto exposure through professionally managed funds. Drivers of Growth Among Investment Advisors : Regulatory Clarity : As regulatory frameworks around crypto ETFs solidify, advisors are more comfortable including these assets in client portfolios. Growing Client Demand : Rising interest in cryptocurrencies among retail investors and high-net-worth individuals is pushing advisors to seek efficient and secure exposure methods. Risk-Adjusted Returns : Crypto ETFs offer a simplified, low-risk avenue for investors to gain exposure without directly managing wallets or dealing with exchanges. Hedge Funds to Remain Significant Players : While hedge funds are expected to lose their dominant position, they will continue to account for a large share of crypto ETF holdings due to their active trading strategies and high appetite for speculative investments. What This Means for the Crypto Market : Increased Liquidity : A greater presence of investment advisors in crypto ETFs is likely to boost market liquidity , stabilizing prices and reducing volatility over time. Mainstream Adoption : This shift underscores cryptocurrency‚Äôs growing legitimacy as a recognized asset class within traditional finance. Potential Regulatory Tailwinds : As investment advisors embrace crypto ETFs, they may exert influence on policymakers to create more crypto-friendly regulations. Conclusion: The rise of investment advisors as the largest holders of crypto ETFs by 2025 marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. It highlights a transition from speculative adoption by hedge funds to broader acceptance among mainstream financial professionals, potentially signaling the maturation of the crypto ecosystem .

Key Highlights: Market Corrections Trigger Panic Selling: Recent price retracements have led to heightened fear among retail traders , particularly those who are less familiar with the typical volatility of crypto markets. Santiment noted an uptick in smaller investors exiting their positions as the correction deepened. Whales and Sharks Accumulate: Larger investors appear to be taking advantage of the sell-off to amass Bitcoin and Ethereum . Historically, such accumulation phases by whales often precede a market rebound , as these entities are known to exert significant influence on price trends. On-Chain Data Signals: Santiment‚Äôs on-chain metrics indicate increased activity from wallets holding large amounts of BTC and ETH. The ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù strategy by these players could help stabilize the market and drive future upward momentum. Opportunities in Volatility: For experienced investors, market corrections present an opportunity to buy assets at lower prices. However, newer traders may perceive the declines as signs of further losses, leading to fear-driven decisions. Potential Implications: Short-Term Volatility : Continued selling pressure from retail traders may lead to more volatility in the short term. Price Recovery : Accumulation by whales and other large holders could set the stage for a market recovery , particularly if institutional interest remains strong. Lessons for Retail Traders : Newer market participants are encouraged to study historical market trends to avoid reacting emotionally to typical corrections. Conclusion: The current market correction highlights a classic dynamic between retail traders and institutional or large-scale investors. While panic selling creates short-term challenges, it also opens up opportunities for seasoned players to position themselves advantageously for the next market upswing.

This announcement highlights the growing attention regulators are placing on digital assets and their associated activities. Key Points: What is Cryptocurrency Staking? Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency in a blockchain network to support its operations, such as validating transactions. In return, participants earn rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency. Taxable Events in Staking: The IRS classifies staking rewards as ordinary income at the time they are received. The value of the staking rewards must be reported in U.S. dollars , calculated based on the fair market value at the time of receipt. This applies regardless of whether the staking rewards are immediately withdrawn or left in the wallet. Impact on Taxpayers: Staking participants are required to include their staking rewards in their gross income during the taxable year they were earned. In addition to income tax, taxpayers may also owe capital gains taxes if they sell or exchange the staked cryptocurrency for a profit at a later date. IRS Guidance and Enforcement: The IRS has been increasing its efforts to regulate and enforce cryptocurrency-related tax compliance. It previously issued guidance for crypto mining and trading activities and now extends its focus to staking. Non-compliance could result in penalties or audits. Implications for Staking Participants: Record-Keeping : Stakers must maintain detailed records of their staking rewards, including the date received and the fair market value at the time of receipt. Tax Planning : Investors should consider the tax implications of staking when determining their overall crypto investment strategies. Potential Complexity : Taxation on staking rewards may add complexity for individuals unfamiliar with crypto tax laws, necessitating professional tax advice. Conclusion: The IRS‚Äôs stance on staking highlights the importance of compliance for cryptocurrency investors. As the digital asset space continues to grow, regulators are expected to provide further clarity and guidelines on other crypto-related activities. Investors engaging in staking must ensure proper documentation and timely reporting to avoid potential legal issues.

One such token was Pudgy Penguin‚Äôs native token, which went live with a massive PENGU airdrop, and with that airdrop, a crypto whale earned $5M. Crypto Whale Made Earned $5M With PENGU Airdrop The crypto market is full of opportunities to make heavy profits, and airdrops bring that to another level, as people can receive free cryptos and turn that into profits. Interestingly, a crypto whale took it to another level, as it received 116.7M PENGU from the PENGU airdrop and earned a heavy profit with that. Initially, these tokens were worth $394K, per the listing price of $0.003375. However, the same is worth $4.2M today, after the PENGU price grew 630% since its launch on December 18, 2024. Interestingly, the crypto whale realized the Pudgy Penguin token‚Äôs worth as it is a famous NFT product and gained an instant listing on Binance. Such listing on popular crypto exchanges increases the possibility of gains. Regardless, the whale spent 5,250 SOL, worth $1M, and bought an additional 34.42M PENGU, bringing his total holdings to $5.49M. A whale who received an airdrop of 116.7M $PENGU ($3.52M) spent 5,250 $SOL ($1M) to buy an additional 34.42M $PENGU today! The whale hasn‚Äôt sold any $PENGU and now holds a total of 151.12M $PENGU ($5.08M). https://t.co/p5JEeH6nUs pic.twitter.com/ZgYm5vm7Wv ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 24, 2024 Similarly, another crypto trader made 14,500x returns on his Pudgy Penguin token investment. He turned $6 into $87k within a few days as he invested before the liquidity pool launched the token. Many similar incidents have amazed investors and increased the demand for Solana meme coins. PENGU Price Surged 40% Today When Binance listed PENGU, its price surged 800% within a day, bringing heavy returns to the investors. Today, the popular Korean exchange Bithumb listed the Pudgy Penguin token, leading to the PENGU price surging 40%. With that, it currently trades at $0.03364, with a market capitalization of $2.6B. This happened as the trading activity increased 211% to $1.16B, clearly explaining its rising demand. However, this is just the beginning, as the token has achieved a much higher target in the past, as it is 38% away from its ATH of $0.05738, set just seven days ago. Further analysts believe the PENGU market cap could hit $10B due to the success of PENGU airdrop and listing by various crypto exchanges. She revealed that more than 70% of airdrop tokens were claimed within 24 hours, which explains users‚Äô interest, and the same interest is likely to push PENGU‚Äôs market cap to $10B. Final Thoughts Pudgy Penguin token has taken the crypto market by storm, as PENGU price rallied more than 630% in just a week. More importantly, it grabbed investors‚Äô instant attention, as the PENGU airdrop was successful, with more than 70% of the tokens getting claimed within the first 24 hours. With that, a crypto whale earned $5M after receiving 116.7M PENGU in the airdrop and grabbing heavy profits over this period.

According to the analyst‚Äôs price chart, Wave 2 and 5 could push XRP to these key targets, marking new all-time highs for the cryptocurrency. XRP Price Roadmap To New ATHs The XRP price has been on a rather lengthy consolidation trend, halting its previous price momentum after hitting the $2.5 mark. Despite facing bearish trends and a drop to $2.2, a crypto analyst on TradingView, ‚ÄòZerpcrypto,‚Äô has shared a bullish forecast for the popular altcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes Major Buy Signal On The 4-Hour TD Sequential Chart, Where To Enter? According to the analyst, XRP could experience a significant price increase between $7.4 to $13.5. The analyst based his bullish projections on XRP‚Äôs recent price action and the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis tool that identifies predictable patterns in crypto prices and helps forecast market trends. Zerpcrypto shared a 2-year XRP price chart from 2014 to the present; labeling wave counts from one to five for the larger cycles and sub-waves within these cycles. The analyst‚Äôs chart indicates that XRP is currently in the middle of Wave 3, signaling a potential upward move. With Wave 2 already complete, Zerpcrypto anticipates that Wave 3 could trigger a strong price rally, potentially propelling XRP to $7.4. After reaching the Wave 3 target, a minor pullback is expected in Wave 4, allowing the market to consolidate before XRP‚Äôs final big push upward into Wave 5. In this last wave, XRP could rise to $13.5 and potentially even surge as high as $27.4. In addition to the Elliott Wave theory, Zerpcrypto‚Äòs predictions are grounded in Fibonacci levels. The projected $7.4 and $13.5 XRP price targets align with the 4.236 and 8.618 Fibonacci extension levels respectively, reinforcing the analyst‚Äôs bullish outlook. Zerpcrypto has also spotlighted a positive Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for XRP, further strengthening his confidence in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs projected $7.4 to $13.5 price target. Crypto Whales Buy 40 Million XRP Despite XRP‚Äôs price drop to $2.25, a 13% decline over the past week, whales continue accumulating large amounts of tokens, viewing the price dips as a potential buying opportunity. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed in a recent X (former Twitter) post that whales have bought another 40 million XRP in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: XRP Price On Its Way To $10 In Only 3 Months If It Follows This Pattern A crypto community member has speculated that this large-scale purchase could signal that whales may be positioning themselves for significant change in XRP. Typically, a surge in whale buying activity often suggests increased confidence in the bullish outlook of a cryptocurrency. With XRP‚Äôs price surging over 4X from its previous low of $0.5 to surpass $2.2 in just two months, analysts are forecasting continued gains as the bull market gains momentum.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solaxy gains momentum with a $4.5m presale, targeting Solana‚Äôs scalability issues with its smart Layer 2 solution and massive staking rewards. Table of Contents Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Solaxy (SOLX) is developing a Layer 2 solution to enhance the user experience on Solana, and investors are taking notice. Less than two weeks have passed since the presale started, and the project‚Äôs funds are just $419,000 away from the $5 million mark. Since the project is still in its early stages, investors have a chance to secure their share of SOLX at a low price and benefit from a massive staking APY to maximize their investment. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at this project and what it‚Äôs all about. Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum The Solaxy presale officially opened its doors to early investors on December 12th, and it has already raised over $4.5 million. While the project‚Äôs scope plays its part in attracting investors, Solaxy is featured on Best Wallet‚Äôs Upcoming Tokens section, making it available to the app‚Äôs 100,000+ monthly users and boosting its visibility further. This makes it very similar to Pepe Unchained (PEPU), an Ethereum-based Layer 2 blockchain project that successfully ended its presale phase with over $73 million raised. Once its presale ended, PEPU launched on Uniswap and soared by more than 600% in the first 48 hours, securing listings on LBank, BingX, MEXC, and other exchanges as its price rose. Comparing the early success of these two presales puts Solaxy ahead, as Pepe Unchained took more than a month to raise $4.5 million. To enter the presale, investors can purchase SOLX using BNB, ETH, USDT, or a bank card. No minimum investment is required. Currently, SOLX costs $0.001576 each, but its per-token price will increase in just one day or if the presale raises another $273,000 by tomorrow. If Solaxy keeps its momentum, it could surpass PEPU‚Äôs success and potentially deliver better returns on launch. Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Solana is among the top three blockchains by transaction volumes, and its daily transaction count has only increased with pump.fun‚Äôs launch. As such, its ecosystem is prone to network overloads and congestion that can result in failed transactions or slow transaction speeds. Solaxy intends to resolve these issues with its Layer 2 blockchain, which will reduce the burden on Solana‚Äôs Layer 1 chain by bundling up and processing transactions in its stead. This won‚Äôt just make Solana more scalable but also more cost-effective for its users. Plus, the bundled transactions will still be finalized on Solana‚Äôs network, leveraging its robust security. The development of the Solaxy Layer 2 blockchain is in full swing, fueled by 30% of the project‚Äôs total 138 billion token supply. Crypto analyst ClayBro has reminded his 134,000-strong audience on YouTube of the congestion issues Solana users faced in March, April, and June of 2024 during meme coin booms. As he anticipates a meme coin supercycle, ClayBro is impressed by Solaxy‚Äôs goal to improve Solana‚Äôs performance and advises his followers to enter the presale while it‚Äôs in its early stages. Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Despite Solaxy‚Äôs ambitious goals and the utility of its upcoming Layer 2 blockchain, it‚Äôs a meme coin first, and as such, its success largely depends on the strength and trust of its community. The project‚Äôs 4-phase roadmap reveals it has a strong focus on community building. Its first phase prioritizes marketing, for which the project allocated 15% of its total token supply, and that has already attracted over 22,000 followers across Solaxy‚Äôs X (Twitter) and Telegram channels. The presale also adopts a dynamic model for staking rewards to encourage early adoption. As more SOLX gets added to the staking pool, the staking yields reduce, which rewards early participants with the best returns. Currently, the project offers an 859% staking APY, allowing investors to nearly 9x their token holdings long-term. Solaxy‚Äôs developers also emphasize investor security, with 10% of the total token supply reserved for liquidity to ensure a safe trading environment. Plus, Coinbase , a security firm, audited the project‚Äôs smart contract and found no issues in its code. Although volatility is as high as ever in the meme coin space, Solaxy stands a solid chance to explode following its DEX launch and the subsequent release of its Layer 2 blockchain.

The article cites Arthur Herman , a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute , who described quantum computing as a ‚Äú time bomb waiting to explode ‚Äù for blockchain technology. Key Points from the WSJ Analysis: Bitcoin‚Äôs Cryptographic Vulnerability : Bitcoin relies on Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to secure transactions and wallets. Quantum computers, unlike classical computers, could theoretically solve ECDSA‚Äôs cryptographic challenges exponentially faster, exposing private keys linked to public addresses. Quantum Computing Capabilities : While today‚Äôs quantum computers are not yet powerful enough to break Bitcoin‚Äôs encryption, advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms could change that within the next decade. Estimates suggest that a fully functional quantum computer capable of this would need approximately 1,500 logical qubits ‚Äîa capability still out of reach but actively pursued. Wider Blockchain Industry Impact : Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency at risk; many blockchain projects depend on similar cryptographic techniques. The advent of quantum computing could compromise smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other cryptographic applications . Mitigation Strategies in Development: Quantum-Resistant Cryptography : Developers and researchers are working on post-quantum cryptography , creating algorithms immune to quantum attacks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is spearheading efforts to standardize quantum-resistant algorithms by 2024 . Transition to Quantum-Safe Protocols : Blockchain networks could transition to quantum-safe cryptographic protocols, but such upgrades would require extensive community consensus and technical integration. Multisig and Time-Locking Solutions : Enhancing security via multi-signature wallets and time-lock contracts may offer short-term solutions to mitigate quantum threats. Timeline and Concerns: While quantum computing capable of breaching Bitcoin‚Äôs security is not expected to arrive imminently, experts suggest the 2030s as a possible time frame. The article underscores the importance of proactive measures to ensure the long-term security of blockchain systems. Conclusion: The rise of quantum computing represents a double-edged sword for technology, offering groundbreaking advancements while posing significant risks to cryptographic systems.

This fourfold rise indicates a growing preference among investors for speculative and culturally-driven opportunities over traditional financial fundamentals. Key Highlights: Cultural Diffusion Over Fundamentals : The surge in interest reflects a shift towards community engagement, humor, and virality as key drivers of investment. Meme coins often derive value from their cultural relevance rather than technological innovation or utility. Speculative Trends Dominate : Investors are increasingly drawn to high-risk, high-reward opportunities , with meme coins offering the potential for significant short-term gains. Pump.fun‚Äôs Role in Meme Coin Popularity : Meme Coin Issuance Made Easy : Platforms like Pump.fun have democratized the creation of meme tokens, allowing individuals and small teams to issue their own coins effortlessly. This has led to a proliferation of new meme coins, further saturating the market and attracting speculative traders. Viral Success Stories : Several tokens issued via Pump.fun gained viral attention, fueling investor enthusiasm and demonstrating the platform‚Äôs impact on the sector. The Appeal of Meme Coins : Community-Centric Approach : Meme coins often build passionate communities that contribute to their growth through viral marketing and social media engagement . Affordability and Accessibility : Lower entry costs make meme coins accessible to retail investors seeking to diversify portfolios or gamble on potential moonshots. Speculative Hype : A rising culture of speculative trading, driven by platforms like TikTok and Twitter, has amplified meme coins‚Äô allure. Challenges Ahead : Regulatory Scrutiny : The speculative nature and lack of utility in meme coins may attract regulatory attention, particularly in jurisdictions prioritizing investor protection. Sustainability Concerns : Critics argue that meme coins rely heavily on hype, making them vulnerable to market sentiment shifts and price volatility. Conclusion : The rise of meme coins to 31% of investor mindshare highlights a transformative trend in the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing cultural relevance and speculative potential. While platforms like Pump.fun fuel their proliferation, sustainability and regulatory challenges remain critical considerations.

This suggests diminished buying interest from U.S. investors relative to international traders on Binance. Historically, similar drops in the index have been temporary, often encouraging new buyers to capitalize on perceived value opportunities. Key Observations: Understanding the Index : A positive premium indicates stronger buying demand from U.S. investors, often considered more institutionally driven. A negative premium , as seen now, points to relatively weaker demand or higher selling pressure from Coinbase users. Current Market Sentiment : The drop in the Coinbase Premium Index reflects decreased enthusiasm from U.S. investors, potentially due to macroeconomic uncertainty or profit-taking at recent highs. Binance‚Äôs dominance in global trading may indicate that demand remains robust outside the U.S. Historical Context : Temporary Reductions : During past bull markets, negative or diminished Coinbase premiums have often been short-lived. These periods have typically enticed new buyers, seeing it as an opportunity to enter the market at slightly discounted prices. Institutional Role : Coinbase is a favorite among institutional investors, meaning changes in its premium index can reflect shifts in their activity. A negative index could suggest caution or a pause in aggressive accumulation by these players. Implications for Bitcoin‚Äôs Price : Potential for Recovery : If historical patterns hold, diminished U.S. buying interest may stabilize as new buyers step in. A rebound in the Coinbase Premium Index could align with broader bullish sentiment. Global Demand Remains Strong : The activity on Binance indicates sustained interest from international markets, possibly mitigating the impact of reduced U.S. demand. What to Watch: Premium Index Movements : A sustained negative premium might signal broader market caution. A swift recovery could reaffirm the strength of institutional and U.S. investor interest. Macroeconomic Factors : Changes in U.S. regulatory sentiment or market conditions could influence the index and overall buying behavior. Conclusion : While the drop in the Coinbase Premium Index may suggest reduced U.S. buying pressure, historical trends indicate that this could present an opportunity for new market entrants. Monitoring the index and broader market sentiment will be crucial in assessing the next phase of Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory.

Drawing on historical data, Kesmeci suggested: Bitcoin Price Target : A potential drop of 23.94% to around $82,220 . Binance Open Interest : A possible decline of 21.88% , taking OI from the current $12.5 billion to $9.77 billion . Key Insights from Historical Patterns Open Interest as a Leading Indicator : Historically, spikes in Binance‚Äôs OI have preceded market corrections. A cooling off in OI typically indicates the unwinding of leveraged positions, resetting the market for the next leg up. Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Corrections : Similar patterns of BTC price corrections have been observed during periods of overheated OI. Kesmeci believes that a 23.94% pullback would align with these historical trends, setting the stage for subsequent recovery. Market Context Current Levels : Bitcoin trades near its recent highs, raising concerns about a potential overbought market. Binance‚Äôs current OI stands at $12.5 billion , which is notably elevated compared to historical averages. Triggers for a Correction : Increased leveraged trading on Binance and other platforms. Broader macroeconomic uncertainties or profit-taking by large holders. Implications for Investors Prepare for Volatility : If the market aligns with Kesmeci‚Äôs prediction, investors may face short-term turbulence. Opportunity to Accumulate : A dip to $82,220 could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors seeking to capitalize on market resets. Watch for Key Indicators : Monitor Binance‚Äôs OI levels and BTC‚Äôs price action closely for signs of stabilization. Conclusion Kesmeci‚Äôs analysis highlights the importance of understanding market dynamics, particularly the relationship between open interest and price movements. While a potential drop to $82,220 may cause concern, it could serve as a reset point, paving the way for a healthier recovery phase.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI.

The exchange‚Äôs decisions come amid ongoing market uncertainty and regulatory pressure, signaling a more cautious approach as it prepares for the challenges of 2025. With Bitcoin‚Äôs price falling below the $100K mark, investor confidence is low, and the overall market sentiment is one of caution. For Binance, ensuring that only the most reliable tokens remain on the platform is imperative as it seeks to maintain its reputation as a secure and trusted exchange. Binance‚Äôs recent delistings: Stringent standards in play? On December 6, Binance announced the removal of two spot trading pairs: NOT/BNB and RDNT/BTC. This followed the exchange‚Äôs routine process of periodically reviewing listed assets to ensure they meet stringent requirements for liquidity, trading volume, and network security. Binance made it clear that such actions were necessary to protect its users and uphold the integrity of its platform, especially in times of market volatility. Additionally, more tokens are set to be delisted on December 25, 2024. These included tokens such as Kaon (AKRO), Bluzelle (BLZ), and WazirX (WRX). While these tokens were removed from the platform‚Äôs main trading pairs, Binance clarified that they could still be traded with other pairs on the platform. Other trading pairs to be removed from the exchange include ACE/BTC, ACM/TRY, BOME/BTC, DYM/BTC, MTL/TRY, PIXEL/BNB, PIXEL/FDUSD, QKC/BTC, RAD/BTC, REZ/FDUSD, TUSD/TRY, all on Dec 27. In a statement, Binance emphasized its ongoing evaluation process for tokens listed on its platform. The exchange explained that it periodically reviews assets to ensure they align with its high standards. If a token fails to meet these standards or if industry dynamics change, Binance may decide to delist it. Furthermore, Binance takes into account any evidence of unethical conduct or negligence related to the token in question. As regulatory requirements evolve, the exchange ensures that its listed assets comply with new legal standards to maintain a secure and trusted marketplace for its users. The WazirX incident: Reasons for Binance to tread carefully The delisting of WRX, WazirX‚Äôs native token, on December 25, 2024, was directly linked to the ongoing troubles at the Indian exchange. The Delhi High Court had, just days earlier on December 18, ordered a fresh investigation into WazirX, stemming from a significant hack in July 2024, which resulted in a $235 million loss in cryptocurrency. The breach, attributed to a North Korean hacking group, raised significant concerns about the platform‚Äôs security measures and transparency. Binance delisting wazirX WRX token, is the best thing. . Coz few days back WRX the dead exchange token, all of a sudden started pumping 20 to 30%, like why anyone in their right mind would buy this token?üßê . So nice of binance, to finally delist it, all exchanges should do it.üôå ‚Äî Jay‚Çøitcoins.ai‚ö°Ô∏è (@JayBitcoins) December 19, 2024 Despite a partial recovery of the stolen funds, 43% of customer assets remain unrecoverable. The court‚Äôs decision to mandate a renewed investigation into WazirX, particularly in light of allegations of financial irregularities, compounded the exchange‚Äôs already fragile position. Binance, which has faced its own scrutiny in connection to WazirX in the past, confirmed that it no longer holds control over the exchange. Binance stated that WazirX is operated by Zanmai Labs, an entity under the jurisdiction of India‚Äôs Financial Intelligence Unit. The Wazirx exchange token experienced a severe dump yesterday due to the news of its delisting from Binance exchange, and its price dropped by nearly 60%. But I don't think this token will disappear like FTT exchange. Was there a buying opportunity at this point? We'll see. üòâ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/whEHSHs2ax ‚Äî Aboozar (@Aboozar_trader) December 19, 2024 Following the delisting, WRX experienced a dramatic 59% drop in value, signaling a loss of investor confidence in both the token and the exchange. Binance Alpha mishap sees investors accrue big losses Binance caused a stir when it posted a list of ‚Äúalpha watchlist tokens‚Äù to one of its official Telegram channels. The post, which highlighted five early-stage crypto projects, triggered a sudden spike in the prices of the mentioned tokens. However, the exchange later clarified that the information was inaccurate, resulting in the tokens losing their newly gained value. The post identified Wise Monkey (MONKY), Happy Cat (HAPPY), Rifampicin (RIF), Zircuit (ZRC), and ai16zeliza (ELIZA) as projects with ‚Äústrong fundamentals‚Äù and ‚Äúactive communities.‚Äù Speculation quickly spread among traders that the Telegram group could be a fake attempt to manipulate the market. As reported by Cryptopolitan , the post had originated from binance_web3_wallet_community, an official Binance channel. Following the clarification, the price of MONKY surged by 38% before plummeting by 22% when the false nature of the announcement was confirmed. One trader suffered significant losses, buying 1.42 million ELIZA tokens at $0.1376, only to see the price fall after the correction was issued. The trader was forced to panic sell at $0.09567, with the remaining position liquidated at just $0.01157, resulting in a $102,000 loss within 12 minutes. Binance‚Äôs Outlook for 2025: A Focus on High-Quality Assets As Binance moves into 2025, its trading strategy appears centered around fostering a more curated and secure marketplace. Binance‚Äôs approach reflects a growing trend among exchanges to streamline their offerings in the face of growing regulatory scrutiny and evolving market conditions. The exchange is expected to continue its practice of periodically reviewing all tokens listed on its platform, ensuring they meet standards like having a strong, committed project team, technological improvements, high levels of trading activity and liquidity, with a safe, stable network environment Binance has also been under increased regulatory pressure in several jurisdictions, and staying ahead of new regulatory developments could be a priority moving forward. It will also likely expand its focus on the US, riding on President-elect Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance.

During the week following Christmas, the total market cap of cryptocurrencies increased by as much as 11.87%! This year, as the market prepares for another Santa Claus Rally, Monero (XMR), Litecoin (LTC), and BlockDAG (BDAG) are poised to lead with their promising growth potential. Monero has experienced a 50% increase in the past month thanks to its strong focus on privacy. Meanwhile, Litecoin has shown remarkable resilience after a 13.59% decrease last week, positioning itself for a potential 15% gain. BlockDAG (BDAG) is at the forefront of the festive surge. Its sophisticated DAG-based framework and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), detailed in the newly released Whitepaper V3, provide unmatched scalability and ease for developers. With a bullish market forecast, analysts are optimistic about BlockDAG‚Äôs potential to reach a $1 price point, as the crypto sector heads into its most vibrant season. Monero Set for Rally Gains Amid Privacy Focus Monero remains in the spotlight as the market anticipates the Santa Claus Rally. This privacy-centric cryptocurrency has surged nearly 50% recently, trading between $172 and $250. Analysts believe Monero could overcome its $278 resistance, potentially reaching $356 if the rally strengthens. With technical indicators like the RSI and Stochastic showing that Monero is potentially undervalued, a rebound may be on the horizon. Monero‚Äôs commitment to secure, anonymous transactions continues to attract attention, underlining its appeal. Litecoin‚Äôs Resilience Poised to Turn Profitable Despite a recent dip of 13.59%, Litecoin‚Äôs price is stabilizing between $103 and $136.79. It has recovered impressively, showing nearly 40% growth this month and a 60% increase over six months. Analysts suggest that breaking the $152 resistance could lead to a further 15% price increase. Market indicators, including an RSI of 40.49 and a Stochastic at 18.92, indicate that Litecoin might be approaching oversold territory, setting the stage for potential gains. With the holiday season fueling the Santa Claus Rally and sparking renewed interest in trading, Litecoin‚Äôs reputation for swift and cost-efficient transactions positions it for potential success. BlockDAG‚Äôs Whitepaper V3 & Price Surge Fuel Holiday Market Dynamics BlockDAG stands on the cusp of significant recognition during the much-anticipated Santa Claus Rally, capitalizing on its developer-centric blockchain technology to draw considerable interest. The release of Whitepaper V3 underscores BlockDAG‚Äôs sophisticated Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, seamlessly integrated with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This integration appeals to developers with its straightforward deployment using platforms like Remix, Hardhat, and Truffle, facilitating the launch of decentralized applications (dApps) that are both scalable and efficient. Impressive presale achievements underscore BlockDAG‚Äôs momentum, with more than $172 million raised and over 17.5 billion BDAG coins distributed. With a current presale price of $0.0234 per coin in batch 26, early participants have realized a remarkable 2240% ROI. Analysts suggest that BlockDAG‚Äôs distinctive attributes and recent advancements may lead to increased activity during December‚Äôs Santa Claus Rally, potentially elevating the BDAG coin‚Äôs price to $1 by the following year. Currently a leading contender among presale crypto assets, BlockDAG‚Äôs scalable DAG infrastructure meets the growing demand for high-throughput solutions in modern applications, while its compatibility with Ethereum tools offers a familiar environment for developers. The timing of BlockDAG‚Äôs advancements perfectly coincides with the holiday rally, providing market participants with an enticing chance to engage with a project set to revolutionize the blockchain industry. BlockDAG is establishing itself as a significant force in the Layer 1 arena, ready to benefit from the anticipated market expansion this December, supported by festive market enthusiasm. Seize the Moment in the Holiday Crypto Wave! The Santa Claus Rally is already catalyzing market action, with major players making significant moves. Monero is positioned to potentially hit $356, Litecoin is gearing up for a strong rebound, and BlockDAG‚Äôs evolutionary potential could escalate its price from $0.0234 to $1 by next year. Participants are eagerly joining BlockDAG‚Äôs crypto presale following the impactful release of Whitepaper V3, which elaborates on its pioneering DAG technology and EVM compatibility. However, the window to acquire BDAG at $0.0234 is narrowing quickly. This holiday season could mark a critical pivot for traders‚Äîif they act swiftly before the rally concludes.

(NASDAQ: RUM ), a video-sharing platform, made headlines this week as its stock surged over 100% on December 23, reaching $14.30. The rally comes on the back of a $775 million investment announcement from Tether, the issuer of the leading stablecoin USDT , marking Rumble‚Äôs highest close since September 2022. As of press time, Rumble‚Äôs stock is trading at $13.30, reflecting a five-day gain of 63%. On a year-to-date basis, the stock has surged an impressive 206%, reflecting heightened investor interest. Rumble year-to-date price chart. Source: Finbold Tether‚Äôs $775 million investment on Rumble The announcement revealed that Tether has agreed to purchase approximately 103.3 million shares of Rumble‚Äôs Class A Common Stock at $7.50 per share. This transaction will generate gross proceeds of $775 million, significantly strengthening Rumble‚Äôs financial position, which already benefits from holding more cash than debt. Rumble has outlined a clear plan for utilizing the funds. Of the total, $250 million will support growth initiatives aimed at enhancing platform engagement and monetization, while $525 million will finance a self-tender offer to repurchase up to 70 million shares of Class A Common Stock at the same $7.50 price offered to Tether. This tender offer is designed to provide liquidity to stockholders and reinforce shareholder value. ‚ÄúI truly believe Tether is the perfect partner that can put a rocket pack on the back of Rumble as we prepare for our next phase of growth.‚Äù- Chris Pavlovski, Rumble‚Äôs Chairman and CEO, Interestingly, this agreement comes shortly after Rumble‚Äôs board approved allocating a portion of its cash reserves to Bitcoin ( BTC ), with plans to purchase up to $20 million in the cryptocurrency. Revenue growth and user metrics The recent surge in Rumble‚Äôs stock price has brought renewed attention to the company, which competes with major players like YouTube and Odysee. Rumble‚Äôs revenue has shown consistent growth, with the company reporting $25.06 million for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, a 39.34% year-over-year increase. Over the past 12 months, Rumble‚Äôs revenue climbed to $85.65 million, up 6.36% compared to the prior year. The platform‚Äôs global monthly active users (MAUs) have also increased , rising to an average of 67 million in Q3 2024 from 53 million in Q2 2024. However, the average revenue per user (ARPU) dropped to $0.33 in Q3 from $0.37 in the previous quarter, indicating room for improvement in monetization. Analyst views and valuation concerns Despite the excitement surrounding Tether‚Äôs investment, questions remain about Rumble‚Äôs valuation and growth prospects. Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein notes that while the $775 million equity investment strengthens Rumble‚Äôs balance sheet and alleviates liquidity concerns, the valuation appears ahead of its current advertising and subscription revenue performance. Analysts, including Wedbush‚Äôs Scott Devitt, have revised their outlook on Rumble, raising the price target from $8 to $10 but maintaining a neutral stance on the stock. While Tether‚Äôs $775 million investment is a major vote of confidence in Rumble‚Äôs potential, the company‚Äôs ability to sustain this momentum and deliver on its growth plans will be closely watched by investors.

You might also like: Cardano and Toncoin take a backseat as Lightchain AI presale shines Why Shiba Inu whales are focusing on LCAI Shiba Inu, known for its fun rise, has had large price jumps driven by communÕèity support and celebrity backing it. But, Lightchain AI is a coin that shows hope for long-term growth supported by fresh tech instead of only talk. This shift in investor focus from SHIB big players to LCAI shows that more people are finding true worth in the crypto space. Unlike a dog that lacks great uses beyond its funny charm, and a XRP that mainly serves as a money tool LCAI mixes blocks and AI to fix many real world problems making it a more interesting choice for investing. With a tiny presale fee of just $0.003, LCAI offers great chances for profit especially when compared with more popular tokens like DOGE and XRP. For an investor the current presale time of LCAI shows a unique chance to join a plan at its start with large growth likely as AI keeps changing areas all around the world. Why LCAI Could outperform DOGE and XRP in the race to $1 While XRP has seen significant price action based on its utility in the cross-border payments market and DOGE remains a beloved meme coin, Lightchain AI has the potential to outperform them both for several reasons. Technological Disruption: LCAI is leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain, making it one of the few projects positioned at the intersection of two rapidly growing sectors. Market Demand for AI Solutions: As industries increasingly adopt AI technologies, LCAI‚Äôs ability to power decentralized AI applications gives it a competitive edge in terms of both real-world utility and scalability. Strong Long-Term Vision: With key milestones on its roadmap, including the mainnet launch and increasing integration with various sectors, LCAI is poised to make a lasting impact on the market, unlike many meme coins. Will LCAI reach $1? Here‚Äôs what experts say Many cryptocurrency experts believe that Lightchain AI has the potential to surpass $1 in the near future. This optimism is driven by several factors. First, LCAI‚Äôs deflationary token model reduces its circulating supply through token burns, which, combined with increasing demand, is expected to drive its price upwards. Additionally, the growing adoption of AI-powered blockchain solutions positions LCAI as a highly relevant and scalable project with real-world applications that go beyond traditional cryptocurrencies. Finally, its low entry price during the presale offers a unique opportunity for early investors to benefit from its long-term potential. Comparing LCAI to DOGE and XRP Let‚Äôs take a look at the key differences between LCAI, DOGE, and XRP. Feature Lightchain AI Dogecoin XRP Technology AI + Blockchain Meme coin Payment solution Consensus Mechanism Proof of Intelligence Proof of Stake RippleNet Market Focus AI applications Community-driven hype Cross-border payments Price Potential High (100x+) Low to moderate Moderate Tokenomics Deflationary Inflationary Inflationary Lightchain AI is set to dominate the market Lightchain AI offers a unique combination of AI-powered blockchain solutions that make it a standout player in the cryptocurrency market. As Shiba Inu whales shift their focus towards LCAI, the altcoin‚Äôs 100x potential presents a compelling investment opportunity. With a low presale price of $0.003 and a projected value of $1 by 2025, LCAI is positioned to deliver unprecedented returns. It‚Äôs time to invest early before Lightchain AI takes the market by storm. So, for those looking to invest in a project with real-world utility and long-term potential, don‚Äôt overlook Lightchain AI .

The action comes as Kraken plans to file an objection to a recent order issued in favor of the SEC. According to a court filing dated December 23, the plaintiff US SEC and defendants Payward Inc and Payward Ventures (together, crypto exchange Kraken) have submitted a stipulation. Parties File Joint Statement On November 19, 2024, the Parties filed a joint statement regarding a discovery dispute concerning the SEC‚Äôs objections to Kraken‚Äôs requests for three categories of documents concerning: Bitcoin and Ether, the SEC‚Äôs public statements and testimony regarding digital assets, and the SEC‚Äôs internal trading policies on digital assets, However, in November, the court referred discovery disputes and all further discovery in this case to Magistrate Judge Robert M. Illman, who subsequently denied Kraken‚Äôs request to compel the production of the discovery. Despite this, Kraken believes that the documents are relevant to the case. SEC, Kraken Agree To Stay Deadline While the deadline to file objections to the order is December 30, Kraken intends to resubmit narrowed requests for production in line with the order. Notably, the US SEC and Kraken have agreed to stay the deadline to file objections to the order until March 31, 2025, to discuss a further extension. Kraken is represented by prominent lawyer Matthew C. Solomon, who is known for many high-profile cases including successfully defending Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in obtaining the dismissal with prejudice and successful defense of all other claims on summary judgment. Kraken requested an order to compel the SEC to produce documents explaining why Bitcoin and Ether were not included in the SEC‚Äôs complaint, despite being traded similarly to other tokens on the platform. However, the magistrate judge found Kraken‚Äôs argument ‚Äúunpersuasive.‚Äù Notably, Kraken and the broader crypto industry have asserted that former SEC official William Hinman‚Äôs speech is relevant to determining the status of Bitcoin and Ether under federal securities laws. Kraken has also argued for the fair notice defense and the major questions doctrine in the lawsuit.

Table of Contents Ripple‚Äôs XRP price recovering lost ground, trading around $2.2 DTX Exchange: ICO 90% completed Conclusion The anticipation in the cryptocurrency market toward the New Year is rising. Ripple‚Äôs XRP price has recovered its upward trend as it reduced its fall over the past week to single digits. Many indicators hint at another dramatic rise soon. With the crypto markets reaching historic highs, XRP‚Äôs price has attracted new investors. The market remains bullish about the anticipated results of Ripple‚Äôs legal proceedings and the rising adoption of XRP for cross-border use cases. The billion-dollar crypto markets are serving up an all-you-can-earn buffet to investors willing to invest thoughtfully in cryptocurrencies. An underdog contender is set to perform quite well in the next bull run, DTX Exchange (DTX). As the last moments of the year wind up, investors are lining up to buy up DTX Exchange, a new altcoin in the crypto community. DTX uses hybrid methodologies that offer users the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Ripple‚Äôs XRP price recovering lost ground, trading around $2.2 In December 2024, the XRP price surged to new heights and continued until last week, when the price dropped from $2.4 to $1.99. XRP price has been up almost 200% since the US elections, after which it experienced two steep drops in December. Source: CoinMarketCap These were due to overall market drops, and XRP price dropped less than the overall market. XRP‚Äôs price has also recovered quicker so far based on its sound technical performance and bullish sentiments around its future performance. Ripple is ranked as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency according to market cap, trailing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether, respectively. The expected launch of Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), has boosted XRP price‚Äôs positive momentum. Trading experts and technical crypto analysts are bullish on XRP‚Äôs growth prospects, with price forecasts of $5 and $7 by mid-2025 circulating. The trading technicals are also looking good, with a short-term bearish trend for the day traders, while the long-term traders are getting a buy signal at the current low prices. DTX Exchange: ICO 90% completed DTX Exchange is a promising new ICO with room for growth. In addition to its growth prospects, its future transformation of the crypto trading scene makes it a solid altcoin to hold on to. It merges features from CEX and DEX and removes the gap between TradFi and DeFi, which limits trading across these. DTX is the first crypto-native platform that allows for seamless trade of stock, forex, ETF trading, and over 100,000 currency pairs in one go. Thus, the company can grab a huge portion of the online trading platform market, With its smart approach to asset trading, DTX Exchange (DTX) is innovating the crypto industry. It uses blockchain technology to democratize real assets and convert them into digital tokens. This removes investment barriers and enhances liquidity in previously inaccessible marketplaces. Regular inventors can then trade these tokens at low costs. DTX Exchange‚Äôs presale has been amazing. After the presale began, the token‚Äôs price rose by over 500% from $0.02 to $0.12 in Stage 6. Conclusion For other investors who would like to mirror the success of the current Ripple millionaires, then DTX Exchange is a great option. Its presale is currently moving very quickly, with an expected official launch next year in Q1 2025. DTX could be the next big crypto, providing early backers with life-changing returns.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

About a month ago, the government ordered crypto mining entities to pause their operations for the winter season. However, the ban has now been extended. According to a report from local media Tass, the Russian Cabinet of Ministers has banned crypto mining, including local participation in mining pools, in select regions and territories from January 1, 2025, to March 15, 2031. Russia Bans Crypto Mining in Select Regions While the list of affected regions is not final, it includes areas like Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, Chechnya, the Donetsk Republic, the Lugansk People‚Äôs Republic, Zaporizhia, and Kherson. The ministers noted that the list remains subject to change based on the government‚Äôs decision on energy development. In addition to the ten areas, the government is temporarily prohibiting crypto mining in some territories in the Irkutsk, Buryatia, and Zabaikalsky Krai regions. These areas will refrain from engaging in mining activities during peak energy consumption periods from January 1 to March 15 in 2025 and from November 15 to March 15 in subsequent years. The Russian government‚Äôs decision stems from the need to maintain the country‚Äôs energy consumption balance. Last year, Russia became the world‚Äôs second-largest crypto miner after the United States, and since then, the country has used at least 16 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity yearly for such activities. High Energy Consumption Issue Currently, crypto mining accounts for 1.5% of Russia‚Äôs overall energy consumption, which has been challenging for regions with harsh climates. Additionally, high energy consumption has created an imbalance in electricity payments across several regions of the country. The government is working towards reducing or eliminating this imbalance. Sergey Kolobanov, deputy director of the Center for the Economy of Fuel and Energy Sectors at the Center for Strategic Research, said: The so-called interregional cross-subsidization, when the low cost of electricity in the regions of regulated contracts is de facto compensated by producers and consumers in other regions. The terms of restrictions on cryptocurrency mining are synchronized with the end of the transition period for the elimination of this benefit. Interestingly, Russia recently legalized crypto mining and introduced a mandatory registration service that allows the Federal Tax Service to obtain information on miners‚Äô assets and crypto wallets.

Historically, significant spot outflows happen during bull rallies , fueled by massive retail demand, buying and withdrawing the BTC to self-custody. However, this increased demand by retail investors could usually signal a price top for Bitcoin and other assets, requiring caution. BTC Spot Inflow/Outflow, 1 week, 2024. Source: CoinGlass / Finbold Nearly $1 billion of Bitcoin left Binance alone in a week In this context, Binance is by far the exchange with the largest individual outflow among its competitors. Nearly $1 billion in Bitcoin left the leading crypto exchange in the last seven days, followed distantly by Bitfinex. The second-largest weekly outflow was slightly above $500 million from Tether‚Äôs parent company. Interestingly, the third largest flow was a green one, with Coinbase registering $422 million in Bitcoin deposits inflow. Other exchanges like Bybit, OKX, Kraken , and Bitstamp also registered BTC outflows between $79 million and $260 million. Bitcoin BTC Spot Data Analysis, Heatmap (Net Inflow). Source: CoinGlass Usually, Bitcoin net inflows mean most investors are depositing BTC with the intention of selling. Meanwhile, net outflows would suggest the opposite, with bullish investors withdrawing what they have already bought. It is notable that, given its nature, inflows can usually precede huge price drops, as investors need to deposit before they can sell, being a proactive measurement. On the other hand, investors can only withdraw what they have already bought, so the outflows are a reactive metric and do not necessarily mean the price will increase after a large Bitcoin net outflow. As seen in the historical chart, outflows are a useful sentiment indicator that sometimes signals an upcoming reversal. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Starting at just $0.037, the token price has already seen significant momentum, with over $7.7 million raised, 374 million tokens sold, and a thriving base of more than 11,700 holders. What makes this presale particularly compelling is its dynamic pricing strategy. Each weekly phase brings a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. Investors who join early gain the advantage of securing $TICS tokens at their lowest prices, positioning themselves for substantial returns as the presale progresses. As the numbers climb, the growing enthusiasm reflects the immense potential of Qubetics‚Äô ecosystem. This presale is your moment to act if you‚Äôre seeking a transformative opportunity in the blockchain sector. Ethereum: Preparing for a 2025 Rally Ethereum‚Äôs performance has been scrutinised after a 17% drop last week. Despite this, analysts see a bright horizon, with predictions of a significant rally in 2025. Key bullish metrics are Driving this optimism, including moderately positive funding rates and an increased Korea Premium Index, highlighting growing demand from South Korean markets. Adding intrigue to Ethereum‚Äôs narrative is a high-stakes gamble by North Korean hackers that resulted in a $458,000 loss. While this episode underscores Ethereum‚Äôs price volatility, the fundamentals remain strong. Institutional and retail investors alike are showing renewed confidence, increasing Ethereum fund holdings even amid the dip. Could this signal the perfect entry point before Ethereum‚Äôs next big surge? Algorand: Building a Greener Blockchain Future Known for its eco-friendly approach, Algorand continues to stand out as a leader in sustainability.

These weren‚Äôt small-time players‚Äîthey were Ivy League graduates and high-powered financiers from companies like Morgan Stanley and BlackRock. They ditched secure, well-paying jobs for the unpredictable world of blockchain. For a while, it looked like they made the wrong call. FTX crumbled, Bitcoin tanked to $16,000, and crypto‚Äôs reputation hit rock bottom. Family, friends, and former colleagues couldn‚Äôt help but say, ‚ÄúTold you so.‚Äù Then came 2024. Bitcoin‚Äôs rally rewrote the narrative. Donald Trump‚Äôs shock election victory in November triggered a price explosion, revitalizing an industry many on the NYSE board had written off. Crypto companies are hiring again, venture capital is flowing into blockchain projects, and the markets are alive. The resurgence has given these risk-takers not only financial relief but also validation. Vivek Raman, a Yale graduate and former Wall Street trader, left behind nearly a decade of stability for crypto during the last bull run. He took a 75% pay cut and joined a blockchain startup. ‚Äú2024 changed it all,‚Äù Raman said. His startup, Etherealize, now focuses on bridging Wall Street and Ethereum ecosystems. He reportedly said he spent years asking himself, ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt we trading bonds on blockchains?‚Äù Now, the industry seems ready to answer that question. The tough road from TradFi to crypto Raman isn‚Äôt alone. Wall Street veterans who moved to crypto have lived through cycles of extreme highs and lows. Patrick Liou, a former BlackRock trader, saw Bitcoin hit $50,000 on his first day in crypto. But by 2022, everything fell apart. Bitcoin crashed, offices emptied, and the stigma around crypto careers became suffocating. Liou admitted there were moments he thought about returning to traditional finance. ‚ÄúBut it takes belief and courage to stick through it,‚Äù he said. Liou now works as a principal at Gemini, one of the few companies to survive the crypto winter intact. The recent rally has turned the tide. A friend thanked him for a 3x return on Bitcoin purchased years ago, while an old mentor called to congratulate him. When Bitcoin hit $100,000, Liou reportedly celebrated at Pubkey, the Bitcoin-themed bar in New York famous for hosting president Donald Trump during his campaign. ‚ÄúI finally convinced my wife to come with me,‚Äù he joked. Zach Pandl, once a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, now leads research at Grayscale Investments. He saw the current Bitcoin rally as more subdued but still transformative. Unlike earlier bull runs, this one is backed by institutional capital from giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. Michael Harvey, who moved to crypto giant Galaxy Digital in 2023 after nearly two decades in finance, recalled the doubts he faced when switching industries. On his first day, a colleague gave him a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label as a joke. It sat unopened on his desk for over a year. But now, with Bitcoin up over 500% from its 2022 lows, Harvey said he‚Äôs finally considering breaking it open. ‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs been good,‚Äù he said, according to the report. Do Bitcoin and Wall Street even go together? Bitcoin and Wall Street make an odd couple, like oil and water‚Äîor maybe like bankers and trust. For years, Wall Street dismissed Bitcoin as some anarchist experiment, too volatile and chaotic for the buttoned-up world of traditional finance. But now? The suits are lining up to get a piece of the action, calling it a ‚Äúhedge‚Äù or an ‚Äúalternative asset class‚Äù while carefully avoiding words like ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù or ‚Äúdecentralization.‚Äù But Wall Street loves a good story, and this one has legs, especially when the Federal Reserve keeps printing money like it‚Äôs going out of style. Adding Bitcoin to portfolios gives institutions something to parade around at investor meetings. ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôre hip and forward-thinking!‚Äù Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise‚Äîup over 500% since the depths of 2022‚Äîmeans the returns are hard to ignore, even for the skeptics. But here‚Äôs the thing: Bitcoin and Wall Street still don‚Äôt really mix. Wall Street wants control, stability, and predictability. Bitcoin offers the opposite. Its price swings like a wrecking ball, jumping over $108,000 one Monday and slipping below $92,000 the next. Wall Street might claim to embrace volatility, but when things get messy, they‚Äôre quick to pull the plug. So when Wall Street starts offering Bitcoin ETFs or custody services, they‚Äôre not ‚Äújoining the revolution.‚Äù They‚Äôre just finding ways to skim off the top. The culture clash is real. Bitcoin‚Äôs core ethos is about financial sovereignty, putting power back in the hands of people. Wall Street is about squeezing out profits wherever possible, often at the expense of the people. So, do they go together? Technically, yes. Philosophically? Not a chance.

Pepe ( PEPE ), the third-biggest meme coin, surged in a high-volume environment as investors bought the recent dip. This rally happened as Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped to $98,500, and the crypto fear and greed index approached the greed zone. Most cryptocurrencies rallied, with the market cap of all coins tracked by CoinGecko hitting a high of $3.60 trillion. Pepe had a 24-hour volume of $2.2 billion, while the futures open interest rose for the third consecutive day, reaching a high of $151 million. It has jumped to the highest level since December 30. The coin also jumped as signs showed that Pepe was the cheapest it has been since Nov. 5 in terms of the Market Value to Realized Value indicator. The MVRV-Z score indicator is widely seen as one of the most accurate indicators in predicting tops and bottoms. You might also like: Hedera Hashgraph price soars as predicted: What‚Äôs next for HBAR? This indicator is calculated by considering an asset‚Äôs market price and the realized value. This MVRV value has dropped to 1.28, a sign that it has become highly oversold. The last time that Pepe had this MVRV value was in November, and the coin staged a strong rally to an all-time high of $0.00002830. Pepe MVRV ratio | Source: IntoTheBlock The other contrarian case for Pepe is that there are signs that speculators capitulated and exited their trades. Data shows that the number of active, new, and zero balance addresses dropped by over 20% in the last seven days. As shown below, the active addresses ratio has dropped to 1.34%, its lowest level in over a month. Most Pepe price breakouts happen when the ratio is falling. Pepe active addresses ratio | Source: IntoTheBlock Pepe coin price analysis Pepe chart | source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Pepe coin price peaked at $0.00002830 earlier this month and then suffered a harsh reversal. It dropped below the important support level at $0.00001713, the upper side of the cup and handle pattern that formed between May and November. A break and retest pattern is usually a sign of a continuation. Pepe remained above the 100-day moving average and is attempting to flip the 50-day MA. So, is the Pepe price crash over? Not yet, since this rebound may be a dead cat bounce. It may also be part of the formation of a bearish flag chart pattern, a popular downward continuation sign. Therefore, there is a risk that the coin will resume the downward trend once the Santa Claus rally ends. A complete bullish breakout will be confirmed when the coin rises above the psychological point at $0.000025. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

The analyst predicts that the top meme coin is on the verge of a massive breakout and could witness an 11x price increase when that happens. FLOKI Price On The Verge Of A Massive Breakout In an X post, Master Kenobi opined that the FLOKI price is on the verge of a massive breakout. He explained that a repetitive structure is beginning to take shape for the third consecutive cycle, indicating that the price is imminent. The analyst‚Äôs accompanying chart showed that the top meme coin could record an 11x price increase and rally above $0.00080 when this breakout happens. Master Kenobi noted that this price pump lasts approximately 35 days. Meanwhile, based on a 112-day measurement as a reference point, the crypto analyst added that this projected price rally is about two weeks away from happening. Master Kenobi also reaffirmed that FLOKI should pump by at least 10 to 11x when this rally finally occurs. If the FLOKI price pump doesn‚Äôt begin in the next two weeks, Master Kenobi suggested that it could happen in early February based on the 140-day scenario he highlighted on the chart. On a macro scale, the crypto analyst added that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also seems to confirm the breakout pattern, adding further confidence to this potential scenario. This rally to $0.0008 is unlikely to be the market top for FLOKI as the crypto analyst had predicted that the meme coin could delete another zero from its price. Master Kenobi previously predicted that the meme coin would reach $0.0023 by March next year. Fundamentals Support A Price Surge Floki‚Äôs fundamentals also support a price surge for the top meme coin. In an X post , the team announced that the University of Floki is live, which provides a bullish outlook for the FLOKI price. Floki announced that the crypto education platform aims to bridge the knowledge gap for the next wave of crypto users, making blockchain and web3 technology accessible to everyone. The University of Floki plans to cater to crypto novices and experts looking to deepen their knowledge. The education platform offers expert-led courses across key areas, including DeFi, Security, Finance, Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and NFTs. This initiative is expected to draw more attention to the Floki ecosystem and could ultimately contribute to the imminent FLOKI price breakout.

Expert Sets Prediction For Breakout Timing,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/can-dogecoin-hit-4-expert-sets-prediction-for-breakout-timing/,"Analysts and investors alike have Dogecoin under the lens, particularly in light of recent forecasts indicating a possible price spike. Market analyst Javier Santini has made headlines with his forecast that Dogecoin could hit $4 within a week after an ongoing correction phase. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Hints at Revival: Can It Defy The Odds? Analyst‚Äôs Take Javier Santini, founder of Elemento Cripto, bases his prediction on how prices have changed since Dogecoin‚Äôs start in 2017. He says that drops below all-time highs are likely to last for a month or more before the coin starts to rise again. Every mid cool-off (below ATH) since the beginning of $DOGE has exactly 1 month of duration at +24th. A fact since 2017. The next and first hyperbolic push will start next week and should reach $4 in a week or less. $XRP to $25. The news should be very unexpected. pic.twitter.com/1Y2HpinqrH ‚Äî Javier Santini (@javierosantini) December 21, 2024 After hitting a high of $0.48 in the wake of the US presidential election results in early December, Dogecoin is currently undergoing a correction. It has since fallen 35%, but according to Santini, this collapse is a normal part of the market cycle. Santini claims that the historical data for Dogecoin demonstrates recurring trends throughout corrections. Based on Dogecoin‚Äôs weekly chart, he provided insights that showed each mid-cool-off period has lasted approximately one month. He believes that Dogecoin will have a huge rally following this correction, which he believes will end soon, and may hit $4 in as little as a week. Compared to its current price of roughly $0.3253, this would indicate an astounding growth of over 1,168%. Market Sentiment And General Patterns Dogecoin excites and worries people. Some investors are wary about cryptocurrencies due to their volatility, but others want to profit. While the correction has garnered attention, analysts like Santini say such swings are normal and often precede major rallies. Other expert @Degengambleh predicts Dogecoin will reach $4.20, supporting Santini‚Äôs optimistic estimate. He foresees another rise since a 1,000-day accumulation pattern shows substantial underlying support for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Break $3,500 Before End Of 2024? Analyst Weighs In Multiple Variables Whether Dogecoin actually achieves these lofty goals going forward will depend on numerous variables, including market mood and more general developments within the cryptocurrency space. Very soon, we may yet witness another chapter in this remarkable history of Dogecoin‚Äôs‚Äîa swift rise after a period of consolidation‚Äîif Santini‚Äôs theory is correct. Even though the prediction of Dogecoin‚Äôs price is quite vague, there is an optimistic atmosphere that one gets from the previous trends and how the market behaves nowadays. With this, investors are challenged to be aware and really conduct in-depth research along the way as they ride this dynamic financial landscape.

The first explored the electoral track record of Fairshake PAC's strategy and the second its intense use of a 2010 Supreme Court stance. The leaders of the companies responsible for the river of money that flooded U.S. political shores this year have already benefited tremendously from the outcome of last month's election ‚Äî increasing their personal fortunes by billions of dollars, far outpacing the large spending they devoted to crypto-friendly candidates. Coinbase Inc. (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong and his company devoted some $74 million to the industry's dominant political action committee, Fairshake, putting Armstrong in a close lead over a few other crypto insiders. That's an especially significant amount of money from a company that booked about $95 million in 2023 profits. But the elections went their way, and the company's value has ballooned by $21 billion since Nov. 4, the day before in-person voting began and the outcome became clear. In a pre-programmed series of trades starting less than a week after the election, Armstrong sold $100 million worth of his Coinbase shares. Those same shares on the night before the election had been worth about $39 million less. A week after that, he cashed in about $313 million ‚Äî all part of a selling strategy he'd set in motion if the price spiked. Since then, the co-founder and CEO sold smaller amounts week after week, for a total of about $437 million for stock that was worth $308 million before the victories of President-elect Donald Trump and a slate of congressional lawmakers backed by crypto. In other words, the pro-crypto sentiment surging after the election outcome that Armstrong helped shape earned him an additional $129 million in wealth for the shares he sold. He still owns more than 10% of the largest U.S. crypto exchange, and the value of about 24 million shares tucked into his trust, according to the latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings, is about $6.4 billion ‚Äî up near $2 billion since Nov. 5. Armstrong's stock sales were planned less than three months before the U.S. elections, submitted in a formal strategy meant to distance corporate insiders from accusations of gaming the markets. And the sales haven't yet reached the halfway point of the SEC-disclosed intent to offload as many as 3.75 million shares, depending on the stock price meeting ""certain threshold prices specified in the Armstrong Plan."" He took to social media site X to explain the plan several days before the elections, saying he was diversifying ""to make investments in moonshots"" but would be keeping the ""vast majority"" of his shares. He said he put the price targets so high that he didn't expect that most of it would sell in the next year ""unless we do much better than expected."" COIN's stock is currently trading around $276, up from around $186 on Nov. 4. A Coinbase spokesperson referred CoinDesk to that post when asked for comment. His rivals among crypto leaders who devoted similar levels of cash to the elections included Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the namesake chiefs of investment firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Ripple gave $73 million, and a16z put in $70 million, including large amounts held over for the next election cycle in 2026. Garlinghouse reportedly owns more than 6% of Ripple, the company, and a large but unspecified amount of the token tied to it, XRP. Various reports put him high among the list of U.S. billionaires as a result. In the wake of the election, XRP surged to become the third-largest crypto asset by market cap. While Garlinghouse chose not to weigh in with details on his net worth, he credited excitement over the return of Trump to the White House in a statement to CoinDesk. ""The crypto market is up over $1 trillion since Trump won ‚Äî that‚Äôs the price of Gensler‚Äôs foot on the neck of the market, and he‚Äôs not even officially gone yet,"" Garlinghouse said. Since the election, Garlinghouse's holdings of XRP have multiplied more than three times as the price of the token jumped from $0.50 to $2.32. And though the non-public Ripple Labs valuation is uncertain and was last set in the neighborhood of $11 billion earlier this year, the election has almost certainly boosted the worth of his major stake. Garlinghouse's personal wealth has likely skyrocketed as a result. The financial status of Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz is even murkier, but both men have gained dramatically since last month from their many stakes in crypto companies, likely outpacing the money they devoted to U.S. politics. But the financial figures aren't available for a16z's investments in private companies as they are for public Coinbase. The firm's vast crypto portfolio includes stakes in Coinbase, Uniswap, Solana, EigenLayer and Anchorage Digital and dozens of others. Virtually all of them became more valuable as the U.S. executive branch will be run by Trump, who says he'll be the crypto president, and the 535-member Congress includes some 300 predicted to be supportive of digital assets ‚Äî including the dozens just supported by Fairshake in their elections. But a company spokesman declined to comment on CoinDesk's review of the gains for Andreessen and Horowitz as individuals. A16z's dip into U.S. politics was aimed ""to help advance clear rules of the road that will support American innovation while holding bad actors to account,"" according to a post from the firm's Chris Dixon. Separately from Fairshake, Andreessen and Horowitz backed Trump's election effort . And Andreessen has become an adviser to the pro-crypto president-elect as he prepares to start his second term next month. The crypto benefactors from Coinbase, Ripple and a16z combined to make the Fairshake super PAC and its affiliates into the most powerful corporate campaign-finance effort in the 2024 elections, helping 53 members of next year's Congress win their races. However, Fairshake didn't weigh in on the presidential election, which may have had the largest effect on crypto market prices. Garlinghouse, in a post-election interview on 60 Minutes , said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs clear that Donald Trump embraced crypto and crypto embraced Donald Trump."" While he didn't claim credit for Trump's success, Garlinghouse said the crypto PACs ""absolutely helped supercharge the candidates"" and influenced outcomes in congressional contests. His company pledged $5 million in XRP to Trump's inauguration ‚Äî the celebration next month of his return to the presidency ‚Äî and Coinbase and fellow U.S. crypto exchange Kraken have also raised their hands to fund it. During the elections, the crypto industry was accused by its critics of being remarkably transactional in its political strategy ‚Äî putting money into the best places to ensure future pro-crypto votes on legislation and buying more than $130 million in congressional campaign ads with framing across the political spectrum (and without mentioning crypto). Gains for the sector have meant a boost for the three main companies behind Fairshake and for their individual leaders, who are tied to them financially. The sector's political effort went in ""purely on interests of the specific industry,"" said Rick Claypool, the research director at Public Citizen who has examined crypto's campaign spending. ""Short term, obviously this has caused a big bump in crypto."" The return on investment for industries putting money into politics can ""often be pretty good,"" said Mark Hays, a senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform, who has also worked on campaign finance issues. ""Crypto is newer, and so the opportunity for growth is larger."" While Armstrong and the others prefer a political narrative that features a grassroots upswell in crypto voters that shifted the elections, he and his company were directly behind establishing Stand With Crypto, the group that's billed as a grassroots effort to harness the will of crypto voters. And Fairshake's political influence was based almost entirely on money from Coinbase and the partner companies, plus smaller amounts from Jump Crypto and Gemini. Gemini's leaders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, were also among Trump's loudest fans in crypto . The day after the voting, Cameron Winklevoss posted on X : ""Imagine how much we are going to accomplish in the next 4 years now that the crypto industry won't be hemorrhaging $ billions on legal fees fighting the SEC and instead investing this money into building the future of money. Amazing awaits."" On Nov. 11, the day Armstrong began selling large amounts of Coinbase stock, Tyler Winklevoss posted , ""The shackles are off, 100k incoming.""

Not now, not ever. During a press conference following the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy meeting, Powell made it painfully clear that any plan to stockpile Bitcoin wouldn‚Äôt get his support. The result? The crypto market took an immediate nosedive. Bitcoin‚Äôs price, which had been climbing earlier this week, pulled back hard. The odds of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (BSR) dropped from 40% to 34% on Polymarket just hours after Powell spoke. Meanwhile, the entire crypto market lost 7.5% of its value, wiping out billions in the blink of an eye. It‚Äôs no surprise traders panicked. But here‚Äôs the thing, a recent report on Wu Blockchain has pointed out that Trump doesn‚Äôt need the Fed‚Äôs approval to start stacking BTC, as we had initially feared . Trump‚Äôs executive workaround But Trump doesn‚Äôt have to care what Powell says. Why? Because as it turns out, Powell actually can‚Äôt stop him. If Trump wants a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, he doesn‚Äôt need Powell or the Fed. He can go straight to the U.S. Treasury and make it happen with an executive order. Here‚Äôs how it works: The Treasury Department controls something called the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). This fund was created to stabilize the U.S. dollar and handle financial crises. It holds assets like gold, U.S. dollars, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). What it doesn‚Äôt hold‚Äîyet‚Äîis Bitcoin. Trump could issue an executive order instructing the Treasury to change that. Simple. Unlike most government spending, the ESF doesn‚Äôt require Congress to approve its budget. This gives the President and Treasury Secretary an unusual level of control over how the fund is used. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Treasury leveraged the ESF to bail out markets, and Congress had to scramble afterward to impose restrictions. If Trump taps into this fund to buy Bitcoin , Congress might investigate, but by then, the purchases could already be underway. It‚Äôs a fast and dirty option, but it‚Äôs not bulletproof. Executive orders don‚Äôt last forever. Another President could come along, erase Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin initiative, and move the ESF money back to safer, more traditional investments. Still, as a short-term strategy, it‚Äôs one way to bypass Congress entirely. A legal path through Congress Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has already proposed legislation for this. Her ‚ÄúU.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act‚Äù is currently sitting with the Senate Banking Committee. Here‚Äôs the catch: passing a bill in Congress isn‚Äôt easy. Even with Republican majorities, bipartisan support is rare these days. The process could take months, if not years. Both the House and Senate would have to approve the bill before Trump could sign it into law. Why bother with the legislative route? It offers stability. Unlike an executive order, a law can‚Äôt be undone by the next administration with the stroke of a pen. A Congressional mandate would lock Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system as a strategic asset, creating a framework for future reserves. For Trump, it‚Äôs a gamble. The legislative process is slow, and crypto doesn‚Äôt exactly have unanimous support on Capitol Hill . But if successful, it would be the strongest endorsement of Bitcoin as part of America‚Äôs financial future, just the way he‚Äôs been saying he wants it. What about the Fed? Some people might wonder if the Federal Reserve could just start buying Bitcoin itself. Theoretically, yes. The Fed conducts open market operations all the time, buying and selling assets like government bonds to stabilize the economy. But Powell‚Äôs comments suggest this won‚Äôt happen anytime soon. ‚ÄúThe Fed is not the place for Bitcoin,‚Äù Powell said. That‚Äôs a pretty definitive no. Even if the Fed wanted to purchase Bitcoin, it would need a new policy framework and likely some changes to existing laws. Powell has made it clear he‚Äôs not interested in pushing for either. This leaves the Treasury as the only real option for a government-led Bitcoin reserve . And while Powell might not like the idea, he can‚Äôt stop the Treasury from acting independently. The Trump factor Trump appointed Powell as Fed Chair in 2018, but their relationship soured almost immediately. The president spent much of his first term bashing Powell for raising interest rates, even threatening to fire him over and over. Fast-forward to 2024, and nothing has changed. Trump still views Powell as an obstacle, and he very much wants his job. Interestingly, the president‚Äôs family crypto project, World Liberty , wasted no time reacting to Powell‚Äôs speech. On-chain data shows the project started buying altcoins just two minutes after the press conference began. All of them almost immediately saw losses, but we don‚Äôt think Trump is bothered.

In a new report , the Open Dialogue Foundation (ODF) provides an overview and analysis of upcoming regulatory proposals around non-custodial Bitcoin and crypto wallets in the European Union (E.U.). Some of the proposals ‚Äî many of which are based on FATF recommendations ‚Äî will negatively affect users‚Äô ability to transact with crypto assets privately. EU & FATF 2025: Your Bitcoin Wallet's New Rules? What is the best Christmas gift from human rights, privacy and Bitcoin advocates? @ODFoundation provides you with a comprehensive respond on what you should know while using #Bitcoin p2p wallet, privacy payments tools &‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/YZIlCZjSiR ‚Äî Lyudmyla Kozlovska üá™üá∫üá∫üá¶ (@LyudaKozlovska) December 24, 2024 Important takeaways from the report include: According to guidelines from the European Banking Authority (EBA), the current regulatory framework around crypto assets in the E.U. allows for actions that pose significant risks, including immediate withdrawals to non-custodial wallets and the use of anonymity-enhancing tools like mixers. Forthcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) regulation may influence Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) to adopt stricter AML/KYC practices. Regulation from the E.U. may prohibit CASPs from facilitating anonymous transactions, which would both reduce privacy for users of crypto-assets and increase operational costs for CASPs. The obligations that may be imposed on CASPs will conflict with the rise of proliferation of open-source technologies like the Lightning Network, Fedimint and ecash, which let users transact privately and in a censorship-resistant manner. Do I share this all because I‚Äôm trying to ruin your holiday season? No, sirs and ma‚Äôams. I share it because we should be grateful for the work that the Open Dialogue Foundation does in shedding light on what‚Äôs happening within the regulatory landscape in the E.U. (especially as it pertains to non-custodial crypto wallets) and in developing relationships with elected officials in the E.U. to educate them on the importance of Bitcoin and other freedom technologies. So, if you‚Äôre looking to make a tax-deductible donation to a nonprofit before the year is out, consider donating to the ODF . And if you‚Äôre thinking either ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt live in the E.U., so this doesn‚Äôt affect me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI do live in the E.U., but I‚Äôll just move if it passes bad regulation,‚Äù I‚Äôd asking you to consider the following two points, (the first of which I lifted directly from this recent ODF report): The European Union plays a central role in shaping global financial regulatory standards (which means that crypto transaction privacy advocates across the globe have something at stake here). The organization making many of the proposals for the new regulatory framework in the E.U. ‚Äî the FATF ‚Äî is an international one, and it will leverage any wins it chalks up in the E.U. to influence regulation in other jurisdictions. But, again, don‚Äôt be scared; be grateful. Donate to the ODF to support its efforts, or do what you can to amplify the organization‚Äôs messaging. This article is a Take .

As a relatively new and rapidly growing asset class, cryptocurrencies attract increasing interest from investors and governments. As the global economy adapts to this digital innovation, countries take different cryptocurrency regulation and taxation approaches. How do cryptocurrency tax policies work around the world? Table of Contents Which countries require you to pay taxes on cryptocurrencies? Why do some countries not have to pay taxes on cryptocurrencies? Countries where cryptocurrencies are banned Why do some countries not pay taxes on cryptocurrency? What‚Äôs next for cryptocurrency taxation? Which countries require you to pay taxes on cryptocurrencies? In the United States, it is simply impossible not to pay taxes ‚Äî the authorities are very strict about this and tax almost everything, including digital assets. Crypto is treated as property, not currency. This means taxpayers must pay capital gains taxes when selling cryptocurrencies. The profit is subject to either short-term or long-term capital gains tax rates depending on how long the asset is held (less than one year or more). Crypto taxes in the U.S. | Source: Kraken In the UK , the picture is much the same ‚Äî cryptocurrencies are taxed like other assets. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applies to income above a tax threshold. If the revenue from cryptocurrency trading exceeds a certain amount, the taxpayer must file a tax return and pay tax. The Australian Tax Office also classifies cryptocurrencies as assets. Investors must pay capital gains tax if they sell their tokens at a profit. However, there is a minor clarification ‚Äî in some cases, cryptocurrencies used to purchase goods and services may be exempt from tax if the transaction amount does not exceed $10,000. Overall, Europe is leading, with Switzerland taking the lead: some residents of that country can not only pay for their purchases with cryptocurrency but also their taxes, the Federal Tax Administration (FTA) explains : ‚ÄúIf the salary or ancillary salary benefits are paid to the employee in the form of payment tokens, these are taxable as income from gainful employment 5 and must be shown on the salary certificate.‚Äù You might also like: Why the U.S. doesn‚Äôt need a tax on mining: Senator Lummis explains Why do some countries not have to pay taxes on cryptocurrencies? Several countries encourage the use of cryptocurrencies due to the absence of mandatory taxation ‚Äî this is how the authorities try to attract investors and create cryptocurrency startups. Portugal became one of the few countries where citizens are exempt from paying taxes on income received from cryptocurrency trading . There are exceptions when cryptocurrency is used in professional activities or business. In Germany , cryptocurrencies held for over a year are not subject to taxation when sold. This creates an incentive for long-term investment in crypto assets. However, the profit will be subject to capital gains tax if the crypto is sold before this period. Malta is actively developing its crypto industry and offers favorable taxation conditions. Cryptocurrencies are only taxed if they are sold or exchanged for fiat currency; otherwise, the tax does not apply. Crypto taxes in EU | Source: Protos However, there are countries where there is no need to pay taxes on cryptocurrencies simply because they are banned. Countries where cryptocurrencies are banned China is one of the most famous countries that ban cryptocurrencies. All cryptocurrency transactions were banned in 2021, and regulators were actively cracking down on mining. This has created significant problems for investors and crypto companies in the country. In Algeria, the use of cryptocurrencies, including trading and mining , is strictly prohibited. The African country does not allow cryptocurrency transactions, including exchange and sale, making it impossible to carry out such transactions in the country. Cryptocurrencies are also banned in several other countries, most of which are in the MENA and Asia regions, such as Morocco, Pakistan, and Indonesia . Why do some countries not pay taxes on cryptocurrency? In addition to the ban and investment attractiveness, some countries do not pay taxes on cryptocurrency for a straightforward reason: the authorities have not yet developed regulations for digital assets. For example, although Japan has recognized Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies as a legal means of exchange, many aspects of their regulation are being developed. Although the country has several rules regulating crypto exchanges, there are many gaps in the legislation regarding specific taxation factors. In Nepal, cryptocurrencies are still not clearly regulated, but they are de facto banned. Since the government has not developed legislation to regulate this class of assets, cryptocurrencies remain in a legal void.

Cryptocurrency taxation varies from country to country, leading to different approaches to regulating and taxing these digital assets. While some countries actively develop tax policies and regulations for handling cryptocurrencies, others remain in legal limbo, and some altogether prohibit their use. However, according to Chainalysis, cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow globally. Source: Chainalysis Cryptocurrency taxation is, therefore, likely to continue to evolve towards greater clarity and regulation, providing stability for investors and market participants.

If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 18:11:00

33767162,[object Object],1735065031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Dominance Breakdown Confirmed ‚Äì The Next Altseason Is Right Around The Corner,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-dominance-breakdown-confirmed-the-next-altseason-is-right-around-the-corner/,"Bitcoin has been struggling to reclaim the $100,000 mark, facing persistent resistance while finding strong support around $94,000. Yesterday brought an interesting twist to the crypto market. While BTC grappled with selling pressure and volatility, Altcoins stole the spotlight, with many posting impressive gains of over 10%. This shift hints at a potential change in market dynamics. Top analyst Jelle recently shared insightful data on X, highlighting a significant development in the Bitcoin dominance chart. According to Jelle, BTC dominance has broken down, and the breakdown has been confirmed, signaling a possible shift of capital flow toward Altcoins. This trend suggests that an Altseason‚Äîa period characterized by massive gains across Altcoins‚Äîcould be on the horizon. Altseasons have historically followed periods of BTC consolidation as investors look for higher returns in alternative cryptocurrencies. With BTC dominance weakening and Altcoins showing strength, the coming weeks could provide exciting opportunities for traders and investors seeking to diversify their portfolios. While Bitcoin continues its battle to break above six figures, the focus may temporarily shift toward Altcoins poised for explosive growth. Bitcoin Euphoria Spreads Into Altcoins The recent euphoria Bitcoin has experienced over the past few months is beginning to shift toward Altcoins, a natural flow in the crypto market where liquidity typically moves from BTC to alternative cryptocurrencies. This shift is becoming more evident as recent price fluctuations suggest that Altcoins are gearing up for a surge. After Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance and bullish sentiment in the market, Altcoins are now showing signs of strength, with many posting impressive gains. Top analyst Jelle recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X , revealing that Bitcoin dominance has broken down and confirmed this breakdown, which could mark the beginning of a new phase in the market. According to Jelle, the next Altseason, which historically follows periods of BTC consolidation, could be right around the corner, with a strong potential to kick off in 2025. Once Bitcoin dominance drops below the critical 55% level, a massive Altseason is likely to follow. This could lead to explosive price movements in Altcoins, offering traders and investors a new opportunity for growth. As BTC struggles to maintain dominance and faces resistance at key levels, Altcoins may become the next big winners. The combination of market sentiment, liquidity shifting, and key technical breakdowns suggests that the coming months could be filled with strong performances from alternative cryptocurrencies. BTC Holding Key Demand Levels Bitcoin is currently trading at $94,000 after testing the $92K level once again and holding it as strong support. This key demand zone has proven resilient, indicating that buyers are still active around this level. If BTC manages to hold above the $95K mark in the coming days, a reclaim of the $100K threshold would likely follow, confirming the continuation of the bullish trend. However, there is a high risk of a drop below $92K, which would trigger a sell-off and could lead to a deeper correction. If BTC remains above $92K, it would signal strength and support the bullish outlook, providing confidence to investors. On the other hand, if the price fails to maintain this support level and drops below $92K, it would suggest weakness and could prompt further selling pressure, potentially pushing the price lower. For the immediate short-term, staying above $92K is critical for maintaining momentum. A failure to do so could alter market sentiment and result in a shift towards bearish price action. Therefore, the next few days will be pivotal in determining Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term direction.

The listing comes after the stablecoin‚Äôs launch on December 17. According to the product listing page on Bullish, the Ripple stablecoin is now available for trading against six asset pairs: RLUSD/USDC, BTC/RLUSD, ETH/RLUSD, USD/RLUSD, EUR/RLUSD, and SOL/RLUSD. These trading pairs make the stablecoin one of the most extensively paired products introduced on the platform since early 2024. The addition of the Ripple stablecoin to Bullish‚Äôs trading platform is expected to broaden the stablecoin‚Äôs accessibility and adoption. As more exchanges onboard RLUSD and broader market conditions stabilize, the Ripple ecosystem may continue to expand its influence in the digital asset space. RLUSD gains momentum across exchanges Earlier today, Singapore-based exchange Independent Reserve also announced it had listed the stablecoin, adding to a growing roster of platforms supporting the token. Previously, the stablecoin was introduced on exchanges such as Bitso and Uphold, expanding its availability to a global user base. Data from CoinGecko places RLUSD‚Äôs market capitalization at $72.8 million, ranking it as the 691st largest cryptocurrency by market cap. RLUSD‚Äôs market capitalization ‚Äì Source: CoinGecko Over the past 24 hours, the stablecoin has recorded a trading volume of $2.7 million. Notably, the Ripple Stablecoin Tracker account reported that approximately 4.9 million new RLUSD tokens were minted during the same period. The stablecoin‚Äôs current market dynamics suggest it is drawing a steady growth trajectory, since its December 17 launch. Additionally, data from XPMarket indicates Ripple USD has seen a 0.22% uptick, which saw the stablecoin go back to maintaining its $1 peg after a short-term consolidation phase. The stablecoin‚Äôs market capitalization has grown significantly, rising from an initial $1.3 million to $4 million. At press time, the Ripple stablecoin‚Äôs fully diluted market cap now stands at $19.2 million, and it has attracted 6,900 unique holders, with the recent exchange listings likely to amplify its user base. RLUSD‚Äôs potential puts industry on notice The RLUSD stablecoin has drawn praise from industry leaders, including Charles Hoskinson, for its promising start. The token‚Äôs growing presence across major trading platforms and its diverse trading pairs position it as a key player in the stablecoin market. Ripple Labs, the entity behind the stablecoin, believes it will be a valuable asset in cross-border payments. ‚ÄúAs we‚Äôve been using stablecoins more and more in our flows, that really piqued our interest that we should have our own native stablecoin that can be more cost-effective and operationally efficient to use,‚Äù Ripple‚Äôs senior vice president of stablecoins, Jack McDonald, told CNBC. Meanwhile, XRP, Ripple‚Äôs flagship token, continues to show robust trading activity. Over the past 24 hours, per Coingecko updates , XRP‚Äôs trading volume reached $11.09 billion, signaling significant market participation despite the persistent selling pressure felt in the entire crypto market.

These comments come at a time when there is a debate going on over whether crypto staking should be considered taxable. The creation of new value and the transfer of existing value are two different things. Staking is the former. Interest income is the latter. ‚Äî David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 24, 2024 Staking Rewards And Interest Income Schwartz explained that the creation of new value and the transfer of existing value are two different things. ‚ÄúStaking is the former. Interest income is the latter,‚Äù he highlighted. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt earn staking rewards, you create them. They didn‚Äôt exist before you created them. Someone transferring existing value to you is not analogous,‚Äù he noted as he highlighted the unique nature of staking rewards compared to traditional financial income. How Is Crypto Staking Different From Dividends Previously, an X user had asked how crypto staking is different from getting dividends on stocks. Schartz responded expalining that ‚Äúyou get dividends from stocks, someone else created/earned them and transferred them to you. With crypto staking, you create the property you receive.‚Äù ‚ÄúStaking is creating property, not receiving it from someone else who earned/created it,‚Äù he added. IRS Says Crypto Staking Is Taxable This clarification is especially relevant as regulators and tax authorities continue to determine how to classify and tax various crypto activities. As per the latest Bloomberg report, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officially said that crypto staking is taxable, stating that tax liabilities arise as soon as staking rewards are received. This ruling came amidst an ongoing lawsuit from a Tennessee couple staking on the Tezos network, who filed a lawsuit against the government regarding the tax clarification for crypto staking and how the IRS views it. According to IRS guidelines released in 2023, block rewards from staking or mining are considered taxable income as soon as they are created, with tax liabilities determined by their market value at the time of creation. Crypto staking allows token holders to participate as validators in a proof-of-stake (PoS) system by locking their tokens in a staking contract. In return, they earn rewards, usually in the form of additional cryptocurrency. Crypto staking enables users to generate passive income without selling their assets.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-24 18:40:05

Based on several analyses, XRP could be eyeing a rally to its yearly high of $2.91. XRP Price Eyes Current ATH Following Latest Pump The XRP price is eyeing a rally to its current ATH following its 7% gains on Christmas Eve. Crypto analyst Javon Marks recently mentioned that XRP‚Äôs 4-hour chart is coming off a Hidden Bullish Divergence confirmation. He added that this suggests that XRP could recover over 30% to its 2024 high of $2.91, which could be on the horizon. The crypto analyst added that a continuation of this uptrend can lead to a new all-time high (ATH). Marks is confident that this projected rally is a matter of when not if. In anticipation of this rally, Ripple Whales have accumulated 40 million XRP, which also provides a bullish outlook for the crypto. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the XRP price. He stated that the XRP/BTC chart looks absolutely ‚Äúfantastic.‚Äù He suggested that a parabolic rally was on the horizon while revealing that he was looking to open another long position. The crypto analyst added that XRP‚Äôs chart is still the most bullish looking in the entire space off the lows.

The analyst added that XRP is now getting a bullish wave. However, she warned that the crypto is still under $2.38, meaning that it is still technically within this recent price correction. As the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and price climbs, CasiTrades noted that the structure looks promising and that XRP is still on track for the wave, pushing toward D targets around $2.60. Her accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could reach this Wave D target by December 26. Thus, she remarked that the crypto still has time to achieve this target. In the long term, a CoinGape market analysis showed that XRP could still reach double digits as it rises to $10 .

Here comes FXGuys ($FXG), a token that promises real-world utility and the potential to make $10,000 with $100. With its innovative features and growing investor interest, $FXG stands out as a top pick in a market increasingly focused on long-term value rather than speculation. Let‚Äôs discuss why $FXG is attracting investors who seek more reliable growth opportunities! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Is Dogecoin Heading for a Sharp Decline as the DOGE Price Falls? From its December 2024 high of $0.46, Dogecoin has lost more than 30%. CoinGlass data shows that DOGE has lost over 30% of its liquidity. The drop has triggered bearish sentiment, leaving investors concerned about the DeFi coin price trajectory. Technical indicators reveal a ‚ÄúDeath Cross‚Äù on the DOGE/USD chart, signaling potential further losses. This pattern forms when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, suggesting a negative market outlook. As bearish pressure builds, analysts predict that the DOGE DeFi coin price might slip below $0.20, intensifying investor concerns. Many are now exploring alternatives like FXGuys as they aim to make $10,000 with $100. The Avalanche DeFi Coin Price Slides Below $50: Will AVAX Rebound? Avalanche‚Äôs DeFi coin price has dropped 32% in just one week, shaking investor confidence. The fall pushed AVAX below the critical $50 psychological mark, intensifying bearish sentiment. Despite positive developments like the Avalanche 9000 upgrade and a $250 million funding round, the price continues to face pressure. Market analysts believe breaking below this key level signals a likely downtrend continuation. AVAX‚Äôs rising market cap, now at $15.59 billion, hasn‚Äôt prevented investors from exploring alternatives. The DeFi coin price struggles highlight concerns over long-term recovery. Many AVAX investors are now eyeing $FXG as a promising alternative, hoping to make $10,000 with $100. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG: The Token Delivering Real Value Beyond Hype in DeFi FXGuys is redefining trading by merging DeFi with real-world utility.

Consequently, investors worldwide need to understand the tax implications of owning, trading, and earning digital assets. Here is how 2025 faces the law. The regulatory space is intricate and constantly changing, with the US, the UK, and the EU each implementing unique tax regulations, rates, and exemptions. Paybis CEO Konstantin Vasilenko advised, ‚ÄúMany individuals who have dabbled in crypto were not initially aware that they would need to account for tax reporting and holdings. However, as tax regimes plan to increase their scrutiny starting in 2025, it‚Äôs crucial to be proactive.‚Äù Crypto tax policies in the US In the US, crypto is categorized as a digital asset. Consecutively, the Internal Revenue Service treats it the same as stocks, bonds, and other capital assets. Source: Blockpit Profits from crypto are taxed at different rates depending on whether they are considered capital gains or income. This is determined by how the crypto was purchased and how long it was held. Crypto tax requirements in the US vary depending on how you use your digital assets. This is because different activities are classified as taxable or non-taxable events. For instance, buying crypto with cash and merely holding it does not result in a tax. Only taxes are paid when selling the crypto, and the earnings are ‚Äúrealized.‚Äù In the case of donating crypto to a qualified charity, one may be eligible for a charitable deduction. Similarly, getting crypto as a gift is often tax-free until it is sold or used in a taxable activity such as staking. In the United States, when crypto is sold for more than it is paid for, it will be subject to capital gains tax. Losses, however, may be deductible. Converting from one crypto to another, such as trading Bitcoin for Ether, is considered a taxable event. This is because it entails selling one asset to get another. Similarly, using crypto to purchase goods or services requires one to pay capital gains tax, as the IRS considers this a sale. Also, crypto activities that generate income are subject to taxation. If your company pays you in crypto, it is considered taxable income in accordance with your tax bracket. Similarly, receiving crypto in exchange for products or services must be declared as income. Mining crypto generates taxable income depending on the fair market value of the coins received. Staking awards are taxed, with liabilities determined by the value of the payments when received. However, in a few instances, some crypto assets have been viewed as securities. This has caused misunderstandings. But, with the new administration, the regulations are expected to be more friendly. The UK regulatory framework in 2025 The UK‚Äôs HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) defines crypto as assets. This distinction implies that any gains or losses from crypto trades are subject to capital gains tax. Capital Gains Tax(CGT) is levied on any crypto disposal. This includes selling, using crypto to purchase products, swapping one crypto for another, and giving digital assets. Tax rates can be large, particularly for high-income earners, reaching up to 24%. But, basic-rate taxpayers pay a 10% tax rate on gains above the exemption threshold. Both basic-rate and higher-rate taxpayers now receive an exemption on the first ¬£3,000 of gains. This attracts more people to engage in the crypto industry. However, if these profits place a taxpayer in the higher-rate band, they will be liable to higher CGT rates. Certain crypto activities are subject to income tax in addition to capital gains. Profits from mining and crypto earned as employment compensation are taxed as income. Still, employers who pay in crypto must account for National Insurance Contributions both for themselves and their employees. Any further gains on crypto received as remuneration are normally liable to CGT. The UK has shown interest in making the nation crypto-friendly enough to compete with the US. This has raised expectations that 2025 will be good for crypto in the nation. Crypto tax policies within the European Union are likely to discourage investments Most European countries treat crypto as property, taxing earnings from sale, exchange, payment, and so forth. However, the nature of these levies differs greatly between countries. In Germany, crypto assets are classified as private money. On the other hand, earnings are tax-free if kept for more than a year. This promotes long-term investment. However, selling within a year results in income tax rates of up to 45%, with a 5.5% solidarity surcharge for incomes over ‚Ç¨10,908. On the contrary, Spain taxes crypto gains as ordinary income. This applies to those with rates ranging from 19% to 28%, regardless of holding term. Strict reporting requirements also apply to crypto trading and holdings. Also, Portugal, previously known for its lax crypto tax policy, has tightened regulations. Current rates range from 14.5% to 53%, with a basic 28% capital gains tax and special allowances for mining operations. Now, the EU is working toward harmonization with the markets in the area of crypto-assets (MiCA) Regulation. Moving forward, the MiCA legislation and the EU‚Äôs travel rule will go into effect in 2025, with an emphasis on anti-money laundering (AML) and countering financial crime. These measures are expected to intensify tax oversight, bringing more crypto activities under scrutiny by local authorities. The crypto industry doesn‚Äôt like hearing this, and it could affect crypto investments in EU nations.

While widespread selloffs and bearish sentiment dominate the broader narrative, a few standout altcoins are defying the odds, gaining traction with fundamentals, upcoming upgrades, and growing community support. These digital assets are positioning themselves for major market cap milestones as signs of market stabilization emerge. Against this backdrop, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies, Horizen ( ZEN ) and Conflux ( CFX ), as top candidates to achieve a $1 billion market cap in 2025. Horizen (ZEN) Horizen is gaining momentum as it positions itself to potentially hit a $1 billion market cap in 2025. Currently valued at $582 million, ZEN has surged 157% in the last week, with trading volume exceeding $320 million in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. The spike follows Grayscale‚Äôs submission of an 8-K form to the SEC for its Horizen Trust, which privately issued 3.56 million shares linked to 304,034 ZEN tokens worth $4.71 million, signaling increased institutional interest. Horizon price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The surge in price can also be attributed to several factors, including growing market confidence and an influx of investors looking to capitalize on the regulated investment vehicle. Further fueling the bullish outlook, Horizen recently underwent its final halving in December 2024 and plans to transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in 2025, increasing scarcity under its new tokenomics. Amid a broader market recovery, ZEN has emerged as a standout performer. Analysts predict ZEN could reach $50 by March 2025, potentially propelling its market cap to $1 billion as adoption and demand grow. Conflux (CFX) Conflux is gaining traction as it inches closer to a $1 billion market cap, currently valued at $800 million. The token has recorded an 8.31% gain over the past 24 hours, supported by strong trading volumes of $53.67 million. A significant 11.49% rise in open interest, now at $33.88 million, highlights growing investor activity and confidence in CFX‚Äôs future price movements. On Binance , long positions on CFX are dominating, with a long/short ratio exceeding 2:1, signaling bullish sentiment among traders. Conflux price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap With the broader market showing signs of recovery and increased demand for CFX, the token appears well-positioned to hit this milestone. For investors and traders, both Horizen and Conflux offer compelling opportunities backed by fundamentals and bullish technical indicators . Keeping a close eye on key price levels, trading volumes, and ecosystem developments will be crucial for capitalizing on their potential as these assets gear up for their next phase of growth.

Despite having a strong track record, Eugene outlined a series of mistakes that led to this costly misstep, while also noting important lessons learned. Eugene started by taking advantage of Bitcoin‚Äôs rise and made a profit from a long position between $102,000 and $107,000. He then shifted these gains into long positions in the Solana ecosystem, such as 220 SOL, 2.75 WIF, and 0.037 BONK, achieving a favorable risk-reward ratio. Initially confident due to Solana‚Äôs strong performance on lower time frames (LTF), Eugene later increased his SOL position from $20 million to $30 million when the market started to decline. Related News: Data Revealed: This Memecoin Has the Strongest Community Eugene admitted that his usual discipline in cutting losses had broken down. When SOL fell to $215, he resisted exiting the market, thinking $200 was a significant support level. Instead of reducing his exposure, he increased his position to $45 million, increasing the risk in an already volatile market. When SOL fell below the $200 support level, Eugene continued to wait, fearing that closing his large position could trigger a price cascade. Succumbing to ‚Äúdesperation,‚Äù he added leverage between $187 and $193, increasing his position to $60 million and increasing the potential downside impact. Eugene, whose unrealized losses were $7-8 million, decided to close 70% of his position at $193, losing $6.2 million (approximately -10.2%). Eugene explained that the transaction went awry due to an accumulation of errors and a ‚Äúsunk cost mentality.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

The Solana meme coin also saw an over 20% spike in its daily trading volume, which is currently well over $200 million amidst heavy interest from TradFi investors. However, sidelined investors may be concerned whether it is too late to buy $FARTCOIN now, and holders may be looking for the next new cryptocurrency to rotate profits to. Is It Too Late To Buy Fartcoin Now? As previously stated, the Fartcoin price is up by 62% on Tuesday. It is currently trading at just above $1, with a market capitalization of $1 billion and a trading volume of $280 million. Fartcoin was created from the Terminal of Truth AI agent, the same as the popular Goatseus Maximus token. It rose to fame earlier this month and even received significant interest from TradFi investors, something which other meme coins have failed to achieve. You‚Äôll see tradfi accounts tweet about Bitcoin from time to time, rarely ever any altsBut now we see tradfi accounts blasting out 3 tweets in a row about fartcoin No other coin has had this effect pic.twitter.com/vDDTsqkJOZ ‚Äî HornHairs üåä (@CryptoHornHairs) December 19, 2024 A big part of Fartcoin‚Äôs popularity is the meme coin‚Äôs hilarious name, and the bulls have no problem with it. They consider the slightly vulgar ticker to be a part of the overall charm. The name is also a key reason behind TradFi‚Äôs growing interest in the meme coin. Institutional investors simply can‚Äôt believe that such a thing as Fartcoin could exist and have a higher market capitalization than a large percentage of publicly traded American companies. For instance, Hedgeye reported that Fartcoin‚Äôs market cap was bigger than 38% of such companies when it had a market capitalization of just $560 million. BREAKING: Fartcoin's market cap is now greater than 38% of all American publicly-traded companies. pic.twitter.com/obLQK8LNTe ‚Äî Hedgeye (@Hedgeye) December 12, 2024 The new cryptocurrency was also the butt of many jokes ahead of December‚Äôs FOMC meeting. Many TradFi investors suggested that the Federal Reserve should restart their quantitative tightening if such a token could have a billion-dollar market cap. However, the bulls are quick to point out that Fartcoin is a community-centric meme coin. Even the token‚Äôs developer team exited early and the meme coin was largely promoted by the degens. Such new meme coins typically see tremendous success, as is evident by Fartcoin‚Äôs recent price action. While sidelined investors are concerned about whether it is too late to buy the Solana meme coin, these concerns are largely unsubstantiated, especially considering its daily Relative Strength Index (RSI-14) is hovering at 66, below the ‚Äúoversold‚Äù territory. In fact, meme coins see their RSI surge to 90 before they see any correction in a bull market. Is New Crypto Wall Street Pepe The Next Fartcoin? Fartcoin‚Äôs biggest strength is its community support. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is no different. WEPE has been one of the hottest new crypto presale coins of 2024 and has already raised over $35 million in less than a month. For perspective, the meme coin hasn‚Äôt even launched yet and already has a higher valuation than the pre-Binance market caps of gems like First Neiro On Ethereum and Act I: The Prophecy. $35M raised. Frogs are thriving. Energy‚Äôs high. Stay ready, stay focused, stay green. üê∏‚öîÔ∏èüöÄ pic.twitter.com/qdYWgKVn2X ‚Äî Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 23, 2024 Wall Street Pepe‚Äôs utilities are also about the community. In fact, its core mission is to challenge the dominance of whales in the meme coin sector and give a fair playing field to small-scale investors. In this regard, all WEPE holders will soon be members of an exclusive group and receive cutting-edge market alpha. They may even find the next 100x meme coin in that group, considering members can share their insights with each other as well. WEPE holders are already benefiting from the project‚Äôs presale staking pool, which is currently offering a reward rate of 37%. With a large amount of the supply already locked in staking, smart money investors are bullish on Wall Street Pepe‚Äôs growth potential. Some even predict up to 100x returns from the new crypto launch. Visit Wall Street Pepe Presale Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

As one of the standout performers this cycle, XRP experienced a massive surge following the US election, capturing investor attention. However, recent price action has introduced uncertainty, leaving some investors concerned about the possibility of further downside. Related Reading: Solana Holds Weekly Support At $180 ‚Äì Analyst Expects $330 Mid-Term Despite these fears, on-chain data suggests a different narrative. Insights from Santiment reveal that whales have accumulated another 40 million XRP in the past 24 hours. This significant accumulation indicates that Smart Money may be positioning itself for an upcoming rally. Historically, such whale activity has preceded major price movements, providing a bullish signal for long-term holders. XRP‚Äôs ability to maintain the $2.10 support level amid market fluctuations demonstrates resilience, but the next decisive move will depend on whether bulls can capitalize on this accumulation phase. If buying momentum continues and XRP breaks out of its current range, a push toward new highs could follow. XRP Continues To Signal Strength XRP continues to display resilience, trading above key support levels and attracting investors who recognize its long-term potential. Despite a significant 30% retrace from recent highs, XRP has held its ground, maintaining critical support zones that bolster a bullish outlook. This stability is driving confidence among market participants, with many seeing the altcoin as a top contender for future growth. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted compelling data from Santiment, showing that whales added another 40 million XRP to their holdings in the last 24 hours. This follows a broader trend of consistent whale accumulation, a phenomenon often regarded as an indicator of smart money positioning for a significant market move. Such activity suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors expect XRP to outperform in the coming months. The sustained interest in XRP stems from its ability to remain strong despite recent corrections and broader market uncertainty. Holding above key support levels not only reflects technical strength but also underscores investor confidence in its potential for a significant rally. Related Reading: If History Repeats Dogecoin Has Potential For A Parabolic Rally ‚Äì Details As whale accumulation continues and sentiment shifts, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on positive momentum. A breakout above resistance levels could mark the beginning of a powerful rally, reinforcing its leadership among altcoins in the current cycle. Technical Analysis: Key Levels To Watch XRP is currently trading at $2.22 after successfully testing the 4-hour moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA) around $1.96 a few days ago. This bounce off critical support levels highlights XRP‚Äôs short-term strength, reinforcing its bullish momentum. The MA and EMA are widely regarded as key indicators for assessing the health of an asset, and XRP‚Äôs ability to hold above them signals strong demand at lower levels. Maintaining support above $2.13 in the coming days is essential to sustain this momentum. If XRP continues to trade above this level, it would solidify investor confidence and pave the way for a potential test of the $2.40 resistance mark. Breaking above $2.40 would likely trigger additional buying interest, potentially driving XRP toward new highs as the broader market sentiment improves. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Bought $1 Billion ETH In The Past 96 Hours ‚Äì Details On the flip side, losing the $2.13 support could introduce some short-term weakness, leading to a retest of lower levels near the MA and EMA.

Groups including the Bank Policy Institute, the Ohio Bankers League, the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Bank Association (ABA) have filed a joint lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio. The suit alleges that the Fed‚Äôs system for testing how big banks would handle a potential economic crisis doesn‚Äôt follow proper administrative procedure. On Monday, the Fed released a press release saying it was considering how to increase the transparency of bank stress tests and reduce the volatility of its capital requirements. While the banking lobby believes that‚Äôs a ‚Äúpositive step,‚Äù they say that litigation is still needed to preserve their legal rights given an upcoming statute of limitations deadline. The suit says that the Fed‚Äôs stress test systems were ‚Äúadopted in secret‚Äù and contain ‚Äúvacillating and unexplained requirements and restrictions on bank capital.‚Äù The goal of the suit is to ensure that bank capital requirements are established in a transparent manner with public input and in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause, beginning in 2026. In a statement posted to its website, ABA president and CEO Rob Nichols says the Fed‚Äôs stress tests are ‚Äúopaque‚Äù in nature, undermining their ‚Äúvalue for providing meaningful insights into bank resilience.‚Äù Nichols says the ABA is pushing for more transparency behind the tests to create a fairer regulatory environment. ‚ÄúWhile we support stress testing as an important risk management tool, ABA has long advocated for the Federal Reserve to increase the transparency of its stress testing program, which shields key components like supervisory models from public view.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 19:14:00

JustLend was one of the busiest smart contracts, drawing in 55% of all value locked on the TRON network. TRON (TRX) increased its lending exposure in 2024, following the expansion of DeFi on all chains. JustLend was one of the growing apps for the past 12 months, ending up with 55% of the total value locked on the chain. TRON locks in a total of $7.36B in its decentralized protocols, including lending and DEX. The chain still hosts more than $60B in stablecoins, which also partially flow into lending. Based on DeFi Llama data, JustLend holds $5.89B in value locked. CryptoQuant reports $6.17B in lending protocols and a higher total TVL for TRON, due to a different methodology in accounting for apps. JustLend‚Äôs own reporting accounts for $8.3B in total value locked. The protocol offers varied annualized earnings for all locked assets. JustLend reports more than 469K active wallets, although user counts may be lower. While JustLend reports significant value locked, DappRadar only registers 94 daily active wallets, a small fraction of the total reported users. JustLend is the seventh most-visited app on TRON, with $3.25M in daily volumes. TRON‚Äôs lending app managed to perform well based on existing metrics, competing with DeFi versions from the Ethereum ecosystem. The liquidity on TRON is still separate from all other chains. Lending may find another boost in 2025, as the chain will carry its own version of WBTC, potentially serving as valuable collateral. JustLend inflows increased in Q4 With those results, JustLend is building up its share of TVL compared to Aave (AAVE), which already holds more than $20B spread into loans and collaterals. Lending on TRON surpassed bridge deposits and centralized trading activity, rising in the past two months of the year. JustLend boosted the expansion of DeFi lending on TRON in 2024. | Source: CryptoQuant JustLend offers a similar model to other lending protocols, where traders can use their assets as collateral, instead of outright selling. To avoid volatility and liquidations, JustLend DAO is itself a liquidity provider. Demand for JustLend also increased as a tool for passive income. JustLend has its own collection of wrapped tokens, including a version of jUSDT. However, the token is not denominated in dollars but carries a price of $0.01. The asset has just 2,776 holders, similar to other tokens with a few thousand depositors. JustLend also has large-scale whales staking TRX or other assets, helping the app build up its value. More than 10K wallets hold jTRX, the locked token for the lending protocol. TRON marked a year of price records It took years for TRX to break its record from 2017, achieved soon after its ICO. TRX started the year at around $0.10, peaking at $0.40 in early December. As the year comes to a close, TRX corrected toward $0.26, still posting significant net gains. TRX trading slowed down, with open interest sinking to $166M from a peak close to $350M. The network aims to regain its major use cases and reputation, by turning TRX into a deflationary asset. The chain destroys 1.5% of the TRX supply in a year, adding to the token‚Äôs growth trend this year. TRON broke above $2B in fees generated for the year to date. Despite catching up with Ethereum, TRON is still in second place based on total earnings. Ethereum is still ahead with $2.45B in the year to date, based on TokenTerminal data .

In 2024, we‚Äôve seen Bitcoin inching closer to record highs, Ethereum making waves with its latest upgrades, and Litecoin continuing its role as a trusted player in the crypto space. But let‚Äôs be honest‚Äînot everyone was lucky enough to jump on the Litecoin train early. If you‚Äôre one of those folks feeling like you missed out, don‚Äôt worry. There‚Äôs a new opportunity knocking at your door. Say hello to Qubetics ($TICS) , a groundbreaking web3 aggregator that‚Äôs shaking up the crypto world. While Litecoin delivered on speed and efficiency, Qubetics is tackling the usability gaps that have long plagued blockchain technology. If you‚Äôre looking for the best crypto presale to buy this week, Qubetics might just be your golden ticket. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining the Crypto Experience Qubetics isn‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill crypto project. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first web3 aggregator, aiming to simplify blockchain interactions for businesses, professionals, and everyday users. If you‚Äôve ever felt overwhelmed juggling multiple wallets or networks, Qubetics is here to save the day. At the core of Qubetics is its Multi-Chain Wallet‚Äîa tool that consolidates assets across multiple blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and more. Managing crypto assets has always been a hassle, but this wallet changes the game. Imagine a freelancer getting paid in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana tokens. Instead of juggling three separate wallets, they use the Qubetics Multi-Chain Wallet to store, convert, and manage everything in one place. Or picture a small business accepting crypto payments. With Qubetics, they can streamline transactions, saving time and avoiding the headache of dealing with multiple platforms. For individuals, the wallet offers a seamless way to send, receive, and stake tokens without hopping between apps. Whether you‚Äôre new to crypto or a seasoned pro, Qubetics is built to make life easier. The Qubetics presale is making waves. In its 14th stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0377, with more than 374 million tokens sold to over 11,700 holders. The project has already raised $7.7 million‚Äîand the excitement is only growing. With prices set to increase by 10% in the 15th stage this weekend, now is the time to jump in. Crypto analysts are calling Qubetics one of the most exciting projects of 2024. With its real-world utility and user-focused features, $TICS is expected to see explosive growth post-launch. Predictions of a 10x increase are already circulating, making it a prime contender for the best crypto presale to buy this week. Litecoin (LTC): The Classic Crypto With Staying Power Litecoin, often dubbed the ‚Äúsilver to Bitcoin‚Äôs gold,‚Äù has been a cornerstone of the crypto space for years. Created by Charlie Lee, it was designed to be a faster, more efficient alternative to Bitcoin. And for many, it delivered exactly that. Litecoin‚Äôs major strength lies in its speed. Transactions are confirmed much faster than Bitcoin, making it a popular choice for day-to-day transactions. Its lower fees and innovative features like Segregated Witness (SegWit) and atomic swaps have also made it a standout option for those looking for efficiency. Beyond technical features, Litecoin has maintained a reputation for reliability. It‚Äôs like the trusty workhorse of the crypto world‚Äîsolid, dependable, and always in the conversation. While Litecoin has held its ground, the crypto landscape has evolved dramatically. Newer blockchains offering greater scalability, speed, and utility have stolen much of the limelight. Projects like Solana and Avalanche have pushed the boundaries, while presales like Qubetics offer the kind of innovation that gets people excited. Litecoin remains a strong option for those who value stability and a proven track record. However, it doesn‚Äôt offer the same buzz or breakout potential as newer projects. For investors chasing transformative gains, projects like Qubetics are where the action is. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto Presale to Buy This Week So, why should you choose Qubetics over Litecoin or any other project? The answer lies in its innovation and accessibility. While Litecoin brought speed and lower fees, Qubetics is tackling the bigger picture. Its Multi-Chain Wallet isn‚Äôt just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a solution to one of blockchain‚Äôs most pressing problems: usability. The presale numbers back this up. With $7.7 million raised and over 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics is attracting a growing community of investors who see its potential. And with the price of $TICS set to increase in the next stage, the time to act is now. This isn‚Äôt just a presale; it‚Äôs a movement toward a more inclusive, user-friendly blockchain ecosystem. Conclusion Missed out on Litecoin‚Äôs early days? No worries. Qubetics is here to give you a second chance at something big. With its groundbreaking Multi-Chain Wallet, impressive presale stats, and a mission to simplify blockchain for everyone, $TICS is the best crypto presale to buy this week . Whether you‚Äôre a business owner, an investor, or just curious about crypto, Qubetics has something for you. But don‚Äôt wait too long. With the 15th presale stage looming and prices set to rise, this opportunity won‚Äôt last forever. Head to the Qubetics website, grab your tokens, and get ready to ride the next big wave in crypto innovation.

As Christmas nears, crypto traders ponder whether the market will see a ‚ÄúSanta Claus‚Äù rally this year. A CoinGecko report states that eight of ten times between 2014 and 2023, crypto markets rallied around the Christmas holidays. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price decline has quashed hopes of a Santa rally this year, and declining institutional investment inflow has dampened the sentiment further.

A ‚ÄúSanta Claus‚Äù rally refers to price gains in crypto in the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the following year, according to a CoinGecko report. The performance of the crypto market is, therefore, key during the one-week timeframe from December 27, 2024, to January 2, 2025. Bitcoin‚Äôs decline from its all-time high has raised concerns among BTC traders, and hopes of a Santa Claus rally have dimmed this cycle. Between 2014 and 2023, crypto markets rallied post-Christmas. Crypto markets experienced a pullback instead of a rally, three times out of ten in the past decade with a correction as steep as 12.12% pre-Christmas, during the ICO bubble of 2017.

It‚Äôs important to note that the bull runs in 2020, 2017, and 2013 ended with nearly 480%, 215%, and 168% gains in BTC in Q4. Bitcoin‚Äôs performance this quarter has been lackluster, and there is little evidence to support extended gains in the first two trading days of 2025. Institutional interest in BTC is slowing down, reducing capital inflows, and this is evident from net outflows of Bitcoin Spot ETFs. With Bitcoin‚Äôs Q4 performance under the median of 54.80%, it is less likely that the token will retest its all-time high before the end of the year.

The index reads 49 on a scale of 0 to 100, meaning the price performance of the top 50 altcoins is lagging behind when compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs yield for holders in the same time period.

Trump nominated Stephen Miran to be Chair of his Council of Economic Advisers. Miran is a known crypto advocate and another pro-crypto appointment made by the incoming President. Previously, Trump appointed pro-crypto candidate Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission and tech investor David Sacks as artificial intelligence and crypto czar. While these appointments are expected to steer crypto towards positive regulation in the U.S., Bitcoin price continues to slide. Data from Statista shows that South Korea is estimated to be the third largest cryptocurrency market in the world and exchanges in Korea account for over 9% of the global trade volume as of 2021. The Korean Won ranks among the top 5 traded currencies against Bitcoin, per the data. South Korea delayed its crypto taxation until 2027 and adopted a pro-crypto approach, paving way for positive developments in Asia and for Bitcoin traders in Korea. Michael Saylor-led MicroStrategy‚Äôs blueprint to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet has inspired a wave of adoption across Asia. Per an Asia Express report, Chinese selfie app developer Meitu invested in 31,000 ETH and 940 BTC in the spring of 2021.

This move could shape the token‚Äôs behavior in the market, offering fresh opportunities for users and investors alike. This move follows the launch of IOTA Rebased, an ambitious upgrade aimed at transforming its blockchain network. IOTA Introduces A Fresh Economic Model For a Sustainable Future IOTA Foundation is shifting to a more sustainable economic model, introducing a mix of inflation, rewards, and transaction fee burns. The most significant change is adding a 6% annual inflation rate, meaning more IOTAs will be distributed over time. It was revealed that validators and delegators can expect to receive 767,000 IOTAs per epoch, creating an incentive for participation. At the same time, IOTA plans to burn a portion of transaction fees geared toward helping reduce inflation. With transaction fees set at just 0.005 IOTAs, IOTA is trying to create a more stable economy while still offering rewards to those involved in the network. To make things even easier for users, IOTA is introducing sponsored transactions. This means developers can cover user transaction fees, encouraging more people to use the platform without worrying about the costs. The platform hopes this move will encourage more developers to build on IOTA, fostering growth and innovation. IOTA See Surge in Activity: A Promising Start Since the announcement, IOTA has seen a noticeable uptick in trading volume, with a 6% increase in just 24 hours. Its price has also surged by 8%, hitting $0.319, signaling positive momentum. At the time of writing, IOTA‚Äôs price is around $0.319, marking an 8% gain in the past day. However, despite this recent boost, IOTA‚Äôs performance still lags behind other crypto assets in the current bull market. It has a relatively modest 12% annual growth. Analysts Weigh In: IOTA‚Äôs Bullish Potential Despite the ongoing challenges, analysts are increasingly optimistic about IOTA‚Äôs future. Poseidon, a well-known crypto analyst, pointed out that IOTA has recently broken out of its bearish weekly structure. He believes the token is well-positioned for a potential pump, particularly as altcoins tend to perform well towards the end of a cycle. He added, ‚ÄúIOTA has the potential to move higher, provided it holds above the mid-range.‚Äù Similarly, Crypto Nova shared a bullish outlook, emphasizing IOTA‚Äôs renewed focus on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization . This approach could draw new retail investors, especially since established projects like IOTA often gain attention during market upswings.

Today, December 25, 2024, the sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape appears to be shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend, as major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP have begun witnessing notable upside momentum. Bullish On-Chain Metrics With this strong positive sentiment, traders‚Äô and long-term holders‚Äô interest in SHIB seems to be rising, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Additionally, aside from the current sentiment, long-term holders appear more confident about the meme coin. $10 Million SHIB Outflow Data from the SHIB spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have experienced an outflow of a significant $10 million in SHIB over the past three days. Meanwhile, with the recent sentiment, this outflow seems to be rising, indicating that long-term holders continue to withdraw the asset from their exchanges. Source: Coinglass In the realm of cryptocurrency, ‚Äú outflow ‚Äù refers to the flow of assets from exchanges to wallets, which indicates potential upside momentum and an ideal buying opportunity. However, this meme coin withdrawal from the exchanges and the continuous price consolidation have occurred near a crucial support level of $0.000021 and the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Rising Open Interest In addition to all this, today‚Äôs intraday traders‚Äô interest has also soared, as SHIB‚Äôs open interest (OI) has increased by 13% in the past 24 hours.

Cardano Set to Surge: ADA Ready for a Major Upswing Cardano (ADA) has seen a recent dip, with a 1-week decline of nearly 20%. However, over the past 6 months, it has soared by over 124%, showing strong growth potential. Currently trading between $0.72 and $1.08, it‚Äôs slightly below its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages. Technical indicators like RSI at 44.78 and Stochastic at 47.53 suggest it‚Äôs poised for a rebound. If ADA breaks the nearest resistance at $1.28, it could rally towards the second resistance at $1.64, a potential gain of over 50%. With altcoin season approaching, Cardano may be gearing up for a significant upward move. XRP Poised for Breakout Amid Anticipated Altcoin Season XRP is trading between $1.86 and $2.63, consolidating after a month of impressive growth exceeding 47%. Despite an 11% dip in the past week, its six-month surge of over 355% highlights strong long-term momentum. The RSI is around 41, indicating room for upward movement before hitting overbought levels.

However, major milestones and other setbacks occurred for the company in 2024. This year, OpenAI went from a nonprofit to a for-profit company. It also had a big funding round. This happened because CEO Sam Altman returned to help save the company, as he had been removed a year before. Nevertheless, OpenAI still has legal issues, such as lawsuits from a co-founder, Elon Musk, and major newspapers. Moreover, several key employees departed, including those who had been with OpenAI since its inception in 2015. According to a report by Business Insider, OpenAI had a challenging rocky year. xAI raises billions to take on OpenAI with Elon Musk Financial Times reported in January that xAI was seeking to raise $6 billion, which had a valuation of $20 billion. Elon Musk founded xAI as a competitor to OpenAI, his co-founded company. He left the board of OpenAI back in 2018. In February, OpenAI was valued at $80 billion In February, the New York Times reported that OpenAI reached an $80 billion valuation, more than triple its previous value. A tender offer allowed workers to sell their shares. Elon Musk sues Sam Altman and OpenAI Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming that the organization had become a profit-focused subsidiary of Microsoft, which went against his original nonprofit mission. In March, Altman and other executives responded in a blog. It shared that Musk wanted to merge OpenAI with Tesla himself to turn it into a for-profit. In June, Musk dropped the lawsuit, but the case resurfaced in the fall. SEC Investigation into Open AI was revealed According to The Wall Street Journal, the SEC was also investigating whether OpenAI had misled investors. According to sources, the former board was the reason behind the investigation. He said that Altman was not ‚Äúconsistently candid in his communications.‚Äù Sam Altman came back to the OpenAI board in March In March, OpenAI‚Äôs board voted to select ‚Äúthe right leaders for OpenAI‚Äù. The decision was ‚Äúunanimously concluded‚Äù in favor of Altman and President Greg Brockman. Three new female members joined Altman back on the board. In May, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever left In May, chief scientist Sutskever departed. He had previously attempted to oust Altman from the company, which he later regretted. On X, he penned his farewell, predicting that in the years to come, OpenAI would build safe and beneficial AI. OpenAI also removed ChatGPT‚Äôs ‚ÄòSky‚Äô voice Soon after, OpenAI stopped using ChatGPT‚Äôs ‚ÄúSky‚Äù voice after complaints that it sounded like Scarlett Johansson‚Äôs in the ‚ÄúHer‚Äù movie. When OpenAI used a similar voice to Johansson‚Äôs without her consent, she hired lawyers and revealed she was asked to voice ChatGPT but turned it down. Safety criticism for OpenAI increased in the summer The New York Times report in June also noted that employees were worried about OpenAI not doing enough to make sure its AI was safe. In response, a spokesperson for the company told Business Insider about their safety commitments and an ‚Äúanonymous integrity hotline‚Äù for employees to express their worries and concerns. Furthermore, a report by Vox discussed that OpenAI also strictly enforced NDAs on employees who leave and a risk to their equity if they disagree. This further created PR challenges for Altman. Apple announced the Integration of ChatGPT in June In June, Apple said it would release its own ChatGPT version into the software through Siri. This partnership was a way for OpenAI API to iOS users, which has the potential to reach millions of iPhone users. In August, Elon Musk filed a new lawsuit and added Microsoft as a defendant later In August Musk filed another lawsuit , accusing OpenAI leaders of tricking him about the company‚Äôs objectives. Last month, he added Microsoft and Reid Hoffman as defendants in a lawsuit alleging that they conspired to monopolize AI and pay excessive employee salaries. He also named Shivon Zilis, a former board member and the mother of his three children, in the suit. In September, OpenAI Announced the shift towards for-profit OpenAI, originally a nonprofit since 2015, said it would make its company for-profit within two years. It involves giving investors equity and earning government approvals. This plan has faced criticism from figures such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Murati announced stepping down as CTO The Chief Technology Officer, Mira Murati, announced that she is leaving the company to work on personal projects. She had been involved in trying to oust Altman and had temporarily taken over as CEO before Altman returned. President Gregg Brockman also returned in November after taking a long leave during August. Business Insider reported that at least nine notable employees recently left OpenAI, including co-founders Andrej Karpathy and John Schulman. OpenAI raised $6.6 Billion in October In October, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion, valued at $157 billion, placing it at the same level as Uber and AT&T. Major investors included Soft Bank, Tiger Global, Microsoft, and Nvidia, led by Thrive Capital. OpenAI was also hit with allegations of legal data deletion in a lawsuit According to the lawsuit, ‚ÄúOpenAI‚Äôs engineers erased all of the News Plaintiffs‚Äô programs and search result data‚Äù when it claimed the lawsuit with other newspapers like The New York Times. When asked about these allegations, OpenAI had nothing to say.

Sui (SUI) Sui is a new kind of blockchain that‚Äôs designed for the future. It‚Äôs built to handle global adoption by being secure, powerful, and able to scale as needed. At its core, Sui uses a unique way of managing data that focuses on objects. This makes it more efficient than many existing blockchains. It also uses the Move programming language, which adds an extra layer of security and addresses common problems found in other blockchain systems. What makes Sui stand out is its focus on the user experience. Many people find blockchain technology hard to use, but Sui aims to change that. It introduces innovations like zkLogin, which makes logging in easier, sponsored transactions that reduce costs for users, and programmable transaction blocks that make apps more flexible. These features make blockchain applications more accessible and user-friendly. In today‚Äôs market, where usability and scalability are crucial, Sui appears to be an attractive option. Compared to other coins that may struggle with speed or high fees, Sui offers solutions that could make it a strong contender in the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) is the latest sensation in the crypto world, bringing a fun twist to digital currencies. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this dog-themed coin is gaining popularity on the Solana blockchain. Meme coins like WIF are known for their community spirit and ability to spread like wildfire across the internet. They often draw from popular memes or cultural trends, making them relatable and exciting for many crypto enthusiasts. In the current market cycle, WIF stands out with its playful approach and growing community. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, WIF focuses on creating a sense of fun and belonging among its holders. While its value can be more unpredictable due to its nature and large supply, many are drawn to its potential for rapid growth and the lively community behind it. Compared to other meme coins, WIF offers a fresh experience on the Solana blockchain, which is known for its fast transactions and low fees. With the rising interest in meme coins, WIF could be an attractive option for those looking to explore new trends in the crypto space. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a joke, much like Dogecoin. But it‚Äôs quickly becoming more than just a meme. Launched in August 2020 by someone known only as Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many apps and systems already using Ethereum. What‚Äôs interesting is that Ryoshi sent half of all SHIB tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. This move built trust. Buterin then donated a big chunk to help with COVID-19 relief in India and ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the tokens, reducing supply and raising SHIB‚Äôs profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB‚Äôs connection with Ethereum allows for more possibilities. There‚Äôs ShibaSwap, a place to trade tokens without a central authority. Plans are also in the works for a platform for NFTs (digital art) and a system where SHIB holders can have a say in decisions. This could make SHIB more useful. In the current market, while many coins are struggling, SHIB‚Äôs developments could make it stand out. Its potential for real-world use, not just as a joke, might attract more attention. As the crypto world evolves, SHIB could be a coin to watch. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) There‚Äôs a new squirrel in town, and it‚Äôs turning heads in the crypto world. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is a meme-inspired token on the Solana blockchain. Designed for meme lovers and crypto enthusiasts, PNUT brings fun and community spirit to the table. With a total supply of 100 million tokens, it features zero transaction taxes, a revoked contract, and a burnt liquidity pool. This means holders can feel secure about their assets. The token‚Äôs mascot, Pnut, is a playful, Pepe-like squirrel that embodies the project‚Äôs lighthearted vibe. To get your hands on PNUT, you can use platforms like Jupiter Aggregator. In a market where meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have made headlines, PNUT aims to carve out its own niche. Its foundation on Solana offers fast transactions and low fees, which is a big plus. The zero transaction tax and security features make it stand out from many other tokens. With the crypto market always looking for the next big thing, PNUT could be an attractive option for those seeking something new and fun. Its community-driven approach might just be the peanut butter to your crypto jelly. Conclusion Although SUI, WIF, SHIB, and PNUT are promising, XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% growth, uniting fans and creating a community-driven movement.

The FBI, Japan‚Äôs National Police Agency and the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center identified the North Korean group known as ‚ÄúTraderTraitor‚Äù as responsible for the theft of 4,502.9 Bitcoin, according to a new press release from the FBI. Investigators say the breach began in March when a hacker posed as a recruiter and sent a malicious GitHub link to an employee of Ginco, a DMM partner company. After the employee copied the link to their personal account, TraderTraitor gained system access and later impersonated the worker to infiltrate DMM‚Äôs communications. The hackers then intercepted and modified a legitimate transaction request from DMM, authorities said. The stolen funds were quickly transferred to wallets controlled by TraderTraitor, which officials have linked to North Korea‚Äôs government. The heist appears to be part of North Korea‚Äôs broader cryptocurrency theft campaign to generate revenue. According to the press release, the international investigation highlights growing concerns about state-sponsored cybercrime targeting digital assets. Law enforcement officials say the case demonstrates the need for enhanced global cooperation against cyber threats. In August, the blockchain security firm PeckShield said wallets associated with the hackers moved roughly 850 BTC worth more than $54 million to six different addresses in a week.

The tweet , accompanied by a commercial produced by the SBI Group, conveys a bold assertion that XRP may surpass Bitcoin in solving some of the problems that Bitcoin was initially designed to address. REMEMBER THIS AWESOME SBI GROUP COMMERCIAL? #XRP WILL TAKEOVER BITCOIN BECAUSE IT WILL END UP SOLVING SOME OF THE ORIGINAL PROBLEMS BITCOIN WAS DESIGNED TO SOLVE! ONLY 9 MORE DAYS UNTIL EVERY JAPANESE BANK WILL START USING XRP, ACCORDING TO THE SBI CEO! pic.twitter.com/eLMKta2eH9 ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 23, 2024 The commercial employs a visual analogy to convey XRP‚Äôs advantages. It portrays two climbers‚Äîone symbolizing Bitcoin and the other XRP‚Äîcompeting in a race to the top of a wall. Bitcoin, depicted as a powerful and muscular climber, appears capable but ultimately loses to XRP, which is represented as a more strategic and composed climber dressed in a suit. The advertisement suggests that while Bitcoin is recognized for its strength and dominance in the cryptocurrency market, XRP‚Äôs efficiency and tailored design enable it to outpace Bitcoin in solving certain challenges. XRP vs. Bitcoin: A Comparison of Capabilities Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized digital currency to enable peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. However, its limitations have become evident, particularly in transaction speed, scalability, and energy consumption. Transactions on the Bitcoin network can take several minutes, with fees fluctuating based on network congestion. Additionally, Bitcoin‚Äôs reliance on proof-of-work (PoW) consensus demands significant energy resources, contributing to environmental concerns. XRP, on the other hand, was developed to address these issues, particularly in the context of cross-border payments and financial settlement. XRP boasts near-instant transaction speeds and significantly lower fees compared to Bitcoin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 It utilizes a consensus protocol rather than PoW, making it more energy-efficient and scalable. These attributes align closely with the needs of financial institutions and global payment networks, such as those in Japan, where SBI Group has been actively promoting XRP adoption. The Role of SBI Group in XRP Adoption SBI Group, a Japanese financial services conglomerate, has long been an XRP advocate. The company‚Äôs CEO has frequently emphasized XRP‚Äôs utility in enabling faster and more cost-effective international transactions. The reference in Amelie‚Äôs tweet to ‚Äúevery Japanese bank‚Äù adopting XRP underscores SBI Group‚Äôs efforts to integrate XRP into Japan‚Äôs financial infrastructure. While the claim of full-scale adoption in nine days may be optimistic, it reflects the growing interest in XRP within the banking sector.

Earlier, the price of the coin dropped to a 4-week low of $0.7659 and entering a short period of consolidation afterward. With the latest bullish uptick, the digital currency is likely to leverage its bull flag setup to soar higher. ADA Price and Future Projections At the time of writing, the price of the ADA has jumped by 6.66% and was changing hands for $0.9412. According to market analyst @Av_Sebastian, there is a whole lot of reasons to agree with the ADA bull flag formation. He presented an ADA/USD 1D chart that shows Cardano breaking out around the $0.93 price mark. Multiple people have pointed out to me that there might be a huge bullish flag on the $ADA chart and I must agree with them. Crypto market seems to be turning around, all coins seem to be recovering right now. Is this the beginning of the Christmas pump? https://t.co/Tkkh2HGcnP pic.twitter.com/0NQ8jcXRkn ‚Äî Sssebi (@Av_Sebastian) December 24, 2024 Notably, this price level formed a strong resistance for ADA over the past week. With just a few attempts to break above this level within this period, the ongoing rally marks a significant stride. The bull flag is a technical setup formed in periods of consolidation within an uptrend. If Cardano ends up with a bullish candle on the daily, the coin might eventually break the $1 price mark in the short term.¬†This projection aligns with previous ADA price analysis where top analysts project a $2.60‚Äì$2.80 based on Elliott Wave projections. Is Cardano Undervalued? Cardano is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol, considered as an Ethereum killer. Many see the coin as undervalued, considering its growing role in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Despite the growing backlash against the protocol and its founder Charles Hoskinson, the push for growth remains intact. Recently, Hoskinson proposed that the Cardano Foundation should move to Abu Dhabi or Wyoming in a bid to drive community governance. The protocol, through the Chang hard fork upgrade, has made significant strides to democratize its governance systems. This, and alliances like the Bitcoin DeFi push makes ADA an appealing coin for long term growth.

The $XYZ presale is already smashing through stages with the speed of a champion‚Äôs knockout blow. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has experienced notable price swings recently. In the past week, its price fell by 20.80%. Over the last month, it decreased by 14.34%. However, looking back six months, ADA‚Äôs price has surged by 122.45%. This long-term growth suggests strong underlying momentum despite short-term declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ADA is at 42.36, indicating that it is nearing oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator stands at 13.57, which also points toward potential bullish reversal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -0.0055, showing bearish momentum but hinting at a possible upcoming shift. With the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages closely aligned at $0.89 and $0.90 respectively, ADA‚Äôs price is consolidating. If ADA‚Äôs price can overcome the nearest resistance level at $1.28, it could target the second resistance at $1.64. Achieving these levels would represent gains of approximately 48% and 78% from the current price range of $0.72-$1.08. Conversely, if the price dips to the nearest support level at $0.56, it would mark a decrease of about 22%. Traders are watching these levels carefully, as they may signal key opportunities in ADA‚Äôs price movement. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin has seen significant shifts in its price recently. Over the past week, it dropped by 24.51%, and the past month shows a decrease of 25.80%. Despite these declines, DOGE holds a substantial 141.95% increase over the last six months. Currently, it trades between $0.24 and $0.40, reflecting a volatile market stance. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days stand at $0.31, indicating a period of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is at 41.81, suggesting that the coin is nearing oversold territory. A Stochastic value of 17.76 supports this, pointing to potential upward momentum. However, the MACD level is at -0.002010, which could hint at continued bearish trends. Key price levels are in focus for Dogecoin. The nearest resistance is at $0.48. Approaching this point would mark an increase of around 60% from the lower end of its current range. Beyond that, the second resistance level is at $0.63. On the downside, the nearest support level sits at $0.17. Falling below this could lead to the second support at $0.0252, indicating a significant decrease. These levels are crucial as traders watch for DOGE‚Äôs next move. Conclusion While ADA and DOGE remain strong, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting fans worldwide and aiming for significant growth in the 2024 bull run.

The Central American country started buying one BTC every day in November 2022, shortly after the crypto exchange FTX imploded. Last Friday, however, El Salvador purchased more than 11 BTC worth $1.07 million, and they executed another 11 BTC purchase on Sunday, per the crypto data platform Arkham . BTC advocate Max Keiser, who works as the ‚Äúsenior Bitcoin advisor‚Äù to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, says Bukele is ramping up buys ‚Äúwith an interim goal of acquiring 20,000 more Bitcoin.‚Äù The additional purchases come shortly after El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion loan facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF says the facility is expected to ‚Äúcatalyze‚Äù a combined total of $3.5 billion in financing from the World Bank and various other international financial institutions, but the UN financial agency claimed in a press release that El Salvador‚Äôs government agreed to limit its crypto efforts as part of the agreement. ‚ÄúThe potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund policies. Legal reforms will make the acceptance of Bitcoin by the private sector voluntary. For the public sector, engagement in Bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of Bitcoin will be confined. Taxes will only be paid in US dollars and the government‚Äôs participation in the crypto e-wallet (Chivo) will be gradually unwound.

Analysts believe Remittix, a new DeFi project could be the best low-cap crypto to surpass the $1 billion mark. Remittix (RTX) aims to revolutionize the cross-border payment sector worth over $190T, allowing users to send cryptocurrencies across borders with ease. The project is currently in the presale stage and could give early investors returns of over 15x by 2025. Pepe (PEPE) Targets 4x Surge ChandlerBing, an analyst, has noted that the relative strength index of the PEPE coin has deviated from Bitcoin in recent growth and has not been at this level since April 2024. He notes that after this rather large deviation in April, Pepe (PEPE) went on to have an incredible run, rising over 4x. ChandlerBing also pointed to this historical precedent, and it appears that there is a high probability of another large increase in the PEPE price. In another tweet, Ali Martinez noted that TD Sequential has presented a buy signal on the daily Pepe price chart. According to him, a rebound could occur in the next few days. Presently, the value of the Pepe crypto has dropped by 21.2% in the weekly timeframe. The meme coin is currently battling with bears and could fall to lower levels unless bulls intervene. Fortunately, technical analysis shows that bulls are gaining momentum. The Average Directional Index (14) and Hull Moving Average (9) show buy signals which is a bullish sign. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Targets $0.000042 The Shiba Inu coin is among the memecoins that are in the red region right now. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the value of Shiba Inu has dropped by 18.7% on the weekly chart and 21.0% on the monthly time frame. A top expert called Shib Spain notes the Shiba Inu coin price could soar to $0.000042 in the coming weeks. However, the memecoin must maintain the support around the $0.000020 level. Another analyst called CW is also bullish about the memecoin. They predict the value of the Shiba Inu crypto might soar to $0.0000355 in the next few weeks. The relative strength index currently supports this bullish forecast. It has fallen below the midline and has enough room to rise in the next few days. Remittix (RTX) Redefines Cross-border Transactions Remittix is a new DeFi project in the digital finance space that is gaining traction among investors. It is a platform that uses blockchain technology to operate alongside the existing financial systems to enable people and companies to transfer and receive digital currencies. Remittix is making a difference and encouraging the use of cryptocurrency by offering a stable service that allows for direct crypto to fiat-transfers to bank accounts in over 30 currencies. This solution is unique in that it offers the fastest, safest, and least expensive way of attaining a better financial experience. Remittix is not just about the transactions; it is about people and companies all over the world. It is playing a role in creating a world where everyone can obtain financial services. With these features, this project seeks to close the gap between TradeFi and DeFi to enable easy crypto payments for its users. On the other hand, Remittix has its utility coin called RTX which is used in cross-border payment and can be staked to earn an interest. The RTX coin is in the presale phase at the moment and is priced at $0.0156. Some analysts have dubbed it as the best crypto to buy for 10x returns. Is Remittix The Next Best Crypto To Reach $1B Market Cap After Pepe (PEPE) And Shiba Inu (SHIB)? According to the article, RTX could be the next best cryptocurrency to reach a market cap of $1 billion. It is tapping into the global payment industry that could be worth over $250 trillion by 2027. In addition to this, RTX is a huge part of the Remittix ecosystem and has unique utilities that could lead to more adoption and subsequently, price growth.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

In a recent analysis, Godbolev noted that the price of SOL has risen by over 7% this week to $193, rebounding from a key trendline support level. According to the analyst, the trendline in question connects the highs of March and July to the lows of April and August, creating a descending channel that encompasses SOL‚Äôs long-term swings from March to October. Earlier this month, SOL broke out of this channel, confirming its bullish trend. Solana quickly rose above $260 before pulling back to the breakout, creating what technical analysts call a ‚Äúbullish regression pattern.‚Äù Related News: Trader Who Opened a $60 Million Long Position in This Altcoin Lost Big: Talks About His Mistakes For SOL, the rebound from the breakout level reaffirmed support and signaled renewed bullish momentum. If this trend continues, traders who took early profits could re-enter the market, further fueling the upward momentum, he said. While the bullish regression pattern is promising, analysts warn that the pattern‚Äôs success depends on SOL maintaining support at the breakout level.

Will the White House push for something like that? ‚ÄúYeah, I think so,‚Äù Trump answered. But the rest of his answer really showed an understanding of the cryptocurrency sector‚Äôs importance to the global economy in terms of first principles. That may be the influence of tech engineer and government efficiency advisor Elon Musk, who is famous for saying , ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy.‚Äù Trump Tells Jim Cramer‚Äôs About Crypto ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do something great with crypto,‚Äù Trump told Kramer. ‚ÄúBecause we don‚Äôt want China or anybody else‚Äî others are embracing it and we want to be the head.

It‚Äôs also an industry with immediate incentives to develop cheap, abundant, renewable energy production. Each time the chip race for more efficient Bitcoin miners catches up to the state of the art, the only place left for miners to compete is on electricity costs. They are already poised to race each other for profit against this expense line in their business model. The possibilities of a smart electrical grid metered by blockchain platforms that are more articulately interchangeable with monetary currencies are scintillating .
