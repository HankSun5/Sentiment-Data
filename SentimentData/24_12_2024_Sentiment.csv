The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI steals the spotlight as Cardano and Toncoin lose investor momentum. Table of Contents Cardano and Toncoin: A decline in investor confidence Why Lightchain AI shines Future outlook Cardano (ADA) and Toncoin (TON) are seeing their momentum slow as Lightchain AI (LCAI) emerges as a more promising opportunity in the market. Currently priced at just $0.003 in its presale phase, Lightchain AI is drawing attention for its potential to transform decentralized applications (dApps) and governance. Cardano and Toncoin: A decline in investor confidence Cardano and Toncoin have been seen as good blockchain plans, but new market signs show a drop in trust from investors. Cardano‚Äôs growth speed, though bold, often gets bad remarks for holdups in adding important parts, making some wonder if it can stay up with quicker changing systems. Likewise, Toncoin, with its special blockchain setup tied to the Telegram world, has a hard time keeping up due to few userÕès outside its small group. These issues have made investors skeptical, especially in a market where new projects give better chances for growth. Lightchain AI, for example, has changed its aim by offering a new AI-blockchain mix during its presale phase, pulling in investors looking for fresh ideas and gain. As such, ADA and TON are falling back to smart projects like LCAI. You might also like: Dogecoin targets $2 but Lightchain AI could be the winner with $10 and a 30,000x return Why Lightchain AI shines Lightchain AI distinguishes itself from Cardano and Toncoin through its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Central to Lightchain AI‚Äôs architecture are the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. The AIVM is designed to optimize the execution of AI-specific tasks, enabling efficient and scalable dApps. Lightchain AI‚Äôs tokenomics are structured to ensure sustainability and equitable distribution. The total supply of LCAI tokens is capped at 10 billion, with 40% allocated for presale, 30% for ecosystem development, 20% for team and advisors, and 10% reserved for future partnerships and strategic initiatives. This allocation strategy aims to foster long-term value for ecosystem participants. Moreover, the roadmap for Lightchain AI is ambitious, focusing on the seamless integration of AI and blockchain to address challenges such as scalability, privacy, and trust. Key milestones include the development and deployment of the AIVM, implementation of the PoI consensus mechanism, and the launch of a suite of AI-driven dApps. LCAI‚Äôs presale phase is priced low at just $0.003 per token, offering investors an opportunity to buy into a potentially disruptive technology at an early stage and reap exponential returns. With limited tokens available during this phase, investors are scrambling to secure their piece of the future through LCAI. Future outlook The Lightchain AI presale has drawn significant attention from blockchain enthusiasts and investors who see its potential to transform the industry. With its future-oriented approach to integrating AI and blockchain, LCAI is positioned to lead the next wave of disruptive technologies. As Cardano and Toncoin experience a slowdown in investor confidence, LCAI‚Äôs momentum continues to build, making it the choice for those seeking growth and transformative technology in their blockchain investments.

A publication from the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Structured Finance sheds light on major global banks collaborating with Ripple to create a potential alternative to SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. The financial institutions mentioned‚ÄîBank of America, Santander, UniCredit, Standard Chartered, Westpac Banking Corporation, and Royal Bank of Canada‚Äîrepresent a substantial segment of the global banking industry. Their collaboration with Ripple underscores a pivotal shift in how financial transactions might be conducted, moving towards the adoption of blockchain technology for cross-border payments.

Blockchain‚Äôs ability to process secure and bilateral transactions in near real-time offers a significant advantage over legacy systems, which can be slow, expensive, and prone to error. Using distributed ledger technology, Ripple aims to simplify and accelerate global money movement while reducing associated costs. Traditionally, SWIFT has dominated the cross-border payments space, serving as the backbone for international transactions. However, its reliance on multiple intermediaries often results in delays and increased transaction fees. Through innovative blockchain solutions, Ripple promises instant settlements with reduced costs and a robust audit trail, making it a formidable alternative to SWIFT. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The participation of major banks in this initiative reflects growing confidence in blockchain‚Äôs potential to transform global financial systems. Ripple‚Äôs established network, RippleNet, allows financial institutions to connect seamlessly, facilitating secure and efficient international transactions. The Future of Cross-Border Payments The collaboration signifies a notable moment for blockchain adoption in traditional banking. By leveraging Ripple‚Äôs technology, these banks aim to reduce the capital tied up in the global trade settlement system and enhance the speed and reliability of their services. This move aligns with a broader industry trend of adopting blockchain to improve transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions. While the details of this collaboration are still emerging, the implications for the broader financial ecosystem are profound. If Ripple‚Äôs solutions prove successful, they could disrupt SWIFT‚Äôs longstanding dominance, paving the way for a new era in international finance.

According to a scoop shared by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the Helio deal is worth about $150 million. If successful, this will mark the largest acquisition made by the Miami-based firm since its inception. Moonpay and Helio as the Power Duo While much detail has not emerged regarding the terms of the deal, many in the ecosystem are already weighing the potential. Notably, Helio will enable Moonpay to compete directly with Coinbase Commerce as a self-service crypto payments outfit. Helio enables content creators and ecommerce merchants to get paid for their products and services using crypto. Among the available products includes Solana Pay, the payments engine powering the DexScreener platform. As Terrett highlighted, the Solana Pay outfit is also integrated into Shopify.

It currently powers a lot of crypto payments services with an extensive partnerships record. As reported by Coingape in October, it landed a Venmo partnership to enable crypto access to 60 million users worldwide. With crypto adoption growing, the need for more merchant integrations have grown considerably. Moonpay is among the infrastructure firms benefitting from these growth and Helio might help amplify this. Growing Corporate Investments in Crypto Since the victory of Donald Trump as president-elect last month, the corporate alignment has increased. Suddenly, companies are beginning to revamp their investment strategies in a bid to benefit from the potential incoming pro-crypto administration. From Justin Sun investing $30 million into World Liberty Financial to Tether‚Äôs latest $775 million investment in Rumble, firms are largely diversifying their portfolios. While M&A activities beyond the potential Moonpay deal might appear too formal, the presence of Bitcoin and Ethereum-based ETF products is removing entry barriers for firms. BlackRock invests in IBIT , setting a precedent for state pension funds to also join the trend. Asset management firms are doubling down on other crypto ETF products to grant firms more access to gain exposure to the crypto industry.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

Despite this, Japan-based Metaplanet has reaffirmed its confidence by buying nearly 620 BTC. Interestingly, the latest acquisition marks its largest Bitcoin purchase to date. Metaplanet‚Äôs Largest Single BTC Acquisition According to the company‚Äôs official press release , the acquisition, executed as part of its Bitcoin Treasury Operations, involved the purchase of 619.7 BTC, worth around $60.6 million.

William Shane Garrow ‚Äì who was senior vice president and a private banker at BOK until being fired early this year ‚Äì is accused of embezzling $4,277,227 from at least 16 customer accounts and funneling the funds to himself, FOX23 reports . Garrow, who was hired in 2007, allegedly began committing the crimes on September 9, 2012, and continued all the way to April 10, 2024. He‚Äôs accused of draining cash from customer accounts without them knowing and transferring the funds to accounts that he controlled at other financial institutions. He‚Äôs also alleged to have written false cashier checks from client accounts and made them payable to himself. If a client noticed discrepancies, Garrow simply told them there was some sort of error, and that BOK would correct it. Says an affidavit seen by FOX23, ‚Äú[Garrow] knowingly executed, and attempted to execute, a scheme‚Ä¶to defraud a financial institution, and to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, and other property owned by‚Ä¶a financial institution.‚Äù Garrow is facing one count of bank fraud along with a separate count of willfully making and subscribing a false federal income tax return. In a statement to the media, BOK said it is cooperating with law enforcement. ‚ÄúShane Garrow‚Äôs employment was terminated earlier this year upon the discovery that he had breached company policy.

Between December 16 and 22, MicroStrategy acquired 5,262 BTC, investing approximately $561 million, the company announced on December 23. The firm purchased Bitcoin at an average price of roughly $106,662 per BTC, marking the highest cost it has ever paid for the cryptocurrency. As of December 22, 2024, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries held a total of 444,262 BTC, acquired for a cumulative $27.7 billion at an average price of $62,257 per BTC. The latest purchase is part of a December buying spree, during which the company accumulated 42,162 BTC now valued at $4 billion. However, the latest acquisition accounts for only about 12% of the company‚Äôs total December purchases and represents the smallest amount of BTC bought since mid-2024, when it acquired 169 BTC. MicroStrategy‚Äôs latest Bitcoin purchase is 191% smaller than the acquisition announced on December 16 and 309% smaller than the one disclosed on December 9. The slowdown in BTC buying coincides with concerns raised by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes about a potential market drop tied to the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Hayes‚Äô fund, Maelstrom, plans to clear some positions and re-enter the market later at lower prices. Additionally, rumors suggest MicroStrategy may enter a blackout period in January 2025, halting its issuance of shares and convertible bonds to fund further Bitcoin purchases.

The new sports event trading product allows users to bet on events like the National Football League‚Äôs Super Bowl. Before this time, not much was heard of the prediction market. During the 2024 US presidential, the niche became quite popular, a success that could be attributed to Polymarket. In a blog post , Crypto.com informed its customers, ‚ÄúSports Event Trading is a CFTC-regulated derivatives trading feature available in the Crypto.com App and on the Crypto.com Web.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt presents you with a straightforward Yes/No decision based on whether you believe an outcome of a sporting event will occur,‚Äù the crypto exchange added. Crypto.com Prediction Market: Shift from Polymarket In the days leading to the November 5th US election, Polymarket recorded more than $3 billion¬†in bets. One French man went home with almost $80 million just for placing a wager on Donald Trump winning the election. So far, Polymarket has secured approximately $1 billion¬†of bets that attempted to predict which team will win the next Super Bowl in February. Once Crypto.com‚Äôs sports prediction market is activated, Polymarket may have to share its dominance to accommodate the new addition. The crypto exchange‚Äôs existing roots in the sports industry may serve as an edge for gaining traction quickly. In August, Crypto.com signed a multi-year partnership with the UEFA Champions League. As a result, the exchange became the official sponsor of Europe‚Äôs top tournament soccer club. Crypto.com Picks And Drops Lawsuit Against SEC In another Crypto.com news, the global exchange has decided against moving forward with its lawsuit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Two months ago, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the US SEC involving Gary Gensler and the agency‚Äôs four Commissioners. The legal action responded to an initial Wells Notice, but Crypto.com took no chance before filing a lawsuit. The exchange is challenging what it perceives as an unlawful expansion of SEC jurisdiction over its operations. This latest development followed after a meeting between the exchange‚Äôs CEO, Kris Marszalek, and President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on December 16.

Cardano Price Needs to Break This Level to Revive Rally,https://cryptonews.com/news/will-a-santa-rally-save-ada-cardano-price-needs-to-break-this-level-to-revive-rally/,"The Cardano (ADA) price is holding above its 50DMA in the low $0.90s on Monday, as the cryptocurrency market attempts the beginnings of a rebound during a holiday-shortened week. The final trading days are normally bullish in the stock market, with the crypto bulls also hoping for a recovery after last week‚Äôs Fed-fuelled market rout. The Cardano price dropped as low as $0.76 last week, and at current levels above $0.92, it remains 30% down from the highs it hit in early December above $1.30. The Fed shocked markets last week by only forecasting two rate cuts in 2025, less than hoped for. Whilst that has created short-term macro headwinds, crypto has plenty of bullish narratives to fall back on that could support a recovery into the year‚Äôs end. Namely, the incoming Trump administration and Congress are more pro-crypto than most crypto investors/industry participants could have possibly imagined just a few months ago. That means crypto is on the cusp of entering a new golden age, at least in the US, next year. ADA was hurt badly in recent years by regulatory uncertainty. However, the prospect of its founder Charles Hopkinson becoming an advisor to incoming US President Trump on crypto affairs means the future for the Cardano ecosystem is likely very bright. Cardano in 2025 will be insane ‚Äî Deezy.eth (@deezy_BTC) December 23, 2024 The recent market turmoil, thus, likely isn‚Äôt the end of altcoins. Rather, its more likely to have just been a hiccup. However, a rally at the end of the year hasn‚Äôt been confirmed yet. Here are the levels that Cardano needs to clear. Cardano Price Recovery Into The Year‚Äôs End? ADA Needs to Clear This Level A key level of resistance that might block the Cardano price from advancing into the year‚Äôs end is around $1.0. Not only is this a key level of psychological significance, but it also lines up with the downtrend form the yearly highs. Once this level breaks, the likelihood of a retest of yearly highs shoots up. But, for now, ADA remains in a technical downtrend, so in the absence of a broader recovery in risk appetite, traders shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the market reverses lower again in the short-term. However, for those with the ability to hold through short-term price bumps, 2025 promises to be a spectacular year for major altcoins like Cardano. A realistic target for this bull market would be the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the 2023 lows traced back to the 2021 record highs just above $3.0, which is near $5.0. That could mean Cardano could still deliver gains of as much as 5x from current levels, despite already being up around 3x from its October levels. Of course, many bulls are predicting even bigger things for the Cardano price, but no one can really be sure how high the crypto will fly during the upcoming bull market. Cardano to $10 ‚Äî Crypto Jebb (@_CoffeeNCrypto_) December 23, 2024 That means Cardano is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy right now . However, a concern is the lack of major adoption of the blockchain, despite having been around for many years and boasting a large and dedicated community. Rather than putting their eggs all in one basket, a better strategy in crypto is to diversify amongst different coins. Bitcoin , the most established crypto that continues to lead global adoption (national strategic reserves coming in 2025?), should probably be the cornerstone of any investor‚Äôs portfolio. Other major altcoins like Ethereum , Solana and XRP also warrant consideration. But ADA certainly has its place, and could be a major winner in the long run. The post Will a Santa Rally Save ADA?

Speaking in an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Tenev revealed that internal discussions about maintaining Bitcoin reserves occur periodically. However, the company currently has no plans to add Bitcoin to its treasury for investment purposes. Robinhood CEO Explains Bitcoin Strategy Amid Crypto Expansion In a recent interview , Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev explained the company‚Äôs position on holding Bitcoin as part of its reserves. While the topic of Bitcoin reserves arises periodically during internal discussions, Robinhood does not intend to follow companies like MicroStrategy or Tesla by holding Bitcoin for investment purposes. Tenev emphasized that Robinhood remains focused on its role as a trading platform and not as an investment manager. According to Vlad Tenev, adding BTC to the company‚Äôs treasury could complicate investors‚Äô perceptions, casting Robinhood as a ‚Äúquasi Bitcoin-holding play.‚Äù Despite Robinhood CEO statements about not holding Bitcoin for investment purposes, institutional BTC adoption continues to gain momentum. Recently, Matador Technologies announced plans to purchase $4.5 million worth of Bitcoin this month as part of its strategy. The company‚Äôs leadership highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value amid growing concerns over fiat currency devaluation. Stock Correlation With Bitcoin Price Although Robinhood does not hold Bitcoin, its stock (HOOD) has demonstrated a close correlation with Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. The company‚Äôs stock price has surged 202% year-to-date in 2024, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 110% growth in the same period. Robinhood CEO noted that this correlation exists without the need for Robinhood to hold Bitcoin in its treasury. This reinforces the company‚Äôs current strategy of providing crypto trading services rather than direct Bitcoin investment. Moreover, Robinhood‚Äôs crypto-related revenues are projected to grow by 20% by the end of 2025, according to Bernstein analysts. Cryptocurrencies are expected to account for 38% of the platform‚Äôs total revenues, driven by growing user interest and favorable market conditions under Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency. More so, the company‚Äôs planned acquisition of top crypto exchange Bitstamp is set to close in early 2025. This move will boost Robinhood‚Äôs crypto offerings and position the platform as a stronger competitor to exchanges offering more crypto options. Robinhood has traditionally taken a conservative approach to its crypto services. It provides fewer digital assets and trading options compared to its competitors. However, analysts predict that this strategy may evolve as the company integrates Bitstamp and explores new opportunities during the current market cycle. Most recently, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev commented on Bitcoin‚Äôs rally , highlighting its evolution from being dismissed to a serious financial asset. Speaking on CNBC, Tenev attributed the surge to institutional adoption and Federal Reserve Chair Powell‚Äôs comparison of Bitcoin to gold. He also expressed optimism about Paul Atkins‚Äô nomination as SEC Chair.

The potential reasons behind this bullish outlook include the current market sentiment and the positive price action that ADA has displayed in recent days. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming level Since the beginning of December 2024, ADA has experienced a price decline of over 40%, falling below the $1 level. However, with notable attention from traders and investors, the altcoin‚Äôs price appears to be recovering and gaining upward momentum. According to expert technical analysis, ADA appears to be consolidating within a tight range near a strong resistance level of $0.95. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if ADA breaks out of the consolidation zone and closes a daily candle above the $1 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 30% to reach the $1.25 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View Conversely, if the altcoin fails to close above this level and falls below the $0.85 mark, it may find support around the $0.72 level in the future. On a positive note, ADA‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands near the oversold area, indicating potential upside momentum in the days ahead. On-Chain Metrics Support ADA‚Äôs Bullish Outlook This bullish outlook appears to have attracted both long-term holders and traders, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from ADA‚Äôs spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $98 million worth of ADA tokens in the past week. Sourcr: Coinglass In addition to long-term holders, trader participation seems to have skyrocketed. According to the data, ADA‚Äôs open interest has surged by 8%, indicating heightened trader activity and suggesting potential upside momentum. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.94 and has experienced a price surge of over 5.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 18% and continues to rise steadily, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors following the bullish outlook.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 22:58:58
33767162,[object Object],1734994813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Hyperliquid (HYPE) Threatened By North Korean Hackers: What Investors Need To Know,https://bitcoinist.com/hyperliquid-hype-threatened-north-korean-hackers/,"Hyperliquid (HYPE), a decentralized perpetual exchange (DEX) operating on its own Layer 1 blockchain, is currently grappling with significant security concerns after observing abnormal trading activities linked to North Korean hacker groups . Several addresses marked as North Korean hacker have been trading on Hyperliquid, with a total loss of more than $700,000, as first highlighted by @tayvano_, a crypto threat tracker known for his expertise in identifying risks related to North Korean cyber activities. According to @tayvano_, the nature of these transactions suggests that they may be tests of Hyperliquid‚Äôs security systems rather than mere financial activity. He expressed his concerns through a post on X. ‚ÄúDPRK‚Äôs trading career is‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶.going‚Ä¶.. tbh if I was the dude managing Hyperliquid‚Äôs 4 validators (or those fucking ghetto ass binaries on gh) I would be shitting my pants right now. Hyperliquid dudes don‚Äôt seem worried at all though so I‚Äôm sure its fine. DPRK doesn‚Äôt trade. DPRK tests,‚Äù he explained. Further underscoring the urgency of the situation, @tayvano_ followed up with a strong statement about the necessity for immediate action by Hyperliquid to enhance its defenses. ‚ÄúMy offer from 2 weeks ago still stands Hyperliquid. I‚Äôm still happy to do it async or via a call. I can even give you one of my super nice happy colleagues if you don‚Äôt like me. But a massive amount of harm will come to people if you don‚Äôt harden your ass asap,‚Äù he warned. Hyperliquid Faces Some Serious Risks Prithvir Jhaveri, founder and CEO of Loch, a personalized crypto portfolio analytics and intelligence platform, provided an assessment of the challenges which Hyperliquid is facing via X. Jhaveri detailed the operational security risks, highlighting the exposure due to the platform‚Äôs reliance on a minimal number of validators. ‚ÄúWallet addresses well-known to be from the North Korean hacker group Lazarus have been testing Hyperliquid. Typically, these addresses perform tests with live funds before coordinating a hack. Their preferred method of approach is phishing. HL has only 4 validators, all running the same code,‚Äù Jhaveri reported. He also elaborated on the regulatory challenges that Hyperliquid might face. He discussed the potential for violations of US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations due to the platform‚Äôs interaction with entities from a sanctioned country and its operation as an unregistered broker , respectively. They‚Äôre operating financial software that is being used by an OFAC-sanctioned country (DPRK). They can argue that their software is open source and non-custodial, but we‚Äôll have to wait and watch. Moving from 4 validators to 16 could help their case,‚Äù he explained about OFAC risks. About the SEC risks, he added: ‚ÄúThe SEC could go after HL for operating as an unregistered broker. The good thing for HL is that the next administration‚Äôs SEC and Congress are positioned to be pro-crypto and freedom. The issue, however, is that the sponsors for this crypto lobby are directly competitive to HL. HL didn‚Äôt take any VC funding. They‚Äôre up against the big money that is economically incentivized to protect the interests of the current CEXs (Coinbase and Kraken) and L1s (Ethereum and Solana).‚Äù The concentration of market-making activities within Hyperliquid‚Äôs own liquidity provider (HLP) is another concern Jhaveri raised, pointing out the risks associated with a centralized approach to liquidity. He warned that any significant exploit could lead to substantial financial loss for customers: ‚ÄúThe HyperLiquid Liquidity Provider (HLP) is by far the largest MM by volume [‚Ä¶] One bug or exploit and customer funds could vanish quickly.‚Äù In conclusion, Jhaveri summarized the strategic position of Hyperliquid amid these challenges. ‚ÄúThe HL team has built an incredible product. Trading perps on Hyperliquid is unparalleled in UX. However, the risks they face are not nothing. If they can overcome these, Valhalla is not far away [‚Ä¶], but I‚Äôm struggling to see the risk-adjusted upside in bidding right now.‚Äù he concluded.

The latest acquisition has pushed Metaplanet‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to 1,762, bought at an average price of $75,600 per BTC. Notably, this $61 million purchase is nearly double the value of Metaplanet‚Äôs previous largest acquisition, which occurred in November and was worth close to $30 million. The company‚Äôs consistent BTC accumulation has earned it the nickname ‚ÄúAsia‚Äôs MicroStrategy,‚Äù in reference to the US-based business intelligence firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy.

According to Metaplanet‚Äôs official announcement, its BTC Yield ‚Äì a proprietary metric used to measure the performance of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy ‚Äì stood at 310% from October 1 to December 23. The firm emphasized that this strategy is designed to be ‚Äúaccretive to shareholders.‚Äù Despite today‚Äôs significant BTC purchase, Metaplanet‚Äôs stock price saw little movement, closing at $22.5, down 0.98% for the day. However, on a year-to-date basis, the company‚Äôs stock has surged by an astounding 1,982%, reflecting the long-term benefits of its Bitcoin-centric strategy. Bitcoin Supply Crunch To Hasten Adoption? With Bitcoin‚Äôs total maximum supply capped at 21 million, the digital asset has solidified its reputation as an inflation-resistant store of value. A recent report highlights that BTC supply on crypto exchanges has hit multi-year lows, indicating that holders are increasingly withdrawing BTC from exchanges, reducing circulating supply and potentially driving prices higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Grows As Rumble Unveils $20 Million BTC Treasury Strategy Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity has triggered an unofficial race among corporations ‚Äì and possibly even governments. For instance, Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 recently purchased 990 BTC for $100 million, increasing its total holdings to over 10,000 BTC. Similarly, MARA, another Bitcoin mining company, acquired 703 BTC earlier this month, bringing its total holdings to 34,794 BTC. Speculations surrounding a potential US strategic Bitcoin reserve are further strengthening BTC‚Äôs supply crunch narrative, which may fast-track its adoption. At press time, BTC trades at $94,003, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from Yahoo!

While Ethereum ( ETH ) and XRP products enjoyed $51.3 million and $8.8 million in inflows each, multi-asset investment products, those investing in a basket of cryptos instead of just one, saw a significant uptick in outflows. ‚ÄúThe most dramatic flows were from multi-asset investment products, which saw US$121m of outflows last week.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This large transaction has drawn attention as market analysts predict a possible rally in XRP‚Äôs price, with some suggesting a new all-time high could be on the horizon. Massive XRP Whale Transfer Sparks Speculation The 60 million XRP transfer, first reported by blockchain monitoring platforms, involved a substantial movement of XRP tokens, raising questions about potential strategies by large holders. XRP whale movements are often linked to preparation for major market events or price shifts especially with the XRP ETF increasing launch potential. EGRAG Crypto, a notable market commentator, expressed optimism about XRP‚Äôs trajectory, predicting a surge to $27. He pointed out that XRP is hovering above its Break of Structure (BOS) level while aligning with the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which could pave the way for a bullish breakout. Additionally, data from CryptoQuant revealed that XRP is the most traded alternative cryptocurrency on Binance‚Äôs futures market this December, with $116.6 million in trading volume. Analysts suggest this heightened activity may indicate increasing interest in the asset ahead of the potential Santa Claus rally. Historical Patterns Indicate Potential Breakout Market chartists have drawn comparisons between XRP‚Äôs current price movements and its behavior during the 2017 bull run amid the XRP whales moves. A trader, known as Crypto Vilian, highlighted XRP‚Äôs price pattern, which mirrors its 2017 trajectory of a steep decline, recovery, consolidation, and eventual explosive breakout. Crypto Vilian noted that XRP price recently broke out of a prolonged bearish trend, entering a consolidation phase that historically preceded significant upward movements. He also suggested that XRP‚Äôs market cap could exceed $1 trillion in this cycle, translating to a price of over $17 per token. However, he emphasized that this outcome would depend on broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. XRP Price Faces Short-Term Bearish Patterns Despite long-term bullish expectations, XRP‚Äôs daily chart reveals a descending triangle pattern, indicating potential short-term bearish pressure. According to TradingView, the support level lies near $2.19, while the downward trendline of lower highs may lead to a drop to $1.69 if breached. On the other hand, analysts see room for recovery if XRP bounces from its current support level. A break above the $2.50 resistance could invalidate bearish predictions and set the stage for XRP to retest its recent high of $2.90. Meanwhile, on-chain data from Messari shows that XRP addresses holding over one million tokens have been reducing their balances, signaling profit-taking by large holders during the asset‚Äôs consolidation phase. This activity has added to market pressure in recent weeks prompting worries XRP price may not be heading for a rally soon unless bouyed by the Ripple SEC case end and Gary Gensler stepping down in January.

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the FSC told media representatives the reports were ‚Äúnot true.‚Äù Will Regulator Let South Korean Companies Buy Crypto? Reports circulated at the start of the month claiming that the FSC was prepared to allow universities and schools to trade donations made in crypto for fiat. This, the reports claimed, would represent the first step on a roadmap. This same roadmap would eventually allow South Korean firms to buy coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , they added. [Press Release] The Financial Services Commission held a meeting to review business financing conditions and response strategies with officials from policy financial institutions and related businesses on December 19. https://t.co/QtSVRIB88h ‚Äî Financial Services Commission ‚Äì FSC Korea (@FSC_Korea) December 19, 2024 The reports also claimed that the FSC would let ‚Äúordinary‚Äù firms buy crypto before the banking sector. ‚ÄúWe are still discussing whether we will allow corporations [to buy and sell crypto]. The reports are not true. The Financial Services Commission‚Äôs Virtual Assets Division has not confirmed anything about this matter.‚Äù South Korean Financial Services Commission spokesperson South Korean law does not explicitly prevent firms from holding crypto. However, to trade BTC, ETH, and altcoins, private individuals need to open crypto exchange -linked bank accounts.

They claim they have been left behind by their international rivals in the US and Japan. American firms like MicroStrategy and Japanese companies like Remixpoint have built up considerable Bitcoin reserves in recent years. However, the FSC has refused to allow South Korean companies to do likewise. It has claimed that further discussion is required beforehand. The same FSC spokesperson also denied reports that the regulator had scheduled a timeframe for approving crypto spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has shown steady performance, currently trading around $3,315, highlighting its resilience in the volatile crypto space. Meanwhile, EOS is making waves with strategic initiatives and partnerships aimed at improving scalability and usability. At the same time, Qubetics ($TICS) has achieved an impressive milestone with its presale success, selling over 372 million tokens to more than 11,500 holders. Qubetics is setting itself apart by tackling the complexities of cryptocurrency management, making it accessible and efficient for users worldwide. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Crypto Transactions Qubetics is breaking barriers with its Non-Custodial Multi Chain Wallet, designed to simplify cryptocurrency management. By integrating with payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay, the wallet aims to make crypto transactions as seamless as everyday payments, whether you‚Äôre on iOS, Android, or desktop. A standout feature of the Qubetics wallet is its smart contract conversion mechanism. This tool automatically converts digital assets into fiat currencies at the point of sale, protecting users from market volatility and ensuring smooth transactions. For example, imagine a global freelancer who deals with clients paying in various cryptocurrencies. With Qubetics, payments are instantly converted to their desired fiat currency, eliminating exchange rate concerns and market fluctuations. Currently, the Qubetics presale is in its 14th stage, having sold over 372 million tokens and raising $7.5 million. At $0.0377 per token, now‚Äôs the perfect time for investors to join before the price increases by 10% in the upcoming 15th stage this weekend. With its mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, Qubetics is making a significant impact in the crypto world. Ethereum (ETH): Consistent Growth and Network Upgrades Ethereum continues to solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Trading at approximately $3,315, Ethereum has shown steady growth even amidst market volatility. Its consistent performance highlights the trust and reliance the crypto community places in Ethereum. Ethereum 2.0 upgrades have been instrumental in enhancing the platform‚Äôs scalability, security, and energy efficiency. These improvements have attracted more developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its network, further boosting its utility and adoption. Consider a scenario where a startup leverages Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain for smart contracts. The platform‚Äôs robust infrastructure and widespread adoption make it an ideal choice for businesses looking to implement secure and scalable blockchain solutions. As decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to flourish, Ethereum remains a critical foundation for the ecosystem. Analysts predict that with growing institutional interest and network developments, Ethereum could reach new milestones in the coming year, reaffirming its place among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. EOS (EOS): Aiming for Scalable Solutions EOS is carving its niche in the competitive world of cryptocurrencies by focusing on scalability and developer-friendly infrastructure. Currently trading at approximately $0.79, EOS has experienced fluctuations but remains a viable option for dApp developers. Recent partnerships and upgrades have aimed at improving transaction speeds and reducing costs, positioning EOS as a cost-effective alternative for blockchain-based applications. For instance, a gaming company exploring blockchain integration for in-game assets can benefit from EOS‚Äôs efficient infrastructure to provide a seamless user experience. Despite challenges, EOS‚Äôs community remains active, driving forward initiatives that enhance the platform‚Äôs utility and adoption. Its ability to cater to developers seeking scalable solutions makes it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. Conclusion The crypto market offers diverse opportunities, and Qubetics, Ethereum, and EOS are leading the way. Qubetics is redefining digital transactions with its innovative wallet, Ethereum continues to dominate with consistent growth and network enhancements, and EOS is providing scalable solutions for dApp developers. Based on the latest research, we recommend considering Qubetics ($TICS), Ethereum (ETH), and EOS (EOS) as some of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 .

Kalshi, one of the sharpest platforms out there, says there‚Äôs now a 77% chance that one of the Magnificent 7 companies (Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia, or Alphabet) will take the plunge and buy Bitcoin in 2025. A few months ago, those odds were sitting at 49%. What happened? Michael Saylor, a man who treats Bitcoin like religion, has been out here pushing companies like Microsoft to stop playing it safe and start stacking sats. Let‚Äôs call it what it is: the market smells blood, and by blood, we mean Bitcoin. 2025 could be even better than 2024 has already been. These guys have been circling the crypto waters for years, and the odds are now higher than ever that one of them is finally going to bite. Let‚Äôs take a look at what they think about Bitcoin *now.* Alphabet keeps Bitcoin at arm‚Äôs length Company number one is Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, which has been doing that thing where it dips a toe into the crypto pool but doesn‚Äôt want to admit it‚Äôs swimming. Back in 2018, it banned crypto ads altogether because, apparently, scams are bad for business. Fast-forward to this year, and they seem like they‚Äôve realized blockchain technology might actually be worth something. Google Cloud is exploring blockchain for enterprise clients, focusing on things like security and transparency. Meanwhile, Alphabet‚Äôs financials are looking good. Google Cloud revenue hit $11.4 billion in Q3, up 35%. The company‚Äôs stock is up more than 30% since September, making it a top performer in that market. Amazon‚Äôs boardroom brawl Amazon‚Äôs shareholders aren‚Äôt exactly the same though. In December, they told the board to put their money where the future is. Specifically, they want Amazon to invest 5% of its $88 billion in cash reserves into Bitcoin. That‚Äôs $4.4 billion, for those keeping score at home. But wait, there‚Äôs more. Insiders reportedly say Amazon is already thinking about dropping $250 million on Bitcoin. Why? Because new accounting rules from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) make it easier to hold crypto on the books. Meanwhile, rumors are going around that Amazon could start accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano as payment soon. Amazon‚Äôs stock is trading at $225, up 20% for the year. With a market cap of $2.36 trillion, they‚Äôre incredibly powerful. If they jump into Bitcoin, it‚Äôll be like Tyson stepping into a middleweight ring. Apple sticks to its lane As for Apple, it isn‚Äôt exactly rushing to buy Bitcoin. Instead, they‚Äôre making it easier for their customers to buy it. Earlier this month, the company partnered with Coinbase to let users buy cryptos directly through Apple Pay. That‚Äôs all we got on them for now. Apple‚Äôs stock is trading at $180, with a market cap north of $2.8 trillion. They‚Äôre playing it safe, but their users? Not so much. Might be time to give the people what they want. Meta pivots to NFTs while Microsoft backs the blockchain Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been pushing NFTs hard, integrating them into Instagram and Facebook. Reports say NFT transactions on Meta‚Äôs platforms are up 40% since launch. But let‚Äôs not forget Meta‚Äôs bigger play: the metaverse. They‚Äôre betting on blockchain to power virtual transactions, and that means they‚Äôre not done with crypto yet. Meanwhile, Microsoft is keeping things corporate. Azure, its cloud platform, has rolled out Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS). Over 500 companies are already using it to build decentralized apps. Microsoft is also throwing cash at startups in DeFi and NFTs. The stock is $380 a share and the company has a $2.8 trillion market cap. But when Michael Saylor suggested that they add Bitcoin to their balance sheet just some weeks back, they told him NO. Tesla and Nvidia: Bitcoin holdings and mining wars Tesla‚Äôs Bitcoin story is well-known. They‚Äôve got $1.5 billion in Bitcoin on their books and are thinking about bringing back Bitcoin payments for their cars. Elon Musk might be polarizing, but Tesla‚Äôs crypto strategy isn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre holding steady while pushing for greener mining practices. Their stock? Trading at $280, with a market cap of $900 billion. Then there‚Äôs Nvidia. Their GPUs are the backbone of crypto mining, especially for Bitcoin miners. But Nvidia‚Äôs relationship with crypto isn‚Äôt all roses. They‚Äôre facing a Supreme Court case over allegations they misled investors about crypto revenue back in 2018. Still, their stock is trading at $140, with a market cap of $3.42 trillion. Legal drama aside, the company has staged nothing short of a remarkable performance this year.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI.

BTFD Coin Offers a 50% Discount for Big Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/floki-inus-ico-left-you-out-btfd-coin-offers-a-50-discount-for-big-returns/,"Floki Inu‚Äôs ICO might have left some investors kicking themselves, but don‚Äôt worry! If you‚Äôre looking to make up for it, BTFD Coin is offering you the opportunity of a lifetime. The coin is currently in presale, and thanks to a 50% festive discount, you can get in at just $0.000064 per token. This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs a community-driven project designed to stand the test of time. Plus, it‚Äôs no secret that meme coins like Floki Inu have shown massive growth, so imagine the potential of BTFD Coin with its strong features and strategic pricing rollout. Inspired by the 1973 market crash, BTFD Coin is taking a page from the ‚ÄúBuy The Dip‚Äù playbook, offering Stage 7 prices that mirror the power of buying in during a market dip. When the market starts to rise, those who bought at a discount will reap the rewards. Just like those who bought during the 1973 crash saw exponential gains once the market recovered, BTFD Coin could bring the same results for presale investors. It‚Äôs an unmissable opportunity that you can unlock with the BIG50 code. Floki Inu‚Äôs ICO ‚Äì The One That Got Away Floki Inu is a meme coin that managed to make waves from the moment it launched. The project took inspiration from Elon Musk‚Äôs beloved dog, Floki, and launched with an ICO that attracted a lot of buzz. Early investors who got in on the ground floor saw their coins soar, and the rest of the market quickly took notice. As Floki Inu continued to rise, FOMO kicked in, and many were left wishing they‚Äôd acted sooner. But here‚Äôs the thing: BTFD Coin is giving you another shot. While you might have missed out on Floki Inu, you now have the chance to invest early in BTFD Coin before its value skyrockets. Just like Floki Inu, BTFD Coin has all the ingredients to be the next big thing‚Äîmeme coin culture, community power, and strategic partnerships that will fuel its rise. The early bird truly gets the worm, and BTFD Coin is giving you that opportunity at a discounted price. BTFD Coin ‚Äì A Meme Coin with More Than Just a Fun Name BTFD Coin is not your typical meme coin. It‚Äôs built on the idea of buying the dip, and this stage is specifically inspired by the classic market strategy used after the 1973 market crash. The idea is simple: when the market dips, it‚Äôs the perfect time to buy. And with BTFD Coin‚Äôs Stage 7 price rollback, you‚Äôre getting the dip at the lowest possible price. Besides its price strategy, BTFD Coin brings a lot to the table. The community-driven project boasts impressive staking rewards , a P2E game, and strong market backing. The presale is already building momentum, and with more than $4.38 raised so far, it‚Äôs clear that BTFD Coin has captured the interest of investors looking to strike it big. This is where the BIG50 code comes in handy. When you use the code during checkout, you‚Äôll unlock a 50% discount on BTFD Coin, giving you access to the Stage 7 price.

Now, let‚Äôs assume the price rises to $0.0006 (which is very likely, considering the presale hype and the project‚Äôs strong fundamentals). That‚Äôs an 837% return on your initial investment, turning your $5,000 into $46,875. The potential upside is absolutely incredible‚Äîespecially if the market behaves like it did post-1973, when prices skyrocketed after the recovery. Investing now could set you up for some serious profits when BTFD Coin hits the open market. How to Unlock the 50% Discount and Get In On BTFD Coin Right Now Unlocking your 50% discount on BTFD Coin is straightforward.

Analyst Predicts Explosive Rally After Dip,https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoins-third-leap-incoming-analyst-predicts-explosive-rally-after-dip/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) could be in for a prolonged period of pain, following by an explosive rally starting in April 2025. That‚Äôs according to the analysis of X user Master Kenobi, who outlined this interesting take in a recent tweet. What if DOGE‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶is gearing up for its third and final leap in such a scenario? A slow drop until April 15, followed by a strong pump starting May 5, reaching its peak around mid-August? Not saying it will happen, but it caught my eye, and I thought I'd share it with you‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/M2kcNs7JPT ‚Äî Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) December 21, 2024 Master Kenobi looked at the price action of Dogecoin in 2024, where it saw a surge to highs in the $0.23 area, before then stagnating for months ahead of a breakout in the final final months of 2025 to new yearly highs above $0.40. If this price pattern repeats, that could mean Dogecoin is in for a period of stagnation until mid-April, before then breaking out again around the mid-point of next year. Could a Dogecoin Rally Come Sooner? Its an interesting theory. But the Dogecoin bulls will be pleased to hear that risks are very much tilted in favor of the Dogecoin price rallying much sooner than next April. Why? The facetiously named Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) , headed by none other than Elon Musk (an ardent Dogecoin supporter for years now) is set to officially land in Washington in January. Incoming US President Donald Trump , whose administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, has given DOGE a mandate to reduce fraud and waste in government spending. Musk is already having an impact in Washington ‚Äì his vocal criticisms on X of a recent Congressional spending bill resulted in the bill being reduced from over 1500 pages in length to a little over 100. Expect D.O.G.E to dominate the headlines in 2025, all but ensuring that Dogecoin retains a commanding portion of mindshare in the meme coin markets . That means as the Trump trade returns to lift crypto prices higher, as is likely in the coming weeks, DOGE will be a prime candidate to outperform. However, chart analysis continues to point to downside risks for the Dogecoin price, for now. Last around $0.32, Dogecoin fell under its 21 and 50DMAs following its price collapse last week. And DOGE is yet to retest its early 2024 highs in the $0.23 area, which will be a key target for the bears. Chart analysis suggests DOGE could be headed lower in the short term. However, if it does reach the low $0.20s, it could be a great coin to buy on the dip. With Dogecoin likely to vault above $1.0 and post gains in the 5x region this bull market, it‚Äôs a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now . Dogecoin Alternative to Consider ‚Äì Flockerz (FLOCK) While Dogecoin could do very well in 2025, there are many smaller, lesser-known meme coins that could post far larger gains. The team at crypto news.com keeps a close eye on the meme coin market as they hunt for high-potential projects. And one new meme coin they like a lot is an exciting new DAO-powered vote-to-earn meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) . Big Announcement for The Flock In just 30 days the Flockerz presale will end. This is your last chance to get in on the ground floor, to grab your share of the presale head on over to: https://t.co/HKN509Un5J It's time to join The Flock! pic.twitter.com/OWkEzSXu3u ‚Äî Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 23, 2024 One of the reasons analysts at crypto news.com are so excited about this token is the impressive pace at which is has been raising funds from earlier investors. Despite only launching a few weeks ago, Flockerz (FLOCK) has already attracted over $7.6 million from eager buyers. Couple that with its impressive social media metrics, and this token is looking like a meme coin that could really pop. With new meme coins like Fart Coin recently hitting a $1 billion market cap, the appetite for novel new meme coins appears elevated. FLOCK could easily become one of the best meme coins to launch in 2024. ClayBro outlines in the video below why he thinks FLOCK is set to launch at the perfect time, just ahead of a new meme season.

This round adds to the $6 billion raised earlier this year, bringing the company‚Äôs total funding to $12 billion. The capital injection positions xAI to expand its generative AI initiatives and enhance its competitive edge. Elon Musk xAI Achieves $12B Total Funding After Latest $6B Round According to a recent report , Elon Musk xAI has successfully secured $6 billion from investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Fidelity, Nvidia, and others. This latest funding round exclusively involved previous investors, many of whom had supported Musk‚Äôs acquisition of X (formerly Twitter). The funds bring xAI total capital raised to $12 billion. The company plans to use this funding to accelerate the development of its generative AI model, Grok, and expand its ecosystem. This substantial financial backing positions the firm to compete with industry leaders such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Moreover, the Grok AI model, developed by xAI, powers a range of features on X, including a chatbot available to premium and free users in select regions. Known for its functionality, Grok can generate images through the Flux generator, analyze visuals, and summarize trending news. In October, xAI launched an API allowing developers to integrate Grok into third-party apps and platforms. The company also introduced a standalone iOS app for testing, further extending its generative Artificial Intelligence capabilities. Memphis Data Center and Infrastructure Upgrades To support its ambitious goals, Elon Musk xAI operates a Memphis data center equipped with 100,000 Nvidia GPUs. The facility, constructed in just 122 days, currently relies partly on diesel generators. According to the blog post, the company has plans to double the center‚Äôs capacity in 2025, securing approval for additional power. The upgraded infrastructure will also benefit Tesla, with plans to integrate xAI‚Äôs developments into autonomous driving technologies. This expansion reflects Elon Musk‚Äôs vision to enhance AI applications across industries. While Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI has made rapid advancements, it continues to face fierce competition. Rivals such as Anthropic and OpenAI have also secured billions in funding. Following the growing competition, earlier this month, the Tesla CEO filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI coerced investors to avoid supporting rivals like Musk‚Äôs xAI. Musk‚Äôs legal team claims that Microsoft‚Äôs $13 billion investment in OpenAI led to conflicts of interest and market manipulation In addition, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the need for stricter oversight to prevent nonprofit entities from exploiting their status for financial gain. Joining Elon Musk, Zuckerberg called for a formal investigation into OpenAI‚Äôs transition, highlighting potential misuse of tax-exempt donations and resources.

Among these metrics, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for long-term holders has particularly emerged as a critical tool for assessing investor sentiment and market resilience. Long-term holders, defined as investors holding Bitcoin for over 155 days, are often viewed as a stabilizing force in the market. Their selling patterns can significantly influence price trends, making SOPR an indicator worth watching. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Leverage and Coinbase Premium: What Recent Data Reveals Long-Term Holder Trends And Market Sentiment Recent analysis from a CryptoQuant analyst known as Cryptoavails highlights that Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term holder SOPR metric continues to exhibit notable patterns as Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends upward. Historically, SOPR values above 1 indicate that long-term holders are selling at a profit, while values below 1 suggest they are offloading their holdings at a loss. This behavior reflects broader market confidence or capitulation during periods of price decline. Currently, the SOPR metric remains consistently above 1, signaling that long-term holders are selling profitably without adding significant downward pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. The analysis from Cryptoavails tracks key phases in the Bitcoin market over the past two years, highlighting significant shifts in SOPR values. For instance, in early 2022, the SOPR metric showed high volatility with frequent spikes, suggesting intense profit-taking activity by long-term holders. Amid these sales, Bitcoin‚Äôs price experienced a downward trend, reflecting persistent selling pressure during that period. This trend gradually shifted in late 2022 and early 2023 when the SOPR metric mostly remained below 1, indicating that long-term holders were selling at a loss as the market sought to find stability. By mid-2023, the SOPR began trending upwards, signaling renewed confidence among long-term investors. The metric consistently moved closer to or above the critical level of 1, suggesting that long-term holders were once again selling at a profit while market confidence began to recover. This upward trend has remained intact into 2024, supported by Bitcoin‚Äôs rising price levels. Importantly, there have been no significant sell-offs by long-term holders, reinforcing the broader market‚Äôs stability, according to the crypto analyst. SOPR As A Forward Indicator For Market Growth Overall, Cryptoavails¬†mentioned that the current state of Bitcoin‚Äôs SOPR suggests a healthy market dynamic, with long-term holders contributing to a stable price structure. Despite periodic corrections, the sustained presence of SOPR above 1 indicates that selling pressure remains controlled. Related Reading: What‚Äôs The Worst Case Scenario For Bitcoin Right Now?
