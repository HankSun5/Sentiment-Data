The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI steals the spotlight as Cardano and Toncoin lose investor momentum. Table of Contents Cardano and Toncoin: A decline in investor confidence Why Lightchain AI shines Future outlook Cardano (ADA) and Toncoin (TON) are seeing their momentum slow as Lightchain AI (LCAI) emerges as a more promising opportunity in the market. Currently priced at just $0.003 in its presale phase, Lightchain AI is drawing attention for its potential to transform decentralized applications (dApps) and governance. Cardano and Toncoin: A decline in investor confidence Cardano and Toncoin have been seen as good blockchain plans, but new market signs show a drop in trust from investors. Cardano‚Äôs growth speed, though bold, often gets bad remarks for holdups in adding important parts, making some wonder if it can stay up with quicker changing systems. Likewise, Toncoin, with its special blockchain setup tied to the Telegram world, has a hard time keeping up due to few userÕès outside its small group. These issues have made investors skeptical, especially in a market where new projects give better chances for growth. Lightchain AI, for example, has changed its aim by offering a new AI-blockchain mix during its presale phase, pulling in investors looking for fresh ideas and gain. As such, ADA and TON are falling back to smart projects like LCAI. You might also like: Dogecoin targets $2 but Lightchain AI could be the winner with $10 and a 30,000x return Why Lightchain AI shines Lightchain AI distinguishes itself from Cardano and Toncoin through its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Central to Lightchain AI‚Äôs architecture are the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. The AIVM is designed to optimize the execution of AI-specific tasks, enabling efficient and scalable dApps. Lightchain AI‚Äôs tokenomics are structured to ensure sustainability and equitable distribution. The total supply of LCAI tokens is capped at 10 billion, with 40% allocated for presale, 30% for ecosystem development, 20% for team and advisors, and 10% reserved for future partnerships and strategic initiatives. This allocation strategy aims to foster long-term value for ecosystem participants. Moreover, the roadmap for Lightchain AI is ambitious, focusing on the seamless integration of AI and blockchain to address challenges such as scalability, privacy, and trust. Key milestones include the development and deployment of the AIVM, implementation of the PoI consensus mechanism, and the launch of a suite of AI-driven dApps. LCAI‚Äôs presale phase is priced low at just $0.003 per token, offering investors an opportunity to buy into a potentially disruptive technology at an early stage and reap exponential returns. With limited tokens available during this phase, investors are scrambling to secure their piece of the future through LCAI. Future outlook The Lightchain AI presale has drawn significant attention from blockchain enthusiasts and investors who see its potential to transform the industry. With its future-oriented approach to integrating AI and blockchain, LCAI is positioned to lead the next wave of disruptive technologies. As Cardano and Toncoin experience a slowdown in investor confidence, LCAI‚Äôs momentum continues to build, making it the choice for those seeking growth and transformative technology in their blockchain investments.

A publication from the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Structured Finance sheds light on major global banks collaborating with Ripple to create a potential alternative to SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. The financial institutions mentioned‚ÄîBank of America, Santander, UniCredit, Standard Chartered, Westpac Banking Corporation, and Royal Bank of Canada‚Äîrepresent a substantial segment of the global banking industry. Their collaboration with Ripple underscores a pivotal shift in how financial transactions might be conducted, moving towards the adoption of blockchain technology for cross-border payments.

Blockchain‚Äôs ability to process secure and bilateral transactions in near real-time offers a significant advantage over legacy systems, which can be slow, expensive, and prone to error. Using distributed ledger technology, Ripple aims to simplify and accelerate global money movement while reducing associated costs. Traditionally, SWIFT has dominated the cross-border payments space, serving as the backbone for international transactions. However, its reliance on multiple intermediaries often results in delays and increased transaction fees. Through innovative blockchain solutions, Ripple promises instant settlements with reduced costs and a robust audit trail, making it a formidable alternative to SWIFT. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The participation of major banks in this initiative reflects growing confidence in blockchain‚Äôs potential to transform global financial systems. Ripple‚Äôs established network, RippleNet, allows financial institutions to connect seamlessly, facilitating secure and efficient international transactions. The Future of Cross-Border Payments The collaboration signifies a notable moment for blockchain adoption in traditional banking. By leveraging Ripple‚Äôs technology, these banks aim to reduce the capital tied up in the global trade settlement system and enhance the speed and reliability of their services. This move aligns with a broader industry trend of adopting blockchain to improve transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions. While the details of this collaboration are still emerging, the implications for the broader financial ecosystem are profound. If Ripple‚Äôs solutions prove successful, they could disrupt SWIFT‚Äôs longstanding dominance, paving the way for a new era in international finance.

According to a scoop shared by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the Helio deal is worth about $150 million. If successful, this will mark the largest acquisition made by the Miami-based firm since its inception. Moonpay and Helio as the Power Duo While much detail has not emerged regarding the terms of the deal, many in the ecosystem are already weighing the potential. Notably, Helio will enable Moonpay to compete directly with Coinbase Commerce as a self-service crypto payments outfit. Helio enables content creators and ecommerce merchants to get paid for their products and services using crypto. Among the available products includes Solana Pay, the payments engine powering the DexScreener platform. As Terrett highlighted, the Solana Pay outfit is also integrated into Shopify.

It currently powers a lot of crypto payments services with an extensive partnerships record. As reported by Coingape in October, it landed a Venmo partnership to enable crypto access to 60 million users worldwide. With crypto adoption growing, the need for more merchant integrations have grown considerably. Moonpay is among the infrastructure firms benefitting from these growth and Helio might help amplify this. Growing Corporate Investments in Crypto Since the victory of Donald Trump as president-elect last month, the corporate alignment has increased. Suddenly, companies are beginning to revamp their investment strategies in a bid to benefit from the potential incoming pro-crypto administration. From Justin Sun investing $30 million into World Liberty Financial to Tether‚Äôs latest $775 million investment in Rumble, firms are largely diversifying their portfolios. While M&A activities beyond the potential Moonpay deal might appear too formal, the presence of Bitcoin and Ethereum-based ETF products is removing entry barriers for firms. BlackRock invests in IBIT , setting a precedent for state pension funds to also join the trend. Asset management firms are doubling down on other crypto ETF products to grant firms more access to gain exposure to the crypto industry.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

Despite this, Japan-based Metaplanet has reaffirmed its confidence by buying nearly 620 BTC. Interestingly, the latest acquisition marks its largest Bitcoin purchase to date. Metaplanet‚Äôs Largest Single BTC Acquisition According to the company‚Äôs official press release , the acquisition, executed as part of its Bitcoin Treasury Operations, involved the purchase of 619.7 BTC, worth around $60.6 million.

William Shane Garrow ‚Äì who was senior vice president and a private banker at BOK until being fired early this year ‚Äì is accused of embezzling $4,277,227 from at least 16 customer accounts and funneling the funds to himself, FOX23 reports . Garrow, who was hired in 2007, allegedly began committing the crimes on September 9, 2012, and continued all the way to April 10, 2024. He‚Äôs accused of draining cash from customer accounts without them knowing and transferring the funds to accounts that he controlled at other financial institutions. He‚Äôs also alleged to have written false cashier checks from client accounts and made them payable to himself. If a client noticed discrepancies, Garrow simply told them there was some sort of error, and that BOK would correct it. Says an affidavit seen by FOX23, ‚Äú[Garrow] knowingly executed, and attempted to execute, a scheme‚Ä¶to defraud a financial institution, and to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, and other property owned by‚Ä¶a financial institution.‚Äù Garrow is facing one count of bank fraud along with a separate count of willfully making and subscribing a false federal income tax return. In a statement to the media, BOK said it is cooperating with law enforcement. ‚ÄúShane Garrow‚Äôs employment was terminated earlier this year upon the discovery that he had breached company policy. We have conducted a thorough internal investigation and worked with law enforcement on their investigation.

Between December 16 and 22, MicroStrategy acquired 5,262 BTC, investing approximately $561 million, the company announced on December 23. The firm purchased Bitcoin at an average price of roughly $106,662 per BTC, marking the highest cost it has ever paid for the cryptocurrency. As of December 22, 2024, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries held a total of 444,262 BTC, acquired for a cumulative $27.7 billion at an average price of $62,257 per BTC. The latest purchase is part of a December buying spree, during which the company accumulated 42,162 BTC now valued at $4 billion. However, the latest acquisition accounts for only about 12% of the company‚Äôs total December purchases and represents the smallest amount of BTC bought since mid-2024, when it acquired 169 BTC. MicroStrategy‚Äôs latest Bitcoin purchase is 191% smaller than the acquisition announced on December 16 and 309% smaller than the one disclosed on December 9. The slowdown in BTC buying coincides with concerns raised by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes about a potential market drop tied to the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Hayes‚Äô fund, Maelstrom, plans to clear some positions and re-enter the market later at lower prices. Additionally, rumors suggest MicroStrategy may enter a blackout period in January 2025, halting its issuance of shares and convertible bonds to fund further Bitcoin purchases.

The new sports event trading product allows users to bet on events like the National Football League‚Äôs Super Bowl. Before this time, not much was heard of the prediction market. During the 2024 US presidential, the niche became quite popular, a success that could be attributed to Polymarket. In a blog post , Crypto.com informed its customers, ‚ÄúSports Event Trading is a CFTC-regulated derivatives trading feature available in the Crypto.com App and on the Crypto.com Web.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt presents you with a straightforward Yes/No decision based on whether you believe an outcome of a sporting event will occur,‚Äù the crypto exchange added. Crypto.com Prediction Market: Shift from Polymarket In the days leading to the November 5th US election, Polymarket recorded more than $3 billion¬†in bets. One French man went home with almost $80 million just for placing a wager on Donald Trump winning the election. So far, Polymarket has secured approximately $1 billion¬†of bets that attempted to predict which team will win the next Super Bowl in February. Once Crypto.com‚Äôs sports prediction market is activated, Polymarket may have to share its dominance to accommodate the new addition. The crypto exchange‚Äôs existing roots in the sports industry may serve as an edge for gaining traction quickly. In August, Crypto.com signed a multi-year partnership with the UEFA Champions League. As a result, the exchange became the official sponsor of Europe‚Äôs top tournament soccer club. Crypto.com Picks And Drops Lawsuit Against SEC In another Crypto.com news, the global exchange has decided against moving forward with its lawsuit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Two months ago, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the US SEC involving Gary Gensler and the agency‚Äôs four Commissioners. The legal action responded to an initial Wells Notice, but Crypto.com took no chance before filing a lawsuit. The exchange is challenging what it perceives as an unlawful expansion of SEC jurisdiction over its operations. This latest development followed after a meeting between the exchange‚Äôs CEO, Kris Marszalek, and President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on December 16.

Cardano Price Needs to Break This Level to Revive Rally,https://cryptonews.com/news/will-a-santa-rally-save-ada-cardano-price-needs-to-break-this-level-to-revive-rally/,"The Cardano (ADA) price is holding above its 50DMA in the low $0.90s on Monday, as the cryptocurrency market attempts the beginnings of a rebound during a holiday-shortened week. The final trading days are normally bullish in the stock market, with the crypto bulls also hoping for a recovery after last week‚Äôs Fed-fuelled market rout. The Cardano price dropped as low as $0.76 last week, and at current levels above $0.92, it remains 30% down from the highs it hit in early December above $1.30. The Fed shocked markets last week by only forecasting two rate cuts in 2025, less than hoped for. Whilst that has created short-term macro headwinds, crypto has plenty of bullish narratives to fall back on that could support a recovery into the year‚Äôs end. Namely, the incoming Trump administration and Congress are more pro-crypto than most crypto investors/industry participants could have possibly imagined just a few months ago. That means crypto is on the cusp of entering a new golden age, at least in the US, next year. ADA was hurt badly in recent years by regulatory uncertainty. However, the prospect of its founder Charles Hopkinson becoming an advisor to incoming US President Trump on crypto affairs means the future for the Cardano ecosystem is likely very bright. Cardano in 2025 will be insane ‚Äî Deezy.eth (@deezy_BTC) December 23, 2024 The recent market turmoil, thus, likely isn‚Äôt the end of altcoins. Rather, its more likely to have just been a hiccup. However, a rally at the end of the year hasn‚Äôt been confirmed yet. Here are the levels that Cardano needs to clear. Cardano Price Recovery Into The Year‚Äôs End? ADA Needs to Clear This Level A key level of resistance that might block the Cardano price from advancing into the year‚Äôs end is around $1.0. Not only is this a key level of psychological significance, but it also lines up with the downtrend form the yearly highs. Once this level breaks, the likelihood of a retest of yearly highs shoots up. But, for now, ADA remains in a technical downtrend, so in the absence of a broader recovery in risk appetite, traders shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the market reverses lower again in the short-term. However, for those with the ability to hold through short-term price bumps, 2025 promises to be a spectacular year for major altcoins like Cardano. A realistic target for this bull market would be the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the 2023 lows traced back to the 2021 record highs just above $3.0, which is near $5.0. That could mean Cardano could still deliver gains of as much as 5x from current levels, despite already being up around 3x from its October levels. Of course, many bulls are predicting even bigger things for the Cardano price, but no one can really be sure how high the crypto will fly during the upcoming bull market. Cardano to $10 ‚Äî Crypto Jebb (@_CoffeeNCrypto_) December 23, 2024 That means Cardano is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy right now . However, a concern is the lack of major adoption of the blockchain, despite having been around for many years and boasting a large and dedicated community. Rather than putting their eggs all in one basket, a better strategy in crypto is to diversify amongst different coins. Bitcoin , the most established crypto that continues to lead global adoption (national strategic reserves coming in 2025?), should probably be the cornerstone of any investor‚Äôs portfolio. Other major altcoins like Ethereum , Solana and XRP also warrant consideration. But ADA certainly has its place, and could be a major winner in the long run. The post Will a Santa Rally Save ADA?

Speaking in an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Tenev revealed that internal discussions about maintaining Bitcoin reserves occur periodically. However, the company currently has no plans to add Bitcoin to its treasury for investment purposes. Robinhood CEO Explains Bitcoin Strategy Amid Crypto Expansion In a recent interview , Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev explained the company‚Äôs position on holding Bitcoin as part of its reserves. While the topic of Bitcoin reserves arises periodically during internal discussions, Robinhood does not intend to follow companies like MicroStrategy or Tesla by holding Bitcoin for investment purposes. Tenev emphasized that Robinhood remains focused on its role as a trading platform and not as an investment manager. According to Vlad Tenev, adding BTC to the company‚Äôs treasury could complicate investors‚Äô perceptions, casting Robinhood as a ‚Äúquasi Bitcoin-holding play.‚Äù Despite Robinhood CEO statements about not holding Bitcoin for investment purposes, institutional BTC adoption continues to gain momentum. Recently, Matador Technologies announced plans to purchase $4.5 million worth of Bitcoin this month as part of its strategy. The company‚Äôs leadership highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value amid growing concerns over fiat currency devaluation. Stock Correlation With Bitcoin Price Although Robinhood does not hold Bitcoin, its stock (HOOD) has demonstrated a close correlation with Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. The company‚Äôs stock price has surged 202% year-to-date in 2024, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 110% growth in the same period. Robinhood CEO noted that this correlation exists without the need for Robinhood to hold Bitcoin in its treasury. This reinforces the company‚Äôs current strategy of providing crypto trading services rather than direct Bitcoin investment. Moreover, Robinhood‚Äôs crypto-related revenues are projected to grow by 20% by the end of 2025, according to Bernstein analysts. Cryptocurrencies are expected to account for 38% of the platform‚Äôs total revenues, driven by growing user interest and favorable market conditions under Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency. More so, the company‚Äôs planned acquisition of top crypto exchange Bitstamp is set to close in early 2025. This move will boost Robinhood‚Äôs crypto offerings and position the platform as a stronger competitor to exchanges offering more crypto options. Robinhood has traditionally taken a conservative approach to its crypto services. It provides fewer digital assets and trading options compared to its competitors. However, analysts predict that this strategy may evolve as the company integrates Bitstamp and explores new opportunities during the current market cycle. Most recently, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev commented on Bitcoin‚Äôs rally , highlighting its evolution from being dismissed to a serious financial asset. Speaking on CNBC, Tenev attributed the surge to institutional adoption and Federal Reserve Chair Powell‚Äôs comparison of Bitcoin to gold. He also expressed optimism about Paul Atkins‚Äô nomination as SEC Chair.

The potential reasons behind this bullish outlook include the current market sentiment and the positive price action that ADA has displayed in recent days. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming level Since the beginning of December 2024, ADA has experienced a price decline of over 40%, falling below the $1 level. However, with notable attention from traders and investors, the altcoin‚Äôs price appears to be recovering and gaining upward momentum. According to expert technical analysis, ADA appears to be consolidating within a tight range near a strong resistance level of $0.95. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if ADA breaks out of the consolidation zone and closes a daily candle above the $1 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 30% to reach the $1.25 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View Conversely, if the altcoin fails to close above this level and falls below the $0.85 mark, it may find support around the $0.72 level in the future. On a positive note, ADA‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands near the oversold area, indicating potential upside momentum in the days ahead. On-Chain Metrics Support ADA‚Äôs Bullish Outlook This bullish outlook appears to have attracted both long-term holders and traders, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from ADA‚Äôs spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $98 million worth of ADA tokens in the past week. Sourcr: Coinglass In addition to long-term holders, trader participation seems to have skyrocketed. According to the data, ADA‚Äôs open interest has surged by 8%, indicating heightened trader activity and suggesting potential upside momentum. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.94 and has experienced a price surge of over 5.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 18% and continues to rise steadily, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors following the bullish outlook.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 22:58:58

Metaplanet Increases BTC Holdings To 1,762 The recent crypto market downturn from its all-time highs (ATH) does not appear to bother Metaplanet, as the Tokyo-listed firm made its largest BTC purchase to date, buying 619.7 BTC worth $ 61 million at an average price of around $96,000. Related Reading: Metaplanet To Expand Bitcoin Holdings With $11.3 Million Bond Sale To recall, Metaplanet started buying BTC earlier this year in May with a purchase of 97.9 BTC. Since then, the company has purchased BTC every month, barring September, and crossed the 1,000 BTC milestone in November. The latest acquisition has pushed Metaplanet‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to 1,762, bought at an average price of $75,600 per BTC. Notably, this $61 million purchase is nearly double the value of Metaplanet‚Äôs previous largest acquisition, which occurred in November and was worth close to $30 million. The company‚Äôs consistent BTC accumulation has earned it the nickname ‚ÄúAsia‚Äôs MicroStrategy,‚Äù in reference to the US-based business intelligence firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy. It is worth highlighting that today‚Äôs BTC purchase comes a week after Metaplanet raised $60.6 million through two tranches of bond issuance for the purpose of ‚Äúaccelerating BTC purchases.‚Äù Metaplanet‚Äôs latest purchase also makes its BTC reserves the 12th-largest among publicly listed firms globally.

The firm emphasized that this strategy is designed to be ‚Äúaccretive to shareholders.‚Äù Despite today‚Äôs significant BTC purchase, Metaplanet‚Äôs stock price saw little movement, closing at $22.5, down 0.98% for the day. However, on a year-to-date basis, the company‚Äôs stock has surged by an astounding 1,982%, reflecting the long-term benefits of its Bitcoin-centric strategy. Bitcoin Supply Crunch To Hasten Adoption? With Bitcoin‚Äôs total maximum supply capped at 21 million, the digital asset has solidified its reputation as an inflation-resistant store of value. A recent report highlights that BTC supply on crypto exchanges has hit multi-year lows, indicating that holders are increasingly withdrawing BTC from exchanges, reducing circulating supply and potentially driving prices higher.

38023737,https://coingape.com/?p=230694,1734996077,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"XRP Whales Move $132M Ahead Of Santa Claus Rally, ATH Looming?",https://coingape.com/xrp-whales-move-132m-ahead-of-santa-claus-rally-ath-looming/,"According to blockchain tracker Whale Alert, XRP whales have seen a significant transfer of 60 million XRP, valued at $132,202,106, between two unidentified wallets. This large transaction has drawn attention as market analysts predict a possible rally in XRP‚Äôs price, with some suggesting a new all-time high could be on the horizon. Massive XRP Whale Transfer Sparks Speculation The 60 million XRP transfer, first reported by blockchain monitoring platforms, involved a substantial movement of XRP tokens, raising questions about potential strategies by large holders. XRP whale movements are often linked to preparation for major market events or price shifts especially with the XRP ETF increasing launch potential. EGRAG Crypto, a notable market commentator, expressed optimism about XRP‚Äôs trajectory, predicting a surge to $27. He pointed out that XRP is hovering above its Break of Structure (BOS) level while aligning with the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which could pave the way for a bullish breakout. Additionally, data from CryptoQuant revealed that XRP is the most traded alternative cryptocurrency on Binance‚Äôs futures market this December, with $116.6 million in trading volume. Analysts suggest this heightened activity may indicate increasing interest in the asset ahead of the potential Santa Claus rally. Historical Patterns Indicate Potential Breakout Market chartists have drawn comparisons between XRP‚Äôs current price movements and its behavior during the 2017 bull run amid the XRP whales moves. A trader, known as Crypto Vilian, highlighted XRP‚Äôs price pattern, which mirrors its 2017 trajectory of a steep decline, recovery, consolidation, and eventual explosive breakout. Crypto Vilian noted that XRP price recently broke out of a prolonged bearish trend, entering a consolidation phase that historically preceded significant upward movements. He also suggested that XRP‚Äôs market cap could exceed $1 trillion in this cycle, translating to a price of over $17 per token. However, he emphasized that this outcome would depend on broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. XRP Price Faces Short-Term Bearish Patterns Despite long-term bullish expectations, XRP‚Äôs daily chart reveals a descending triangle pattern, indicating potential short-term bearish pressure. According to TradingView, the support level lies near $2.19, while the downward trendline of lower highs may lead to a drop to $1.69 if breached. On the other hand, analysts see room for recovery if XRP bounces from its current support level. A break above the $2.50 resistance could invalidate bearish predictions and set the stage for XRP to retest its recent high of $2.90. Meanwhile, on-chain data from Messari shows that XRP addresses holding over one million tokens have been reducing their balances, signaling profit-taking by large holders during the asset‚Äôs consolidation phase. This activity has added to market pressure in recent weeks prompting worries XRP price may not be heading for a rally soon unless bouyed by the Ripple SEC case end and Gary Gensler stepping down in January.

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the FSC told media representatives the reports were ‚Äúnot true.‚Äù Will Regulator Let South Korean Companies Buy Crypto? Reports circulated at the start of the month claiming that the FSC was prepared to allow universities and schools to trade donations made in crypto for fiat. This, the reports claimed, would represent the first step on a roadmap. This same roadmap would eventually allow South Korean firms to buy coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , they added. [Press Release] The Financial Services Commission held a meeting to review business financing conditions and response strategies with officials from policy financial institutions and related businesses on December 19. https://t.co/QtSVRIB88h ‚Äî Financial Services Commission ‚Äì FSC Korea (@FSC_Korea) December 19, 2024 The reports also claimed that the FSC would let ‚Äúordinary‚Äù firms buy crypto before the banking sector. ‚ÄúWe are still discussing whether we will allow corporations [to buy and sell crypto].

The Financial Services Commission‚Äôs Virtual Assets Division has not confirmed anything about this matter.‚Äù South Korean Financial Services Commission spokesperson South Korean law does not explicitly prevent firms from holding crypto. However, to trade BTC, ETH, and altcoins, private individuals need to open crypto exchange -linked bank accounts. The regulator‚Äôs guidelines instruct financial institutions to reject all such applications from corporate clients.

They claim they have been left behind by their international rivals in the US and Japan. American firms like MicroStrategy and Japanese companies like Remixpoint have built up considerable Bitcoin reserves in recent years. However, the FSC has refused to allow South Korean companies to do likewise. It has claimed that further discussion is required beforehand. The same FSC spokesperson also denied reports that the regulator had scheduled a timeframe for approving crypto spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The official also said these reports were ‚Äúcompletely groundless,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúWe have not discussed the timing of the launch of virtual asset ETFs.‚Äù Crypto hackers from North Korea stole $1.3 billion in funds in 2024, new data released this week from Chainalysis shows. #NorthKorea #CryptoHackers https://t.co/TQYgKiaQ22 ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2024 ‚ÄòHuge Demand‚Äô Other media outlets, citing anonymous sources, have claimed the FSC is still consulting with ‚Äúministries, organizations, and private experts‚Äù before deciding on new crypto regulations.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has shown steady performance, currently trading around $3,315, highlighting its resilience in the volatile crypto space. Meanwhile, EOS is making waves with strategic initiatives and partnerships aimed at improving scalability and usability. At the same time, Qubetics ($TICS) has achieved an impressive milestone with its presale success, selling over 372 million tokens to more than 11,500 holders. Qubetics is setting itself apart by tackling the complexities of cryptocurrency management, making it accessible and efficient for users worldwide. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Crypto Transactions Qubetics is breaking barriers with its Non-Custodial Multi Chain Wallet, designed to simplify cryptocurrency management. By integrating with payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay, the wallet aims to make crypto transactions as seamless as everyday payments, whether you‚Äôre on iOS, Android, or desktop. A standout feature of the Qubetics wallet is its smart contract conversion mechanism. This tool automatically converts digital assets into fiat currencies at the point of sale, protecting users from market volatility and ensuring smooth transactions. For example, imagine a global freelancer who deals with clients paying in various cryptocurrencies. With Qubetics, payments are instantly converted to their desired fiat currency, eliminating exchange rate concerns and market fluctuations. Currently, the Qubetics presale is in its 14th stage, having sold over 372 million tokens and raising $7.5 million. At $0.0377 per token, now‚Äôs the perfect time for investors to join before the price increases by 10% in the upcoming 15th stage this weekend. With its mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, Qubetics is making a significant impact in the crypto world. Ethereum (ETH): Consistent Growth and Network Upgrades Ethereum continues to solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Trading at approximately $3,315, Ethereum has shown steady growth even amidst market volatility. Its consistent performance highlights the trust and reliance the crypto community places in Ethereum. Ethereum 2.0 upgrades have been instrumental in enhancing the platform‚Äôs scalability, security, and energy efficiency. These improvements have attracted more developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its network, further boosting its utility and adoption. Consider a scenario where a startup leverages Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain for smart contracts. The platform‚Äôs robust infrastructure and widespread adoption make it an ideal choice for businesses looking to implement secure and scalable blockchain solutions. As decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to flourish, Ethereum remains a critical foundation for the ecosystem. Analysts predict that with growing institutional interest and network developments, Ethereum could reach new milestones in the coming year, reaffirming its place among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. EOS (EOS): Aiming for Scalable Solutions EOS is carving its niche in the competitive world of cryptocurrencies by focusing on scalability and developer-friendly infrastructure. Currently trading at approximately $0.79, EOS has experienced fluctuations but remains a viable option for dApp developers. Recent partnerships and upgrades have aimed at improving transaction speeds and reducing costs, positioning EOS as a cost-effective alternative for blockchain-based applications. For instance, a gaming company exploring blockchain integration for in-game assets can benefit from EOS‚Äôs efficient infrastructure to provide a seamless user experience. Despite challenges, EOS‚Äôs community remains active, driving forward initiatives that enhance the platform‚Äôs utility and adoption. Its ability to cater to developers seeking scalable solutions makes it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. Conclusion The crypto market offers diverse opportunities, and Qubetics, Ethereum, and EOS are leading the way. Qubetics is redefining digital transactions with its innovative wallet, Ethereum continues to dominate with consistent growth and network enhancements, and EOS is providing scalable solutions for dApp developers. Based on the latest research, we recommend considering Qubetics ($TICS), Ethereum (ETH), and EOS (EOS) as some of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 .

Kalshi, one of the sharpest platforms out there, says there‚Äôs now a 77% chance that one of the Magnificent 7 companies (Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia, or Alphabet) will take the plunge and buy Bitcoin in 2025. A few months ago, those odds were sitting at 49%. What happened? Michael Saylor, a man who treats Bitcoin like religion, has been out here pushing companies like Microsoft to stop playing it safe and start stacking sats. Let‚Äôs call it what it is: the market smells blood, and by blood, we mean Bitcoin. 2025 could be even better than 2024 has already been. These guys have been circling the crypto waters for years, and the odds are now higher than ever that one of them is finally going to bite. Let‚Äôs take a look at what they think about Bitcoin *now.* Alphabet keeps Bitcoin at arm‚Äôs length Company number one is Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, which has been doing that thing where it dips a toe into the crypto pool but doesn‚Äôt want to admit it‚Äôs swimming. Back in 2018, it banned crypto ads altogether because, apparently, scams are bad for business. Fast-forward to this year, and they seem like they‚Äôve realized blockchain technology might actually be worth something. Google Cloud is exploring blockchain for enterprise clients, focusing on things like security and transparency. Meanwhile, Alphabet‚Äôs financials are looking good. Google Cloud revenue hit $11.4 billion in Q3, up 35%. The company‚Äôs stock is up more than 30% since September, making it a top performer in that market. Amazon‚Äôs boardroom brawl Amazon‚Äôs shareholders aren‚Äôt exactly the same though. In December, they told the board to put their money where the future is. Specifically, they want Amazon to invest 5% of its $88 billion in cash reserves into Bitcoin. That‚Äôs $4.4 billion, for those keeping score at home. But wait, there‚Äôs more. Insiders reportedly say Amazon is already thinking about dropping $250 million on Bitcoin. Why? Because new accounting rules from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) make it easier to hold crypto on the books. Meanwhile, rumors are going around that Amazon could start accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano as payment soon. Amazon‚Äôs stock is trading at $225, up 20% for the year. With a market cap of $2.36 trillion, they‚Äôre incredibly powerful. If they jump into Bitcoin, it‚Äôll be like Tyson stepping into a middleweight ring. Apple sticks to its lane As for Apple, it isn‚Äôt exactly rushing to buy Bitcoin. Instead, they‚Äôre making it easier for their customers to buy it. Earlier this month, the company partnered with Coinbase to let users buy cryptos directly through Apple Pay. That‚Äôs all we got on them for now. Apple‚Äôs stock is trading at $180, with a market cap north of $2.8 trillion. They‚Äôre playing it safe, but their users? Not so much. Might be time to give the people what they want. Meta pivots to NFTs while Microsoft backs the blockchain Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been pushing NFTs hard, integrating them into Instagram and Facebook. Reports say NFT transactions on Meta‚Äôs platforms are up 40% since launch. But let‚Äôs not forget Meta‚Äôs bigger play: the metaverse. They‚Äôre betting on blockchain to power virtual transactions, and that means they‚Äôre not done with crypto yet. Meanwhile, Microsoft is keeping things corporate. Azure, its cloud platform, has rolled out Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS). Over 500 companies are already using it to build decentralized apps. Microsoft is also throwing cash at startups in DeFi and NFTs. The stock is $380 a share and the company has a $2.8 trillion market cap. But when Michael Saylor suggested that they add Bitcoin to their balance sheet just some weeks back, they told him NO. Tesla and Nvidia: Bitcoin holdings and mining wars Tesla‚Äôs Bitcoin story is well-known. They‚Äôve got $1.5 billion in Bitcoin on their books and are thinking about bringing back Bitcoin payments for their cars. Elon Musk might be polarizing, but Tesla‚Äôs crypto strategy isn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre holding steady while pushing for greener mining practices. Their stock? Trading at $280, with a market cap of $900 billion. Then there‚Äôs Nvidia. Their GPUs are the backbone of crypto mining, especially for Bitcoin miners. But Nvidia‚Äôs relationship with crypto isn‚Äôt all roses. They‚Äôre facing a Supreme Court case over allegations they misled investors about crypto revenue back in 2018. Still, their stock is trading at $140, with a market cap of $3.42 trillion. Legal drama aside, the company has staged nothing short of a remarkable performance this year.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

It‚Äôs an unmissable opportunity that you can unlock with the BIG50 code. Floki Inu‚Äôs ICO ‚Äì The One That Got Away Floki Inu is a meme coin that managed to make waves from the moment it launched. The project took inspiration from Elon Musk‚Äôs beloved dog, Floki, and launched with an ICO that attracted a lot of buzz.

Now, let‚Äôs assume the price rises to $0.0006 (which is very likely, considering the presale hype and the project‚Äôs strong fundamentals). That‚Äôs an 837% return on your initial investment, turning your $5,000 into $46,875.

38025659,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322221,1734999492,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38025659.jpeg,Dogecoin‚Äôs Third Leap Incoming? Analyst Predicts Explosive Rally After Dip,https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoins-third-leap-incoming-analyst-predicts-explosive-rally-after-dip/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) could be in for a prolonged period of pain, following by an explosive rally starting in April 2025. That‚Äôs according to the analysis of X user Master Kenobi, who outlined this interesting take in a recent tweet. What if DOGE‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶is gearing up for its third and final leap in such a scenario? A slow drop until April 15, followed by a strong pump starting May 5, reaching its peak around mid-August? Not saying it will happen, but it caught my eye, and I thought I'd share it with you‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/M2kcNs7JPT ‚Äî Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) December 21, 2024 Master Kenobi looked at the price action of Dogecoin in 2024, where it saw a surge to highs in the $0.23 area, before then stagnating for months ahead of a breakout in the final final months of 2025 to new yearly highs above $0.40. If this price pattern repeats, that could mean Dogecoin is in for a period of stagnation until mid-April, before then breaking out again around the mid-point of next year. Could a Dogecoin Rally Come Sooner? Its an interesting theory. But the Dogecoin bulls will be pleased to hear that risks are very much tilted in favor of the Dogecoin price rallying much sooner than next April. Why? The facetiously named Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) , headed by none other than Elon Musk (an ardent Dogecoin supporter for years now) is set to officially land in Washington in January. Incoming US President Donald Trump , whose administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, has given DOGE a mandate to reduce fraud and waste in government spending. Musk is already having an impact in Washington ‚Äì his vocal criticisms on X of a recent Congressional spending bill resulted in the bill being reduced from over 1500 pages in length to a little over 100. Expect D.O.G.E to dominate the headlines in 2025, all but ensuring that Dogecoin retains a commanding portion of mindshare in the meme coin markets . That means as the Trump trade returns to lift crypto prices higher, as is likely in the coming weeks, DOGE will be a prime candidate to outperform. However, chart analysis continues to point to downside risks for the Dogecoin price, for now. Last around $0.32, Dogecoin fell under its 21 and 50DMAs following its price collapse last week. And DOGE is yet to retest its early 2024 highs in the $0.23 area, which will be a key target for the bears. Chart analysis suggests DOGE could be headed lower in the short term. However, if it does reach the low $0.20s, it could be a great coin to buy on the dip. With Dogecoin likely to vault above $1.0 and post gains in the 5x region this bull market, it‚Äôs a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now . Dogecoin Alternative to Consider ‚Äì Flockerz (FLOCK) While Dogecoin could do very well in 2025, there are many smaller, lesser-known meme coins that could post far larger gains. The team at crypto news.com keeps a close eye on the meme coin market as they hunt for high-potential projects. And one new meme coin they like a lot is an exciting new DAO-powered vote-to-earn meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) . Big Announcement for The Flock In just 30 days the Flockerz presale will end. This is your last chance to get in on the ground floor, to grab your share of the presale head on over to: https://t.co/HKN509Un5J It's time to join The Flock! pic.twitter.com/OWkEzSXu3u ‚Äî Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 23, 2024 One of the reasons analysts at crypto news.com are so excited about this token is the impressive pace at which is has been raising funds from earlier investors. Despite only launching a few weeks ago, Flockerz (FLOCK) has already attracted over $7.6 million from eager buyers. Couple that with its impressive social media metrics, and this token is looking like a meme coin that could really pop. With new meme coins like Fart Coin recently hitting a $1 billion market cap, the appetite for novel new meme coins appears elevated. FLOCK could easily become one of the best meme coins to launch in 2024. ClayBro outlines in the video below why he thinks FLOCK is set to launch at the perfect time, just ahead of a new meme season.

This round adds to the $6 billion raised earlier this year, bringing the company‚Äôs total funding to $12 billion. The capital injection positions xAI to expand its generative AI initiatives and enhance its competitive edge. Elon Musk xAI Achieves $12B Total Funding After Latest $6B Round According to a recent report , Elon Musk xAI has successfully secured $6 billion from investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Fidelity, Nvidia, and others. This latest funding round exclusively involved previous investors, many of whom had supported Musk‚Äôs acquisition of X (formerly Twitter). The funds bring xAI total capital raised to $12 billion. The company plans to use this funding to accelerate the development of its generative AI model, Grok, and expand its ecosystem. This substantial financial backing positions the firm to compete with industry leaders such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Moreover, the Grok AI model, developed by xAI, powers a range of features on X, including a chatbot available to premium and free users in select regions. Known for its functionality, Grok can generate images through the Flux generator, analyze visuals, and summarize trending news. In October, xAI launched an API allowing developers to integrate Grok into third-party apps and platforms. The company also introduced a standalone iOS app for testing, further extending its generative Artificial Intelligence capabilities. Memphis Data Center and Infrastructure Upgrades To support its ambitious goals, Elon Musk xAI operates a Memphis data center equipped with 100,000 Nvidia GPUs. The facility, constructed in just 122 days, currently relies partly on diesel generators. According to the blog post, the company has plans to double the center‚Äôs capacity in 2025, securing approval for additional power. The upgraded infrastructure will also benefit Tesla, with plans to integrate xAI‚Äôs developments into autonomous driving technologies. This expansion reflects Elon Musk‚Äôs vision to enhance AI applications across industries. While Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI has made rapid advancements, it continues to face fierce competition. Rivals such as Anthropic and OpenAI have also secured billions in funding. Following the growing competition, earlier this month, the Tesla CEO filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI coerced investors to avoid supporting rivals like Musk‚Äôs xAI. Musk‚Äôs legal team claims that Microsoft‚Äôs $13 billion investment in OpenAI led to conflicts of interest and market manipulation In addition, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the need for stricter oversight to prevent nonprofit entities from exploiting their status for financial gain. Joining Elon Musk, Zuckerberg called for a formal investigation into OpenAI‚Äôs transition, highlighting potential misuse of tax-exempt donations and resources.

Among these metrics, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for long-term holders has particularly emerged as a critical tool for assessing investor sentiment and market resilience. Long-term holders, defined as investors holding Bitcoin for over 155 days, are often viewed as a stabilizing force in the market. Their selling patterns can significantly influence price trends, making SOPR an indicator worth watching. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Leverage and Coinbase Premium: What Recent Data Reveals Long-Term Holder Trends And Market Sentiment Recent analysis from a CryptoQuant analyst known as Cryptoavails highlights that Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term holder SOPR metric continues to exhibit notable patterns as Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends upward. Historically, SOPR values above 1 indicate that long-term holders are selling at a profit, while values below 1 suggest they are offloading their holdings at a loss. This behavior reflects broader market confidence or capitulation during periods of price decline. Currently, the SOPR metric remains consistently above 1, signaling that long-term holders are selling profitably without adding significant downward pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. The analysis from Cryptoavails tracks key phases in the Bitcoin market over the past two years, highlighting significant shifts in SOPR values. For instance, in early 2022, the SOPR metric showed high volatility with frequent spikes, suggesting intense profit-taking activity by long-term holders. Amid these sales, Bitcoin‚Äôs price experienced a downward trend, reflecting persistent selling pressure during that period. This trend gradually shifted in late 2022 and early 2023 when the SOPR metric mostly remained below 1, indicating that long-term holders were selling at a loss as the market sought to find stability. By mid-2023, the SOPR began trending upwards, signaling renewed confidence among long-term investors. The metric consistently moved closer to or above the critical level of 1, suggesting that long-term holders were once again selling at a profit while market confidence began to recover. This upward trend has remained intact into 2024, supported by Bitcoin‚Äôs rising price levels. Importantly, there have been no significant sell-offs by long-term holders, reinforcing the broader market‚Äôs stability, according to the crypto analyst. SOPR As A Forward Indicator For Market Growth Overall, Cryptoavails¬†mentioned that the current state of Bitcoin‚Äôs SOPR suggests a healthy market dynamic, with long-term holders contributing to a stable price structure. Despite periodic corrections, the sustained presence of SOPR above 1 indicates that selling pressure remains controlled. Related Reading: What‚Äôs The Worst Case Scenario For Bitcoin Right Now? Analyst Explains The analyst also pointed out that this behavior reflects market maturity, where long-term investors are not rushing to offload their holdings despite Bitcoin‚Äôs price appreciation. Regardless, Bitcoin has continued to consistently decrease in price since its sharp drop below $100,000 last week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at a price of $93,991 down by 1.6% in the past 24 hours.

33767162,[object Object],1735000244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,BlackRock‚Äôs Ethereum ETF Soars Past 1 Million ETH ‚Äì Can Price Follow?,https://bitcoinist.com/blackrocks-ethereum-etf-soars-past-1-million-eth-can-price-follow/,"While Ethereum (ETH) has once again failed to break through the stubborn $4,000 resistance level, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust ETF has quietly accumulated over one million ETH. This milestone reflects strong institutional demand for Ethereum, even as its price performance in 2024 remains lackluster. Institutional Interest In Ethereum On The Rise Year-to-date (YTD), Ethereum ‚Äì the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap ‚Äì has risen by 43%, climbing from approximately $2,280 on January 1 to $3,283 at the time of writing. While this is notable, ETH‚Äôs performance has been overshadowed by other cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana (SOL), and SUI, which have posted significantly higher gains in the same period. However, Ethereum holds a key advantage over most altcoins ‚Äì direct access to institutional investors through regulated ETFs, akin to Bitcoin‚Äôs position in the market. In a recent post on X, crypto entrepreneur Dan Gambardello highlighted that BlackRock‚Äôs Ethereum ETF has now surpassed one million ETH in holdings. Gambardello noted that ETH‚Äôs consolidation below its all-time high (ATH), combined with growing institutional interest, sets the stage for a potential altcoin season ‚Äúunlike any we‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù Recent ETH ETF inflow data appears to support this outlook. According to data from SoSoValue, US spot ETH ETFs have had four continuous weeks of net inflows, attracting more than $2 billion in capital. The total net assets held across all US spot ETH ETFs stand at $12.15 billion, equivalent to almost 3% of Ethereum‚Äôs total market cap. Crypto analysts remain optimistic that Ethereum, the leading smart-contract platform, is on track to reach a new ATH. For instance, CryptosRus pointed out that historically, Ethereum has demonstrated bullish price action during the first four months of the next year, following US presidential elections. The chart below shows that after the 2016 US election, ETH rallied significantly during the first quarter of 2017. A similar pattern was observed in 2021 following the 2020 election, with Ethereum recording four consecutive weeks of price increases. From a technical perspective, crypto analyst @CryptoPoseidonn shared an 8-hour ETH chart, suggesting that ETH may bottom around the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), marked in green. The analyst stated: The first pullback since the last significant upside move, and fear is at its peak. I believe this is where we print a higher low. Dips like these are opportunities to increase your spot exposure. Is The Market Correction Nearing Its End? The total crypto market cap has dropped from $3.9 trillion on December 16 to $3.4 trillion at the time of writing ‚Äì a $500 billion loss in a week. Data from Coinglass reveals that over $289 million worth of liquidations occurred in the past 24 hours alone. Despite this downturn, seasoned crypto analyst Pentoshi suggested on the 3-day chart that the crash could serve as a retest of the previous crypto market cap ATH recorded in November 2022. If so, this level might act as a base for the next upward rally. However, not all analysts are bullish in the short term.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 344,000 YouTube subscribers that the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/ BTC ) pair is flashing a ‚Äúmajor altcoin signal.‚Äù However, he warns that altcoins still have a bit further to drop before market sentiment turns around and sparks a rally. ‚ÄúETH/BTC in November got a bounce but again it still has not broken past at least the 4% level and the major level that I‚Äôm watching for an overbalance in price here is 0.046 [BTC]. That‚Äôs going to give us an overbalance in price to the upside and ideally if [the 0.032 BTC] low isn‚Äôt taken out, it‚Äôll be overbalanced in time as well and that would be that major altcoin signal, when everyone has that extreme greed, the excitement and the belief that these markets are just not going to come back down. We‚Äôre still not there yet so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too crazy to think that we‚Äôd see further at least consolidation but until that happens, you‚Äôre probably not going to get that same extreme excitement to the upside.‚Äù According to the trader, ETH/BTC is mirroring the same pattern it did in 2020 before taking off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs similar to what happened in December of 2020 and what followed December 2020 is your massive January bar: big, big volume, big reversal‚Ä¶ So we have a look back to January [2021]. Y ou start to see that volume really pick up early on and just come back out of nowhere. You can see [December 27th, 2020] it started to pick up and [on] the 3rd of January [2021], [a] nice big move. Third and fourth [of January], [ETH/BTC] starts to break those tops and then consolidate above those support levels. You can see they‚Äôre around 3% and then it started to move again ‚Äì sure it came back down, but that gives you the overbalance that you‚Äôre looking for, meaning more buyers for a longer period of time and they‚Äôre holding the price up. That‚Äôs exactly what we need to see, and we haven‚Äôt seen it yet with the ETH/BTC chart.‚Äù ETH/BTC is valued at 0.0342 BTC ($3,264.68) at time of writing.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

JasmyCoin (JASMY) Imagine having full control over your personal data and deciding how it‚Äôs used. JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a project from a Tokyo-based company called Jasmy Corporation that aims to make this possible. They specialize in the Internet of Things (IoT), connecting devices like computers, cars, and phones. By combining IoT with blockchain technology, Jasmy creates a secure platform where users can safely store and exchange their data. In this system, your personal information becomes your own asset, and you have the power over it. In today‚Äôs market, data privacy is more important than ever. JasmyCoin stands out by focusing on protecting individual data rights. Unlike some other coins that prioritize speed or scalability, JASMY puts data ownership front and center. This aligns with a growing trend where people want more control over their digital lives. As concerns about data security rise, a coin that empowers users could draw more interest. While the crypto market is always changing, JasmyCoin‚Äôs unique approach to data democratization makes it an intriguing player to watch. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency world, born from the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Launched on the Ethereum blockchain, this deflationary memecoin has captured the attention of many. It follows in the footsteps of other meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. By embracing its meme origins and keeping things simple with a no-tax policy and being upfront about its lack of utility, PEPE appeals to those who enjoy the fun side of crypto. In late April and May of 2023, PEPE‚Äôs value skyrocketed, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion at its peak. Early investors saw huge gains, and a strong community formed around it. This surge sparked what some call a ‚Äúmemecoin season,‚Äù with new memecoins popping up and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE‚Äôs roadmap includes plans for major exchange listings and aims for a ‚Äúmeme takeover.‚Äù Whether PEPE will reach new heights remains uncertain, but with the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a Bull Run, many are watching closely. For those intrigued by meme coins and high-risk, high-reward opportunities, PEPE might be an attractive option in the current market. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is an innovative project founded in 2017 and launched on Binance in 2019. It‚Äôs building an open, decentralized machine learning network powered by blockchain technology. Fetch.ai aims to make AI accessible to everyone through a permissionless network.

With its unique blend of AI and blockchain, Fetch.ai has significant potential. In the current market, the coin looks promising, especially as interest in AI and decentralization grows. Price predictions suggest FET could gain value in the coming years, reaching over $1 by 2025 and $1.19 by 2030. Compared to other AI-focused coins like SingularityNET or Ocean Protocol, Fetch.ai stands out with its autonomous agents and practical applications. As demand for AI solutions increases, Fetch.ai might be a project to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Stellar Lumens (XLM) Stellar Lumens (XLM) is changing the way money moves around the globe. Founded in 2014, Stellar is a decentralized network that uses blockchain technology to make sending funds fast and affordable. It doesn‚Äôt pick favorites among currencies. Instead, it allows people to transfer any type of money, whether it‚Äôs a national currency or a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Over the years, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and teamed up with major companies. With Stellar apps, individuals can send money worldwide, and businesses can build their own blockchain tools or use the network for payments and currency exchanges. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies that aim to replace traditional financial systems, Stellar wants to work with them. It offers a platform where different financial systems can collaborate. This approach sets it apart in the current market, where cooperation is becoming more important. The Stellar Development Foundation, supported initially by Stripe, helps promote the network‚Äôs use. It works on projects like NFT creation and smart contracts. As the crypto market evolves, Stellar‚Äôs focus on bridging old and new financial worlds might make it stand out among other coins. Its technology and partnerships could play a key role in the future of global finance.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price shifts in recent times. Over the past week, its value dropped by 15.25%, marking a significant decline. In the last month, the price decreased by 2.48%, and over six months, it edged down by 2.16%. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range of $3648.43 to $4137.17, reflecting the volatility in the market. Technical indicators hint at possible future movements for Ethereum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.07, approaching oversold levels, suggesting a potential rebound. The Stochastic indicator stands at 21.50, also indicating an oversold condition. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -21.52, showing bearish momentum. The price hovers near its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $3331.27 and $3461.32, respectively. Ethereum‚Äôs immediate resistance level is at $4318. If the price breaks above this point, it could aim for the second resistance at $4807, an increase of around 11%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3340.38. A drop below this could lead to the second support level at $2851.64, a decrease of about 15%. Given the current indicators and support levels, Ethereum may be poised for a turnaround or further decline, making this a critical juncture for the asset. XRP (XRP) Over the past six months, XRP has seen a remarkable increase of 366.94%. This significant rise reflects strong interest and trading activity around the cryptocurrency. In the last month, XRP‚Äôs price climbed by 77.14%, showcasing a robust upward trend. However, the past week experienced a dip of 7.81%, indicating some short-term volatility. Currently, XRP is trading between $2.03 and $2.73. The nearest resistance level is at $3.02, a point that, if surpassed, could lead to testing the second resistance at $3.73. On the other hand, the nearest support lies at $1.61, with a secondary support at $0.9041. These levels are key indicators of potential price movement in either direction. Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $2.24 and $2.28 respectively, suggesting the market is consolidating. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.72, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0059, which could point to a mild bearish sentiment. Monitoring these indicators can provide insight into XRP‚Äôs potential price direction in the near future. Solana (SOL) SOL has faced notable price shifts recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 18.80%, and over the last month, it decreased by 30.50%. Despite these declines, Solana has grown by 34.97% over the past six months. The current trading range is between $205.85 and $239.87, showing significant volatility. Technical indicators suggest the bearish trend might persist. The RSI is at 38.29, nearing oversold levels. The MACD is negative at -1.376, and the Stochastic oscillator is low at 26.34. These figures point towards potential further declines, but they could also hint at an upcoming reversal if buyers step in. Solana‚Äôs nearest support is at $188; falling below this could lead to a drop to the next support at $154. On the upside, resistance levels are at $256 and $290. To reach the first resistance, Solana needs to rise by about 8%. A decline to the nearest support means a decrease of around 10%. The 10-day SMA is $182.89, and the 100-day SMA is $193.52, indicating recent prices are above average. Conclusion Though ETH, XRP, and SOL are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely merges sports and memes, positioning itself for significant growth in the current bull run.

Among the many players in this space, Qubetics , Tron, and Immutable X stand out for their distinct approaches and recent developments. Each of these altcoins offers unique insights into the evolving blockchain landscape. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at their current status and potential. Qubetics: Transforming Financial Interactions Through Blockchain Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in blockchain innovation with a mission to revolutionise how financial transactions occur. By offering a secure, user-friendly, and inclusive platform, Qubetics allows individuals and institutions to manage tokenised assets effortlessly while conducting efficient cross-border payments . Its goal is to redefine global finance through accessible financial services, tokenised asset trading, and innovative payment solutions. In Presale Phase 14 , Qubetics has captured significant attention due to its structured presale model. Weekly phases see a 10% price increase, and the final stage promises a 20% hike, creating a sense of urgency for early investors. Priced at $0.037 per $TICS token, the project has raised over $7.5 million, boasts more than 11,500 holders, and sold 372 million tokens. The anticipated post-presale price of $0.25 signals an ROI of 630% for current buyers, making it an enticing opportunity. Analysts further predict that the token could rise to between $10 and $15 after the mainnet launch, highlighting its long-term potential. With a clear vision, strong presale momentum, and a strategic roadmap, Qubetics is a project to watch closely in blockchain. Tron (TRX): Challenges Amidst Market Pressure Tron, once a prominent player in the DeFi space, has recently faced significant hurdles. Its native token, TRX, has been on a consistent downward trajectory, recording a 10.56% loss over the past week. The decline has raised concerns among investors, especially as the network struggles to compete with Ethereum in the supply of USDT. Tether‚Äôs recent minting activities have seen Ethereum secure a larger share of the $2 billion in USDT issued since early November, leaving Tron behind. This shift has added to the mounting challenges TRX faces, further diminishing its appeal in the eyes of investors. Adding to the pressure, large-scale holders or ‚Äúwhales‚Äù increasingly highlight newer projects like Lunex Network, which offer high growth potential. While Tron‚Äôs robust infrastructure and active community suggest that it retains the capacity for recovery, the network must innovate and address these challenges to regain investor confidence and market relevance. Immutable X (IMX): Volatility Ahead of Token Unlock Immutable X, a blockchain platform based in Sydney, Australia, has established itself as a leading Ethereum Layer 2 solution specialising in NFTs and gaming. However, the platform faces significant price volatility as it approaches a major token unlock event. Immutable X plans to release 24.5 million IMX tokens, valued at over $33 million, as part of its tokenomics strategy. This monthly release, a standard feature of the project‚Äôs design, introduces additional supply to the market, often leading to downward price pressure. IMX‚Äôs price has declined to its lowest since November 21, falling below critical support levels. Analysts predict further declines leading up to the unlock event on December 27, with the token potentially approaching a support zone around $1.1720. A Diversified Approach to Investing The stories of Qubetics, Tron, and Immutable X underscore the diversity of opportunities within the cryptocurrency market. Qubetics offers a promising presale phase with exceptional ROI potential and a transformative vision for blockchain-based financial services. Tron‚Äôs challenges reflect the competitive nature of the DeFi sector, yet its infrastructure and community offer hope for a turnaround. Despite short-term volatility, Immutable X continues to innovate in the NFT and gaming space, making it a key player in these expanding industries. Investors must assess their risk tolerance, investment goals, and market trends to make informed decisions about these altcoins. As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, these projects highlight cryptocurrencies‚Äô dynamic possibilities.

As established tokens grapple with changing trends, attention is turning to this new contender. The developments ahead could alter market perceptions and ignite fresh interest among investors and enthusiasts. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life ‚Äî posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That‚Äôs the DOGEN lifestyle ! If you‚Äôre the kind of guy who‚Äôs always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win . HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market This thing is about to explode! We‚Äôre talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up ‚Äî and that‚Äôs just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you‚Äôre already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain , running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat ‚Äî all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN‚Äôs flying under the radar, but it‚Äôs about to set new records in this bull run. You don‚Äôt want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‚Äòcause they‚Äôre holding an airdrop ! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you‚Äôll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! Floki: From Meme Coin to Utility Token with Real-World Applications Floki, inspired by Elon Musk‚Äôs June 2021 tweet about naming his Shiba Inu ‚ÄúFloki,‚Äù began as Floki Inu coin but has evolved beyond a meme coin. It provides utility and charity, such as building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria. Recognized by The Economic Times as a top meme coin to buy in 2023, Floki has projects like the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and DeFi service FlokiFi. Its partnership with NOWPayments and the Floki Card allow tokens to be used for real-world transactions. This diversification into NFTs, DeFi, and real-world use differentiates FLOKI from other meme coins. The coin may appear attractive in the current market cycle due to its expanding utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. The coin started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB aims for broader utility by developing platforms like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and governance system. Its integration with Ethereum allows for potential growth in decentralized applications. Conclusion While FLOKI and SHIB show shifting patterns and may have less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN anticipates 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with potential for massive returns. Following successful tokens like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

XRP, Ripple‚Äôs native token, has seen significant whale activity, suggesting a major price move ahead. Large-scale purchases by whales indicate growing confidence in XRP‚Äôs future, with potential price targets of $3 to $7.5 by 2025. Similarly, SUI, the native token of the Sui Network, has experienced a remarkable surge, with its price pumping 231% over the past year. Dubbed the ‚ÄúSolana killer,‚Äù SUI‚Äôs growth is attracting attention from investors seeking the next big opportunity in crypto. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves by addressing challenges that earlier cryptocurrencies have struggled to overcome. By focusing on user-friendly solutions and seamless integration with existing financial systems, Qubetics aims to make cryptocurrency transactions as straightforward as traditional payment methods. This approach not only simplifies the user experience but also bridges the gap between digital and fiat currencies, fostering broader adoption among businesses and individuals. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Digital Transactions Qubetics is on a mission to streamline digital asset management with its Non-Custodial Multi chain Wallet. This innovative wallet integrates seamlessly with major financial platforms like Apple Pay and Google Pay, making crypto transactions as simple as swiping a card.

Tokens are currently priced at $0.0377, with a 10% price increase anticipated in the upcoming 15th stage this weekend. This presents a timely opportunity for investors to join before the next price surge. Ripple (XRP): Whale Activity Signals Potential Surge XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple, has recently garnered significant attention due to increased whale activity. Large investors have accumulated substantial amounts of XRP, indicating a bullish sentiment and the potential for a significant price movement. For instance, consider a scenario where a major financial institution decides to adopt Ripple‚Äôs technology for cross-border payments. This move could streamline their operations, reduce transaction costs, and expedite processing times. Such real-world applications highlight XRP‚Äôs utility and its potential to revolutionize traditional financial systems. Market analysts have responded to this whale activity with optimistic forecasts for XRP‚Äôs future. Predictions suggest potential price targets of $3 to $7.5 by 2025, based on current accumulation trends and investor confidence. SUI (SUI): A Rising Star in the Crypto Space SUI, the native token of the Sui Network, has been making significant strides in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past year, SUI‚Äôs price has surged by 231%, reflecting growing interest and investment in the platform.

The United States Department of Justice announced that the pair face charges including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and stalking. According to prosecutors, Hay and Mayo promoted various NFT and digital asset projects, providing misleading roadmaps and making ‚Äúmaterially false and misleading statements‚Äù about their intentions to fulfill project promises. One such project, Vault of Gems, was marketed as the first NFT project ‚Äúpegged to a hard asset.‚Äù However, prosecutors claim the duo abandoned the initiative after collecting millions from investors. Principal Deputy Attorney General Nicole Argentieri stated: ‚ÄúGabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo allegedly defrauded investors in digital asset projects of tens of millions of dollars and threatened an individual who attempted to expose their roles in these fraudulent schemes.‚Äù When a project manager revealed their involvement in another NFT project, Faceless, Hay and Mayo allegedly resorted to harassment and intimidation, targeting the individual and their family. The Justice Department revealed that the duo used similar tactics across multiple projects, including Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Dirty Dogs, MoonPortal, and Squiggles. To obscure their involvement, they reportedly misrepresented others as the project owners. Argentieri emphasized the Justice Department‚Äôs commitment to combating digital asset fraud, saying: ‚ÄúFraudsters take advantage of new technologies and financial products to steal investors‚Äô hard-earned money.‚Äù Officials vowed to work with law enforcement to uproot crypto fraud schemes and protect investors.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Metaverse|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 02:12:21

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solaxy nears $5M presale goal, offering low entry prices and high staking APY to early investors on Solana‚Äôs Layer 2. Table of Contents Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Solaxy (SOLX) is developing a Layer 2 solution to enhance the user experience on Solana , and investors are taking notice. Less than two weeks have passed since the presale started, and the project‚Äôs funds are just $419,000 away from the $5 million mark. Since the project is still in its early stages, investors have a chance to secure their share of SOLX at a low price and benefit from a massive staking APY to maximize their investment. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at this project and what it‚Äôs all about. You might also like: Crypto.com launches U.S. trust company Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum The Solaxy presale officially opened its doors to early investors on December 12th, and it has already raised over $4.5 million. While the project‚Äôs scope plays its part in attracting investors, Solaxy is featured on Best Wallet‚Äôs Upcoming Tokens section, making it available to the app‚Äôs 100,000+ monthly users and boosting its visibility further. This makes it very similar to Pepe Unchained (PEPU), an Ethereum -based Layer 2 blockchain project that successfully ended its presale phase with over $73 million raised. Once its presale ended, PEPU launched on Uniswap and soared by more than 600% in the first 48 hours, securing listings on LBank, BingX, MEXC, and other exchanges as its price rose. Comparing the early success of these two presales puts Solaxy ahead, as Pepe Unchained took more than a month to raise $4.5 million. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1870529241072173066 To enter the presale, investors can purchase SOLX using BNB, ETH, USDT , or a bank card. No minimum investment is required. Currently, SOLX costs $0.001576 each, but its per-token price will increase in just one day or if the presale raises another $273,000 by tomorrow. If Solaxy keeps its momentum, it could surpass PEPU‚Äôs success and potentially deliver better returns on launch. Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Solana is among the top three blockchains by transaction volumes, and its daily transaction count has only increased with pump.fun‚Äôs launch. As such, its ecosystem is prone to network overloads and congestion that can result in failed transactions or slow transaction speeds. Solaxy intends to resolve these issues with its Layer 2 blockchain, which will reduce the burden on Solana‚Äôs Layer 1 chain by bundling up and processing transactions in its stead. This won‚Äôt just make Solana more scalable but also more cost-effective for its users. Plus, the bundled transactions will still be finalized on Solana‚Äôs network, leveraging its robust security. The development of the Solaxy Layer 2 blockchain is in full swing, fueled by 30% of the project‚Äôs total 138 billion token supply. Crypto analyst ClayBro has reminded his 134,000-strong audience on YouTube of the congestion issues Solana users faced in March, April, and June of 2024 during meme coin booms. As he anticipates a meme coin supercycle, ClayBro is impressed by Solaxy‚Äôs goal to improve Solana‚Äôs performance and advises his followers to enter the presale while it‚Äôs in its early stages. Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Despite Solaxy‚Äôs ambitious goals and the utility of its upcoming Layer 2 blockchain, it‚Äôs a meme coin first, and as such, its success largely depends on the strength and trust of its community. The project‚Äôs 4-phase roadmap reveals it has a strong focus on community building. Its first phase prioritizes marketing, for which the project allocated 15% of its total token supply, and that has already attracted over 22,000 followers across Solaxy‚Äôs X (Twitter) and Telegram channels. The presale also adopts a dynamic model for staking rewards to encourage early adoption. As more SOLX gets added to the staking pool, the staking yields reduce, which rewards early participants with the best returns. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 Currently, the project offers an 859% staking APY, allowing investors to nearly 9x their token holdings long-term. Solaxy‚Äôs developers also emphasize investor security, with 10% of the total token supply reserved for liquidity to ensure a safe trading environment. Plus, Coinbase , a security firm, audited the project‚Äôs smart contract and found no issues in its code. Although volatility is as high as ever in the meme coin space, Solaxy stands a solid chance to explode following its DEX launch and the subsequent release of its Layer 2 blockchain.

Dogecoin & Other Top Memecoins Have Seen A Decline In Social Dominance In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about how cryptocurrency market sentiment on social media has changed amid the latest bearish downturn. The indicator of relevance here is the Social Dominance, which keeps track of the percentage of social media discussions related to the top 100 coins by market cap that a particular asset or group of assets is contributing right now. The indicator measures the degree of discussion or talk related to an asset by counting up the number of posts that are making unique mentions of it. The reason it doesn‚Äôt count up the mentions themselves is that they can provide a false picture of the trend being followed in the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Top Above $168,500 Based On This Indicator, Analyst Reveals Focusing on just the posts means that a few outlier ones with hundreds of mentions can‚Äôt skew the data by themselves and the metric only registers a spike when discussion is spread across the major social media platforms. In the context of the current topic, the Social Dominance of two asset classes is of interest: the Layer 1 Top 6 and the Memecoin Top 6. The former includes the six largest layer 1 networks (that is, blockchains that handle their own security and aren‚Äôt built on top of another network, like Bitcoin) and the latter the six largest meme-based tokens (like Dogecoin). Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Social Dominance for these two types of cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks: As displayed in the graph, the Social Dominance of the Memecoin Top 6 was high a couple of weeks ago, implying social media users were highly interested in Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and other such tokens. Since then, however, the metric has followed an overall downward trajectory for this class of assets. It would appear that investor attention has shifted to Bitcoin and other layer 1 assets, as their combined social dominance has risen during the same period. Historically, whenever Dogecoin and other memecoins have been at the center of attention in the market, it has been a sign that the investors are becoming greedy. Related Reading: XRP Could Be The Altcoin To Recover Quickly, CryptoQuant Analyst Explains Why Cryptocurrency markets generally tend to move against the expectations of the majority, so it may not be a surprise that this greedy sentiment was followed by a downturn in the sector. The shift in Social Dominance to safer investments like Bitcoin would imply the investors are now becoming fearful. It‚Äôs possible that the sector would continue to decline in the coming days, but at least with the sentiment seeing a flip, there is more of a chance that a bottom can be reached. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.31, down more than 24% over the last seven days.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 02:36:00

Then, in 2021, Solana attracted the market‚Äôs interest by blazing blockchain scalability and speed. One issue many investors wonder about as the sector develops is which altcoin will copy these spectacular profits in 2025. One competitor that stands out is Rexas Finance (RXS) , a concept ready to rethink asset tokenization completely. Rexas Finance is a top choice for investors wishing to profit from the next great opportunity since analysts estimate gains of up to 10,000% by 2025. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Ethereum‚Äôs 2017 ascent The explosive climb of Ethereum in 2017 was just amazing. Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain‚Äôs release helped distributed apps (dApps), distributed finance (DeFi), and ‚Äî above all‚Äî smart contracts ‚Äî which let developers create programmable assets‚Äîto emerge. Ethereum surged from roughly $8 in early 2017 to over $1,400 by January 2018 due to this invention, generating a tsunami of demand from institutional investors, developers, and regular users. Ethereum‚Äôs success came from its strong ecosystem of projects and developers and its unique capacity to offer a venue for creating distributed apps. Despite significant obstacles, including high transaction fees and scalability problems, Ethereum stayed a prominent participant in the market, and its success encouraged a fresh round of blockchain initiatives. Solana: The 2021 sensation By 2021, Solana became the next major altcoin with significant potential profits. Early investors would find exceptional gains as SOL‚Äôs price skyrocketed from about $1 at the start of the year to over $200 by the year‚Äôs conclusion. The scalability of Solana and the expanding DeFi and NFT ecosystems created on its platform drove its success. Solana is still a prominent player in the blockchain market despite network failures and technical problems in 2022; many think it has great potential for development in the following years. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 Rexas Finance: The next 10,000% altcoin? One altcoin that is attracting significant attention as we approach 2025 is Rexas Finance . Rexas Finance addresses a distinct challenge: tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), while Ethereum and Solana concentrate mainly on dApps and blockchain scalability. The project seeks to tokenize tangible and financial assets, including real estate, commodities, and intellectual property, generating more liquidity and accessibility for investors. Rexas Finance could upset established asset markets using blockchain technology to permit fractional ownership and enable smooth trade of tokenized assets. This invention will democratize access to valuable assets, appealing to regular consumers and institutional investors. The project‚Äôs ecosystem includes a suite of tools for asset tokenization, including the Rexas Token Builder, QuickMint Bot, and the GenAI system, simplifying the process of creating and managing digital assets. The presale performance of Rexas Finance is among its most interesting developments. With tokens valued at $0.15 in Stage 10, Rexas Finance is in the middle of a successful presale as of writing. $29,341,073 has been raised for the presale so far, and early backers of the project are hopeful about its exponential expansion once it launches on tier-1 exchanges in 2025. Being an exciting altcoin for long-term expansion, some analysts estimate RXS might experience a price spike of up to 10,000% by the end of 2025. Why might Rexas Finance be the next major altcoin? Rexas Finance‚Äôs unique value proposition and capacity to solve critical issues in the asset management field define its potential for significant returns. By allowing the tokenization of actual assets, Rexas Finance is opening doors for most people, opening previously unreachable investing possibilities. Furthermore, appealing to institutional investors seeking blockchain-based solutions to manage their assets, the project emphasizes security, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Moreover, the success of Rexas Finance‚Äôs presale and expanding community will help indicate its significant expansion in 2025. Because of its constant creativity and emphasis on streamlining asset tokenization, Rexas Finance could be a candidate for the best altcoin with a 10,000% ROI in 2025. Conclusion Rexas Finance could be the next major altcoin to provide tremendous gains in 2025. With its emphasis on real-world asset tokenization, successful presale, and roadmap addressing important asset management issues, Rexas Finance is positioned for exponential development.
