The targets include Gazprom, the massive state-owned energy company, and several other major organizations tied to natural resources and finance. Officials involved in the matter did not disclose any more names. Trump hasn’t signed the sanctions yet, but every piece is ready and waiting. One US official said plainly, “It’s totally his call.” Another added that the National Security Council is coordinating the rollout of “more punitive actions.” Trump has been growing frustrated with Putin after repeated attempts to get him to the table have failed. At first, Trump echoed Moscow’s points during the early stages of his private phone calls with Putin. Now he’s running out of patience. Trump presses harder after Putin rejects peace talks James Hewitt, spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Trump is still focused on a full and comprehensive ceasefire. Hewitt refused to say anything about current discussions behind closed doors. If Trump does approve this new sanctions package, it’ll follow the US-Ukraine minerals deal he signed on Wednesday, which was meant to be part of the peace framework. That agreement was pushed hard by Trump to show he’s taking a strong line, even as Putin ignores calls for negotiation. Since the 2022 invasion, the US and its allies have added sanctions over and over. But the Kremlin always finds ways around them. Moscow keeps making money, keeps buying weapons, and the war drags on. That’s why this new set of penalties targets Russia’s lifelines directly. Kurt Volker, who once served as Trump’s envoy to NATO and also handled Ukraine negotiations during his first term, said, “Trump has been bending over backwards to give Putin every opportunity to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to have a ceasefire and an end to the war,’ and Putin keeps rejecting him.” Volker added, “This is the next phase of putting some pressure on Russia. Putin has been escalating.” Trump, meanwhile, “has got the US and Ukraine now in alignment calling for an immediate and full ceasefire, and Putin is now the outlier.” Witkoff meets Putin again as Moscow keeps launching attacks Since returning to the Oval Office in January, Trump has been moving pieces around to try to make the Kremlin play ball. One of the biggest moves was shutting down the Justice Department task force that used to chase down sanctions violators and Russian oligarchs. He’s also made some public comments that support Russia, blaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the war and calling him a “dictator.” None of those gestures worked. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special peace envoy, has taken it further. He’s been promoting a peace deal that would give four Ukrainian regions to Moscow. He’s now met Putin four times, including a visit just last week. But three days after that, Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, repeated Putin’s maximum demands, and more attacks followed. Missile and drone strikes slammed into Ukrainian cities again, killing more civilians. Back in March, Reuters reported that US officials had a sanctions relief plan on the table—ready to give Russia a break if it came to the negotiating table. But that plan is dead for now. Trump’s mood has changed. Last Saturday, he met Zelenskiy in Vatican City for what both sides called a “very productive” meeting. One day later, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was “strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions and Tariffs on Russia” and said they’d stay in place until there’s a full ceasefire and a final deal. Volker also pointed out that Russia is still making serious money off oil and gas sales to India and China. He said the US could go further by using secondary sanctions, a tactic where a country punishes another country for doing business with a third one. In this case, that would mean punishing countries that keep buying from Russia. Volker said it would be “very significant” if Trump pulled that trigger.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) on the other hand has successfully increased its presale raise to $7.3 million by selling 430 million tokens to 9,200 holders. Analysts have identified these cryptocurrencies because they should be considered underpriced assets among the shifting dynamics of the crypto market. The market drive of Dogecoin through memes differs from Mutuum Finance’s organized DeFi strategy though they offer distinct prospective outcomes. The reason behind investor excitement about these tokens will be examined herein for their potential discovery space. Dogecoin’s Resurgent Rally Dogecoin benefits from fresh positive energy spreading throughout its market. The cryptocurrency market response has been highly positive as Dogecoin reached $0.1828 while analysts expect this asset to climb to $1.25 by 2025. Two bullish patterns emerge from the 5-day candlestick chart which strengthens $0.1316 as a solid support level. However, the $0.20 resistance looms large. Several market conditions must be present for Dogecoin to surpass the $0.20 resistance level because market and Bitcoin price performance heavily influence its success. Dogecoin achieved significant price gains during its history but its dependence on public excitement and market moods creates uncertainty for its prolonged existence. Market participants keep their attention on Dogecoin because of its affordable starting value although they remain cautious about the price fluctuations. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) experiences rapid expansion during phase 4 of its 11-phase presale by trading at a price of $0.025. With the ongoing momentum in Mutuum Finance presale the platform has secured $7.3 million worth of investment from 9,200 participating stakeholders. Phase 5 of the presale introduces price hikes to $0.03 which will generate a 20% profit for existing phase 4 investors nearing full capacity. The tokenomics design of Mutuum Finance guarantees investors will profit by 140% during the $0.06 listing price while analysts predict the price should hit $2.50 for a total 9,900% return. Through its buy-and-distribute model Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself in DeFi while awarding substantial returns to its first members. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions as a decentralized lending platform whose operations support this platform. MtETH tokens grant users who deposit assets with ETH the opportunity to earn interest accrual through time. Users obtain funding through supplying assets which exceed collateral requirements for maintaining system safety. The revenue generated by Mutuum Finance buys tokens which are used to pay rewards to stakers thus sustaining continuous market purchase demand. Mutuum Finance recently introduced a platform display that presents the 50 most dominant token holders who will obtain additional rewards when they preserve their standing thus encouraging potential investors to compete. The team will reveal smart contract audit results from Certik at social channels to build trust among investors. Seizing Undervalued Opportunities The crypto market shows diverse potential through the tokens Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Speculators aim for Dogecoin due to its low valuation and price spikes but reaching the target price of $1.25 depends on market dynamics. The ongoing phase 4 presale of Mutuum Finance brings investors the opportunity to enter the DeFi space through a carefully calculated investment method that provides first launch returns of 140% followed by launch-value estimates reaching 9,900%. Investors need to hurry because the exclusive opportunity to purchase MUTM at $0.025 before phase 5 launches.

The Israeli trading platform had hit the brakes on its U.S. initial public offering (IPO) in April due to market chaos caused by Donald Trump’s new tariff policy. However, the trading and investment platform is ready to move forward with its plans, now that global macroeconomics and market conditions are improving. eToro Delays IPO Due to Market Uncertainty eToro wanted to go public in late March and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to start the process. Other big companies like JPMorgan, Binance, and Gemini are also planning to go public. However, President Trump announced new tariffs shortly after, which made the markets unstable, causing eToro to halt its plans. At the same time, other companies were also putting IPO plans on hold due to market worries. Now that the markets are calming down, and stocks like Robinhood have increased by more than 16% in the past month, eToro feels it is a better time to start its plans. The company says it may go public as soon as next week. eToro Sees Stronger Financial Results in 2024 Founded in 2007, eToro allows users to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies and copy the portfolios of successful investors. The company had planned to go public through a SPAC deal with a value of $10.4 billion, but that plan failed. This time, eToro’s business results are much better. In 2024, it earned $931 million in commissions and $192 million in profit. This is a big improvement from 2023, when it earned $639 million in commissions and only $15.3 million in profit. Details of the eToro’s IPO Offering and Overall Market Outlook eToro revealed that the IPO will be backed by major banks, including Goldman Sachs , Jefferies, UBS, and Citigroup. The investment platform plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ETOR.” The company aims to raise its valuation above the $3.5 billion it achieved in 2023 . This funding round was backed by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and ION Group. eToro recently agreed to pay the SEC a $1.5 million fine and limit some of its crypto services in the U.S. to settle charges for offering brokerage services without a license. eToro believes the improved overall crypto market is a good sign to proceed with its IPO plans. Bitcoin (BTC) ‘s market price is now almost $100,000, which has renewed investors’ interest. Many believe crypto rules will be more relaxed with President Trump in office.

Polkadot (DOT) shows a cautious setup, facing repeated rejection near the $4.50 mark, which keeps many watchers uncertain. TRON hasn’t brought much movement either, staying locked around $0.25 for several months, with slow accumulation and no clear direction emerging. This trend echoes across several charts, where momentum tends to weaken just when it’s most needed. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out, offering a rare price of $0.0019 and a possible 2,531% gain for those entering now. While other projects hesitate, this leading decentralized platform is gaining traction as it gears up to reveal a major update tied to 10 planned exchange listings. With $222.5 million already raised, its next step appears just around the corner. Polkadot Price Remains Stuck Under $4.50 Polkadot (DOT) has had difficulty breaking through the $4.50 resistance level over the past several weeks. Following a brief uptick earlier in the month, DOT retraced to $4.09, struggling to regain upward momentum. Current market data shows DOT hovering around $4.25, with little trading volume to drive price action further. Analysts note a lack of strong catalysts or developments within the Polkadot ecosystem that could shift market sentiment in the short term. Despite its robust interoperability framework, DOT is failing to spark significant interest from the broader crypto community at present. Unless there is a major shift in development activity or partnership news, Polkadot may continue to trend sideways, constrained by persistent sell pressure just above the $4.50 mark. TRON Price Holds Steady Near $0.25 TRON (TRX) has remained in a tight price range near the $0.25 level for the past few months. Despite moments of accumulation and brief upward movement, TRX has not been able to decisively break out. The token faces continued resistance near its current levels, while the absence of large-scale updates or ecosystem shifts limits the potential for significant upward movement. Although TRON maintains a solid presence through its stablecoin infrastructure and DeFi integrations, traders appear to be waiting for a more definitive signal. The price continues to be capped by a nearby supply zone, leading to sideways action as market participants remain cautious. Without new growth triggers, TRON is likely to continue trading flat in the near term. BlockDAG Gears Up for Exchange Listings BlockDAG has officially hinted at a significant update tied to its upcoming exchange listing announcement, marking a major milestone on its path toward market entry. Speculation is swirling that this update will unveil details about 10 centralized exchange listings, expected to take place in the near future. This announcement marks the closing stages before BDAG hits public trading. All signs suggest that BlockDAG is fully prepared for this next chapter. With expectations mounting around these exchange confirmations, buyer activity is rising sharply. Currently, the coin is available for a limited time at a special price of $0.0019, down from its earlier $0.0248. This offer ends on May 13. The upcoming Batch 28 will be priced at $0.0262. This pricing tier offers a remarkable 2,520% return for those stepping in now, as BDAG prepares to launch on exchanges at $0.05. Such a return is uncommon, especially for a leading decentralized project that has already secured over $224 million in funding, moved over 19.6 billion BDAG coins, and generated over $6.9 million in miner sales, with a total of 17,232 miners sold. Interest in BlockDAG continues to grow. Rather than fading, this final stage is pulling in new attention as buyers start to realize what lies ahead. The exchange announcement is expected to narrow the gap between presale access and market trading, setting BlockDAG on a fast track toward broader adoption. Few projects earn recognition as standout crypto leaders before entering open markets, yet BlockDAG has managed to do exactly that. The $0.0019 price is scheduled to end on May 13, and with that, the opportunity to be early will close. From there, BlockDAG moves into its defining role as a next-gen decentralized platform. Market Outlook: BlockDAG Outpaces DOT and TRX While Polkadot and TRON continue their sideways movement, BlockDAG is setting a different pace. Its sharp rise in presale earnings and miner adoption signals broader traction across retail buyers and Web3 users. Unlike DOT and TRX, which are bound by resistance zones and limited news, BlockDAG is actively rolling out features, expanding its ecosystem, and preparing for major exchange launches. This divergence in activity is creating a shift in sentiment. For now, BlockDAG stands out as the project with the most immediate potential for movement, both in price and platform utility.

Bitcoin is a matter of national security — Deputy CIA director The US Central Intelligence Agency is increasingly incorporating Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a tool in its operations, and working with the cryptocurrency is a matter of national security, Michael Ellis, the agency’s deputy director, told podcast host Anthony Pompliano. In an appearance on the market analyst and investor’s show, Ellis told Pompliano that the intelligence agency works with law enforcement to track BTC , and it is a point of data collection in counter-intelligence operations . Ellis added: ""Bitcoin is here to stay — cryptocurrency is here to stay. As you know, more and more institutions are adopting it, and I think that is a great trend. One that this administration has obviously been leaning forward into."" ""It's another area of competition where we need to ensure the United States is well-positioned against China and other adversaries,"" Ellis said. Although Ellis's comments point to Bitcoin maturing as an asset, they also reflect the increased involvement of governments and institutions in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This increased involvement runs contrary to the libertarian and cypherpunk ethos originally inherent in crypto. European Union to ban anonymous crypto and privacy tokens by 2027 The European Union is set to impose sweeping AML rules that will ban privacy-preserving tokens and anonymous cryptocurrency accounts from 2027. Under the new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), credit institutions, financial institutions and crypto asset service providers (CASPs) will be prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts or handling privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, such as Monero ( XMR ) and Zcash ( ZEC ). “Article 79 of the AMLR establishes strict prohibitions on anonymous accounts [...]. Credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto-asset service providers are prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts,” according to the AML Handbook, published by European Crypto Initiative (EUCI). The AML Handbook. Source: EUCI The regulation is part of a broader AML framework that includes bank and payment accounts, passbooks and safe-deposit boxes, “crypto-asset accounts allowing anonymisation of transactions,” and “accounts using anonymity-enhancing coins.” US wants to cut off Huione over crypto crime The US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on May 1 proposed blocking the Cambodia-based Huione Group from the US banking system, accusing it of helping North Korea’s state-backed Lazarus Group to launder crypto. Huione Group comprises a network of businesses, which includes payment service platform Huione Pay PLC, the crypto exchange Huione Crypto, and Haowang Guarantee, an online marketplace offering illicit goods and services. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the conglomerate established itself as the “marketplace of choice for malicious cyber actors” like the Lazarus Group, who have “stolen billions of dollars from everyday Americans.” Source: Chainalysis FinCEN said Huione laundered at least $4 billion worth of illicit proceeds between August 2021 and January 2025, including over $36 million from crypto pig butchering scams and $37 million worth of crypto for North Korea. It has also created a US dollar-pegged stablecoin, the US Dollar Huione (USDH), which FinCEN said cannot be frozen and helps to carry out money laundering activities.

According to a new report by CNBC, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer is looking to launch a new crypto asset pegged to the US dollar by the end of the year as its chief executive continues to influence national crypto policies. News of the new stablecoins was confirmed by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino in an interview with CNBC. According to Ardoino, Tether – which is headquartered in El Salvador – is attempting to rebrand itself as being cooperative with law enforcement, as it was previously known as the “go-to” crypto for criminal activity. The report says that Ardoino may have helped shape key legislation, such as the GENIUS Act – a bill that aims to give clear guidelines for stablecoins – and added provisions for Tether to help law enforcement. As stated by Ardoino, according to CNBC, “There is no company… even in the traditional financial system, that has such a breadth of collaboration with law enforcement. We are always trying to do better and more to block criminal activity… we have much better tools than the traditional financial system and we’re proving that every day.” The CEO goes on to address Tether’s reserve assets, a point of contention for the firm in the past, as it agreed to pay $18.5 million to New York in 2021 after it was alleged that it lied about its reserves. “We are very close to having $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries in our reserves. We have $7 billion in excess equity within the company’s capital. That is really unprecedented and I wish financial institutions in the traditional financial system would at least try to copy us to provide better products for their consumers.” Tether, which now regularly publishes attestation statements, holds about $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries managed by the financial giant Cantor Fitzgerald, according to its latest report.

Lummis further alleged that large-scale adoption of Bitcoin would be “transformative” and put “the everyday worker all over the world in control of their money.” “As Bitcoin comes into more usage, its use makes the whole system more secure, more robust, and more capable of serving our needs all over the world,” she added. “We should be the global leader with this fantastic, new ledger-based asset that is in a digital format.” The U.S. Head Towards A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proponents of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve widely believe that it would position the U.S. as a technologically forward-looking global power while acting as a hedge against traditional financial concerns. Trump largely campaigned on enacting a crypto-friendly regulatory framework , promising to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” In March, Trump signed an executive order mandating the development of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and digital asset stockpile. “I am very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry,” he said. “Our country must be the leader in the field.” As of Friday afternoon, Bitcoin continued to experience a slight surge in value, hovering around $97,000.

According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23 , roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token. “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News. Despite Lummis’ reported “pause” over the president’s actions, on May 2, she posted a video to X of herself speaking on the Senate floor, saying she was “particularly pleased” by Trump’s support of legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve in the United States. The Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide, or BITCOIN, Act would seemingly codify Trump’s executive order to create a national crypto reserve. Related: House Democrats want ethics probe on Trump over crypto projects The launch of the TRUMP coin on Jan. 17 was met with outrage from many lawmakers and figures in the crypto industry, who pointed to potential conflicts of interest and implications of allowing foreign actors to channel funds directly to Trump. The criticism continued after Trump announced that a group of the top memecoin holders would have the opportunity to apply for a White House tour and dinner. “Trump once claimed he is so rich he cannot be bought,” said Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen. “But his obsession with money means he apparently can be bought for a meme.” Calls for impeachment over ties to crypto Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, called for Trump’s impeachment during an April 25 town hall, claiming the memecoin dinner represented “selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him.” During his first term, Trump was impeached twice in the House of Representatives but acquitted after the Senate votes fell short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction. At the time of publication, it was unclear who, if any, of the memecoin holders would attend the May 22 dinner with Trump. Usernames from the TRUMP leaderboard have led to speculation that staunch supporters like Tron founder Justin Sun and Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be among the attendees. As of May 2, neither the individuals nor the companies have made any formal announcements.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low. Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators. This price action has occurred alongside significant net inflows into US spot exchange-traded Bitcoin funds (ETFs). Some of the disappointment among traders can be attributed to the ongoing global tariff dispute , which is beginning to affect macroeconomic data. Bitcoin traders are concerned that, despite growing interest from institutional investors, fears of an economic recession could limit price performance. This concern reduces the likelihood of BTC reaching $110,000 or higher in 2025. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch The annualized premium for Bitcoin’s two-month futures has remained between 6% and 7% over the past week, staying within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. Compared to January, when Bitcoin was trading near $95,000 and the futures premium was above 10%, traders’ sentiment has weakened. This data suggests there is less optimism, or at least less conviction, in further price gains toward $100,000 and above. Gold’s performance outshone Bitcoin’s modest gains Some market participants point to gold’s 20% rally, from $2,680 to $3,220, as a source of concern. Although Bitcoin recently surpassed silver’s $1.8 trillion market capitalization to become the seventh largest global tradable asset, gold’s surge to a massive $21.7 trillion valuation has overshadowed this achievement. Investors worry that Bitcoin’s strong correlation with the stock market has diminished the appeal of its “digital gold” narrative. Bitcoin spot US-listed ETFs daily net flows, USD. Source: CoinGlass There is also a possibility that the $3.6 billion in net inflows to US spot ETFs over the past two weeks are being driven by delta-neutral strategies. In this scenario, the flows reflect Bitcoin holders moving to listed products or using derivatives for hedging. If so, the direct impact on price would be limited, which is consistent with Bitcoin’s modest 5% gain during this period. To determine whether professional traders are comfortable with Bitcoin around $97,500, it is helpful to examine the BTC options market. Bitcoin 1-month options 25% delta skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.ch The BTC options 25% delta skew metric is currently near its lowest level since Feb. 15, indicating that whales and market makers are assigning higher odds to further upside from here. This marks a sharp reversal from three weeks ago, when put (sell) options traded at a premium. Related: Bitcoin unsure as recession looms, US-China tariff talks kick off Bitcoin derivatives’ resilience favors further BTC price gains Overall, Bitcoin derivatives indicate moderate optimism. Traders generally expect further price gains, but bulls are refraining from using leverage. Some might argue that this creates the ideal conditions for a surprise rally, especially since the retest of $74,500 on April 9 did not significantly affect BTC derivatives. The most important factor influencing Bitcoin’s performance remains the commercial relationship between the US and China. As long as the trade war continues, Bitcoin is likely to continue tracking the S&P 500 movements. While this environment may prevent Bitcoin from reaching a new all-time high in the near term, BTC derivatives are currently leaning slightly in favor of the bulls.

After jumping by over 15% in the past two weeks and stabilizing firmly above $94,000, most analysts, including Crypto Caesar , believe Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to hit new all-time highs. Despite these projections, investors are more focused on altcoins that are likely to take advantage of Bitcoin’s rebound in May. Among the top picks, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out particularly due to its unique positioning as a presale AI altcoin that has raised over $2 million in just a few weeks. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Ranks As The Best Altcoin Play As Bitcoin (BTC) Rebounds Higher In anticipation of Bitcoin’s (BTC) steady ascent to $100,000, savvy investors are continually stocking up on the FloppyPepe (FPPE) token, and it’s not surprising. This new Matt Furie-inspired meme coin boasts even greater potential than the Pepe coin, poised to potentially dominate the AI crypto market upon its launch. Riding the coattails of AI technology, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has been able to blend humor with advanced tech, allowing holders to earn with its in-house utilities like its Meme-o-Matic and Floppy X . With both components supporting the creation of memes and video contents for sale, this SolidProof-approved altcoin sold out its private presale round in less than a day, raising nearly $1 million. Why FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Path To Mainstream Explosion Is Inevitable Thanks to a glowing review by popular YouTuber Nass Crypto, who described it as an AI altcoin gem with massive upside potential, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is already capturing significant attention. However, here are a few more reasons why this altcoin is bound for inevitable success: Real-Time Reaction to News & Trends: FloppyX bots instantly react to breaking events (crypto, sports, memes), guaranteeing hyper-relevant, viral content that drives engagement and visibility. Passive Income Through Holder Rewards (1% Redistribution): Investors earn simply by holding, which fosters long-term loyalty and encourages them to hold rather than sell. NFT & Staking Ecosystem Integration: Floppy-themed NFTs and staking options improve the ecosystem by adding utility, gamification, and additional income streams. Whale Accumulation Hints At Possible Breakout For Pi Network (PI) While the Pi Network’s (PI) recent pump was short-lived, optimism is peaking, as CoinGecko indicates a whopping 88% of bullish votes from 3.9 million users. For the record, Pi Network (PI) has experienced a 19% decline in trading volume, accompanied by a 15% month-long price decrease. Despite the current slump, Pi Network (PI) has seen a major vote of confidence, with the top Pi wallet recently accumulating over 50 million PI tokens. This significant whale activity signals strong trust and renewed optimism for Pi Network’s (PI) long-term potential. Now trading in a week-to-date range of $0.5741 to $0.6699, investors are closely watching Pi Network (PI), especially as Bitcoin (BTC) is turning the tide positively. Movement (MOVE) Price Volatility Demands Caution Since Movement Labs launched its beta mainnet and the Movement (MOVE) token in December 2024, which reached an all-time high (ATH) of $1.45, speculation has been brewing about its possible comeback. This speculation is driven by Movement’s (MOVE) inventive MoveVM technology and its ability to deliver high-speed transactions as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Despite ongoing losses, Movement’s (MOVE) DeFi Spring initiative —supported by a 250 million Movement (MOVE) token incentive—is setting the stage for a potential bullish reversal. Moreso, as Bitcoin (BTC) slowly gains, Movement (MOVE) could benefit from this positivity. Make The Smart Move Now! Stocking up on the FloppyPepe (FPPE) token while Bitcoin (BTC) is slowly pacing up could be the best crypto move this year. Although Pi Network (PI) and Movement (MOVE) also show potential, this new altcoin holds more intrinsic value. Aside from its inherent potential for widespread adoption and growth due to its 1% burn rate deflationary tokenomics and wildlife conservation efforts, which appeal to socially conscious investors, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is currently offering an 80% discount. So, hurry up and buy the token using the code FLOPPY80 !

This recent price action is particularly significant as it marks a clean breakout above a key on-chain resistance zone stretching from $93,000 to $95,000, which many analysts believe could determine whether Bitcoin’s next leg takes it into six-figure territory. Supporting this momentum is a long-term technical outlook by renowned trader Peter Brandt, who projected that Bitcoin remains on course to set new all-time highs, with a potential price peak exceeding $150,000 on his projected timeline. Peter Brandt Maps Timeline For $150,000 Bitcoin Top With Parabolic Structure Veteran trader Peter Brandt shared a weekly candlestick Bitcoin price chart on social media, highlighting a path toward $150,000 by late summer 2025. According to Brandt’s post on social media platform X, Bitcoin is currently trading below a parabolic trendline that is key to the final leg of the current bull cycle. Interestingly, this parabolic trendline has served as an upper resistance for Bitcoin’s price peaks and all-time highs since 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: The Last Leg-Up That Confirms A Resounding Rally To $150,000 Brandt’s chart captures a variety of classical technical formations, including multiple head and shoulders patterns, expanding triangles, and consolidation wedges. The breakout from the recent wedge pattern serves as his basis for suggesting that the bull market is structurally intact. According to his projection, the parabolic slope that Bitcoin needs to overcome currently sits around the $120,000 mark. A decisive breakout above this threshold would set the stage for a run-up to a cycle top. Brand noted that this cycle top would be between $125,000 and $150,000, and the timeline is by August or September 2025. On-Chain Indicators Reveal Pressure Points Around $93,000 To $95,000 On-chain data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shows that Bitcoin is currently testing the convergence of two critical resistance points: the 111-day simple moving average, which now sits at $91,300, and the short-term holder cost basis, which sits at $93,200. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Analyst Peter Brandt Says BTC Still Bearish Unless This Happens Notably, Bitcoin’s price structure has confirmed a higher high relative to a high of $94,000 in early May, effectively breaking the downtrend from early April. This suggests that the market may be shifting into a more aggressive accumulation phase. However, this region also represents a significant cluster of previously bought coins, meaning investors underwater during earlier pullbacks now find themselves near break-even. This could cause increased sell-side pressure if some traders take profit or exit at breakeven. Meanwhile, long-term holders continue to exhibit strong HOLDling behavior, with realized profits exceeding 350% for many. In fact, over 254,000 BTC have crossed the 155-day threshold since Bitcoin’s recent local bottom, indicating that a significant portion of the supply is maturing into long-term holdings. Many of these coins were acquired at prices above $95,000. Although current momentum clearly favours the bulls, the $93,000 to $95,000 range is a major battleground that could define Bitcoin’s trajectory in the months ahead of reaching Peter Brandt’s target of $150,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,635.

Lummis called for a pause on the offer as it raises ethical and legal complications. Trump is once again in the middle of controversy following his decision to host a dinner and tour for his top investors. On April 23, 2025, the organization behind the $TRUMP meme coin announced an exclusive dinner event at Trump’s National Golf Club. The top 220 holders of the $TRUMP meme coin were invited to have dinner with the President between April 23 and May 12. The top 25 holders of the coin would receive additional perks including a VIP reception and a special tour. The tour was originally tagged as a “White House Tour,” but that was later removed. Senator Cynthia Lummis urges moderation Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming is a pro-crypto legislator and a supporter of President Trump, and even she has expressed concerns about the ethical implications of the memecoin dinner offer. “This is my president that we’re talking about, but I am willing to say that this gives me pause,” she said . The memecoin dinner is even more controversial once the involvement of foreign entities in purchasing the $TRUMP coin is considered. The dinner could potentially violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits government officials from accepting payments or gifts from foreign entities without congressional approval. Lummis said Wednesday in an interview that she believes Congress needs to regulate standards around the use of digital assets like meme coins. She has stated that she’s open to working with her colleagues to create clear regulations around digital assets for elected officials, including the president. “This is the Wild West, and so when I hear things like this, my reaction is, we need to legislate so there are rules,” Lummis said. “Even what may appear to be ‘cringey’ with regard to meme coins, it’s legal, and what we need to do is have a regulatory framework that makes this more clear, so we don’t have this Wild West scenario,” she added. While a few Senate Republicans questioned the ethics around Trump’s dinner for his top investors, most of the party’s members, like Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota, stated that they were confident that the president would work within the boundaries of the law. Other GOP senators said they hadn’t heard about the president’s plan. The dinner invitation is controversial After the dinner announcement, the TRUMP memecoin experienced a surge in value and recorded an over 50% price increase and a $100 million value boost in related wallets. The $TRUMP meme coin’s total market cap increased to an impressive $2.7B. Despite the immediate benefits for Trump, the dinner invitation was met with criticism from various quarters. A number of lawmakers view the dinner as a potential conflict of interest and a messy fusion of politics with personal business. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, expressed her displeasure about the event, though she noted she didn’t have all of the details. “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” Murkowski told NBC News. The event is unpopular with other Senate Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, and Adam Schiff of California, who even requested an ethics investigation into the dinner. “This latest action raises grave ethics and legal concerns, including the severe risk that President Trump and other officials may be engaging in ‘pay to play’ corruption by selling presidential access to individuals or entities, to include foreign nationals and corporate actors with vested interests in federal action, while personally enriching the President and his family,” the senators wrote in their letter. Sen. Jon Ossoff, took the criticism further, mentioning impeaching Trump over the meme coin dinner. Sen. Cory Booker stated that the meme coin sale is a “violation of the Constitution.” “Before you can even get to the point of discussing impeachment,” he said, “can we even get the United States Congress to step forward in saying this is wrong and we should investigate?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

However, they have limited intent or expertise for any sophisticated obfuscation of their financial trails. One of the biggest reasons criminal groups have resorted to using crypto is that it enables rapid, borderless payments, allowing their networks to move funds globally without the delays or risk linked to traditional banking systems. Why criminal groups are really using crypto Mexican cartels are one of the criminal groups out there increasingly taking advantage of crypto’s advantages. They have been observed using crypto to pay Chinese suppliers for fentanyl precursors, capitalizing on low transaction fees and instant transfers. Every single action not deliberately obfuscated on the blockchain is transparent and verifiable. Source: Chainalysis Many of these criminals operate on the common belief that crypto facilitates untraceable financial anonymity. It is actually a misconception, as every single action, not deliberately obfuscated, that happens on the blockchain is available to anyone with the know-how to see. Ironically, that misconception has been driving adoption, particularly among groups like cartels and wildlife traffickers who often reportedly use it without advanced privacy tools. The fact that so many of these bad actors have been using crypto in recent times proves that they are using it more because it is unrestricted by borders and simplifies financial operations for illicit activities, rather than because they think it grants anonymity. According to the report , this is why organized crime that capitalizes on crypto is often not sophisticated. Compared to state-backed cyber criminals like North Korean hackers who utilize advanced obfuscation methods like mixers or privacy coins e.g Monero, traditional organized crime groups just go about their business without covering their tracks. These criminals would often use regulated exchanges for cash-outs, an act that exposes their funds to KYC-compliant platforms. Good examples are cartel-linked launderers who move fentanyl proceeds through CEX accounts, leaving clear on-chain trails. It has also been observed that most groups stick to widely available cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or stablecoins, choosing to avoid privacy coins because of how complex they make things or limited liquidity. The major focus is always on scaling operations rather than evading detection because crypto’s borderless nature allows them to reach their global customer bases. It is actually good news for law enforcement The brazen use of crypto by organized crime groups for nefarious purposes, because they don’t try hard to hide, creates various opportunities for law enforcement. As earlier stated, virtually every action that happens on the blockchain can be traced because it acts like an immutable ledger. This means that investigators can trace transactions in real-time and map the criminal networks across borders, something that would have been almost impossible to do with traditional banking. The fact that criminals also rely on CEXs, which comply with KYC/AML regulations, can also help authorities identify and freeze assets as well as gather off-chain intelligence. A good example of this was when the Ledger co-founder was kidnapped and investigators were able to trace nearly all ransom funds and seize them. Unfortunately, while the blockchain offers avenues to track transactions, law enforcement faces challenges because of their limited blockchain expertise, as crypto is yet to go mainstream. While training can help more officers identify case overlaps, broader adoption is needed to properly capitalize on the transparency crypto offers. Mastering blockchain analysis will also encourage and aid proactive tracking, which will allow law enforcement to disrupt criminal networks before their crimes escalate. It is crucial this happens fast because criminals may eventually start employing more sophisticated techniques before crackdown efforts become coordinated enough.

The anticipated approval of spot Litecoin ETFs in the United States has sparked a sharp uptick in demand by institutional investors. The rise of Bitcoin (BTC) price above $95.5k in the past two days, has sparked a surge in altcoin speculation, led by Litecoin (LTC). The demand for risky crypto assets has helped LTC price signal bullish sentiment, in the near future, especially after consolidating in the past few years. According to the latest market data, LTC price surged over 14 percent in the last two weeks to trade about $87.38 on Friday, during the late North American session. Midterm Expectations for LTC Price In the weekly timeframe, LTC price has respected a rising logarithmic trend established in the past six years. Following the recent rebound, LTC price is well positioned to retest its all-time high above $359 in the near term. For leveraged crypto traders, placing a stop loss slightly below $62 and a midterm target of about $359 will present a loss-to-win ratio of 0.42 to 2.9. The midterm bullish sentiment for LTC price is bolstered by the fact that the altcoin has formed higher high and higher low since late 2022 to date. Fundamental Outlook for Litecoin Network The Litecoin network has experienced significant growth in the past few years, catalyzed by the rising demand from institutional investors. Several fund managers – led by CoinShares, Grayscale, and Canary Capital – are seeking to offer spot LTC ETFs in the United States, in the near future. As a result, the volume of larger transactions than $100k on the Litecoin network surged by $52.33 billion in the past seven days.

The research noted that there could be an 8.3x increase from the current stablecoin market cap of $234 billion in April 2025 to about $2 trillion by 2028. “Evolving market dynamics have the potential to accelerate stablecoins’ trajectory to reach $2 trillion in market cap by 2028.” Big Predictions for Future Growth This projection assumes the passage of the GENIUS Act in the US, which would establish clear regulatory guidelines and drive market confidence and adoption. The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) defines “payment stablecoins” as digital assets redeemable at a fixed value, pegged to fiat, but non-yield-bearing. It also sets out reserve rules for stablecoin issuers. In early April 2, the US House Financial Services Committee passed the STABLE Act , which gives the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) the authority to approve and supervise “federally qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers.” Stablecoin reserve requirements could also drive large demand for short-dated U.S. Treasuries, it stated. Projections suggest stablecoin issuers could hold around $1 trillion in T-bills by 2028 if growth hits expectations. The Treasury also predicted that stablecoin transactions could rise from around $700 billion per month today to around $6 trillion per month by 2028, which is roughly 10% of global forex spot transactions. If regulatory clarity is achieved, stablecoins could become a mainstream financial instrument not just for crypto users, but for traditional finance, corporate treasury, and even sovereign liquidity management. Potential drivers of stablecoin growth. Source: US Treasury Dept For users in emerging markets, stablecoins provide direct access to US dollars without needing a US bank account, strengthening the currency’s global role, the report noted. Stablecoin Ecosystem Outlook The current stablecoin market capitalization is $244.5 billion, which represents around 8% of the total crypto market cap, which is just over $3 trillion, according to Coingecko. The lion’s share of the stablecoin market is currently dominated by Tether, which has a 61% share with $149 billion USDT in circulation. Circle is second with $61 billion in USDC circulation, giving it a 25% market share, and decentralized USDS (formerly DAI) is third with 3% of the stablecoin market. PayPal has seen significant growth for its PYUSD stablecoin this year. However, it has less than 0.36% market share.

With prices of Bitcoin still on the rise, the firm continues to make strategic buys of the digital currency. According to reports, Strategy has changed its business tactics in the last five years. What began as a business intelligence activity is now most famously associated with enormous Bitcoin holdings. The latest performance of the company indicates this strategy continues to work in 2025. $MSTR announces BTC Yield of 13.7% and BTC $ Gain of $5.8B year-to-date, doubles capital plan to $42B equity and $42B fixed income to purchase bitcoin, and increases BTC Yield target from 15% to 25% and BTC $ Gain target from $10B to $15B for 2025. https://t.co/LgeMEd6Dr5 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 1, 2025 Investment Plan Doubles To $84 Billion Strategy said that it will now invest $84 billion in purchasing additional Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg. The company’s move is to invest half the funds ($42 billion) in fixed income and the remaining half ($42 billion) in fixed equity. This significant capital outlay indicates Strategy still has faith in the long-term worth of Bitcoin. The company considers Bitcoin a key component to its business model and a fundamental asset for its treasury holdings. The scale of this investment is a staggering increase on past expenditure. If implemented, it would leave Strategy an even more prominent corporate owner of Bitcoin than it is currently. Performance Targets Leap From 15% To 25% Strategy has increased its Bitcoin performance targets for the next year. The firm has been targeting a 15% return on its Bitcoin holdings but now anticipates 25%. Concurrently, the company raised its target for dollar gains from Bitcoin in 2025. The objective rose from $10 billion to $15 billion, implying Strategy anticipates the price and value of Bitcoin to appreciate considerably during the course of the year. Stock Price Surges More Than 3,000% Since 2020 Strategy’s stock price has risen dramatically since the company initially acquired Bitcoin five years ago.

Coinbase didn’t articulate a specific reason for the delisting , but the decision materialized a few weeks after Movement became embroiled in a controversy on another top crypto exchange. In late March, Binance banned and froze the assets of a market maker that operated for Movement. The layer-2 project’s native token launched via Binance’s Airdrops Portal in December, but Binance said that after MOVE was listed, the unnamed market maker sold approximately 66 million MOVE tokens on December 10th, with few buy orders. The market maker ended up netting a profit of $38 million worth of the stablecoin USDT before being offboarded last week. Movement uses Move, a programming language originally built by a consortium backed by tech giant Meta for the now-defunct Diem project. The language was then used to develop layer-1 blockchains Sui ( SUI ) and Aptos ( APT ). The MOVE token hit an all-time low of $0.185 at one point on Thursday. The 160th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $0.189 at time of writing and is down more than 23% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum (ETH) shows early signs of recovery after recent selling pressure, while XRP appears to be moving in line with broader Bitcoin trends. With several altcoins holding higher support levels, the market looks ready for fresh rallies in the coming weeks. As legacy assets like ETH and XRP attract renewed interest, early-stage projects with real innovation are also gaining traction. BlockDAG (BDAG) , in particular, is emerging as a top contender. Backed by a powerful tech stack and strong community support, BlockDAG has now raised over $224 million in its ongoing presale. Its unique architecture and consistent momentum are positioning it as one of the most promising breakout cryptos in today’s market. Ethereum (ETH) Targets $3500 as Bulls Regain Ground Ethereum (ETH) is facing tough resistance, but buyers are stepping back in after a period of selling pressure. While short-term volatility remains, analysts still expect a move toward $3500 if Ethereum can hold above key moving averages. The recent dip came from market-wide uncertainty and profit-taking following earlier gains. Now, technical signs are starting to shift. Momentum is showing signs of stabilizing, and buyers are gradually returning. Ethereum’s strong position in DeFi and NFTs continues to build long-term trust. As breakout trends develop, Ethereum’s path to $3500 could act as a major signal of strength across the altcoin market. XRP Prepares for 8% Upswing XRP is showing signs of a potential 8% move upward, closely tracking Bitcoin’s recent recovery trend. Analysts note that XRP often mirrors Bitcoin during bounce-back periods, and current charts suggest that history could repeat itself. Support levels have stayed firm, and rising trading volumes hint at growing bullish momentum. While long-term concerns around XRP’s legal status remain in play, short-term traders are focusing on technical signals. If Bitcoin continues its upward path, XRP could follow with a similar lift. For buyers looking for quick breakout plays, XRP is shaping up to be a strong candidate with calculated upside potential. BlockDAG Is Not Just Rising: It’s Leading the Future of Crypto BlockDAG is quickly becoming a standout project in the crypto space, offering real solutions to long-standing scalability problems. Unlike traditional blockchains that validate transactions one at a time, BlockDAG uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to process many transactions in parallel. This results in faster speeds and higher capacity, without compromising on decentralization. As more industries look for scalable solutions in payments, gaming, and DeFi, BlockDAG’s setup is proving to be well-timed and highly relevant. Its ongoing presale success is adding serious weight to its momentum. BlockDAG has now raised over $224 million in Batch 28, with the BDAG coin priced at just $0.0262. However, BDAG is offering a special price of $0.0019 till May 13th and is gaining viral traction. Since the start of batch 1, BDAG has seen a massive 2520% surge, and over 19.5 billion coins have already been sold. Adding to the buzz, miner sales have crossed $6.9 million, with 17,232 miners sold. Strategic tools like the “Buyer Battles” feature are also helping BlockDAG grow a strong and competitive early community. Looking ahead, BlockDAG isn’t just relying on a strong presale. The team has ambitious post-launch plans, including listings on 10 major centralized exchanges after the mainnet launches in 2025. A partnership with HackerEarth aims to bring in over 10,000 developers, expanding the ecosystem with fresh ideas and real-world use cases. By focusing on real scalability, rewarding early users, and growing a developer-friendly environment, BlockDAG is positioning itself as more than just a trending crypto. It’s building the foundation needed to power the next wave of blockchain adoption. For those seeking early access to a project with clear utility and strong momentum, BlockDAG is becoming top crypto presale that’s hard to ignore. Final Thoughts Ethereum (ETH) remains on track for a potential push toward $3500, with market bulls slowly regaining control after recent sideways movement. XRP is also showing promise, with analysts projecting an 8% rebound closely linked to Bitcoin’s momentum across the altcoin space. Meanwhile, BlockDAG continues to stand out. With its powerful scalability model and an impressive $224 million raised in presale, it is emerging as a serious contender in the breakout crypto space. As more buyers look beyond legacy coins for high-upside opportunities, BlockDAG’s growth story becomes harder to ignore. Its strong fundamentals and surging community interest suggest it may not just be the next big crypto, it could be the one to lead the next market cycle.

It is about how that asset performs. As buyers hunt for projects with real utility, XRP and Pepe coin both grab headlines through ETF advances and community-driven momentum. XRP builds strength with institutional backing and legal wins, while Pepe coin thrives on meme culture and viral support. Yet Unstaked’s $UNSD offers something different and tangible. Through its presale, it brings AI agents that act on behalf of users in real-time, delivering measurable on-chain results. If you are searching for the best crypto for 2025, Unstaked ’s functional, working utility makes it hard to ignore. XRP Price Prediction: ETF Tailwinds Offer Hope XRP’s recent fall to $2.07 reflects broader market stress, yet a 15% weekly gain keeps optimism alive. A wave of exchange inflows, topping 55 million XRP, signals mounting sell pressure, leading to more than $5.1 million in liquidations within a day. Even with this pressure, XRP’s deep liquidity remains a key strength, especially as U.S. spot crypto ETF conversations heat up. Teucrium’s new leveraged XRP ETF and Grayscale’s pending application, facing a May 22 SEC decision, add excitement to XRP’s outlook. A pending settlement with the SEC could speed up ETF approvals. Technically, XRP is holding above $2.00 with backup support at $1.95 and $1.64. Resistance levels sit at $2.24 and $2.38. While short-term dips remain possible, ETF momentum and legal clarity keep the XRP price prediction positive for 2025. Inside Pepe Coin’s Growing Ecosystem Pepe coin is building more than just a meme-driven hype machine. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, it uses a deflationary model that cuts supply with every transaction, creating more scarcity. A rewards system returns transaction fees to holders, making long-term ownership more appealing. Plus, it does all this without applying extra transaction taxes, keeping it simple to use. What really drives Pepe coin’s success is its strong tie to internet culture. Rooted in the famous Pepe the Frog meme, the project built a lively community across X, Telegram, and Reddit. Projects like the Pepe Academy and merchandise lines also boost community loyalty. On the technical side, its Ethereum base gives it easy access to apps, wallets, and DeFi tools. Together, the Pepe coin ecosystem shows how culture and blockchain can blend to create something unique in the digital space. $UNSD Presale Sparks Rush: Unlock Monetized AI Ownership Now Unstaked is changing what digital ownership means. With $UNSD now available in presale stage 2 for just $0.006695, early buyers are not just getting a token. They are unlocking the chance to deploy real AI agents across X and Telegram. These are not basic bots. Each AI agent works on its own, posting, engaging users, adapting in real time, and building communities 24/7 while linking all its work directly to the owner on-chain. The massive potential on offer with the network has been on display with the presale seeing more than a million in inflows in just a matter of days. More than that, these AI agents are built to earn. Owners collect $UNSD rewards based on their agent’s actual performance, thanks to the on-chain “Proof of Intelligence” system. As agents get better, their owners can earn even more. With no middlemen and full transparency, $UNSD holders are part of a growing ecosystem focused on results, not promises. At launch, $UNSD is set to reach around $0.1819, meaning the current presale price could deliver major returns. Unlike many early-stage projects that promise future plans, Unstaked gives buyers working AI agents, instant rewards, and community governance from the start. This unique blend of utility, rewards based on output, and full AI ownership puts $UNSD on the map as a top choice among the best cryptos for 2025. For traders ready to move beyond hype and into real earning systems, Unstaked offers a rare early entry into an AI-driven digital economy where users control the future. Real Utility Is the New Standard Speculation can catch attention, but real, lasting value comes from true utility and empowering users. XRP’s legal wins and ETF hopes open new doors for institutions, while Pepe Coin rides strong on meme energy and a loyal online community. Still, Unstaked stands apart by giving users active control. Instead of waiting for charts to move, $UNSD holders deploy AI agents that create on-chain value from day one. As traders hunt for the best crypto for 2025 , the ability to own and operate real digital assets may become the real difference. In the next wave, the projects that offer action over waiting will lead, and Unstaked is already delivering the tools to make that happen.

New York’s Governor and state lawmakers say they’ve agreed on a budget framework that includes $2 billion for inflation refund checks to over eight million taxpayers. The plan targets New Yorkers who filed taxes, are not claimed as dependents and earn below $150,000 annually. Eligible joint filers earning up to $150,000 will receive $400, while those earning between $150,000 and $300,000 will get $300. Single filers and heads of household earning up to $75,000 will receive $200, and those earning between $75,000 and $150,000 will get $150. No application is needed and checks will be issued automatically using recent tax filings once the budget is passed and signed into law in about a week from today. New York’s Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul says the rebates as a response to inflation-driven costs, reports News10 ABC. “I can’t stop inflation, but everyone across the state paid more because inflation drove up prices.” But the program has its critics. Democratic Assemblymember Phil Steck says such programs are gimmicks, arguing for long-term tax relief or other spending priorities.

During its current Phase 4 investors can purchase tokens for $0.025 while they stand to gain 140% when the price reaches $0.06 at listing. Upcoming phase 5 brings forward the pre-set price increase to $0.03 which requires immediate attention from potential gain seekers. This structured lending and buyback system installed within the DeFi project positions it for admission into the top-20 crypto market rankings during 2025 while setting itself apart from meme-driven tokens. The project shows strong evidence it might accomplish better performance than Shiba Inu along with Stellar. Here’s why. Robust Lending Framework Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes its market position through a combined lending operation. Lenders get added protection through borrowers who place collateral assets that surpass the value of their loans. Pool depositors who back liquidity receive annual percentage yield of up to 10% through their contributions. The platform generates interest-bearing mtTokens including mtETH for ETH participants in its system. This system fosters stability, unlike volatile meme coins. Team members have submitted smart contracts to CertiK for audit review which they intend to publicly announce through social media. This transparency bolsters trust. The declining availability of Phase 4 tokens creates an attractive environment for investors to seek reliable opportunities at Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Strategic Buyback Mechanism Many investors choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of its buy-and-distribute system which draws them in. Fees from the platform buy regular MUTM tokens which are then distributed among holders of mtTokens. The constant purchasing pressure from investors prevents mass selling and helps the price keep growing. During Phase 4 when buyers purchase MUTM for $0.025 they will receive a 20% gain once Phase 5 arrives at $0.03 while achieving a 140% ROI at the $0.06 listing price. According to industry analysis Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reach $3 after its launch creating an 11.900% profit potential. The MUTM platform launched its top 50 holder dashboard to give bonus tokens as appreciation for their ranking positions. Official loyalty programs help strengthen the project because loyal users enjoy additional rewards that drive its overall upward pattern. Community-Driven Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fuels intense interest by distributing $100,000 in which ten investors obtain $10,000 worth of tokens each. Participation levels rise through referral programs that give additional rewards to recruits. Users who join early staking pools and governance structures develop enhanced involvement levels because of their privileged access. The rapid sell-out in Phase 4 underscores the intense market demand for the project as over 430 million tokens have found buyers. The upcoming stablecoin from the project uses collateralization means to deliver dependable service based on the Ethereum network. The initiatives at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) develop a dynamic user base that eclipses generic utility-less tokens thereby positioning the platform for rapid expansion. Surging Toward the Top Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will supplant both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Stellar (XLM) as its ascends into the top 20 rankings. The combination between a lending model and community incentives and a buyback strategy makes this offering formidable. The $3 price prediction for 2025 underscores its potential. The near conclusion of Phase 4 token sale has opened a short period in which investors must purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025. The project’s emphasis on stability and utility provides strong reasons for becoming a superior alternative compared to speculative coin investments. People looking for high-return decentralized finance opportunities must take notice of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Review its current services because this rising investment opportunity needs your commitment.

Whether it’s AI-powered innovation, new exchange-traded products, or growing on-chain utility, here is a breakdown of the top crypto to buy in 2025 based on the latest updates from April. 1. Unstaked’s Presale Picks Up Speed with Strong Demand Unstaked is making a name for itself as one of the top crypto to buy in 2025, especially for those watching real-world tech and long-term returns. The platform is designed for users to deploy AI agents post-launch that will help manage communities, post content, and engage across platforms like Telegram, Discord, and X. These agents will function within Unstaked’s Proof of Intelligence system, which verifies and rewards helpful activity transparently. Currently, the presale is in Stage 2 at a price of $0.006695, with a projected listing price of $0.1819. This creates an estimated return of more than 2700% for early participants. The project has already raised over $1 million in less than a week, with strong public interest and no allocations to venture capital. Unstaked’s roadmap includes future features like NFT-based upgrades and cross-platform integrations continuing into 2026. With a low barrier to entry and no coding needed to use its AI tools, it appeals to a wide range of users. For those who want a presale with active development and growing attention, Unstaked is a standout pick in the top crypto to buy in 2025. 2. XRP Gains Ground as ETFs and Futures Hit the Market XRP is making strong moves in 2025, supported by a major wave of institutional interest. Three XRP futures ETFs from ProShares are set to go live on April 30, with CME Group launching XRP futures contracts just weeks later in May. These updates are increasing access to XRP through regulated investment vehicles, which could push demand higher. XRP is trading near $2.23 and showing strong market activity, with resistance zones at $2.74 and $3.00. Inflows have increased, with over $37 million added to XRP-focused funds. As legal clarity around the asset improves, more firms are starting to engage with XRP, and its partnership with Ripple is still central to cross-border payment development. Mid-range predictions suggest a price of $5 is within reach if momentum continues. For investors interested in the top crypto to buy in 2025, especially those tracking ETFs and futures growth, XRP remains a reliable option backed by strong developments. 3. Dogecoin Builds Toward Its Next Big Move Dogecoin continues to regain strength even as Elon Musk reduces his public commentary. Although the price dipped slightly, DOGE has still gained 6.66% over the last month and is now trading near $0.179 with a market cap close to $25.6 billion. The Fear and Greed Index is holding at 65 (Greed), which shows strong market sentiment. Adding to the excitement are new “Doge dividend” incentives introduced for Tesla shareholders and early Dogecoin users. Short-term price expectations suggest DOGE could rise to $0.195 soon, with May targets between $0.22 and $0.25. For the long term, estimates suggest the coin might reach $10 by 2032 if consistent growth continues. Dogecoin stands out as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025 for those who believe in the ongoing power of online communities, upcoming payment use cases, and growing speculation around ETF potential. 4. Cardano Grows With Focus on Digital Identity Cardano is increasing its focus on practical use cases, especially through the release of Veridian, a new platform for blockchain-based digital identity. ADA is trading at about $0.694 and has seen a 6.14% gain in the past month. Its current market cap is around $25 billion. Cardano also got a policy boost after the U.S. government named it as one of the assets in a planned national crypto reserve, alongside BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP. Near-term projections expect ADA to test $0.756, with stable support seen between $0.662 and $0.838. Over a longer horizon, forecasts point to a possible rise toward $10.29 by 2031. For investors who want the top crypto to buy in 2025 based on network progress and increased adoption, Cardano is holding its place as a strong option. With expanding governance systems and ecosystem growth, ADA looks prepared for solid performance in the coming year. Final Thoughts The race to find the top crypto to buy in 2025 is picking up speed as fresh news, partnerships, and upgrades fuel movement across the market. New entrants like Unstaked offer early-stage access to advanced AI use cases, while established players such as XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano continue to push forward with major updates and broader relevance in global markets. To choose the top crypto to buy in 2025 , it helps to look beyond hype and focus on projects delivering on their goals. Whether your focus is on AI tools coming to life with Unstaked after launch or the steady progress of tokens like XRP, DOGE, and ADA, the right strategy now could shape your returns for the entire year. Watching trends and acting with purpose could make all the difference in this market cycle.

Large ETH holders have increased their positions, reversing a long-term downtrend in wallet concentration. On-chain data suggests growing investor confidence despite subdued trading volumes and ongoing market caution. Ethereum (ETH) continues to flow out of centralized exchanges at a significant rate. Over the past seven days alone, net outflows surpassed $380 million, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. This reduction in exchange-held ETH reflects growing investor accumulation into self-custody and could point to a tightening supply narrative that has historically preceded price rallies. ETH Accumulation Persists Despite Price Volatility Data shows Ethereum’s net flows from exchanges were consistently negative between April 24 and May 1, with a particularly large outflow recorded on April 26. This behavior suggests that investors took advantage of short-term price dips to buy and withdraw ETH into self-custody. Despite price fluctuations during the week, ETH ended the period on a positive note, climbing back above $1,840.

The current price action signals a potential shift, with volatility compressing and momentum building for a major move in either direction. After months of selling pressure and weak performance relative to Bitcoin, analysts now believe ETH is approaching a critical inflection point. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy 100 Million DOGE In 24 Hours – Demand Signals Growing Confidence Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a key technical observation, highlighting the formation of a long-legged Doji candle on Ethereum’s monthly timeframe. This type of candle typically reflects intense market indecision, where both bulls and bears tested the extremes, but neither side gained clear control by the close. It’s often seen near major turning points, especially after prolonged downtrends or consolidations. If Ethereum can reclaim the $2,000 level in the coming sessions, it would confirm bullish intent and open the door to a stronger rally. On the other hand, failure to hold above $1,750 could trigger renewed downside pressure, possibly retesting deeper support zones. For now, ETH remains trapped in a tight range, but the technical setup and market structure suggest that a decisive breakout could soon define Ethereum’s path for the weeks ahead. Ethereum Key Resistance Levels Limit Upside Ethereum has been trading below the $2,000 level since late March, and this prolonged consolidation signals a market still searching for direction. Despite bouncing from local lows, ETH remains over 55% down from its December highs, reflecting the broader weakness in the altcoin market. Bulls have managed to hold the $1,800 level, but a sustained breakout above supply-heavy zones like $2,000–$2,100 is required to confirm any meaningful reversal. In the short term, Ethereum has started to build a more bullish structure, with higher lows forming across intraday charts. This suggests that bulls are gradually reclaiming control, though the pressure from sellers remains strong. Volume continues to thin out during upward moves, and without a decisive breakout, price may continue to chop sideways or revisit lower support zones near $1,700 or $1,550. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with analysts closely watching technical signals for confirmation. Pillows pointed out that ETH recently formed a long-legged Doji candle on the monthly chart—a rare formation that often signals market indecision or the beginning of a trend reversal. If this candle marks a turning point, Ethereum may be preparing for a breakout. However, until bulls reclaim key resistance, the risk of a move into lower demand zones remains very real. Related Reading: HYPE Confirms Strength With Solid Throwback Response – Bullish Reversal? ETH Price Consolidates as Bulls Eye Breakout Ethereum is currently trading at $1,830, holding firm after several days of tight consolidation between $1,750 and $1,850. This narrow range has defined recent price action, as bulls and bears remain locked in a standoff near key resistance. For bulls to maintain control and confirm a reversal structure, a decisive breakout above the $1,850 level is critical. Reclaiming the $2,000 zone would likely spark renewed buying momentum and shift short-term sentiment in favor of the upside. However, the longer ETH stays capped below resistance, the greater the risk of a breakdown. If bulls fail to push above the $1,850 level soon, selling pressure may intensify. A loss of support at $1,750 could open the door for a move back toward the $1,700 zone. Further weakness from there could drag ETH down to retest the $1,500 level, where demand previously stepped in. Related Reading: Solana Monthly Candle Reclaims Key Levels – Is $240 The Next Target? With macroeconomic uncertainty still weighing on markets and Ethereum underperforming relative to Bitcoin, traders are watching closely for a decisive move. Until then, ETH remains trapped in a tight range where momentum is building, and a breakout or breakdown is likely just around the corner.

First, SEI finds itself at the center of legal battles tied to its troubled acquisition of Solaris Energy. Meanwhile, the MANA price rally is drawing attention after Decentraland’s token surged to its highest level in two months, prompting fresh interest from traders. However, the biggest story continues to be BlockDAG (BDAG) , which has demonstrated incredible growth during its presale. Moving from $0.001 to $0.0262 per coin, it has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts. The project’s presale success has been nothing short of remarkable, and with over $224 million raised and 19.5 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s momentum is gaining speed. With over 10 exchange listings on the horizon, some analysts predict that the next big move for BlockDAG could be a jump to $1. Its rapidly growing community and the upcoming exchange listings have many calling it the best crypto to watch in 2025. SEI Faces Legal Pressure Over Solaris Energy Deal In an unexpected twist for SEI, a class action lawsuit has been filed against the company, alleging it misled investors about the potential of its recent acquisition, Solaris Energy. The acquisition involved Mobile Energy Rentals LLC, a company that allegedly failed to establish a solid foundation in the energy leasing sector. To make matters worse, one of MER’s co-owners has a history of fraud, casting a shadow over the acquisition. The lawsuit claims that SEI overestimated the value of MER’s mobile turbine rental business and that the financial reporting was flawed. Investors who purchased SEI securities between July 9, 2024, and March 17, 2025, may be eligible to join the class action. Rosen Law Firm, which is handling the case, is encouraging affected parties to act quickly and consider taking on lead plaintiff roles, with a deadline of May 27, 2025. This unfolding situation could have significant consequences for the company’s future and could continue to shape investor sentiment as the case progresses. MANA Price Rally: Decentraland Hits Two-Month High Decentraland’s MANA token has been gaining serious momentum, jumping by over 10% in just one day. This surge pushed the token to a two-month high of $0.31, prompting many analysts to look closely at the token’s performance. The price spike comes at a time when the Metaverse is back on the radar for many crypto enthusiasts, and MANA is one of the standout players. On-balance volume indicators are also suggesting that the price hike has strong backing, as demand for the token continues to climb. The technical outlook is promising, with MANA consistently trading above its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), signaling short-term bullish momentum. A solid trendline of support is also in place, meaning buying pressure remains strong. If this pattern holds, there’s potential for MANA to push further toward $0.44, although analysts caution that downside risks could send the price down to around $0.19 if the trend falters. BlockDAG’s $224M Presale Success – Aiming for $1 Post-Listing BlockDAG’s presale success has been remarkable, drawing significant attention in the crypto space. Initially priced at $0.001, the coin has surged to $0.0262 in Batch 27, marking an incredible 2,380% increase. Over $224 million has been raised to date, and more than 19.5 billion coins have been sold. BlockDAG offers coins at $0.0019 for a limited time , further fueling demand and creating a sense of urgency among buyers. The pace of sales has quickened with each batch, reflecting increasing interest in the project. As BlockDAG prepares for its upcoming exchange listings, analysts believe these could act as a springboard for a price jump, potentially reaching $1. Plans are already in motion for BlockDAG to be listed on over 10 centralized exchanges, which will likely lead to higher visibility, increased trading volumes, and broader market access. Analysts following the project are confident that these listings could trigger another surge in price, given the project’s already impressive track record. BlockDAG’s growing community is another key factor driving its success. With over $6.9 million in miner sales and 17,232 crypto miners sold, the project has built strong engagement from its user base. This solid foundation positions BlockDAG as a crypto project to watch closely, with the potential for substantial growth once it launches on exchanges. The Takeaway: BlockDAG Takes Center Stage As the legal drama surrounding SEI unfolds, and the MANA rally continues to capture the spotlight, BlockDAG is emerging as one of the most exciting crypto prospects. With a remarkable 2,380% surge in presale price and over $224 million raised, BlockDAG is gearing up for what could be a game-changing entry into the crypto market. The project’s listing on centralized exchanges is fast approaching, and many analysts believe this could be the catalyst for the next big price jump, potentially reaching $1. The clock is ticking for anyone looking to get in at the current price of $0.0019, as the opportunity to buy at these levels may not last much longer. BlockDAG has quickly positioned itself as one of the top crypto projects to watch for 2025 and beyond.

But now, their momentum has stalled, with prices trapped in tight ranges and investors questioning their long-term utility. Beneath the noise, a new contender is emerging: RCO Finance (RCOF) . Armed with $7.5M in venture capital and over 285,000 users, RCOF aims to disrupt the status quo. Rather than leaning on hype or slow upgrades, RCOF is tapping into AI-driven finance tool, something ADA and SOL haven’t quite managed. Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL): What Went Wrong? Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) were once hailed as Ethereum killers, promising scalability, speed, and institutional adoption. But the moments of massive gains driven by community hype and big promises are long gone. Now, ADA and SOL face moments of setbacks. Even with the Vasil upgrade on Cardano , ADA’s price hovers between $0.5 and $0.7 , far from its $3 peak. Solana also continues to deal with repeated network outages and speculative meme-driven spikes. Even with their strong communities, both platforms have hit a wall in their growth. The real issue for ADA and SOL is that they rely heavily on hype and incremental updates. Investors nowadays look for platforms that deliver tangible benefits; tools that can help them navigate market volatility, not just speculative potential. Now they’re eyeing projects like RCO Finance, which offer practical, real-world solutions. Why VCs Are Betting Big on RCO Finance The $7.5M VC investment in RCO Finance signals a shift in crypto’s evolution. Institutions aren’t just chasing hype, they’re backing real innovation.

Big names like Chainlink have experienced their peaks, leaving many to wonder if the window for significant returns has already closed. Yet, a new player is on the scene, with a promise that could redefine how the crypto market operates: Qubetics ($TICS). As the world continues to search for the next big opportunity, Qubetics is flying under the radar, quietly positioning itself to outperform the likes of Chainlink, Solana, and other previous crypto giants. Those who missed Chainlink’s peak should be paying attention right now—Qubetics might be the next big opportunity. Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a comprehensive blockchain ecosystem offering tools that many earlier projects failed to deliver. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network was revolutionary, but its scalability and real-world applicability didn’t quite meet the expectations of every market segment. Fast forward to 2025, and Qubetics is changing the game. With its presale in full swing and token prices still at a manageable $0.2093, those entering now could see returns that surpass anything seen before. Its suite of solutions, including QubeQode and Qubetics IDE, promises to solve real-world problems and drive massive adoption. Chainlink: The Missed Opportunity of a Lifetime Chainlink’s rise was nothing short of meteoric. It became one of the most popular crypto assets, with a unique proposition—decentralized oracles bridging blockchain networks with real-world data. While this was groundbreaking, it faced challenges in scaling and widespread adoption. Many believed that Chainlink would revolutionize the financial industry, yet its actual impact fell short of expectations in certain sectors. For those who hopped on the Chainlink train too late, the high returns have become a thing of the past. Once the market priced in Chainlink’s utility, it became clear that the opportunity to reap the greatest rewards had passed. If you didn’t get in during the early stages, waiting for another shot at big returns seemed futile. But now, with Qubetics entering the scene, those who missed out on Chainlink’s peak have another shot at a massive win. Qubetics: The New Star in the Crypto Sky Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a revolution in the making. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics focuses on providing solutions that cater to a wide range of real-world problems, something that other projects couldn’t fully address. Whether you’re a developer, business owner, or someone who simply believes in the future of decentralized technologies, Qubetics has something for everyone. Right now, Qubetics is in its 32nd presale stage, with over 510 million tokens already sold. The presale has raised over $16.6 million, and with over 25,600 holders, the demand is skyrocketing. At $0.2093 per token, the opportunity is still affordable, but time is running out. Analysts predict that $TICS will reach $1, offering a 377% ROI, $5, offering a 2288% ROI, and could even hit $15 after the mainnet launch, resulting in a staggering 7066% ROI. Qubetics Application: Solving Real-World Problems Qubetics isn’t just another crypto token; it’s a tool for revolutionizing industries. One of its standout features is the Qubetics application, which is set to change how businesses, professionals, and everyday individuals interact with blockchain technology. Imagine a developer building decentralized applications (dApps) who needs seamless blockchain interaction but is hindered by the complexity of other platforms. Enter Qubetics. With the Qubetics IDE and QubeQode, developers can quickly code, test, and deploy decentralized applications with ease. The Qubetics ecosystem takes care of the underlying complexity, allowing developers to focus on what matters most: innovation. But it’s not just for developers. Businesses can harness Qubetics to integrate blockchain solutions into their operations. Whether it’s through secure transactions, smart contracts, or tokenization, the possibilities are vast. For professionals, Qubetics provides a level of blockchain accessibility that other solutions simply don’t offer. It’s not about understanding the inner workings of blockchain; it’s about utilizing it to streamline your operations. The Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity The Qubetics crypto presale is currently in its 32nd stage, and the clock is ticking. With over 510 million $TICS tokens already sold and over $16.6 million raised, Qubetics is on track for rapid growth. Analysts predict that the price of $TICS could soar to $1 after the presale, offering a 377% ROI, or even reach $5 with a 2288% ROI. Once the mainnet launches, analysts predict a potential price of $15, giving those who buy in early a jaw-dropping 7066% ROI. The presale offers an incredible chance to get in on the ground floor. Token prices are still low, and with analysts projecting massive growth, this could be the last chance to secure tokens before prices skyrocket. It’s not every day that such a unique opportunity comes around. Qubetics and Blockchain Accessibility for All One of Qubetics’ key selling points is its commitment to making blockchain technology accessible to everyone. Blockchain has traditionally been seen as a complex and inaccessible space, reserved for tech-savvy developers or those with deep pockets. Qubetics is changing that. With its user-friendly tools and real-world applications, anyone from large businesses to independent professionals can take advantage of blockchain technology. For example, a small business looking to secure transactions can integrate Qubetics into its payment system with ease. By leveraging Qubetics’ smart contracts, the business ensures secure and transparent transactions without the need for a third-party intermediary. For developers, Qubetics’ IDE and QubeQode make it simple to create decentralized applications without needing deep blockchain expertise. Conclusion Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the top cryptos for significant returns in 2025, offering unique tools and solutions that previous projects failed to deliver. With its presale in full swing, now is the perfect time to get in before prices soar. Analysts are projecting an extraordinary ROI for those who act quickly, with $TICS possibly reaching $1, $5, or even $15 after the mainnet launch. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Qubetics stands out as a rare opportunity for substantial growth. Missing this opportunity could mean losing out on one of the top cryptos for significant returns in 2025. Don’t let this chance slip by—get in on the presale now and secure your position in the future of blockchain technology. Time is running out, and the potential is enormous.

Currently in the sixth stage of a successful presale, RCO Finance has generated considerable excitement through the launch of innovative artificial intelligence (AI) products and features designed for both institutional and retail investors. Major Institutions Set To Join RCOF’s Token Presale A major venture capital firm has put $7.5 million into the platform, therefore enhancing its roadmap and upgrading the beta platform just revealed, providing early access to RCOF’s ecosystem before its scheduled launch later this year. $17 million have also been raised so far, attracting the attention of major institutions and suggesting that even more may join the token presale in the future, raising RCOF’s value and possible price. Traders on the beta platform will be in to boost profits, lower risks, and discover new opportunities across more than 100,000 assets in global markets using artificial intelligence technology, including its own Robo Advisor. Using a combination of artificial intelligence, creative features, and advanced trading tools, traders can significantly raise their winning rates and portfolios, which offers huge profit potential. The Power Of RCO Finance’s AI-Driven Robo Advisor Operating as an investment manager, the Robo Advisor personalizes trading and investing suggestions to users’ individual goals. It creates personalized investing strategies and modifies asset allocations based on machine learning algorithms. Its adaptability to changing market conditions—whether bullish or bearish—enables the platform to seize profitable opportunities and execute trades at the most advantageous moments. For instance, the Robo Advisor can predict trends, identify when a popular memecoin or cryptocurrency is likely to have significant price fluctuations, and then trade appropriately to maximize earnings. This means that only people engaged in the RCO Finance token presale will have the opportunity to benefit from these market insights going forward, with the potential to turn tiny investments into millions in record time. Potential 400% Returns Await Early Investors Aside from the Robo Advisor, the RCO Finance team has added several features to its token presale features. Among other asset classes—including crypto, stocks, bonds, and commodities—the recently launched AI-Powered Dashboard provides market transparency. An Instant Deposit System lets account financing directly from connected bank cards, while a Demo Trading Environment offers risk-free simulated trading across all asset classes. Through Telegram and X (formerly Twitter), users may also monitor their portfolio performance and get real-time notifications. When combined with the Robo Advisor, this creates the ideal setting for optimal transactions. These features have prompted analysts to optimize their projections for RCOF. Early backers are already enjoying returns of 1,000%, and experts predict that, once these products are fully launched and RCOF is listed on centralized exchanges (CEXs), the token’s value could surge from $0.13 to approximately $0.60, resulting in potential returns of nearly 400% for those who hold the altcoin for a brief period. Looking ahead, the RCO Finance team plans to unveil a new set of features in the second quarter of the year for its token presale participants, which, combined with institutional support, could further elevate these projections, offering even greater profit potential. Now’s The Time To Invest According to the platform’s token presale roadmap, users can anticipate the launch of AI-Powered Simulated Trading, which will enable demo users to compare manual trades against AI-executed strategies. A Demo Trading Leaderboard will rank the top 50 demo traders by profit rise, hence promoting competition and skill development. Users will be provided by In-Depth Trade Performance Analytics a whole package to review their trading history. Furthermore, Calendar-Based P/L Tracking would provide performance measurement across many timeframes; CRM Sync and User Behavior Tracking will enhance customised onboarding and participation. Moreover, the inclusion of an artificial intelligence trading indicator will provide real-time notifications for overbought or oversold conditions, so alerting users to unusual market trends. Given this, together with the robust tokenomics of the protocol intended to enhance incentives, accessibility, and discounts within the RCO Finance ecosystem, now is the time to engage in RCOF’s token presale. Apart from continuous smart contract audits for global compliance, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ensure your financial future by simple registration in a know-your-customer (KYC)-free environment that respects privacy and security. Don’t miss this chance; buy RCOF tokens at a significant discount before they take off.

33767162,[object Object],1746241244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Kuwait Clamps Down On Bitcoin Mining As Power Grid Reaches Breaking Point,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-banned-in-kuwait-as-power-grid-reaches-breaking-point/,"The government of Kuwait has initiated a crackdown on cryptocurrency miners throughout the nation, accusing them of aggravating power shortages with summer just around the corner, according to a Reuters report. The interior ministry last week declared a “wide-ranging” security campaign targeting houses that have been converted into mining centers. Power Grid Under Severe Strain The crypto mining operations “represent an illegal exploitation of electric power” and can trigger blackouts impacting residential homes, commercial establishments, and critical services, Kuwaiti authorities said. The operations “present a direct threat to public safety,” the interior ministry added in its announcement. The power shortage in the Gulf country is a result of multiple causes: a population increase, urbanization, increased temperatures, and postponed upkeep at current power plants. Authorities have focused on the southern sector of Al-Wafrah, where around 100 houses were said to be utilized for mining operations. Video: Kuwait Busts Crypto Miners’ Den Operating in Residential Area #Kuwait #CryptoMinning #CryptoCurrency https://t.co/uJi7sH6TAL — ARAB TIMES – KUWAIT (@arabtimeskuwait) April 25, 2025 Mining Operations Exploit Cheap Electricity Some of Al-Wafrah’s mining facilities use as much as 20 times the average electricity levels that ordinary homes require, according to earlier reports made by the ministry of electricity. The nation’s highly subsidized cheap electricity has brought miners who hope to make big profits. Legal Gray Area Fuels Problem Though Kuwait has prohibited cryptocurrency trading , the nation lacks legislation governing mining operations. This loophole has enabled miners to work in a legal limbo even as the central bank cautioned against investing in cryptocurrencies. The case illustrates how crypto mining looks for areas with low electricity costs. The same trends have been observed globally, leading nations from Kosovo to Russia to limit mining to avoid power shortages. Early Results Indicate Strong Impact The ministry of electricity announced a 55% decline in energy consumption in Al-Wafrah after last week’s crackdown operation. This steep decline indicates the crackdown has been successful in its initial phases. Kuwait’s cryptocurrency policy is starkly at odds with that of some of its neighbors. As Kuwait suppresses mining, Dubai opened this week to a key crypto conference, with Eric Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump, in attendance. University of Cambridge research estimated that Kuwait was responsible for only 0.05% of global bitcoin mining in 2022. Yet even this small proportion can have a major effect on Kuwait’s relatively small electrical grid, experts say. “It would only take a very tiny proportion of the overall bitcoin mining network to have a large influence on the comparatively small overall electrical usage of Kuwait,” said Alex de Vries-Gao, co-founder of Digiconomist, a tracker of crypto energy usage. As Kuwaiti summers heat up in the next few months, officials continue to ask citizens to cut back on electricity consumption, expecting the clampdown on miners to avoid frequent power outages during the hot summer months ahead.

44091685,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=743035,1746241249,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44091685.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Confirmed Local Bottom As All Indicators Flash Bullish, Where’s Price Headed?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-confirmed-local-bottom/,"The Bitcoin price has just printed a major bullish signal, officially confirming a strong local bottom and sparking renewed sentiment among analysts. This bullish shift comes after April closed in the green, reclaiming technical levels and signaling the potential for a significant move toward the six-figure price territory. Market expert Titan Of Crypto has announced on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin has officially hit a local bottom. The analyst shared a chart showcasing that Bitcoin is flashing one of the strongest bullish signals. Bitcoin Price Establishes Solid Local Bottom According to the Ichimoku Cloud analysis, BTC’s price has closed firmly above the Tenkan (red line), Kijun (blue line), and Kimo cloud. All of these Ichimoku lines are sloping upwards, reinforcing that Bitcoin’s momentum and trend structure are aligned. Related Reading: Bitcoin Raging Bull Indicator Turns Back On, But This Level Holds The Key A close above the Tenkan signals short-term bullish momentum, while the Kijun confirms strength in a medium-trend. The thick Kimo cloud represents the most bullish configuration, indicating clear trend dominance. Furthermore, when Bitcoin closes above all Ichimoku lines, it establishes a dynamic support or resistance zone, validating the overall bullish structure. Adding more weight to this bullish signal, Titan of Crypto revealed that Bitcoin has reclaimed the April high, a key resistance level of around $95,173, which is now acting as a support area. The rectangular zone highlighted as “the local bottom” on the chart reflects price action between February and April 2025, where BTC formed a higher low above the Kijun. The bullish April monthly candle close above this zone officially establishes this region as a strong foundational support, which validates the possibility of a local bottom from a technical standpoint. With the local bottom confirmed and momentum on its side, Bitcoin could be headed to the next likely resistance area, marked on the chart as the “Next Point of Interest.” This area sits above the $110,000 region, near $115,000. For this bullish scenario to play out, BTC must maintain its position above the April high and the Kijun as dynamic support. Bulls will need to defend any retracements toward these zones to preserve momentum. Failure to do so could lead to a deeper correction, effectively invalidating the bullish outlook. BTC Price Action Looks Strong In a more recent X post, Titan of Crypto announced that Bitcoin is breaking out of a tight range and its price action looks strong. He shared an Ichimoku Cloud analysis of the cryptocurrency, showing a potential bullish breakout setup on the 1-day timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes Golden Cross That Only Happens Once Every Cycle, What To Expect Looking at the price chart, Bitcoin has been consolidating between $92,880 and $95,800 over the past several days, but momentum appears to be building for a potential breakout. A confirmed close above $95,800 would validate the breakout and open the door for a bullish continuation, with the price target set near $99,000.

As bullish sentiment returned, the total crypto market cap climbed almost 3.5% to stabilise around $3.11 trillion on Friday. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index cooled off after hitting a multi-month high of 72 last week, but still closed the current week in “greed” at 67, suggesting that some caution remains. The altcoin sector saw more modest action compared to Bitcoin, with most top cryptocurrencies giving up last week’s gains, and only a handful managing to hold on to double-digit returns. Altcoin trading remained relatively muted, hinting that traders were still sitting on the sidelines, weighing macro cues before making riskier bets. Why is Bitcoin going up? Macroeconomic data dominated sentiment through the week, keeping Bitcoin rangebound as traders waited for clarity on the Fed’s next move. The first catalyst came midweek with the release of US PCE inflation data, which showed no month-on-month growth and a continued decline in core PCE to 2.6%, its lowest reading in nearly a year. The figures were stable, but not soft enough to justify an immediate rate cut, prompting a brief dip in crypto prices. The cautious mood deepened after fresh labour market data showed signs of cooling. ADP’s private payroll report came in well below expectations, while first estimates for Q1 GDP revealed a surprise 0.3% contraction. The downturn was largely driven by a spike in imports ahead of Trump’s new tariff wave, reinforcing investor concerns around slowing growth and elevated trade tensions. However, sentiment began to recover on Friday following a statement from China’s commerce ministry expressing openness to trade talks with the US. The news sparked optimism across global markets, lifting Bitcoin past $97,000 as hopes for de-escalation in the ongoing tariff standoff gained traction. Momentum strengthened further after April’s nonfarm payrolls beat expectations, easing fears of a deeper slowdown. While the Fed is still expected to hold rates steady next week, markets are now more confident that easing could come later this summer, especially with Trump renewing pressure on the central bank to cut. As of late Asian trading hours on Friday, bulls were back in control, pushing Bitcoin toward the $98,000 level and setting the stage for a potential breakout toward six figures in the days ahead. Will Bitcoin hit $100k? The answer may rest heavily on geopolitics, particularly the thawing trade tensions between the US and China. Analysts now view May as a crucial month. As Nansen’s Aurelie Barthere explains, exemptions on several tariff categories—including auto parts and low-value shipments—are set to expire. If no progress is made this month, recession risks could grow, dragging Bitcoin and other speculative assets down. However, Barthere believes a deal or “agreement in principle” is more likely, with both sides keen to avoid economic disruption. Beyond trade tensions, recession fears are also back in focus. Analysts at Apollo Global have warned that the US could slip into a recession by summer, pointing to the biggest drop in corporate earnings expectations since 2020. While a slowdown could initially pressure Bitcoin, some analysts say it might ultimately benefit from the shift in Fed policy expectations. Historical trends show Bitcoin has performed strongly in post-recession environments, particularly when monetary easing follows. Most analysts were bullish regarding the short-term price action over the weekend. According to Cas Abbé, spot demand will be the real deciding factor for what comes next for Bitcoin. “If there is a spike in Coinbase Bitcoin Premium during US hours, my bet will be to the upside. If BTC fails to attract spot demand, I think we could see a long squeeze with BTC potentially reaching the $94K to $95K level,” Abbé wrote in a May 2 post. Others like Nonzee also echoed similar sentiment, as he shared a Wyckoff accumulation schematic suggesting Bitcoin is nearing the final phase of a breakout structure. According to a chart he shared, Bitcoin appears to have completed its “spring” and “test” phases, key markers in Wyckoff theory that often precede a strong upside move. Bitcoin/USD 1-day chart. Source: Nonzee Offering an alternate perspective, well-followed analyst Ted added that Offering an alternate perspective, well-followed analyst Ted said that Bitcoin may still need a brief consolidation phase before its next leg higher. According to Ted, the $96K–$99K zone could act as near-term resistance, with price action potentially stalling there for a few days. However, he expects Bitcoin to eventually break out to the upside, continuing its recovery in line with the Wyckoff structure’s “Sign of Strength” phase. When writing, Bitcoin was trading at $97,423.72, up 2% in the past days. Altcoins’ momentum is yet to return Broader crypto markets followed Bitcoin’s lead, with most major altcoins posting modest gains. Ethereum rose 1.4% to $1,838, XRP edged up 0.5% to $2.22, while Solana and Cardano added 0.6% and 2.7% respectively. Dogecoin led the pack with a 3.3% surge. The total altcoin market cap rose just over 1.6%, holding steady around the $1.2 trillion mark. While altcoin season hasn’t kicked off yet, Bitcoin’s dominance climbed to 64.89% this week, its highest level since January 2021, raising speculation that it could be around the corner. According to Rekt Capital, traders may need to wait until Bitcoin dominance approaches the 71% level, where past rejections have typically triggered sharp altcoin rallies. Still, several top altcoins outperformed the market this week, logging double-digit gains. The top performers were: Virtuals Protocol Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL) soared over 100% in the past 7 days, hitting a 3-month high of $1.86 as of press time. Its market cap crossed the $1.2 billion mark, though daily trading volume was down 45% from the previous day, sitting at $371 million, hinting that trading activity is starting to cool off a bit. Source: CoinMarketCap The main driver behind this week’s gains was the successful rollout of Virtual’s Genesis Launch update. This update introduced several key features, like letting developers auto-lock their token allocations and set up transparent vesting schedules. Another major boost came from the announcement that Recognized Staked Agents are now eligible to earn points in the ecosystem, opening up new incentives for participants, rewarding those actively staking and engaging with the platform. VIRTUAL also gained steam from its recent listing on crypto exchange Binance.US, which likely attracted fresh investor interest and liquidity, pulling in both retail and institutional buyers. Solayer Over the past week, Solayer (LAYER) climbed 29% to $3.03, lifting its market cap to over $638 million. However, daily trading volume slipped 22% over the past day, settling at around $146 million at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap The week’s gains appear largely tied to renewed market attention following the reveal of the Solayer Emerald Card. The card allows users to spend USDC directly via Visa without converting to fiat, and also offers an annual yield option through sUSD, a stablecoin backed by US Treasury bills. Additionally, the Emerald Card includes a rewards system where transactions generate points, which can be exchanged for LAYER tokens, partner airdrops, or referral bonuses. Monero Monero (XMR) was up 26% over the past week, trading at $288.7 at the time of writing. Its market cap stood at $5.3 billion, with daily trading volume hovering over $120.7 million. Source: CoinMarketCap While no major positive development or news could be identified as of press time, part of this recent surge appears linked to on-chain activity flagged by blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who identified a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC (worth about $330.7 million) that was later swapped into XMR. The large-scale conversion led to a sharp price surge, which likely drew the attention of day traders and scalpers, further contributing to the token’s sharp price increase.

In September of last year, $38,000 was stolen from an account that Justin Chan jointly held with his sister, reports the ABC-affiliated news station KGTV. The theft happened after a SIM-swapping attack, where a hacker managed to convince Xfinity Mobile to port Chan’s cellphone number to a new device. With access to two-factor verification codes, Chan says the hacker changed his login credentials and initiated three outgoing wire transfers. “All these instances occurred within a three-hour period starting at around 2:00am, 3:00am. It was very fast.” Chan reported the fraudulent incident to Bank of America, but says the lender refused to reimburse. “ Our investigation found the transaction in question was confirmed valid by you via (SMS/MMS) text message response or speaking directly with Fraud Detection Employee.” Bank of America later reopened an investigation in November but still denied Chan a refund. Chan also presented a letter to Bank of America from Xfinity Mobile saying that his phone number was “likely accessed by a third party as a result of fraudulent activity” but the lender did not respond. “ I didn’t think I would get the money back. It was a very tough situation to begin with. Bank of America was being difficult.” KGTV says things took a positive turn after the news team continued to press Bank of America on the matter. The lender reimbursed $20,000 and the trading platform Robinhood, where the remaining $18,000 had been sent, refunded the remaining funds.

44092172,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154722,1746242144,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shockwave: Brown University Holds $4.9M in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/brown-university-bitcoin-etf/,"The world of finance is constantly evolving, and perhaps no sector has seen more dramatic shifts recently than the intersection of traditional investments and digital assets. A significant development has just emerged, capturing the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and financial analysts: a leading Ivy League institution has publicly disclosed a substantial holding in a spot Bitcoin ETF . Ivy League Embraces Digital Assets: Brown University’s Bold Move In a move that underscores the increasing legitimacy and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance, Brown University , one of the United States’ most prestigious Ivy League universities, has reported holding shares in BlackRock’s popular spot Bitcoin ETF . This isn’t just any investment; it’s a clear signal from an institution known for its cautious and long-term investment strategies. According to a recent securities filing, as reported by Wu Blockchain via X, Brown University held 105,000 shares of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF , ticker IBIT, as of March 31st. This holding was valued at approximately $4.9 million at the time. What makes this particularly noteworthy is that these shares were a new addition to the university’s portfolio during the first quarter of this year, indicating a recent strategic decision to gain exposure to Bitcoin via this regulated investment vehicle. While $4.9 million might seem modest compared to the multi-billion dollar endowments managed by Ivy League schools, its significance lies in the institution itself. An Ivy League university adding a spot Bitcoin ETF to its holdings sends a powerful message about the growing acceptance and perceived stability of Bitcoin as an asset class among sophisticated, long-term investors. Understanding the Significance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock IBIT provide investors with exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without requiring them to directly buy, hold, or manage the cryptocurrency itself. This structure simplifies investment, reduces technical hurdles, and operates within traditional brokerage accounts and regulatory frameworks. The approval of these ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year was a landmark event, paving the way for broader Institutional Adoption . For institutions like universities, pension funds, and endowments, investing in a spot Bitcoin ETF is often the preferred or only viable method to gain Bitcoin exposure due to internal investment mandates, regulatory requirements, and operational simplicity. The fact that an institution like Brown University has chosen this route highlights the effectiveness of the ETF structure in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. BlackRock IBIT: A Popular Choice for Institutional Adoption BlackRock IBIT has quickly emerged as one of the most successful and popular spot Bitcoin ETFs since its launch. Its rapid accumulation of assets under management speaks volumes about investor confidence, both retail and institutional, in BlackRock’s reputation and the ETF structure itself. Brown University’s choice to invest specifically in BlackRock IBIT further validates the fund’s position as a leading vehicle for Institutional Adoption of Bitcoin. Brown University’s overall investment portfolio is substantial, totaling $216 million across 14 different stocks (as per the specific filing mentioned). The $4.9 million allocated to BlackRock IBIT represents a calculated allocation within a diversified strategy. It signals a belief that Bitcoin, accessed through a regulated ETF, has a role to play in a modern, diversified portfolio, potentially as a hedge against inflation or as a growth asset with unique characteristics. What Does This Mean for Institutional Adoption and the Market? This disclosure from Brown University is more than just news about one university’s portfolio; it’s a potential bellwether for broader trends. Here’s why it’s significant: Validation: An Ivy League university adding a spot Bitcoin ETF provides significant validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Precedent: This move could encourage other endowments, foundations, and institutional investors who have been watching from the sidelines to consider their own allocations. Liquidity and Stability: Increased institutional participation through ETFs adds liquidity and can contribute to market stability over the long term. Education and Awareness: Such disclosures bring attention to Bitcoin and digital assets within traditional financial circles and educational institutions themselves. While it’s crucial not to extrapolate too much from a single data point, the pattern of increasing interest and allocation from sophisticated investors and institutions like Brown University , facilitated by products like BlackRock IBIT , points towards a future where digital assets are a more integrated part of the global financial landscape. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Bitcoin Investment The disclosure from Brown University is likely just the beginning. As spot Bitcoin ETFs mature and gain longer track records, and as regulatory clarity potentially improves, more institutions are expected to explore allocations. The due diligence processes for large endowments and pension funds are rigorous, but the fact that an institution like Brown has completed this process and made an investment is a positive sign for the broader trend of Institutional Adoption . Investors watching this space should pay attention not only to the performance of the ETFs themselves but also to future filings from other large institutions. These disclosures provide valuable insights into the evolving sentiment and strategic thinking among some of the world’s most influential investors. Conclusion: A Milestone for Bitcoin’s Mainstream Journey Brown University’s decision to invest nearly $5 million in BlackRock IBIT is a significant milestone in Bitcoin’s journey towards mainstream financial acceptance. It highlights the effectiveness of spot Bitcoin ETFs in facilitating Institutional Adoption and demonstrates that even historically conservative Ivy League institutions are beginning to recognize the potential role of digital assets in their portfolios. This development adds another layer of credibility to the asset class and could pave the way for further institutional inflows in the future, solidifying Bitcoin’s position within the global financial ecosystem.

44092269,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154749,1746242446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Apple Crypto Rules: Exciting Easing for iOS Apps and NFTs on iPhone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/apple-crypto-rules-eased/,"Get ready, crypto enthusiasts and developers! Apple, a giant in the tech world, has made a significant move that could reshape how we interact with digital assets on our mobile devices. The long-anticipated changes to Apple crypto rules are finally here, bringing new opportunities for iOS crypto apps and users alike. For a long time, navigating the App Store’s policies around cryptocurrencies and NFTs felt restrictive for developers. Now, following a key U.S. court ruling, Apple has updated its guidelines, opening up new possibilities, particularly concerning payments and NFT transactions. What’s Changing with Apple Crypto Rules? The core of the update addresses two major pain points for developers integrating crypto functionalities: External Payment Links: Previously, apps were heavily restricted in linking to external websites for purchases, forcing many transactions through Apple’s in-app purchase system, subject to their commission. The updated guidelines now allow developers of U.S. apps to include buttons or links that direct users to an external website to complete a purchase, including those involving crypto. NFT Secondary Marketplace Purchases: This is a big one for the digital collectibles space. Apple now explicitly allows apps to facilitate the buying and selling of NFTs on secondary marketplaces within the app, provided the transaction complies with other App Store Review Guidelines. This directly impacts how developers can build experiences around the NFT on App Store ecosystem. These changes, as reported by outlets like Decrypt, represent a notable shift from Apple’s historically cautious stance on decentralized technologies within its walled garden. Impact on iOS Crypto Apps and Developers So, what does this mean if you’re building or using iOS crypto apps ? The implications are substantial: Increased Flexibility: Developers have more options for handling transactions, potentially reducing reliance on Apple’s in-app purchase system for certain crypto-related activities. New Business Models: Enabling secondary NFT sales directly within apps unlocks new revenue streams and user engagement models for platforms focusing on digital art, collectibles, and gaming. Improved User Experience: Users might see more seamless integration of crypto purchases and NFT trading within their favorite apps on their crypto apps iPhone . This update signals Apple’s adaptation to the evolving digital economy, acknowledging the growing importance of crypto and NFTs. Accessing NFT on App Store: What’s Possible Now? The ability to buy and sell NFTs on secondary marketplaces directly through apps is a game-changer for the NFT on App Store experience. Before this change, facilitating such transactions within an app was often a complex and restricted process. Now, platforms focused on NFTs can offer a more integrated trading experience, potentially attracting more users to the space via the familiar and trusted App Store environment. Imagine browsing a digital art gallery app and being able to not just view, but also purchase or sell NFTs from other users directly within the app, using an external payment method if the developer chooses to offer it. This was previously a significant hurdle. Navigating the Apple App Store Crypto Landscape While the rules have eased, it’s crucial to understand that not everything is a free-for-all. The updated Apple App Store crypto guidelines still maintain restrictions on certain activities deemed high-risk or non-compliant with Apple’s broader policies. Activities such as cryptocurrency mining within apps, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and other securities-related crypto activities remain prohibited. Developers must still navigate the complex review process and ensure their apps comply with all other guidelines related to user safety, privacy, and financial regulations. What Remains Restricted for Crypto Apps iPhone Users? Even with the relaxed crypto apps iPhone rules, some core limitations persist: Mining: Running cryptocurrency mining processes in the background is still not allowed due to battery and performance concerns. ICOs and Securities: Apps cannot facilitate the trading of cryptocurrency futures, options, or other securities, nor can they conduct ICOs. Compliance: Apps must still comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including financial regulations, which can be complex for crypto. So, while buying an NFT or using an external payment link for a crypto-related service is becoming easier, don’t expect to turn your iPhone into a Bitcoin miner via an app anytime soon. Summary: A Step Forward for Crypto on iOS Apple’s updated App Store guidelines represent a significant step forward for the integration of crypto and NFTs into the mainstream mobile ecosystem, particularly for users and developers in the U.S. By allowing external payment links and facilitating secondary NFT sales, Apple is acknowledging the growing importance of decentralized technologies and providing developers with more flexibility. While restrictions on activities like mining and ICOs remain, these changes pave the way for more innovative and user-friendly iOS crypto apps in the future. This move is poised to benefit developers seeking alternative payment methods and users looking for more direct access to the vibrant NFT market on their iPhones.

Hayes doubts print money plans for Bitcoin “The United States is a deficit country; the only way they can do a Strategic Reserve is not sell the Bitcoin they took from people, fine, that’s 200,000 Bitcoin,” he said. Arthur Hayes spoke to Kyle Chasse on his crypto interview series. Source: Kyle Chasse However, Hayes said it’s hard to imagine any “properly elected” politician openly announcing that the government plans to print money to buy Bitcoin ( BTC ). “Especially when the popular narrative is a bunch of Bitcoin bros going to the club.” “Is that really what you want people to think about your policy?” he asked. On March 6, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve and digital asset stockpile in the US. The US holds 198,012 Bitcoin worth over $18 billion, as per recent data. The reserve is primarily formed of Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil cases , including significant amounts from the Silk Road and Bitfinex hack cases. However, many crypto industry leaders believe that if the US government starts buying Bitcoin, it could set off an aggressive domino effect. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of exchange aggregator 1inch, said during Cointelegraph’s LONGITUDE event in Dubai that if the US were to start buying Bitcoin for a strategic reserve, even smaller countries may soon struggle to acquire the cryptocurrency. He added. “I’m pretty sure we’ll soon see countries battling over who owns more Bitcoin. The US will start.” Hayes sees Bitcoin to altcoin rotation playbook staying the same Hayes remains confident that the Bitcoin cycle leading into altcoin season will follow the same pattern as it did in 2021, despite differing views from other analysts. “I personally think Bitcoin dominance is going back to where it was before the 2021 altcoin season, which is about 70%,” Hayes said. Hayes isn’t convinced the pattern will change. “Then people just start rotating,” he said. “It’s back at all-time highs; bull markets are back, and altcoins should outperform. Should is a keyword there,” Hayes said. “Depends on what you buy,” he added.

Source: TradingView This represents an 11.68% increase since Jan. 1, when Bitcoin dominance was hovering just below 60%, a level where some analysts said would be its peak before altcoin season began. Several analysts doubted that Bitcoin dominance would ever return to 70%. One of those skeptics was Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen, who explained in August that he doesn’t “think it is going back up to 70%,” and his target for Bitcoin dominance is 60%. Meanwhile, in December CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said “altseason is no longer defined by asset rotation from Bitcoin.” He said the traditional signal marking the beginning of an altcoin season when capital rotates from Bitcoin to altcoins is outdated. Instead, altcoin trading volume has become more prevalent against stablecoin and fiat currency pairs.

That’s why recent reports of a significant Kraken wallet connection issue have caught the attention of users across the platform. As a leading crypto exchange , any technical hiccup at Kraken can impact a large number of traders and investors. What’s Happening with the Kraken Wallet Connection? U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has officially acknowledged a technical problem impacting how users connect to their digital wallets on the platform. The core of the issue appears to be related to the wallet connection process itself. According to Kraken’s statements, users attempting to access their wallets may encounter several frustrating experiences, including: Errors: Specific error messages popping up when trying to view wallet details or initiate transactions. Indefinite Loading: The wallet interface simply spinning or freezing, failing to load account balances or transaction history. Inability to Access Funds: The most critical impact, preventing users from seeing their holdings or performing essential actions like depositing, withdrawing, or trading. This issue specifically pertains to the integrated wallets users manage directly within the Kraken exchange platform, rather than external self-custody wallets. Why is a Stable Wallet Connection Critical for a Crypto Exchange? For any crypto exchange , the wallet function is the gateway for users to interact with their digital assets. It’s where your Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies are held (or more accurately, where the private keys controlled by the exchange that give you access to those funds are linked). A reliable wallet connection is essential for several key functions: Viewing Balances: Users need to see exactly how much crypto they hold. Depositing Funds: Sending crypto from an external wallet or another exchange to Kraken. Withdrawing Funds: Moving crypto from Kraken to an external wallet or another platform. Trading: While trading interfaces might load, you need a connected wallet to execute buy or sell orders using your existing balance. Checking Transaction History: Reviewing past deposits, withdrawals, and trades. When the Kraken wallet connection fails, all these fundamental activities become impossible or severely hindered, leading to significant user frustration and potential financial implications, especially in volatile market conditions. Kraken’s Response: Investigation and Communication Upon identifying the problem, Kraken has stated they are actively investigating the root cause of the wallet connection issue. Transparency and timely communication from a cryptocurrency exchange during such incidents are crucial for maintaining user trust. While the initial announcement indicated an investigation was underway, users should monitor Kraken’s official communication channels for updates. These typically include: The official Kraken Status Page. Kraken’s official social media accounts (e.g., Twitter). Email notifications from Kraken support. Staying informed through these verified sources is the best way for users to understand the progress of the fix and when normal service is expected to resume for the Kraken wallet . What Challenges Do Users Face During This Kraken Wallet Issue? Beyond the immediate frustration of not being able to access funds, the Kraken wallet connection problem presents several challenges: 1. Trading Limitations: If you can’t see your balance or access your wallet, you cannot make timely trades. In a market known for rapid price swings, this can mean missed opportunities or the inability to react to sudden drops or pumps. 2. Uncertainty and Anxiety: Not being able to view your assets can be stressful for any investor. Users may worry about the safety of their funds, even if the underlying issue is technical and not a security breach. 3. Deposit and Withdrawal Halts: The inability to move funds on or off the exchange locks users into their current positions, regardless of their needs or external market factors. 4. Planning Disruptions: Investors who planned to make specific transactions at a certain time based on market analysis find their strategies disrupted by the unexpected outage. These challenges highlight just how vital a stable and reliable platform is for a major cryptocurrency exchange like Kraken. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Kraken Wallet Problem If you are a Kraken user affected by this wallet connection issue, here are some actionable steps you can take: Action Why It Helps Check Official Channels Get accurate, real-time updates directly from Kraken’s status page or official social media. Avoid relying on unverified sources. Be Patient Technical issues, especially on large, complex platforms, take time to diagnose and fix properly. Rushing the process can lead to further complications. Avoid Unofficial Support Be wary of individuals contacting you via social media or other platforms claiming to be support and asking for your login details or private keys. These are likely scams. Kraken support will not ask for this information. Review Security Practices While waiting, take the opportunity to review your account security: enable 2FA, use a strong unique password, and be aware of phishing attempts. Consider Diversification (Long-Term) For future preparedness, consider holding assets across multiple reputable exchanges or in self-custody wallets to avoid being entirely reliant on one platform’s uptime. Remember, Kraken is investigating the issue, and their technical teams are working to restore full functionality to the Kraken wallet and the platform as a whole. The Broader Picture: Reliability in the Cryptocurrency Exchange Space Incidents like the Kraken wallet connection issue, while frustrating, are not entirely uncommon in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Technical glitches can arise from various factors, including software updates, infrastructure load, or external network problems. What distinguishes a reliable platform is not necessarily the absence of issues, but the speed and effectiveness of their response, their communication with users, and their ability to implement long-term solutions to prevent recurrence. Users of any crypto exchange should be aware that platform downtime is a possibility and factor this into their trading and investment strategies, especially during periods of high market volatility. Conclusion: Awaiting Resolution for the Kraken Wallet The current Kraken wallet connection issue serves as a reminder of the technical complexities underlying even the most popular cryptocurrency exchange platforms. While frustrating for users unable to access their funds or trade, Kraken has acknowledged the problem and is working towards a resolution. For affected users, the best course of action is to remain patient, rely solely on official Kraken communication channels for updates, and take basic security precautions. As the investigation progresses, the crypto community will be watching for Kraken to restore full functionality and provide insights into the cause of the disruption to their wallet connection services.

44092856,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154780,1746243658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Google Gemini Safety Report Reveals Regression,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-gemini-safety-report/,"In the fast-paced world of artificial intelligence, developments happen rapidly, influencing everything from how we search for information to how complex systems operate. For those following the intersection of technology and finance, including the cryptocurrency space, understanding the capabilities and limitations of powerful AI models is increasingly relevant. A recent report from Google has brought a critical aspect of AI development into focus: safety. Specifically, concerns are being raised about the latest internal benchmarks for one of Google’s AI models, highlighting potential regressions in key safety metrics. This development regarding Google Gemini safety is prompting discussions across the tech industry and beyond. What’s Happening with Gemini 2.5 Flash Safety Scores? Google recently published a technical report detailing the performance of its new AI models. Among the findings, one stood out: the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, a newer iteration, performed worse on certain internal safety evaluations compared to its predecessor, Gemini 2.0 Flash. This regression in safety scores is a notable point as AI models become more widely deployed. According to Google’s report, the decline was measured across two specific metrics: Text-to-text safety: This metric assesses how often an AI model generates responses that violate Google’s safety guidelines when given a text prompt. Gemini 2.5 Flash showed a 4.1% regression in this area. Image-to-text safety: This metric evaluates how well the model adheres to safety boundaries when processing information from an image prompt. Gemini 2.5 Flash saw a more significant regression of 9.6% here. Google confirmed these findings, stating that Gemini 2.5 Flash indeed “performs worse on text-to-text and image-to-text safety.” These automated tests suggest that the newer model is more prone to generating potentially problematic content based on user inputs, whether text or image-based. Why is AI Model Safety Becoming a Bigger Concern? These surprising benchmark results for AI model safety come at a time when the broader AI industry is navigating a complex challenge: making models more ‘permissive’. This means making them less likely to simply refuse to answer questions on controversial or sensitive topics. The goal is often to provide more helpful or comprehensive responses, even on difficult subjects. Other major players are also exploring this path: Meta has stated that its latest Llama models were tuned to avoid endorsing specific views and to respond to more politically debated prompts. OpenAI has indicated plans to adjust future models to offer multiple perspectives on controversial issues rather than taking an editorial stance or refusing to engage. While the intention behind increased permissiveness is often to make AI more useful and less prone to frustrating users with excessive guardrails, it creates a delicate balance. The risk is that in becoming more open to diverse prompts, models might inadvertently become more susceptible to generating harmful, biased, or unsafe content. This highlights the ongoing tension in developing robust AI model safety protocols. Instruction Following vs. AI Policy Violations: A Tightrope Walk? Google’s report points to a core reason for the safety regression in Gemini 2.5 Flash : its improved ability to follow instructions. While generally a positive trait, this also means it follows instructions more faithfully even when those instructions cross problematic lines or request content that constitutes AI policy violations . As Google’s report notes, “Naturally, there is tension between [instruction following] on sensitive topics and safety policy violations, which is reflected across our evaluations.” The model is better at doing what the user asks, but if the user asks for something unsafe, it’s now more likely to comply. While Google attributes some of the regression to ‘false positives’ in their automated testing system, they acknowledge that Gemini 2.5 Flash does sometimes generate “violative content” when explicitly prompted to do so. This underscores the challenge: making a model helpful and responsive without making it exploitable for harmful purposes. Testing conducted via the AI platform OpenRouter reportedly showed Gemini 2.5 Flash generating essays supporting concerning ideas like replacing human judges with AI, weakening due process, and implementing widespread warrantless surveillance programs without hesitation. These examples illustrate the potential for AI policy violations when instruction following overrides safety guardrails. Is AI Safety Testing Transparent Enough? The details provided in Google’s technical report, or lack thereof, have also drawn criticism. Thomas Woodside, co-founder of the Secure AI Project, emphasized the need for greater transparency in AI safety testing . “There’s a trade-off between instruction-following and policy following, because some users may ask for content that would violate policies,” Woodside stated. “In this case, Google’s latest Flash model complies with instructions more while also violating policies more.” Woodside highlighted that Google did not provide extensive detail on the specific instances where policies were violated, beyond stating they were not severe. Without this detailed information, it becomes difficult for independent analysts to fully understand the nature and severity of the safety issues. This lack of detail in AI safety testing reports is a recurring point of concern for researchers and the public alike. Google has faced scrutiny over its safety reporting practices before. The technical report for its more powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro model was initially delayed and later published with key safety testing details omitted, requiring a subsequent, more detailed release. This history adds to the calls for more upfront and comprehensive transparency in how powerful AI models are evaluated for safety before and after release. What Does This Google Gemini Safety Report Mean for AI’s Future? The findings in the latest report on Google Gemini safety are a clear indicator of the ongoing challenges in scaling AI capabilities while maintaining robust safety standards. As models like Gemini become more sophisticated and integrated into various applications, including potentially those relevant to finance, data analysis, or automated systems within the broader tech ecosystem that includes cryptocurrency, their safety and reliability are paramount. The tension between making AI helpful and ensuring it is safe is a fundamental challenge that the industry must continue to address proactively. The regression seen in Gemini 2.5 Flash’s internal safety scores serves as a reminder that progress in one area (like instruction following) can inadvertently impact another (like safety), requiring continuous vigilance, rigorous testing, and open reporting. The conversation around AI model safety , Gemini 2.5 Flash performance, AI safety testing methodologies, and potential AI policy violations is essential. As AI technology continues its rapid advancement, understanding these nuances is crucial for developers, policymakers, and the public to build and use these powerful tools responsibly. In conclusion, Google’s recent report on Gemini 2.5 Flash safety is a significant data point in the ongoing discussion about AI development. While the model shows improvements in some areas, the regression in safety benchmarks highlights the inherent difficulties in balancing performance with safety, especially as models are designed to be more permissive. The calls for increased transparency in safety testing underscore the need for the industry to work collaboratively towards building safer and more reliable AI systems for the future.

44093345,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=720023,1746244312,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44093345.jpeg,Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP—Is a major sell-off coming?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-unlocks-1-billion-xrp/,"Ripple has released 1 billion XRP tokens from escrow, marking a departure from the company’s usual XRP release pattern, which has remained unchanged since 2017. Ripple executed the release on May 3, 2025, in three trades—500 million XRP, 300 million XRP, and 200 million—worth at least $2.2 billion at XRP’s average exchange rate. The release is notable because it came two days later than usual for Ripple to release funds , as the firm unlocks one billion XRP each first day of the month. Details of the transactions were released by Whale Alert, a blockchain data service that confirmed the payments had been sent from Ripple’s escrow wallet. Ripple alters escrow timing amid XRP’s market consolidation Ripple’s monthly escrow process has been established since 2017 to provide a consistent and predictable supply of XRP to support market liquidity. The initial plan was to place 55 billion XRP into escrow, with one billion monthly release for 55 months. The latest release followed Ripple’s escrow lockup of 700 million XRP on May 2, 2025. This is the third month in a row that Ripple has made this pre-release move — also noticed in April and March — which could suggest a change of tactic. Traditionally, around 700 million XRP has been relocked after each release. However, Ripple recently changed when this relocking occurred from post-release to before release. This shift has led to speculation on Ripple’s focus regarding liquidity control and the distribution of the XRP supply. Ripple has not publicly issued a statement as to why the change in timing is being made. Still, some in the market speculate that the new date has something to do with market conditions or internal policy changes. However, the company has not verified these rumors. So far in May, XRP has traded between $1.96 and $2.50. Analysts say the asset is consolidating right now. Charts watchers point out that XRP has been maintaining above the key support levels, such as the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement and the historical resistance of around $1.80. Crypto analyst Casitrades provided her technical analysis , speculating that a back-test of the $2.25 level may occur and that a move further down to $1.90 is still on the table. The analyst added that the recent RSI is overbought, suggesting short-term price declines may be followed by some rebound time. The near-term sentiment is neutral, with longer-term traders closely watching resistance at $2.25. If XRP can maintain above this level, higher targets of $2.68 and $3.00 could be on the table. XRP is “loading” as Wall Street quietly moves in Recently, popular crypto influencer John Squire commented on the popular claim within the crypto community from critics labeling XRP as a “dead coin”. In Squire’s view, XRP is “loading,” potentially setting up for a monumental rally. In a lengthy May 1 post on X, John Squire noted that Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP is the only top 10 cryptocurrency mired in a multi-year-long legal battle with the U.S. government and emerged victorious. With the regulatory cloud finally behind it, Squire thinks XRP is poised to see a tidal wave of institutional adoption that sends the crypto higher in value. The pundit says that big money is gearing up as the CME Group is ready to introduce cash-settled XRP futures later this month. A comparable product from Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was introduced in April, underscoring growing institutional interest in XRP. Squire backed this sentiment by citing rumors of a potential XRP trust from asset management giant BlackRock — arguably the most highly awaited XRP product. He claims this is not retail-driven hype but early indications of Wall Street quietly positioning itself. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?
