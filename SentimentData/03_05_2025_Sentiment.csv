The targets include Gazprom, the massive state-owned energy company, and several other major organizations tied to natural resources and finance. Officials involved in the matter did not disclose any more names. Trump hasn’t signed the sanctions yet, but every piece is ready and waiting. One US official said plainly, “It’s totally his call.” Another added that the National Security Council is coordinating the rollout of “more punitive actions.” Trump has been growing frustrated with Putin after repeated attempts to get him to the table have failed. At first, Trump echoed Moscow’s points during the early stages of his private phone calls with Putin. Now he’s running out of patience. Trump presses harder after Putin rejects peace talks James Hewitt, spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Trump is still focused on a full and comprehensive ceasefire. Hewitt refused to say anything about current discussions behind closed doors. If Trump does approve this new sanctions package, it’ll follow the US-Ukraine minerals deal he signed on Wednesday, which was meant to be part of the peace framework. That agreement was pushed hard by Trump to show he’s taking a strong line, even as Putin ignores calls for negotiation. Since the 2022 invasion, the US and its allies have added sanctions over and over. But the Kremlin always finds ways around them. Moscow keeps making money, keeps buying weapons, and the war drags on. That’s why this new set of penalties targets Russia’s lifelines directly. Kurt Volker, who once served as Trump’s envoy to NATO and also handled Ukraine negotiations during his first term, said, “Trump has been bending over backwards to give Putin every opportunity to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to have a ceasefire and an end to the war,’ and Putin keeps rejecting him.” Volker added, “This is the next phase of putting some pressure on Russia. Putin has been escalating.” Trump, meanwhile, “has got the US and Ukraine now in alignment calling for an immediate and full ceasefire, and Putin is now the outlier.” Witkoff meets Putin again as Moscow keeps launching attacks Since returning to the Oval Office in January, Trump has been moving pieces around to try to make the Kremlin play ball. One of the biggest moves was shutting down the Justice Department task force that used to chase down sanctions violators and Russian oligarchs. He’s also made some public comments that support Russia, blaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the war and calling him a “dictator.” None of those gestures worked. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special peace envoy, has taken it further. He’s been promoting a peace deal that would give four Ukrainian regions to Moscow. He’s now met Putin four times, including a visit just last week. But three days after that, Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, repeated Putin’s maximum demands, and more attacks followed. Missile and drone strikes slammed into Ukrainian cities again, killing more civilians. Back in March, Reuters reported that US officials had a sanctions relief plan on the table—ready to give Russia a break if it came to the negotiating table. But that plan is dead for now. Trump’s mood has changed. Last Saturday, he met Zelenskiy in Vatican City for what both sides called a “very productive” meeting. One day later, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was “strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions and Tariffs on Russia” and said they’d stay in place until there’s a full ceasefire and a final deal. Volker also pointed out that Russia is still making serious money off oil and gas sales to India and China. He said the US could go further by using secondary sanctions, a tactic where a country punishes another country for doing business with a third one. In this case, that would mean punishing countries that keep buying from Russia. Volker said it would be “very significant” if Trump pulled that trigger.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) on the other hand has successfully increased its presale raise to $7.3 million by selling 430 million tokens to 9,200 holders. Analysts have identified these cryptocurrencies because they should be considered underpriced assets among the shifting dynamics of the crypto market. The market drive of Dogecoin through memes differs from Mutuum Finance’s organized DeFi strategy though they offer distinct prospective outcomes. The reason behind investor excitement about these tokens will be examined herein for their potential discovery space. Dogecoin’s Resurgent Rally Dogecoin benefits from fresh positive energy spreading throughout its market. The cryptocurrency market response has been highly positive as Dogecoin reached $0.1828 while analysts expect this asset to climb to $1.25 by 2025. Two bullish patterns emerge from the 5-day candlestick chart which strengthens $0.1316 as a solid support level. However, the $0.20 resistance looms large. Several market conditions must be present for Dogecoin to surpass the $0.20 resistance level because market and Bitcoin price performance heavily influence its success. Dogecoin achieved significant price gains during its history but its dependence on public excitement and market moods creates uncertainty for its prolonged existence. Market participants keep their attention on Dogecoin because of its affordable starting value although they remain cautious about the price fluctuations. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) experiences rapid expansion during phase 4 of its 11-phase presale by trading at a price of $0.025. With the ongoing momentum in Mutuum Finance presale the platform has secured $7.3 million worth of investment from 9,200 participating stakeholders. Phase 5 of the presale introduces price hikes to $0.03 which will generate a 20% profit for existing phase 4 investors nearing full capacity. The tokenomics design of Mutuum Finance guarantees investors will profit by 140% during the $0.06 listing price while analysts predict the price should hit $2.50 for a total 9,900% return. Through its buy-and-distribute model Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself in DeFi while awarding substantial returns to its first members. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions as a decentralized lending platform whose operations support this platform. MtETH tokens grant users who deposit assets with ETH the opportunity to earn interest accrual through time. Users obtain funding through supplying assets which exceed collateral requirements for maintaining system safety. The revenue generated by Mutuum Finance buys tokens which are used to pay rewards to stakers thus sustaining continuous market purchase demand. Mutuum Finance recently introduced a platform display that presents the 50 most dominant token holders who will obtain additional rewards when they preserve their standing thus encouraging potential investors to compete. The team will reveal smart contract audit results from Certik at social channels to build trust among investors. Seizing Undervalued Opportunities The crypto market shows diverse potential through the tokens Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Speculators aim for Dogecoin due to its low valuation and price spikes but reaching the target price of $1.25 depends on market dynamics. The ongoing phase 4 presale of Mutuum Finance brings investors the opportunity to enter the DeFi space through a carefully calculated investment method that provides first launch returns of 140% followed by launch-value estimates reaching 9,900%. Investors need to hurry because the exclusive opportunity to purchase MUTM at $0.025 before phase 5 launches.

The Israeli trading platform had hit the brakes on its U.S. initial public offering (IPO) in April due to market chaos caused by Donald Trump’s new tariff policy. However, the trading and investment platform is ready to move forward with its plans, now that global macroeconomics and market conditions are improving. eToro Delays IPO Due to Market Uncertainty eToro wanted to go public in late March and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to start the process. Other big companies like JPMorgan, Binance, and Gemini are also planning to go public. However, President Trump announced new tariffs shortly after, which made the markets unstable, causing eToro to halt its plans. At the same time, other companies were also putting IPO plans on hold due to market worries. Now that the markets are calming down, and stocks like Robinhood have increased by more than 16% in the past month, eToro feels it is a better time to start its plans. The company says it may go public as soon as next week. eToro Sees Stronger Financial Results in 2024 Founded in 2007, eToro allows users to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies and copy the portfolios of successful investors. The company had planned to go public through a SPAC deal with a value of $10.4 billion, but that plan failed. This time, eToro’s business results are much better. In 2024, it earned $931 million in commissions and $192 million in profit. This is a big improvement from 2023, when it earned $639 million in commissions and only $15.3 million in profit. Details of the eToro’s IPO Offering and Overall Market Outlook eToro revealed that the IPO will be backed by major banks, including Goldman Sachs , Jefferies, UBS, and Citigroup. The investment platform plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ETOR.” The company aims to raise its valuation above the $3.5 billion it achieved in 2023 . This funding round was backed by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and ION Group. eToro recently agreed to pay the SEC a $1.5 million fine and limit some of its crypto services in the U.S. to settle charges for offering brokerage services without a license. eToro believes the improved overall crypto market is a good sign to proceed with its IPO plans. Bitcoin (BTC) ‘s market price is now almost $100,000, which has renewed investors’ interest. Many believe crypto rules will be more relaxed with President Trump in office.

Polkadot (DOT) shows a cautious setup, facing repeated rejection near the $4.50 mark, which keeps many watchers uncertain. TRON hasn’t brought much movement either, staying locked around $0.25 for several months, with slow accumulation and no clear direction emerging. This trend echoes across several charts, where momentum tends to weaken just when it’s most needed. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out, offering a rare price of $0.0019 and a possible 2,531% gain for those entering now. While other projects hesitate, this leading decentralized platform is gaining traction as it gears up to reveal a major update tied to 10 planned exchange listings. With $222.5 million already raised, its next step appears just around the corner. Polkadot Price Remains Stuck Under $4.50 Polkadot (DOT) has had difficulty breaking through the $4.50 resistance level over the past several weeks. Following a brief uptick earlier in the month, DOT retraced to $4.09, struggling to regain upward momentum. Current market data shows DOT hovering around $4.25, with little trading volume to drive price action further. Analysts note a lack of strong catalysts or developments within the Polkadot ecosystem that could shift market sentiment in the short term. Despite its robust interoperability framework, DOT is failing to spark significant interest from the broader crypto community at present. Unless there is a major shift in development activity or partnership news, Polkadot may continue to trend sideways, constrained by persistent sell pressure just above the $4.50 mark. TRON Price Holds Steady Near $0.25 TRON (TRX) has remained in a tight price range near the $0.25 level for the past few months. Despite moments of accumulation and brief upward movement, TRX has not been able to decisively break out. The token faces continued resistance near its current levels, while the absence of large-scale updates or ecosystem shifts limits the potential for significant upward movement. Although TRON maintains a solid presence through its stablecoin infrastructure and DeFi integrations, traders appear to be waiting for a more definitive signal. The price continues to be capped by a nearby supply zone, leading to sideways action as market participants remain cautious. Without new growth triggers, TRON is likely to continue trading flat in the near term. BlockDAG Gears Up for Exchange Listings BlockDAG has officially hinted at a significant update tied to its upcoming exchange listing announcement, marking a major milestone on its path toward market entry. Speculation is swirling that this update will unveil details about 10 centralized exchange listings, expected to take place in the near future. This announcement marks the closing stages before BDAG hits public trading. All signs suggest that BlockDAG is fully prepared for this next chapter. With expectations mounting around these exchange confirmations, buyer activity is rising sharply. Currently, the coin is available for a limited time at a special price of $0.0019, down from its earlier $0.0248. This offer ends on May 13. The upcoming Batch 28 will be priced at $0.0262. This pricing tier offers a remarkable 2,520% return for those stepping in now, as BDAG prepares to launch on exchanges at $0.05. Such a return is uncommon, especially for a leading decentralized project that has already secured over $224 million in funding, moved over 19.6 billion BDAG coins, and generated over $6.9 million in miner sales, with a total of 17,232 miners sold. Interest in BlockDAG continues to grow. Rather than fading, this final stage is pulling in new attention as buyers start to realize what lies ahead. The exchange announcement is expected to narrow the gap between presale access and market trading, setting BlockDAG on a fast track toward broader adoption. Few projects earn recognition as standout crypto leaders before entering open markets, yet BlockDAG has managed to do exactly that. The $0.0019 price is scheduled to end on May 13, and with that, the opportunity to be early will close. From there, BlockDAG moves into its defining role as a next-gen decentralized platform. Market Outlook: BlockDAG Outpaces DOT and TRX While Polkadot and TRON continue their sideways movement, BlockDAG is setting a different pace. Its sharp rise in presale earnings and miner adoption signals broader traction across retail buyers and Web3 users. Unlike DOT and TRX, which are bound by resistance zones and limited news, BlockDAG is actively rolling out features, expanding its ecosystem, and preparing for major exchange launches. This divergence in activity is creating a shift in sentiment. For now, BlockDAG stands out as the project with the most immediate potential for movement, both in price and platform utility.

Bitcoin is a matter of national security — Deputy CIA director The US Central Intelligence Agency is increasingly incorporating Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a tool in its operations, and working with the cryptocurrency is a matter of national security, Michael Ellis, the agency’s deputy director, told podcast host Anthony Pompliano. In an appearance on the market analyst and investor’s show, Ellis told Pompliano that the intelligence agency works with law enforcement to track BTC , and it is a point of data collection in counter-intelligence operations . Ellis added: ""Bitcoin is here to stay — cryptocurrency is here to stay. As you know, more and more institutions are adopting it, and I think that is a great trend. One that this administration has obviously been leaning forward into."" ""It's another area of competition where we need to ensure the United States is well-positioned against China and other adversaries,"" Ellis said. Although Ellis's comments point to Bitcoin maturing as an asset, they also reflect the increased involvement of governments and institutions in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This increased involvement runs contrary to the libertarian and cypherpunk ethos originally inherent in crypto. European Union to ban anonymous crypto and privacy tokens by 2027 The European Union is set to impose sweeping AML rules that will ban privacy-preserving tokens and anonymous cryptocurrency accounts from 2027. Under the new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), credit institutions, financial institutions and crypto asset service providers (CASPs) will be prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts or handling privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, such as Monero ( XMR ) and Zcash ( ZEC ). “Article 79 of the AMLR establishes strict prohibitions on anonymous accounts [...]. Credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto-asset service providers are prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts,” according to the AML Handbook, published by European Crypto Initiative (EUCI). The AML Handbook. Source: EUCI The regulation is part of a broader AML framework that includes bank and payment accounts, passbooks and safe-deposit boxes, “crypto-asset accounts allowing anonymisation of transactions,” and “accounts using anonymity-enhancing coins.” US wants to cut off Huione over crypto crime The US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on May 1 proposed blocking the Cambodia-based Huione Group from the US banking system, accusing it of helping North Korea’s state-backed Lazarus Group to launder crypto. Huione Group comprises a network of businesses, which includes payment service platform Huione Pay PLC, the crypto exchange Huione Crypto, and Haowang Guarantee, an online marketplace offering illicit goods and services. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the conglomerate established itself as the “marketplace of choice for malicious cyber actors” like the Lazarus Group, who have “stolen billions of dollars from everyday Americans.” Source: Chainalysis FinCEN said Huione laundered at least $4 billion worth of illicit proceeds between August 2021 and January 2025, including over $36 million from crypto pig butchering scams and $37 million worth of crypto for North Korea. It has also created a US dollar-pegged stablecoin, the US Dollar Huione (USDH), which FinCEN said cannot be frozen and helps to carry out money laundering activities.

According to a new report by CNBC, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer is looking to launch a new crypto asset pegged to the US dollar by the end of the year as its chief executive continues to influence national crypto policies. News of the new stablecoins was confirmed by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino in an interview with CNBC. According to Ardoino, Tether – which is headquartered in El Salvador – is attempting to rebrand itself as being cooperative with law enforcement, as it was previously known as the “go-to” crypto for criminal activity. The report says that Ardoino may have helped shape key legislation, such as the GENIUS Act – a bill that aims to give clear guidelines for stablecoins – and added provisions for Tether to help law enforcement. As stated by Ardoino, according to CNBC, “There is no company… even in the traditional financial system, that has such a breadth of collaboration with law enforcement. We are always trying to do better and more to block criminal activity… we have much better tools than the traditional financial system and we’re proving that every day.” The CEO goes on to address Tether’s reserve assets, a point of contention for the firm in the past, as it agreed to pay $18.5 million to New York in 2021 after it was alleged that it lied about its reserves. “We are very close to having $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries in our reserves. We have $7 billion in excess equity within the company’s capital. That is really unprecedented and I wish financial institutions in the traditional financial system would at least try to copy us to provide better products for their consumers.” Tether, which now regularly publishes attestation statements, holds about $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries managed by the financial giant Cantor Fitzgerald, according to its latest report.

Lummis further alleged that large-scale adoption of Bitcoin would be “transformative” and put “the everyday worker all over the world in control of their money.” “As Bitcoin comes into more usage, its use makes the whole system more secure, more robust, and more capable of serving our needs all over the world,” she added. “We should be the global leader with this fantastic, new ledger-based asset that is in a digital format.” The U.S. Head Towards A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proponents of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve widely believe that it would position the U.S. as a technologically forward-looking global power while acting as a hedge against traditional financial concerns. Trump largely campaigned on enacting a crypto-friendly regulatory framework , promising to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” In March, Trump signed an executive order mandating the development of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and digital asset stockpile. “I am very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry,” he said. “Our country must be the leader in the field.” As of Friday afternoon, Bitcoin continued to experience a slight surge in value, hovering around $97,000.

According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23 , roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token. “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News. Despite Lummis’ reported “pause” over the president’s actions, on May 2, she posted a video to X of herself speaking on the Senate floor, saying she was “particularly pleased” by Trump’s support of legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve in the United States. The Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide, or BITCOIN, Act would seemingly codify Trump’s executive order to create a national crypto reserve. Related: House Democrats want ethics probe on Trump over crypto projects The launch of the TRUMP coin on Jan. 17 was met with outrage from many lawmakers and figures in the crypto industry, who pointed to potential conflicts of interest and implications of allowing foreign actors to channel funds directly to Trump. The criticism continued after Trump announced that a group of the top memecoin holders would have the opportunity to apply for a White House tour and dinner. “Trump once claimed he is so rich he cannot be bought,” said Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen. “But his obsession with money means he apparently can be bought for a meme.” Calls for impeachment over ties to crypto Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, called for Trump’s impeachment during an April 25 town hall, claiming the memecoin dinner represented “selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him.” During his first term, Trump was impeached twice in the House of Representatives but acquitted after the Senate votes fell short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction. At the time of publication, it was unclear who, if any, of the memecoin holders would attend the May 22 dinner with Trump. Usernames from the TRUMP leaderboard have led to speculation that staunch supporters like Tron founder Justin Sun and Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be among the attendees. As of May 2, neither the individuals nor the companies have made any formal announcements.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low. Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators. This price action has occurred alongside significant net inflows into US spot exchange-traded Bitcoin funds (ETFs). Some of the disappointment among traders can be attributed to the ongoing global tariff dispute , which is beginning to affect macroeconomic data. Bitcoin traders are concerned that, despite growing interest from institutional investors, fears of an economic recession could limit price performance. This concern reduces the likelihood of BTC reaching $110,000 or higher in 2025. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch The annualized premium for Bitcoin’s two-month futures has remained between 6% and 7% over the past week, staying within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. Compared to January, when Bitcoin was trading near $95,000 and the futures premium was above 10%, traders’ sentiment has weakened. This data suggests there is less optimism, or at least less conviction, in further price gains toward $100,000 and above. Gold’s performance outshone Bitcoin’s modest gains Some market participants point to gold’s 20% rally, from $2,680 to $3,220, as a source of concern. Although Bitcoin recently surpassed silver’s $1.8 trillion market capitalization to become the seventh largest global tradable asset, gold’s surge to a massive $21.7 trillion valuation has overshadowed this achievement. Investors worry that Bitcoin’s strong correlation with the stock market has diminished the appeal of its “digital gold” narrative. Bitcoin spot US-listed ETFs daily net flows, USD. Source: CoinGlass There is also a possibility that the $3.6 billion in net inflows to US spot ETFs over the past two weeks are being driven by delta-neutral strategies. In this scenario, the flows reflect Bitcoin holders moving to listed products or using derivatives for hedging. If so, the direct impact on price would be limited, which is consistent with Bitcoin’s modest 5% gain during this period. To determine whether professional traders are comfortable with Bitcoin around $97,500, it is helpful to examine the BTC options market. Bitcoin 1-month options 25% delta skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.ch The BTC options 25% delta skew metric is currently near its lowest level since Feb. 15, indicating that whales and market makers are assigning higher odds to further upside from here. This marks a sharp reversal from three weeks ago, when put (sell) options traded at a premium. Related: Bitcoin unsure as recession looms, US-China tariff talks kick off Bitcoin derivatives’ resilience favors further BTC price gains Overall, Bitcoin derivatives indicate moderate optimism. Traders generally expect further price gains, but bulls are refraining from using leverage. Some might argue that this creates the ideal conditions for a surprise rally, especially since the retest of $74,500 on April 9 did not significantly affect BTC derivatives. The most important factor influencing Bitcoin’s performance remains the commercial relationship between the US and China. As long as the trade war continues, Bitcoin is likely to continue tracking the S&P 500 movements. While this environment may prevent Bitcoin from reaching a new all-time high in the near term, BTC derivatives are currently leaning slightly in favor of the bulls.

After jumping by over 15% in the past two weeks and stabilizing firmly above $94,000, most analysts, including Crypto Caesar , believe Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to hit new all-time highs. Despite these projections, investors are more focused on altcoins that are likely to take advantage of Bitcoin’s rebound in May. Among the top picks, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out particularly due to its unique positioning as a presale AI altcoin that has raised over $2 million in just a few weeks. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Ranks As The Best Altcoin Play As Bitcoin (BTC) Rebounds Higher In anticipation of Bitcoin’s (BTC) steady ascent to $100,000, savvy investors are continually stocking up on the FloppyPepe (FPPE) token, and it’s not surprising. This new Matt Furie-inspired meme coin boasts even greater potential than the Pepe coin, poised to potentially dominate the AI crypto market upon its launch. Riding the coattails of AI technology, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has been able to blend humor with advanced tech, allowing holders to earn with its in-house utilities like its Meme-o-Matic and Floppy X . With both components supporting the creation of memes and video contents for sale, this SolidProof-approved altcoin sold out its private presale round in less than a day, raising nearly $1 million. Why FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Path To Mainstream Explosion Is Inevitable Thanks to a glowing review by popular YouTuber Nass Crypto, who described it as an AI altcoin gem with massive upside potential, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is already capturing significant attention. However, here are a few more reasons why this altcoin is bound for inevitable success: Real-Time Reaction to News & Trends: FloppyX bots instantly react to breaking events (crypto, sports, memes), guaranteeing hyper-relevant, viral content that drives engagement and visibility. Passive Income Through Holder Rewards (1% Redistribution): Investors earn simply by holding, which fosters long-term loyalty and encourages them to hold rather than sell. NFT & Staking Ecosystem Integration: Floppy-themed NFTs and staking options improve the ecosystem by adding utility, gamification, and additional income streams. Whale Accumulation Hints At Possible Breakout For Pi Network (PI) While the Pi Network’s (PI) recent pump was short-lived, optimism is peaking, as CoinGecko indicates a whopping 88% of bullish votes from 3.9 million users. For the record, Pi Network (PI) has experienced a 19% decline in trading volume, accompanied by a 15% month-long price decrease. Despite the current slump, Pi Network (PI) has seen a major vote of confidence, with the top Pi wallet recently accumulating over 50 million PI tokens. This significant whale activity signals strong trust and renewed optimism for Pi Network’s (PI) long-term potential. Now trading in a week-to-date range of $0.5741 to $0.6699, investors are closely watching Pi Network (PI), especially as Bitcoin (BTC) is turning the tide positively. Movement (MOVE) Price Volatility Demands Caution Since Movement Labs launched its beta mainnet and the Movement (MOVE) token in December 2024, which reached an all-time high (ATH) of $1.45, speculation has been brewing about its possible comeback. This speculation is driven by Movement’s (MOVE) inventive MoveVM technology and its ability to deliver high-speed transactions as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Despite ongoing losses, Movement’s (MOVE) DeFi Spring initiative —supported by a 250 million Movement (MOVE) token incentive—is setting the stage for a potential bullish reversal. Moreso, as Bitcoin (BTC) slowly gains, Movement (MOVE) could benefit from this positivity. Make The Smart Move Now! Stocking up on the FloppyPepe (FPPE) token while Bitcoin (BTC) is slowly pacing up could be the best crypto move this year. Although Pi Network (PI) and Movement (MOVE) also show potential, this new altcoin holds more intrinsic value. Aside from its inherent potential for widespread adoption and growth due to its 1% burn rate deflationary tokenomics and wildlife conservation efforts, which appeal to socially conscious investors, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is currently offering an 80% discount. So, hurry up and buy the token using the code FLOPPY80 !

This recent price action is particularly significant as it marks a clean breakout above a key on-chain resistance zone stretching from $93,000 to $95,000, which many analysts believe could determine whether Bitcoin’s next leg takes it into six-figure territory. Supporting this momentum is a long-term technical outlook by renowned trader Peter Brandt, who projected that Bitcoin remains on course to set new all-time highs, with a potential price peak exceeding $150,000 on his projected timeline. Peter Brandt Maps Timeline For $150,000 Bitcoin Top With Parabolic Structure Veteran trader Peter Brandt shared a weekly candlestick Bitcoin price chart on social media, highlighting a path toward $150,000 by late summer 2025. According to Brandt’s post on social media platform X, Bitcoin is currently trading below a parabolic trendline that is key to the final leg of the current bull cycle. Interestingly, this parabolic trendline has served as an upper resistance for Bitcoin’s price peaks and all-time highs since 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: The Last Leg-Up That Confirms A Resounding Rally To $150,000 Brandt’s chart captures a variety of classical technical formations, including multiple head and shoulders patterns, expanding triangles, and consolidation wedges. The breakout from the recent wedge pattern serves as his basis for suggesting that the bull market is structurally intact. According to his projection, the parabolic slope that Bitcoin needs to overcome currently sits around the $120,000 mark. A decisive breakout above this threshold would set the stage for a run-up to a cycle top. Brand noted that this cycle top would be between $125,000 and $150,000, and the timeline is by August or September 2025. On-Chain Indicators Reveal Pressure Points Around $93,000 To $95,000 On-chain data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shows that Bitcoin is currently testing the convergence of two critical resistance points: the 111-day simple moving average, which now sits at $91,300, and the short-term holder cost basis, which sits at $93,200. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Analyst Peter Brandt Says BTC Still Bearish Unless This Happens Notably, Bitcoin’s price structure has confirmed a higher high relative to a high of $94,000 in early May, effectively breaking the downtrend from early April. This suggests that the market may be shifting into a more aggressive accumulation phase. However, this region also represents a significant cluster of previously bought coins, meaning investors underwater during earlier pullbacks now find themselves near break-even. This could cause increased sell-side pressure if some traders take profit or exit at breakeven. Meanwhile, long-term holders continue to exhibit strong HOLDling behavior, with realized profits exceeding 350% for many. In fact, over 254,000 BTC have crossed the 155-day threshold since Bitcoin’s recent local bottom, indicating that a significant portion of the supply is maturing into long-term holdings. Many of these coins were acquired at prices above $95,000. Although current momentum clearly favours the bulls, the $93,000 to $95,000 range is a major battleground that could define Bitcoin’s trajectory in the months ahead of reaching Peter Brandt’s target of $150,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,635.

Lummis called for a pause on the offer as it raises ethical and legal complications. Trump is once again in the middle of controversy following his decision to host a dinner and tour for his top investors. On April 23, 2025, the organization behind the $TRUMP meme coin announced an exclusive dinner event at Trump’s National Golf Club. The top 220 holders of the $TRUMP meme coin were invited to have dinner with the President between April 23 and May 12. The top 25 holders of the coin would receive additional perks including a VIP reception and a special tour. The tour was originally tagged as a “White House Tour,” but that was later removed. Senator Cynthia Lummis urges moderation Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming is a pro-crypto legislator and a supporter of President Trump, and even she has expressed concerns about the ethical implications of the memecoin dinner offer. “This is my president that we’re talking about, but I am willing to say that this gives me pause,” she said . The memecoin dinner is even more controversial once the involvement of foreign entities in purchasing the $TRUMP coin is considered. The dinner could potentially violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits government officials from accepting payments or gifts from foreign entities without congressional approval. Lummis said Wednesday in an interview that she believes Congress needs to regulate standards around the use of digital assets like meme coins. She has stated that she’s open to working with her colleagues to create clear regulations around digital assets for elected officials, including the president. “This is the Wild West, and so when I hear things like this, my reaction is, we need to legislate so there are rules,” Lummis said. “Even what may appear to be ‘cringey’ with regard to meme coins, it’s legal, and what we need to do is have a regulatory framework that makes this more clear, so we don’t have this Wild West scenario,” she added. While a few Senate Republicans questioned the ethics around Trump’s dinner for his top investors, most of the party’s members, like Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota, stated that they were confident that the president would work within the boundaries of the law. Other GOP senators said they hadn’t heard about the president’s plan. The dinner invitation is controversial After the dinner announcement, the TRUMP memecoin experienced a surge in value and recorded an over 50% price increase and a $100 million value boost in related wallets. The $TRUMP meme coin’s total market cap increased to an impressive $2.7B. Despite the immediate benefits for Trump, the dinner invitation was met with criticism from various quarters. A number of lawmakers view the dinner as a potential conflict of interest and a messy fusion of politics with personal business. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, expressed her displeasure about the event, though she noted she didn’t have all of the details. “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” Murkowski told NBC News. The event is unpopular with other Senate Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, and Adam Schiff of California, who even requested an ethics investigation into the dinner. “This latest action raises grave ethics and legal concerns, including the severe risk that President Trump and other officials may be engaging in ‘pay to play’ corruption by selling presidential access to individuals or entities, to include foreign nationals and corporate actors with vested interests in federal action, while personally enriching the President and his family,” the senators wrote in their letter. Sen. Jon Ossoff, took the criticism further, mentioning impeaching Trump over the meme coin dinner. Sen. Cory Booker stated that the meme coin sale is a “violation of the Constitution.” “Before you can even get to the point of discussing impeachment,” he said, “can we even get the United States Congress to step forward in saying this is wrong and we should investigate?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

However, they have limited intent or expertise for any sophisticated obfuscation of their financial trails. One of the biggest reasons criminal groups have resorted to using crypto is that it enables rapid, borderless payments, allowing their networks to move funds globally without the delays or risk linked to traditional banking systems. Why criminal groups are really using crypto Mexican cartels are one of the criminal groups out there increasingly taking advantage of crypto’s advantages. They have been observed using crypto to pay Chinese suppliers for fentanyl precursors, capitalizing on low transaction fees and instant transfers. Every single action not deliberately obfuscated on the blockchain is transparent and verifiable. Source: Chainalysis Many of these criminals operate on the common belief that crypto facilitates untraceable financial anonymity. It is actually a misconception, as every single action, not deliberately obfuscated, that happens on the blockchain is available to anyone with the know-how to see. Ironically, that misconception has been driving adoption, particularly among groups like cartels and wildlife traffickers who often reportedly use it without advanced privacy tools. The fact that so many of these bad actors have been using crypto in recent times proves that they are using it more because it is unrestricted by borders and simplifies financial operations for illicit activities, rather than because they think it grants anonymity. According to the report , this is why organized crime that capitalizes on crypto is often not sophisticated. Compared to state-backed cyber criminals like North Korean hackers who utilize advanced obfuscation methods like mixers or privacy coins e.g Monero, traditional organized crime groups just go about their business without covering their tracks. These criminals would often use regulated exchanges for cash-outs, an act that exposes their funds to KYC-compliant platforms. Good examples are cartel-linked launderers who move fentanyl proceeds through CEX accounts, leaving clear on-chain trails. It has also been observed that most groups stick to widely available cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or stablecoins, choosing to avoid privacy coins because of how complex they make things or limited liquidity. The major focus is always on scaling operations rather than evading detection because crypto’s borderless nature allows them to reach their global customer bases. It is actually good news for law enforcement The brazen use of crypto by organized crime groups for nefarious purposes, because they don’t try hard to hide, creates various opportunities for law enforcement. As earlier stated, virtually every action that happens on the blockchain can be traced because it acts like an immutable ledger. This means that investigators can trace transactions in real-time and map the criminal networks across borders, something that would have been almost impossible to do with traditional banking. The fact that criminals also rely on CEXs, which comply with KYC/AML regulations, can also help authorities identify and freeze assets as well as gather off-chain intelligence. A good example of this was when the Ledger co-founder was kidnapped and investigators were able to trace nearly all ransom funds and seize them. Unfortunately, while the blockchain offers avenues to track transactions, law enforcement faces challenges because of their limited blockchain expertise, as crypto is yet to go mainstream. While training can help more officers identify case overlaps, broader adoption is needed to properly capitalize on the transparency crypto offers. Mastering blockchain analysis will also encourage and aid proactive tracking, which will allow law enforcement to disrupt criminal networks before their crimes escalate. It is crucial this happens fast because criminals may eventually start employing more sophisticated techniques before crackdown efforts become coordinated enough.

The anticipated approval of spot Litecoin ETFs in the United States has sparked a sharp uptick in demand by institutional investors. The rise of Bitcoin (BTC) price above $95.5k in the past two days, has sparked a surge in altcoin speculation, led by Litecoin (LTC). The demand for risky crypto assets has helped LTC price signal bullish sentiment, in the near future, especially after consolidating in the past few years. According to the latest market data, LTC price surged over 14 percent in the last two weeks to trade about $87.38 on Friday, during the late North American session. Midterm Expectations for LTC Price In the weekly timeframe, LTC price has respected a rising logarithmic trend established in the past six years. Following the recent rebound, LTC price is well positioned to retest its all-time high above $359 in the near term. For leveraged crypto traders, placing a stop loss slightly below $62 and a midterm target of about $359 will present a loss-to-win ratio of 0.42 to 2.9. The midterm bullish sentiment for LTC price is bolstered by the fact that the altcoin has formed higher high and higher low since late 2022 to date. Fundamental Outlook for Litecoin Network The Litecoin network has experienced significant growth in the past few years, catalyzed by the rising demand from institutional investors. Several fund managers – led by CoinShares, Grayscale, and Canary Capital – are seeking to offer spot LTC ETFs in the United States, in the near future. As a result, the volume of larger transactions than $100k on the Litecoin network surged by $52.33 billion in the past seven days.

The research noted that there could be an 8.3x increase from the current stablecoin market cap of $234 billion in April 2025 to about $2 trillion by 2028. “Evolving market dynamics have the potential to accelerate stablecoins’ trajectory to reach $2 trillion in market cap by 2028.” Big Predictions for Future Growth This projection assumes the passage of the GENIUS Act in the US, which would establish clear regulatory guidelines and drive market confidence and adoption. The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) defines “payment stablecoins” as digital assets redeemable at a fixed value, pegged to fiat, but non-yield-bearing. It also sets out reserve rules for stablecoin issuers. In early April 2, the US House Financial Services Committee passed the STABLE Act , which gives the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) the authority to approve and supervise “federally qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers.” Stablecoin reserve requirements could also drive large demand for short-dated U.S. Treasuries, it stated. Projections suggest stablecoin issuers could hold around $1 trillion in T-bills by 2028 if growth hits expectations. The Treasury also predicted that stablecoin transactions could rise from around $700 billion per month today to around $6 trillion per month by 2028, which is roughly 10% of global forex spot transactions. If regulatory clarity is achieved, stablecoins could become a mainstream financial instrument not just for crypto users, but for traditional finance, corporate treasury, and even sovereign liquidity management. Potential drivers of stablecoin growth. Source: US Treasury Dept For users in emerging markets, stablecoins provide direct access to US dollars without needing a US bank account, strengthening the currency’s global role, the report noted. Stablecoin Ecosystem Outlook The current stablecoin market capitalization is $244.5 billion, which represents around 8% of the total crypto market cap, which is just over $3 trillion, according to Coingecko. The lion’s share of the stablecoin market is currently dominated by Tether, which has a 61% share with $149 billion USDT in circulation. Circle is second with $61 billion in USDC circulation, giving it a 25% market share, and decentralized USDS (formerly DAI) is third with 3% of the stablecoin market. PayPal has seen significant growth for its PYUSD stablecoin this year. However, it has less than 0.36% market share.

With prices of Bitcoin still on the rise, the firm continues to make strategic buys of the digital currency. According to reports, Strategy has changed its business tactics in the last five years. What began as a business intelligence activity is now most famously associated with enormous Bitcoin holdings. The latest performance of the company indicates this strategy continues to work in 2025. $MSTR announces BTC Yield of 13.7% and BTC $ Gain of $5.8B year-to-date, doubles capital plan to $42B equity and $42B fixed income to purchase bitcoin, and increases BTC Yield target from 15% to 25% and BTC $ Gain target from $10B to $15B for 2025. https://t.co/LgeMEd6Dr5 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 1, 2025 Investment Plan Doubles To $84 Billion Strategy said that it will now invest $84 billion in purchasing additional Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg. The company’s move is to invest half the funds ($42 billion) in fixed income and the remaining half ($42 billion) in fixed equity. This significant capital outlay indicates Strategy still has faith in the long-term worth of Bitcoin. The company considers Bitcoin a key component to its business model and a fundamental asset for its treasury holdings. The scale of this investment is a staggering increase on past expenditure. If implemented, it would leave Strategy an even more prominent corporate owner of Bitcoin than it is currently. Performance Targets Leap From 15% To 25% Strategy has increased its Bitcoin performance targets for the next year. The firm has been targeting a 15% return on its Bitcoin holdings but now anticipates 25%. Concurrently, the company raised its target for dollar gains from Bitcoin in 2025. The objective rose from $10 billion to $15 billion, implying Strategy anticipates the price and value of Bitcoin to appreciate considerably during the course of the year. Stock Price Surges More Than 3,000% Since 2020 Strategy’s stock price has risen dramatically since the company initially acquired Bitcoin five years ago.

Coinbase didn’t articulate a specific reason for the delisting , but the decision materialized a few weeks after Movement became embroiled in a controversy on another top crypto exchange. In late March, Binance banned and froze the assets of a market maker that operated for Movement. The layer-2 project’s native token launched via Binance’s Airdrops Portal in December, but Binance said that after MOVE was listed, the unnamed market maker sold approximately 66 million MOVE tokens on December 10th, with few buy orders. The market maker ended up netting a profit of $38 million worth of the stablecoin USDT before being offboarded last week. Movement uses Move, a programming language originally built by a consortium backed by tech giant Meta for the now-defunct Diem project. The language was then used to develop layer-1 blockchains Sui ( SUI ) and Aptos ( APT ). The MOVE token hit an all-time low of $0.185 at one point on Thursday. The 160th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $0.189 at time of writing and is down more than 23% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum (ETH) shows early signs of recovery after recent selling pressure, while XRP appears to be moving in line with broader Bitcoin trends. With several altcoins holding higher support levels, the market looks ready for fresh rallies in the coming weeks. As legacy assets like ETH and XRP attract renewed interest, early-stage projects with real innovation are also gaining traction. BlockDAG (BDAG) , in particular, is emerging as a top contender. Backed by a powerful tech stack and strong community support, BlockDAG has now raised over $224 million in its ongoing presale. Its unique architecture and consistent momentum are positioning it as one of the most promising breakout cryptos in today’s market. Ethereum (ETH) Targets $3500 as Bulls Regain Ground Ethereum (ETH) is facing tough resistance, but buyers are stepping back in after a period of selling pressure. While short-term volatility remains, analysts still expect a move toward $3500 if Ethereum can hold above key moving averages. The recent dip came from market-wide uncertainty and profit-taking following earlier gains. Now, technical signs are starting to shift. Momentum is showing signs of stabilizing, and buyers are gradually returning. Ethereum’s strong position in DeFi and NFTs continues to build long-term trust. As breakout trends develop, Ethereum’s path to $3500 could act as a major signal of strength across the altcoin market. XRP Prepares for 8% Upswing XRP is showing signs of a potential 8% move upward, closely tracking Bitcoin’s recent recovery trend. Analysts note that XRP often mirrors Bitcoin during bounce-back periods, and current charts suggest that history could repeat itself. Support levels have stayed firm, and rising trading volumes hint at growing bullish momentum. While long-term concerns around XRP’s legal status remain in play, short-term traders are focusing on technical signals. If Bitcoin continues its upward path, XRP could follow with a similar lift. For buyers looking for quick breakout plays, XRP is shaping up to be a strong candidate with calculated upside potential. BlockDAG Is Not Just Rising: It’s Leading the Future of Crypto BlockDAG is quickly becoming a standout project in the crypto space, offering real solutions to long-standing scalability problems. Unlike traditional blockchains that validate transactions one at a time, BlockDAG uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to process many transactions in parallel. This results in faster speeds and higher capacity, without compromising on decentralization. As more industries look for scalable solutions in payments, gaming, and DeFi, BlockDAG’s setup is proving to be well-timed and highly relevant. Its ongoing presale success is adding serious weight to its momentum. BlockDAG has now raised over $224 million in Batch 28, with the BDAG coin priced at just $0.0262. However, BDAG is offering a special price of $0.0019 till May 13th and is gaining viral traction. Since the start of batch 1, BDAG has seen a massive 2520% surge, and over 19.5 billion coins have already been sold. Adding to the buzz, miner sales have crossed $6.9 million, with 17,232 miners sold. Strategic tools like the “Buyer Battles” feature are also helping BlockDAG grow a strong and competitive early community. Looking ahead, BlockDAG isn’t just relying on a strong presale. The team has ambitious post-launch plans, including listings on 10 major centralized exchanges after the mainnet launches in 2025. A partnership with HackerEarth aims to bring in over 10,000 developers, expanding the ecosystem with fresh ideas and real-world use cases. By focusing on real scalability, rewarding early users, and growing a developer-friendly environment, BlockDAG is positioning itself as more than just a trending crypto. It’s building the foundation needed to power the next wave of blockchain adoption. For those seeking early access to a project with clear utility and strong momentum, BlockDAG is becoming top crypto presale that’s hard to ignore. Final Thoughts Ethereum (ETH) remains on track for a potential push toward $3500, with market bulls slowly regaining control after recent sideways movement. XRP is also showing promise, with analysts projecting an 8% rebound closely linked to Bitcoin’s momentum across the altcoin space. Meanwhile, BlockDAG continues to stand out. With its powerful scalability model and an impressive $224 million raised in presale, it is emerging as a serious contender in the breakout crypto space. As more buyers look beyond legacy coins for high-upside opportunities, BlockDAG’s growth story becomes harder to ignore. Its strong fundamentals and surging community interest suggest it may not just be the next big crypto, it could be the one to lead the next market cycle.

It is about how that asset performs. As buyers hunt for projects with real utility, XRP and Pepe coin both grab headlines through ETF advances and community-driven momentum. XRP builds strength with institutional backing and legal wins, while Pepe coin thrives on meme culture and viral support. Yet Unstaked’s $UNSD offers something different and tangible. Through its presale, it brings AI agents that act on behalf of users in real-time, delivering measurable on-chain results. If you are searching for the best crypto for 2025, Unstaked ’s functional, working utility makes it hard to ignore. XRP Price Prediction: ETF Tailwinds Offer Hope XRP’s recent fall to $2.07 reflects broader market stress, yet a 15% weekly gain keeps optimism alive. A wave of exchange inflows, topping 55 million XRP, signals mounting sell pressure, leading to more than $5.1 million in liquidations within a day. Even with this pressure, XRP’s deep liquidity remains a key strength, especially as U.S. spot crypto ETF conversations heat up. Teucrium’s new leveraged XRP ETF and Grayscale’s pending application, facing a May 22 SEC decision, add excitement to XRP’s outlook. A pending settlement with the SEC could speed up ETF approvals. Technically, XRP is holding above $2.00 with backup support at $1.95 and $1.64. Resistance levels sit at $2.24 and $2.38. While short-term dips remain possible, ETF momentum and legal clarity keep the XRP price prediction positive for 2025. Inside Pepe Coin’s Growing Ecosystem Pepe coin is building more than just a meme-driven hype machine. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, it uses a deflationary model that cuts supply with every transaction, creating more scarcity. A rewards system returns transaction fees to holders, making long-term ownership more appealing. Plus, it does all this without applying extra transaction taxes, keeping it simple to use. What really drives Pepe coin’s success is its strong tie to internet culture. Rooted in the famous Pepe the Frog meme, the project built a lively community across X, Telegram, and Reddit. Projects like the Pepe Academy and merchandise lines also boost community loyalty. On the technical side, its Ethereum base gives it easy access to apps, wallets, and DeFi tools. Together, the Pepe coin ecosystem shows how culture and blockchain can blend to create something unique in the digital space. $UNSD Presale Sparks Rush: Unlock Monetized AI Ownership Now Unstaked is changing what digital ownership means. With $UNSD now available in presale stage 2 for just $0.006695, early buyers are not just getting a token. They are unlocking the chance to deploy real AI agents across X and Telegram. These are not basic bots. Each AI agent works on its own, posting, engaging users, adapting in real time, and building communities 24/7 while linking all its work directly to the owner on-chain. The massive potential on offer with the network has been on display with the presale seeing more than a million in inflows in just a matter of days. More than that, these AI agents are built to earn. Owners collect $UNSD rewards based on their agent’s actual performance, thanks to the on-chain “Proof of Intelligence” system. As agents get better, their owners can earn even more. With no middlemen and full transparency, $UNSD holders are part of a growing ecosystem focused on results, not promises. At launch, $UNSD is set to reach around $0.1819, meaning the current presale price could deliver major returns. Unlike many early-stage projects that promise future plans, Unstaked gives buyers working AI agents, instant rewards, and community governance from the start. This unique blend of utility, rewards based on output, and full AI ownership puts $UNSD on the map as a top choice among the best cryptos for 2025. For traders ready to move beyond hype and into real earning systems, Unstaked offers a rare early entry into an AI-driven digital economy where users control the future. Real Utility Is the New Standard Speculation can catch attention, but real, lasting value comes from true utility and empowering users. XRP’s legal wins and ETF hopes open new doors for institutions, while Pepe Coin rides strong on meme energy and a loyal online community. Still, Unstaked stands apart by giving users active control. Instead of waiting for charts to move, $UNSD holders deploy AI agents that create on-chain value from day one. As traders hunt for the best crypto for 2025 , the ability to own and operate real digital assets may become the real difference. In the next wave, the projects that offer action over waiting will lead, and Unstaked is already delivering the tools to make that happen.

New York’s Governor and state lawmakers say they’ve agreed on a budget framework that includes $2 billion for inflation refund checks to over eight million taxpayers. The plan targets New Yorkers who filed taxes, are not claimed as dependents and earn below $150,000 annually. Eligible joint filers earning up to $150,000 will receive $400, while those earning between $150,000 and $300,000 will get $300. Single filers and heads of household earning up to $75,000 will receive $200, and those earning between $75,000 and $150,000 will get $150. No application is needed and checks will be issued automatically using recent tax filings once the budget is passed and signed into law in about a week from today. New York’s Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul says the rebates as a response to inflation-driven costs, reports News10 ABC. “I can’t stop inflation, but everyone across the state paid more because inflation drove up prices.” But the program has its critics. Democratic Assemblymember Phil Steck says such programs are gimmicks, arguing for long-term tax relief or other spending priorities.

The breakout signals renewed strength from bulls, who have regained control following weeks of tight consolidation. However, while this move confirms bullish momentum in the short term, the critical level to reclaim remains the psychological $100,000 threshold. A decisive push above $100K could unlock a wave of market-wide upside and potentially trigger a new phase of the bull cycle. Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, noting that BTC has officially broken out of the $93K–$96K range after about a week of compressed price action. He compares the current setup to a previous consolidation phase that also preceded a breakout, emphasizing the need to hold above this new support. The coming days will be key in determining whether Bitcoin can sustain this momentum and move confidently toward the long-anticipated six-figure milestone. Bitcoin Breaks Out Again, but Bulls Must Defend Key Levels After months of selling pressure from the all-time highs, Bitcoin is once again showing signs of strength, attempting to confirm a broader bullish setup that could lift the entire market. The decisive break above the $90K level marked a major shift in momentum, giving bulls the upper hand and fueling optimism about a potential push toward six-figure territory. However, broader market risks remain, including persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and ongoing trade conflicts between global powers that continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Daan shared insights suggesting that BTC has broken out of the $93K–$96K range after nearly a week of tight consolidation and compressed price action. This pattern mirrors a previous setup seen just days before, where similar compression led to an upside breakout. According to Daan, this breakout is encouraging, but it must be defended. A move back into the $93K–$96K range would undermine the current rally and could signal a mere liquidity grab rather than a sustained breakout. For now, Bitcoin continues to trade with strength, but the next few sessions will be critical. If bulls can hold above $96K and build momentum, the path toward reclaiming the $100K mark becomes increasingly likely. Otherwise, the risk of a retrace and renewed volatility remains on the table. Price Analysis: Bulls Aim For $100K As Breakout Extends Bitcoin is currently trading at $97,015 after pushing through key resistance levels in a strong continuation of the uptrend that began in mid-April. This 4-hour chart shows a clear breakout above the $93K–$96K consolidation range, which had compressed price action for about a week. The breakout has been followed by steady price action above $95K, indicating solid demand and controlled bullish momentum. Both the 200-period SMA ($86,572) and EMA ($89,048) are far below current levels, showing that Bitcoin is well above its medium-term support zones. This positioning reinforces bullish structure and suggests any retrace into the $90K–$92K zone could serve as a healthy retest rather than a breakdown. Volume picked up significantly during the breakout on April 23–24 and has remained elevated, which is a strong technical confirmation of the move. Immediate resistance now lies at the psychological $100K level, with a secondary target at $103,600. Bulls must maintain momentum and avoid a sharp rejection below $95K, which could imply a failed breakout and open the door for profit-taking. Overall, the trend remains bullish with upside potential, but traders should watch for signs of exhaustion near resistance.
